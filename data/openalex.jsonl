However, the orientation of the heart, angle selection for cardiac planes, number of segments, slice display and thickness, nomenclature for segments, and assignment of segments to coronary arterial territories have evolved independently within each field. This evolution has been based on the inherent strengths and weaknesses of the technique and the practical clinical application of these modalities as they are used for patient management. This independent evolution has resulted in a lack of standardization and has made accurate intra- and cross-modality comparisons for clinical patient management and research very difficult, if not, at times, impossible.

In a doubleblind study, we enrolled 1663 patients who had severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily, and 841 to receive placebo. The primary end point was death from all causes.The trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46 percent) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35 percent; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35 percent lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10 percent of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.Blockade of aldosterone receptors by spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of both morbidity and death among patients with severe heart failure.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2323458614", "source": "openalex"}

DHF is also referred to as heart failure with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFNEF) to indicate that HFNEF could be a precursor of heart failure with reduced LVEF. Because of improved cardiac imaging and because of widespread clinical use of plasma levels of natriuretic peptides, diagnostic criteria for HFNEF needed to be updated. The diagnosis of HFNEF requires the following conditions to be satisfied: (i) signs or symptoms of heart failure; (ii) normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function; (iii) evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. Normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function implies both an LVEF > 50% and an LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) <97 mL/m2. Diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction can be obtained invasively (LV end-diastolic pressure >16 mmHg or mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >12 mmHg) or non-invasively by tissue Doppler (TD) (E/E′ > 15). If TD yields an E/E′ ratio suggestive of diastolic LV dysfunction (15 > E/E′ > 8), additional non-invasive investigations are required for diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. These can consist of blood flow Doppler of mitral valve or pulmonary veins, echo measures of LV mass index or left atrial volume index, electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation, or plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. If plasma levels of natriuretic peptides are elevated, diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction also requires additional non-invasive investigations such as TD, blood flow Doppler of mitral valve or pulmonary veins, echo measures of LV mass index or left atrial volume index, or electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation. A similar strategy with focus on a high negative predictive value of successive investigations is proposed for the exclusion of HFNEF in patients with breathlessness and no signs of congestion. The updated strategies for the diagnosis and exclusion of HFNEF are useful not only for individual patient management but also for patient recruitment in future clinical trials exploring therapies for HFNEF.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127039247", "source": "openalex"}

In previous studies, enalapril improved survival in such patients. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 8442 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial was designed to detect a difference in the rates of death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early, according to prespecified rules, after a median follow-up of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed. At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P<0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3%) and 693 (16.5%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21% (P<0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P=0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group.

More data are needed regarding the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with established heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this phase 3, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 4744 patients with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure) or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: Over a median of 18.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 386 of 2373 patients (16.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 of 2371 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001).

Methods and Results —This work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P &lt;.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, ≈28% of CHD events in men and 29% in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (≥130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) was 27% in men and 34% in women. Conclusions —Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165884492", "source": "openalex"}

Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term (~5 min), and ultra-short-term (< 5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time domain, frequency, and nonlinear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from ~2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Nonlinear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2759190050", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment with amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proposed to improve the prognosis in such patients.We randomly assigned 2521 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35 percent or less to conventional therapy for CHF plus placebo (847 patients), conventional therapy plus amiodarone (845 patients), or conventional therapy plus a conservatively programmed, shock-only, single-lead ICD (829 patients). Placebo and amiodarone were administered in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was death from any cause.The median LVEF in patients was 25 percent; 70 percent were in NYHA class II, and 30 percent were in class III CHF. The cause of CHF was ischemic in 52 percent and nonischemic in 48 percent. The median follow-up was 45.5 months. There were 244 deaths (29 percent) in the placebo group, 240 (28 percent) in the amiodarone group, and 182 (22 percent) in the ICD group. As compared with placebo, amiodarone was associated with a similar risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.06; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P=0.53) and ICD therapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 23 percent (0.77; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.007) and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population. Results did not vary according to either ischemic or nonischemic causes of CHF, but they did vary according to the NYHA class.In patients with NYHA class II or III CHF and LVEF of 35 percent or less, amiodarone has no favorable effect on survival, whereas single-lead, shock-only ICD therapy reduces overall mortality by 23 percent.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2075175982", "source": "openalex"}

The primary composite end point was the time to death from or hospitalization for any cause.As compared with optimal pharmacologic therapy alone, cardiac-resynchronization therapy with a pacemaker decreased the risk of the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.81; P=0.014), as did cardiac-resynchronization therapy with a pacemaker-defibrillator (hazard ratio, 0.80; P=0.01).

Conventional treatment for heart failure, including the use of other vasodilators, was continued in both groups. Follow-up averaged 188 days (range, 1 day to 20 months). The crude mortality at the end of six months (primary end point) was 26 percent in the enalapril group and 44 percent in the placebo group — a reduction of 40 percent (P = 0.002). Mortality was reduced by 31 percent at one year (P = 0.001). By the end of the study, there had been 68 deaths in the placebo group and 50 in the enalapril group — a reduction of 27 percent (P = 0.003). The entire reduction in total mortality was found to be among patients with progressive heart failure (a reduction of 50 percent), whereas no difference was seen in the incidence of sudden cardiac death. A significant improvement in NYHA classification was observed in the enalapril group, together with a reduction in heart size and a reduced requirement for other medication for heart failure. The overall withdrawal rate was similar in both groups, but hypotension requiring withdrawal occurred in seven patients in the enalapril group and in no patients in the placebo group. After the initial dose of enalapril was reduced to 2.5 mg daily in high-risk patients, this side effect was less frequent. We conclude that the addition of enalapril to conventional therapy in patients with severe congestive heart failure can reduce mortality and improve symptoms. The beneficial effect on mortality is due to a reduction in death from the progression of heart failure.

We conducted a double-blind trial to evaluate this therapeutic approach. Methods Four hundred fifty-three patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms of heart failure associated with an ejection fraction of 35 percent or less and a QRS interval of 130 msec or more were randomly assigned to a cardiac-resynchronization group (228 patients) or to a control group (225 patients) for six months, while conventional therapy for heart failure was maintained. The primary end points were the New York Heart Association functional class, quality of life, and the distance walked in six minutes. Results As compared with the control group, patients assigned to cardiac resynchronization experienced an improvement in the distance walked in six minutes (+39 vs. +10 m, P=0.005), functional class (P<0.001), quality of life (i18.0 vs. i9.0 points, P= 0.001), time on the treadmill during exercise testing (+81 vs. +19 sec, P=0.001), and ejection fraction (+4.6 percent vs. i0.2 percent, P<0.001). In addition, fewer patients in the group assigned to cardiac resynchronization than control patients required hospitalization (8 percent vs. 15 percent) or intravenous medications (7 percent vs. 15 percent) for the treatment of heart failure (P<0.05 for both comparisons). Implantation of the device was unsuccessful in 8 percent of patients and was complicated by refractory hypotension, bradycardia, or asystole in four patients (two of whom died) and by perforation of the coronary sinus requiring pericardiocentesis in two others. Conclusions Cardiac resynchronization results in significant clinical improvement in patients who have moderate-to-severe heart failure and an intraventricular conduction delay.

The effect of this exposure on the subsequent risk of ischemic heart disease is uncertain. Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study of major coronary events (i.e., myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease) in 2168 women who underwent radiotherapy for breast cancer between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark; the study included 963 women with major coronary events and 1205 controls. Individual patient information was obtained from hospital records. For each woman, the mean radiation doses to the whole heart and to the left anterior descending coronary artery were estimated from her radiotherapy chart. Results: The overall average of the mean doses to the whole heart was 4.9 Gy (range, 0.03 to 27.72). Rates of major coronary events increased linearly with the mean dose to the heart by 7.4% per gray (95% confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.5; P<0.001), with no apparent threshold. The increase started within the first 5 years after radiotherapy and continued into the third decade after radiotherapy. The proportional increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray was similar in women with and women without cardiac risk factors at the time of radiotherapy. Conclusions: Exposure of the heart to ionizing radiation during radiotherapy for breast cancer increases the subsequent rate of ischemic heart disease. The increase is proportional to the mean dose to the heart, begins within a few years after exposure, and continues for at least 20 years. Women with preexisting cardiac risk factors have greater absolute increases in risk from radiotherapy than other women.

It is unclear whether overweight and lesser degrees of obesity also pose a risk.We investigated the relation between the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the incidence of heart failure among 5881 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 55 years; 54 percent women). With the use of Cox proportional-hazards models, the body-mass index was evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (normal, 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; and obese, 30.0 or more).During follow-up (mean, 14 years), heart failure developed in 496 subjects (258 women and 238 men). After adjustment for established risk factors, there was an increase in the risk of heart failure of 5 percent for men and 7 percent for women for each increment of 1 in body-mass index. As compared with subjects with a normal body-mass index, obese subjects had a doubling of the risk of heart failure. For women, the hazard ratio was 2.12 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.51 to 2.97); for men, the hazard ratio was 1.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 2.79). A graded increase in the risk of heart failure was observed across categories of body-mass index. The hazard ratios per increase in category were 1.46 in women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.72) and 1.37 in men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.67).In our large, community-based sample, increased body-mass index was associated with an increased risk of heart failure.

Death rates from CVD have declined, yet the burden of disease remains high.• The 2004 overall death rate from CVD (International Classification of Diseases 10, I00 -I99) was 288.0 per 100 000.The rates were 335.1 per 100 000 for white males, 454.0 per 100 000 for black males, 238.0 per 100 000 for white females, and 333.6 per 100 000 for black females.From 1994 to 2004, death rates from CVD (International Classification of Diseases 10, I00 -I99) declined 24.7%.Preliminary mortality data from 2005 show that CVD (I00 -I99; Q20 -Q28) accounted for 35.2% (861 826) of all 2 447 910 deaths in 2005, or 1 of every 2.8 deaths in the United States.• Nearly 2400 Americans die of CVD each day-an average of 1 death every 37 seconds.The 2005 overall preliminary death rate from CVD was 279.2.More than 148 000 Americans killed by CVD (I00 -I99) in 2004 were Ͻ65 years of age.In 2004, 32% of deaths from CVD occurred before the age of 75 years, which is well before the average life expectancy of 77.9 years.• Coronary heart disease caused 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States in 2004.Coronary heart disease mortality was 451 326.In 2008, an estimated 770 000 Americans will have a new coronary attack, and about 430 000 will have a recurrent attack.It is estimated that an additional 175 000 silent first myocardial infarctions occur each year.About every 26 seconds, an American will have a coronary event, and about every minute someone will die from one.• Each year, about 780 000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke.About 600 000 of these are first attacks, and 180 000 are recurrent attacks.Preliminary data from 2005 indicate that stroke accounted for about 1 of every 17 deaths in the United States.On average, every 40 seconds someone in the United States has a stroke.From 1994 to 2004, the stroke death rate fell 24.2%, and the actual number of stroke deaths declined 6.8%.• In 2004, 1 in 8 death certificates (284 365 deaths) in the United States mentions heart failure. Control of risk factors remains an issue for manyAmericans.• End-stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease are conditions that are most commonly associated with diabetes and/or high blood pressure and occur when the kidneys can no longer function normally on their own.• The incidence of reported end-stage renal disease has almost doubled in the past 10 years.In 2004, 104 364 new cases of end-stage renal disease were reported.• The number of persons treated for end-stage renal disease increased from 68 757 in 1994 to 102 356 in 2004; this translates to 261.3 per million in 1994 to 348.6 per million in 2004.• The US Renal Data System estimates that by 2010, 650 000 Americans will require treatment for kidney failure, which represents a 60% increase over the number who received such treatment in 2001.• The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (stages I-V) is 16.8%.This represents an increase over the 14.5% preva-e26", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2166302161", "source": "openalex"}

The patients had a history of myocardial infarction or hospitalization for unstable angina and initial plasma total cholesterol levels of 155 to 271 mg per deciliter. Both groups received advice on following a cholesterol-lowering diet. The primary study outcome was mortality from coronary heart disease.Death from coronary heart disease occurred in 8.3 percent of the patients in the placebo group and 6.4 percent of those in the pravastatin group, a relative reduction in risk of 24 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 35 percent; P<0.001). Overall mortality was 14.1 percent in the placebo group and 11.0 percent in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 31 percent; P<0.001). The incidence of all cardiovascular outcomes was consistently lower among patients assigned to receive pravastatin; these outcomes included myocardial infarction (reduction in risk, 29 percent; P<0.001), death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction (a 24 percent reduction in risk, P<0.001), stroke (a 19 percent reduction in risk, P=0.048), and coronary revascularization (a 20 percent reduction in risk, P<0.001). The effects of treatment were similar for all predefined subgroups. There were no clinically significant adverse effects of treatment with pravastatin.Pravastatin therapy reduced mortality from coronary heart disease and overall mortality, as compared with the rates in the placebo group, as well as the incidence of all prespecified cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina who had a broad range of initial cholesterol levels.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W38523360", "source": "openalex"}

It has been reported worldwide and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries.To revise the previous American Heart Association guidelines, a multidisciplinary writing group of experts was convened to review and appraise available evidence and practice-based opinion, as well as to provide updated recommendations for diagnosis, treatment of the acute illness, and long-term management. Although the cause remains unknown, discussion sections highlight new insights into the epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, pathology, natural history, and long-term outcomes. Prompt diagnosis is essential, and an updated algorithm defines supplemental information to be used to assist the diagnosis when classic clinical criteria are incomplete. Although intravenous immune globulin is the mainstay of initial treatment, the role for additional primary therapy in selected patients is discussed. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients do not respond to initial intravenous immune globulin, and recommendations for additional therapies are provided. Careful initial management of evolving coronary artery abnormalities is essential, necessitating an increased frequency of assessments and escalation of thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification for long-term management is based primarily on maximal coronary artery luminal dimensions, normalized as Z scores, and is calibrated to both past and current involvement. Patients with aneurysms require life-long and uninterrupted cardiology follow-up.These recommendations provide updated and best evidence-based guidance to healthcare providers who diagnose and manage Kawasaki disease, but clinical decision making should be individualized to specific patient circumstances.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2604027935", "source": "openalex"}

The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with >100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings.

Mean age was 66.7 years.Intervention.—Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n=1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n=1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.Main Outcome Measures.—The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.Results.—Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P&lt;.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).Conclusions.—During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2113264115", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive CRT plus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (1089 patients) or an ICD alone (731 patients). The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event (whichever came first). Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments, but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments.During an average follow-up of 2.4 years, the primary end point occurred in 187 of 1089 patients in the CRT-ICD group (17.2%) and 185 of 731 patients in the ICD-only group (25.3%) (hazard ratio in the CRT-ICD group, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.84; P=0.001). The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The superiority of CRT was driven by a 41% reduction in the risk of heart-failure events, a finding that was evident primarily in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a QRS duration of 150 msec or more. CRT was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in the ejection fraction. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the overall risk of death, with a 3% annual mortality rate in each treatment group. Serious adverse events were infrequent in the two groups.CRT combined with ICD decreased the risk of heart-failure events in relatively asymptomatic patients with a low ejection fraction and wide QRS complex.

We recommend a new stepwise diagnostic process, the ‘HFA–PEFF diagnostic algorithm’. Step 1 (P=Pre-test assessment) is typically performed in the ambulatory setting and includes assessment for HF symptoms and signs, typical clinical demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elderly, atrial fibrillation), and diagnostic laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. In the absence of overt non-cardiac causes of breathlessness, HFpEF can be suspected if there is a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, no significant heart valve disease or cardiac ischaemia, and at least one typical risk factor. Elevated natriuretic peptides support, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFpEF. The second step (E: Echocardiography and Natriuretic Peptide Score) requires comprehensive echocardiography and is typically performed by a cardiologist. Measures include mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e′), left ventricular (LV) filling pressure estimated using E/e′, left atrial volume index, LV mass index, LV relative wall thickness, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, LV global longitudinal systolic strain, and serum natriuretic peptide levels. Major (2 points) and Minor (1 point) criteria were defined from these measures. A score ≥5 points implies definite HFpEF; ≤1 point makes HFpEF unlikely. An intermediate score (2–4 points) implies diagnostic uncertainty, in which case Step 3 (F1: Functional testing) is recommended with echocardiographic or invasive haemodynamic exercise stress tests. Step 4 (F2: Final aetiology) is recommended to establish a possible specific cause of HFpEF or alternative explanations. Further research is needed for a better classification of HFpEF.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2971111962", "source": "openalex"}

Lowering the blood cholesterol level may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This double-blind study was designed to determine whether the administration of pravastatin to men with hypercho- lesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction re- duced the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial in- farction and death from coronary heart disease. Methods. We randomly assigned 6595 men, 45 to 64 years of age, with a mean ( � SD) plasma cholesterol lev- el of 272 � 23 mg per deciliter (7.0 � 0.6 mmol per liter) to receive pravastatin (40 mg each evening) or placebo. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years. Medical rec- ords, electrocardiographic recordings, and the national death registry were used to determine the clinical end points. Results. Pravastatin lowered plasma cholesterol lev- els by 20 percent and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 percent, whereas there was no change with placebo. There were 248 definite coronary events (speci- fied as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coro- nary heart disease) in the placebo group, and 174 in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk with prava- statin, 31 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent; P � 0.001). There were similar reductions in the risk of definite nonfatal myocardial infarctions (31 percent reduction, P � 0.001), death from coronary heart disease (definite cases alone: 28 percent reduction, P � 0.13; definite plus suspected cases: 33 percent reduc- tion, P � 0.042), and death from all cardiovascular causes (32 percent reduction, P � 0.033). There was no excess of deaths from noncardiovascular causes in the pravastatin group. We observed a 22 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause in the pravastatin group (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 40 percent; P � 0.051). Conclusions. Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction.

In trying to bridge a gap between what we feel and what we ought to feel, we take guidance from feeling about what is owing to others in a given situation. Based on our private mutual understandings of rules, we make a of acts of emotion management. We bow to each other not simply from the waist, but from the heart. But what occurs when emotion work, rules, and the gift of exchange are introduced into the public world of work?In search of the answer, Arlie Hochschild closely examines two groups of public-contact workers: flight attendants and bill collectors. The flight attendant's job is to deliver a service and create further demand for it, to enhance the status of the customer and be nicer than natural. The bill collector's job is to collect on the service, and if necessary, to deflate the status of the customer by being nastier than natural. Between these extremes, roughly one-third of American men and one-half of American women hold jobs that call for substantial emotional labor. In many of these jobs, they are trained to accept rules and techniques of emotion management that serve the company's commercial purpose. Just as we have seldom recognized or understood emotional labor, we have not appreciated it cost to those who do it for a living.Like a physical laborer who becomes estranged from what he or she makes, an emotional laborer, such as a flight attendant, can become estranged not only from own expressions of (her smile is not her smile), but also from what she actually feels (her managed friendliness). This estrangement, though a valuable defense against stress, is also an important occupational hazard, because it is through our feelings that we are connected with those around us. On the basis of this book, Hochschild was featured in Key Sociological Thinkers, edited by Rob Stones.

With the aging of the population, the impact of HF is expected to increase substantially. Methods and Results— We estimated future costs of HF by adapting a methodology developed by the American Heart Association to project the epidemiology and future costs of HF from 2012 to 2030 without double counting the costs attributed to comorbid conditions. The model assumes that HF prevalence will remain constant by age, sex, and race/ethnicity and that rising costs and technological innovation will continue at the same rate. By 2030, &gt;8 million people in the United States (1 in every 33) will have HF. Between 2012 and 2030, real (2010$) total direct medical costs of HF are projected to increase from $21 billion to $53 billion. Total costs, including indirect costs for HF, are estimated to increase from $31 billion in 2012 to $70 billion in 2030. If one assumes all costs of cardiac care for HF patients are attributable to HF (no cost attribution to comorbid conditions), the 2030 projected cost estimates of treating patients with HF will be 3-fold higher ($160 billion in direct costs).

The purpose of the study was to develop and validate a multivariate risk model to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival in heart failure patients with the use of easily obtainable characteristics relating to clinical status, therapy (pharmacological as well as devices), and laboratory parameters. Methods and Results— The Seattle Heart Failure Model was derived in a cohort of 1125 heart failure patients with the use of a multivariate Cox model. For medications and devices not available in the derivation database, hazard ratios were estimated from published literature. The model was prospectively validated in 5 additional cohorts totaling 9942 heart failure patients and 17 307 person-years of follow-up. The accuracy of the model was excellent, with predicted versus actual 1-year survival rates of 73.4% versus 74.3% in the derivation cohort and 90.5% versus 88.5%, 86.5% versus 86.5%, 83.8% versus 83.3%, 90.9% versus 91.0%, and 89.6% versus 86.7% in the 5 validation cohorts.

Today, because of a growing and ageing population, the total number of heart failure patients still continues to rise. However, the case mix of heart failure seems to be evolving. Incidence has stabilized and may even be decreasing in some populations, but alarming opposite trends have been observed in the relatively young, possibly related to an increase in obesity. In addition, a clear transition towards heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction has occurred. Although this transition is partially artificial, due to improved recognition of heart failure as a disorder affecting the entire left ventricular ejection fraction spectrum, links can be made with the growing burden of obesity‐related diseases and with the ageing of the population. Similarly, evidence suggests that the number of patients with heart failure may be on the rise in low‐income countries struggling under the double burden of communicable diseases and conditions associated with a Western‐type lifestyle. These findings, together with the observation that the mortality rate of heart failure is declining less rapidly than previously, indicate we have not reached the end of the epidemic yet.

There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known.This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (<28 days) myocardial infarction. 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine.During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN <70 ms) or BRS (<3.0 ms per mm Hg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p<0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN >105 ms, BRS >6.1 ms per mm Hg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN (> or = 70 ms) and BRS (> or = 3 ms per mm Hg).ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias and that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145912168", "source": "openalex"}

This article briefly reviews neural regulation of the heart, and its basic anatomy, the cardiac cycle, and the sinoatrial and atrioventricular pacemakers. The cardiovascular regulation center in the medulla integrates sensory information and input from higher brain centers, and afferent cardiovascular system inputs to adjust heart rate and blood pressure via sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways. This article reviews sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart, and examines the interpretation of HRV and the association between reduced HRV, risk of disease and mortality, and the loss of regulatory capacity. This article also discusses the intrinsic cardiac nervous system and the heart-brain connection, through which afferent information can influence activity in the subcortical and frontocortical areas, and motor cortex. It also considers new perspectives on the putative underlying physiological mechanisms and properties of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF), very-low-frequency (VLF), low-frequency (LF), and high-frequency (HF) bands. Additionally, it reviews the most common time and frequency domain measurements as well as standardized data collection protocols. In its final section, this article integrates Porges' polyvagal theory, Thayer and colleagues' neurovisceral integration model, Lehrer, Vaschillo, and Vaschillo's resonance frequency model, and the Institute of HeartMath's coherence model. The authors conclude that a coherent heart is not a metronome because its rhythms are characterized by both complexity and stability over longer time scales.

DHF is also referred to as heart failure with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFNEF) to indicate that HFNEF could be a precursor of heart failure with reduced LVEF. Because of improved cardiac imaging and because of widespread clinical use of plasma levels of natriuretic peptides, diagnostic criteria for HFNEF needed to be updated. The diagnosis of HFNEF requires the following conditions to be satisfied: (i) signs or symptoms of heart failure; (ii) normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function; (iii) evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. Normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function implies both an LVEF > 50% and an LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) <97 mL/m(2). Diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction can be obtained invasively (LV end-diastolic pressure >16 mmHg or mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >12 mmHg) or non-invasively by tissue Doppler (TD) (E/E' > 15). If TD yields an E/E' ratio suggestive of diastolic LV dysfunction (15 > E/E' > 8), additional non-invasive investigations are required for diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. These can consist of blood flow Doppler of mitral valve or pulmonary veins, echo measures of LV mass index or left atrial volume index, electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation, or plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. If plasma levels of natriuretic peptides are elevated, diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction also requires additional non-invasive investigations such as TD, blood flow Doppler of mitral valve or pulmonary veins, echo measures of LV mass index or left atrial volume index, or electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation. A similar strategy with focus on a high negative predictive value of successive investigations is proposed for the exclusion of HFNEF in patients with breathlessness and no signs of congestion. The updated strategies for the diagnosis and exclusion of HFNEF are useful not only for individual patient management but also for patient recruitment in future clinical trials exploring therapies for HFNEF.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2605975631", "source": "openalex"}

The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning.

The Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting (IMPROVE HF) prospectively tested a multidimensional practice-specific performance improvement intervention on the use of guideline-recommended therapies for HF in outpatient cardiology practices. Methods and Results— Performance data were collected in a random sample of HF patients from 167 US outpatient cardiology practices at baseline, longitudinally after intervention at 12 and 24 months, and in single-point-in-time patient cohorts at 6 and 18 months. Participants included 34 810 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%) and chronic HF or previous myocardial infarction. To quantify guideline adherence, 7 quality measures were assessed. Interventions included clinical decision support tools, structured improvement strategies, and chart audits with feedback. The performance improvement intervention resulted in significant improvements in 5 of 7 quality measures at the 24-month assessment compared with baseline: β-blocker (92.2% versus 86.0%, +6.2%), aldosterone antagonist (60.3% versus 34.5%, +25.1%), cardiac resynchronization therapy (66.3% versus 37.2%, +29.9%), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (77.5% versus 50.1%, +27.4%), and HF education (72.1% versus 59.5%, +12.6%) (each P &lt;0.001).

The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of heart rate and its relationship with blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in three populations. One European general population (Belgian study), one North American general population (Tecumseh study), and one European hypertensive population (HARVEST trial) were studied. Within each population, mixture analysis was used to investigate whether a mixture of two normal distributions explained the variance in heart rate better than a single distribution. In the men of all populations, mixture analysis identified a larger subpopulation of subjects with normal heart rate and a smaller one with fast heart rate. The subgroups with tachycardia had higher blood pressure and lipid levels than those with normal heart rate. In the populations in which they were measured, fasting insulin and postload glucose were also higher in the men with faster heart rate. A subgroup with tachycardia could also be singled out among the women from Tecumseh, but no relation between heart rate and blood pressure could be found. These findings show that in Western societies, high heart rate pertains to a distinct subgroup of subjects, who are more frequently men and exhibit the characteristic features of the insulin resistance syndrome.

Subjects were older at the diagnosis of heart failure in the later decades of this study (mean age at heart failure diagnosis, 57.3 +/- 7.6 years in the 1950s, 65.9 +/- 7.9 years in the 1960s, 71.6 +/- 9.4 years in the 1970s, and 76.4 +/- 10.0 years in the 1980s; p &lt; 0.001). Median survival after the onset of heart failure was 1.7 years in men and 3.2 years in women. Overall, 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 57% and 25% in men and 64% and 38% in women, respectively. Survival was better in women than in men (age-adjusted hazards ratio for mortality, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77).

Heart failure etiology was ischemic in 51%, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 25%. Exercise adherence decreased from a median of 95 minutes per week during months 4 through 6 of follow-up to 74 minutes per week during months 10 through 12.

At present, approximately 26 million people worldwide are living with heart failure. The outlook for such patients is poor, with survival rates worse than those for bowel, breast or prostate cancer. Furthermore, heart failure places great stresses on patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Demands on healthcare services, in particular, are predicted to increase dramatically over the next decade as patient numbers rise owing to ageing populations, detrimental lifestyle changes and improved survival of those who go on to develop heart failure as the final stage of another disease. It is time to ease the strain on healthcare systems through clear policy initiatives that prioritize heart failure prevention and champion equity of care for all. Despite the burdens that heart failure imposes on society, awareness of the disease is poor. As a result, many premature deaths occur. This is in spite of the fact that most types of heart failure are preventable and that a healthy lifestyle can reduce risk. Even after heart failure has developed, premature deaths could be prevented if people were taught to recognize the symptoms and seek immediate medical attention. Public awareness campaigns focusing on these messages have great potential to improve outcomes for patients with heart failure and ultimately to save lives. Compliance with clinical practice guidelines is also associated with improved outcomes for patients with heart failure. However, in many countries, there is considerable variation in how closely physicians follow guideline recommendations. To promote equity of care, improvements should be encouraged through the use of hospital performance measures and incentives appropriate to the locality. To this end, policies should promote the research required to establish an evidence base for performance measures that reflect improved outcomes for patients. Continuing research is essential if we are to address unmet needs in caring for patients with heart failure. New therapies are required for patients with types of heart failure for which current treatments relieve symptoms but do not address the disease. More affordable therapies are desperately needed in the economically developing world. International collaborative research focusing on the causes and treatment of heart failure worldwide has the potential to benefit tens of millions of people. Change at the policy level has the power to drive improvements in prevention and care that will save lives. It is time to make a difference across the globe by confronting the problem of heart failure.POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS: We urge policymakers at local, national and international levels to collaborate and act on the following recommendations.Support the development and implementation of public awareness programmes about heart failure. These should define heart failure in simple and accessible language, explain how to recognize the symptoms and emphasize that most types of heart failure are preventable.Highlight the need for healthcare professionals across all clinical disciplines to identify patients with illnesses that increase the risk of heart failure and to prescribe preventive medications.Prioritize the elimination of infectious diseases in parts of the world where they still cause heart failure.Encourage the development and use of heart failure education programmes for all appropriate healthcare professionals. These should aim to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of heart failure and raise awareness of clinical practice guidelines.Provide a healthcare system that delivers timely access to diagnostic services and treatment of heart failure, as well as a seamless transition to long-term management.Ensure that the best available and most appropriate care is consistently provided to all patients with heart failure through efficient use of resources.Provide resources for the education and practical support of patients with heart failure and their families or other caregivers, empowering them to engage proactively in long-term care.Fund and encourage international collaborative research to improve understanding of the patterns, causes and effects of modern day heart failure and how the disease can be prevented across the globe.Fund and encourage research into new and more affordable therapies and medical devices for all types of heart failure.Fund and encourage research into evidence-based healthcare performance measures that reflect improved clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152865365", "source": "openalex"}

Obesity contributes directly to incident cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sleep disorders. Obesity also leads to the development of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. More recent data highlight abdominal obesity, as determined by waist circumference, as a cardiovascular disease risk marker that is independent of body mass index. There have also been significant advances in imaging modalities for characterizing body composition, including visceral adiposity. Studies that quantify fat depots, including ectopic fat, support excess visceral adiposity as an independent indicator of poor cardiovascular outcomes. Lifestyle modification and subsequent weight loss improve both metabolic syndrome and associated systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. However, clinical trials of medical weight loss have not demonstrated a reduction in coronary artery disease rates. In contrast, prospective studies comparing patients undergoing bariatric surgery with nonsurgical patients with obesity have shown reduced coronary artery disease risk with surgery. In this statement, we summarize the impact of obesity on the diagnosis, clinical management, and outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, especially sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. In particular, we examine the influence of obesity on noninvasive and invasive diagnostic procedures for coronary artery disease. Moreover, we review the impact of obesity on cardiac function and outcomes related to heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Finally, we describe the effects of lifestyle and surgical weight loss interventions on outcomes related to coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3152705473", "source": "openalex"}

Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease).Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52).

We aimed to assess the effect of CTCA on the diagnosis, management, and outcome of patients referred to the cardiology clinic with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.MethodsIn this prospective open-label, parallel-group, multicentre trial, we recruited patients aged 18–75 years referred for the assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease from 12 cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland. We randomly assigned (1:1) participants to standard care plus CTCA or standard care alone. Randomisation was done with a web-based service to ensure allocation concealment. The primary endpoint was certainty of the diagnosis of angina secondary to coronary heart disease at 6 weeks. All analyses were intention to treat, and patients were analysed in the group they were allocated to, irrespective of compliance with scanning. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01149590.FindingsBetween Nov 18, 2010, and Sept 24, 2014, we randomly assigned 4146 (42%) of 9849 patients who had been referred for assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease. 47% of participants had a baseline clinic diagnosis of coronary heart disease and 36% had angina due to coronary heart disease. At 6 weeks, CTCA reclassified the diagnosis of coronary heart disease in 558 (27%) patients and the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease in 481 (23%) patients (standard care 22 [1%] and 23 [1%]; p<0·0001). Although both the certainty (relative risk [RR] 2·56, 95% CI 2·33–2·79; p<0·0001) and frequency of coronary heart disease increased (1·09, 1·02–1·17; p=0·0172), the certainty increased (1·79, 1·62–1·96; p<0·0001) and frequency seemed to decrease (0·93, 0·85–1·02; p=0·1289) for the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease. This changed planned investigations (15% vs 1%; p<0·0001) and treatments (23% vs 5%; p<0·0001) but did not affect 6-week symptom severity or subsequent admittances to hospital for chest pain.

Recovery of the heart rate immediately after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation. Because a generalized decrease in vagal activity is known to be a risk factor for death, we hypothesized that a delayed fall in the heart rate after exercise might be an important prognostic marker.For six years we followed 2428 consecutive adults (mean [+/-SD] age, 57+/-12 years; 63 percent men) without a history of heart failure or coronary revascularization and without pacemakers. The patients were undergoing symptom-limited exercise testing and single-photon-emission computed tomography with thallium scintigraphy for diagnostic purposes. The value for the recovery of heart rate was defined as the decrease in the heart rate from peak exercise to one minute after the cessation of exercise. An abnormal value for the recovery of heart rate was defined as a reduction of 12 beats per minute or less from the heart rate at peak exercise.There were 213 deaths from all causes. A total of 639 patients (26 percent) had abnormal values for heart-rate recovery. In univariate analyses, a low value for the recovery of heart rate was strongly predictive of death (relative risk, 4.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 5.2; P<0.001). After adjustments were made for age, sex, the use or nonuse of medications, the presence or absence of myocardial perfusion defects on thallium scintigraphy, standard cardiac risk factors, the resting heart rate, the change in heart rate during exercise, and workload achieved, a low value for heart-rate recovery remained predictive of death (adjusted relative risk, 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7; P<0.001).A delayed decrease in the heart rate during the first minute after graded exercise, which may be a reflection of decreased vagal activity, is a powerful predictor of overall mortality, independent of workload, the presence or absence of myocardial perfusion defects, and changes in heart rate during exercise.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2318588083", "source": "openalex"}

The primary outcome occurred in 297 of 894 patients (33.2%) in the ICD-CRT group and 364 of 904 patients (40.3%) in the ICD group (hazard ratio in the ICD-CRT group, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.87; P<0.001). In the ICD-CRT group, 186 patients died, as compared with 236 in the ICD group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.91; P = 0.003), and 174 patients were hospitalized for heart failure, as compared with 236 in the ICD group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.83; P<0.001). However, at 30 days after device implantation, adverse events had occurred in 124 patients in the ICD-CRT group, as compared with 58 in the ICD group (P<0.001).Among patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure, a wide QRS complex, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the addition of CRT to an ICD reduced rates of death and hospitalization for heart failure. This improvement was accompanied by more adverse events.

Measurements were made from as many as 870 intramural terminals. In the isolated human hearts three endocardial areas were synchronously excited 0 to 5 msec after the start of the left ventricular activity potential. These areas increased rapidly in size during the next 5 to 10 msec and became confluent in 15 to 20 msec. The left ventricular areas first excited were (1) high on the anterior paraseptal wall just below the attachment of the mitral valve; (2) central on the left surface of the interventricular septum and (3) posterior paraseptal about one third of the distance from apex to base. The last part of the left ventricle to be activated usually was the posterobasal area. Endocardial activation of the right ventricle was found to start near the insertion of the anterior papillary muscle 5 to 10 msec after onset of the left ventricular cavity potential. Septal activation started in the middle third of the left side of the interventricular septum, somewhat anteriorly, and at the lower third at the junction of the septum and posterior wall. The epicardial excitation pattern reflected the movements of the intramural excitation wave. Conduction velocity was determined in one heart by an appropriate stimulation technic. Atrial excitation, explored in two hearts, spread more or less according to concentric isochronic lines. Control studies, carried out on five canine hearts, disclosed that the pattern of ventricular excitation did not change after isolation and perfusion. However, total excitation was completed earlier in the isolated heart, and conduction velocity increased. Careful mapping illustrations are presented.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995281013", "source": "openalex"}

Studies were identified by MEDLINE searches, scanning of relevant reference lists, hand searching of cardiology, epidemiology, and other relevant journals, and discussions with authors of relevant reports.Study Selection.—All relevant studies identified were included.Data Extraction.—The following information was abstracted from published reports (supplemented, in several cases, by the authors): size and type of cohort, mean age, mean duration of follow-up, assay methods, degree of adjustment for confounders, and relationship of CHD risk to the baseline assay results.Data Synthesis.—For fibrinogen, with 4018 CHD cases in 18 studies, comparison of individuals in the top third with those in the bottom third of the baseline measurements yielded a combined risk ratio of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.0) associated with a difference in long-term usual mean fibrinogen levels of 2.9 µmol/L (0.1 g/dL) between the top and bottom thirds (10.3 vs 7.4 µmol/L [0.35 vs 0.25 g/dL]). For CRP, with 1053 CHD cases in 7 studies, the combined risk ratio of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.1) was associated with a difference of 1.4 mg/L (2.4 vs 1.0 mg/L). For albumin, with 3770 CHD cases in 8 studies, the combined risk ratio of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7) was associated with a difference of 4 g/L (38 vs 42 g/L, ie, an inverse association). For leukocyte count, with 5337 CHD cases in the 7 largest studies, the combined risk ratio of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.3-1.5) was associated with a difference of 2.8×109/L (8.4 vs 5.6×109/L). Each of these overall results was highly significant (P&lt;.0001).Conclusions.—The published results from these prospective studies are remarkably consistent for each factor, indicating moderate but highly statistically significant associations with CHD.

Continuous-flow pumps are newer types of left ventricular assist devices developed to overcome some of these limitations.In a prospective, multicenter study without a concurrent control group, 133 patients with end-stage heart failure who were on a waiting list for heart transplantation underwent implantation of a continuous-flow pump. The principal outcomes were the proportions of patients who, at 180 days, had undergone transplantation, had cardiac recovery, or had ongoing mechanical support while remaining eligible for transplantation. We also assessed functional status and quality of life.The principal outcomes occurred in 100 patients (75%). The median duration of support was 126 days (range, 1 to 600). The survival rate during support was 75% at 6 months and 68% at 12 months. At 3 months, therapy was associated with significant improvement in functional status (according to the New York Heart Association class and results of a 6-minute walk test) and in quality of life (according to the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires).

Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle.

Recent observations of disease occurrence over 26 years indicate that obesity, measured by Metropolitan Relative Weight, was a significant independent predictor of CVD, particularly among women. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that Metropolitan Relative Weight, or percentage of desirable weight, on initial examination predicted 26-year incidence of coronary disease (both angina and coronary disease other than angina), coronary death and congestive heart failure in men independent of age, cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, cigarettes, left ventricular hypertrophy and glucose intolerance. Relative weight in women was also positively and independently associated with coronary disease, stroke, congestive failure, and coronary and CVD death. These data further show that weight gain after the young adult years conveyed an increased risk of CVD in both sexes that could not be attributed either to the initial weight or the levels of the risk factors that may have resulted from weight gain. Intervention in obesity, in addition to the well established risk factors, appears to be an advisable goal in the primary prevention of CVD.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110713453", "source": "openalex"}

However, the evidence for a benefit of prophylactic ICDs in patients with systolic heart failure that is not due to coronary artery disease has been based primarily on subgroup analyses. The management of heart failure has improved since the landmark ICD trials, and many patients now receive cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods In a randomized, controlled trial, 556 patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction, ≤35%) not caused by coronary artery disease were assigned to receive an ICD, and 560 patients were assigned to receive usual clinical care (control group). In both groups, 58% of the patients received CRT. The primary outcome of the trial was death from any cause. The secondary outcomes were sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular death. Results After a median follow-up period of 67.6 months, the primary outcome had occurred in 120 patients (21.6%) in the ICD group and in 131 patients (23.4%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.12; P=0.28). Sudden cardiac death occurred in 24 patients (4.3%) in the ICD group and in 46 patients (8.2%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.82; P=0.005). Device infection occurred in 27 patients (4.9%) in the ICD group and in 20 patients (3.6%) in the control group (P=0.29). Conclusions In this trial, prophylactic ICD implantation in patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure not caused by coronary artery disease was not associated with a significantly lower long-term rate of death from any cause than was usual clinical care.

Methods Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health and results Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are ~30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4206703572", "source": "openalex"}

On the basis of the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action on the heart and cardiovascular system, it is possible to explain the changes in cardiac output, cardiac contractility, blood pressure, vascular resistance, and rhythm disturbances that result from thyroid dysfunction. The importance of the recognition of the effects of thyroid disease on the heart also derives from the observation that restoration of normal thyroid function most often reverses the abnormal cardiovascular hemodynamics. In the present review, we discuss the appropriate thyroid function tests to establish a suspected diagnosis as well as the treatment modalities necessary to restore patients to a euthyroid state.

Although lifestyle choices such as smoking, diet, and exercise are viewed as major environmental influences, the contribution of pollutants and environmental chemicals is less clear. Accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to pollutants and chemicals could elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease. Many epidemiological studies report that exposure to fine particles present in ambient air is associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality. Statistically significant relationships between particulate air pollution and ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure have been reported. Animal studies show that exposure to ambient air particles increases peripheral thrombosis and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Exposures to arsenic, lead, cadmium, pollutant gases, solvents, and pesticides have also been linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Mechanistically, these effects have been attributed to changes in the synthesis or reactivity of nitric oxide that may be caused by environmental oxidants or increased endogenous production of reactive oxygen species. Additional studies are urgently needed to: identify the contribution of individual pollutants to specific aspects of cardiovascular disease; establish causality; elucidate the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms; estimate the relative susceptibility of diseased and healthy individuals and that of specific population groups; and determine whether pollutant exposure are risk correlates, that is, whether they influence major risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol, or diabetes, or whether they contribute to the absolute risk of heart disease.

Autonomic dysfunction may play an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiac death in CHF. UK-HEART examined the value of heart rate variability (HRV) measures as independent predictors of death in CHF. Methods and Results —In a prospective study powered for mortality, we recruited 433 outpatients 62±9.6 years old with CHF (NYHA functional class I to III; mean ejection fraction, 0.41±0.17). Time-domain HRV indices and conventional prognostic indicators were related to death by multivariate analysis. During 482±161 days of follow-up, cardiothoracic ratio, SDNN, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and serum sodium were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. The risk ratio for a 41.2-ms decrease in SDNN was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.16 to 2.44). The annual mortality rate for the study population in SDNN subgroups was 5.5% for &gt;100 ms, 12.7% for 50 to 100 ms, and 51.4% for &lt;50 ms. SDNN, creatinine, and serum sodium were related to progressive heart failure death. Cardiothoracic ratio, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and serum potassium were related to sudden cardiac death. A reduction in SDNN was the most powerful predictor of the risk of death due to progressive heart failure. Conclusions —CHF is associated with autonomic dysfunction, which can be quantified by measuring HRV. A reduction in SDNN identifies patients at high risk of death and is a better predictor of death due to progressive heart failure than other conventional clinical measurements. High-risk subgroups identified by this measurement are candidates for additional therapy after prescription of an ACE inhibitor.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2028960923", "source": "openalex"}

We determined the prevalence, age distribution, and proportion of adults and children with severe and other forms of CHD in the general population from 1985 to 2000. Methods and Results— Where healthcare access is universal, we used administrative databases that systematically recorded all diagnoses and claims. Diagnostic codes conformed to the International Classification of Disease , ninth revision. Severe CHD was defined as tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, transposition complexes, endocardial cushion defects, and univentricular heart. Prevalence of severe and other CHD lesions was determined in l985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 using population numbers in Quebec. Children were subjects &lt;18 years of age. The prevalence was 4.09 per 1000 adults in the year 2000 for all CHD and 0.38 per 1000 (9%) for those with severe lesions. Female subjects accounted for 57% of the adult CHD population. The median age of all patients with severe CHD was 11 years (interquartile range, 4 to 22 years) in 1985 and 17 years (interquartile range, 10 to 28 years) in 2000 ( P &lt;0.0001). The prevalence of severe CHD increased from 1985 to 2000, but the increase in adults was significantly higher than that observed in children. In the year 2000, 49% of those alive with severe CHD were adults.

Which exercise intensity yields maximal beneficial adaptations is controversial. Furthermore, the incidence of chronic heart failure increases with advanced age; it has been reported that 88% and 49% of patients with a first diagnosis of chronic heart failure are &gt;65 and &gt;80 years old, respectively. Despite this, most previous studies have excluded patients with an age &gt;70 years. Our objective was to compare training programs with moderate versus high exercise intensity with regard to variables associated with cardiovascular function and prognosis in patients with postinfarction heart failure. Methods and Results— Twenty-seven patients with stable postinfarction heart failure who were undergoing optimal medical treatment, including β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aged 75.5±11.1 years; left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction 29%; V̇ o 2peak 13 mL · kg −1 · min −1 ) were randomized to either moderate continuous training (70% of highest measured heart rate, ie, peak heart rate) or aerobic interval training (95% of peak heart rate) 3 times per week for 12 weeks or to a control group that received standard advice regarding physical activity. V̇ o 2peak increased more with aerobic interval training than moderate continuous training (46% versus 14%, P &lt;0.001) and was associated with reverse LV remodeling. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes declined with aerobic interval training only, by 18% and 25%, respectively; LV ejection fraction increased 35%, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide decreased 40%. Improvement in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (endothelial function) was greater with aerobic interval training, and mitochondrial function in lateral vastus muscle increased with aerobic interval training only. The MacNew global score for quality of life in cardiovascular disease increased in both exercise groups. No changes occurred in the control group. Conclusions— Exercise intensity was an important factor for reversing LV remodeling and improving aerobic capacity, endothelial function, and quality of life in patients with postinfarction heart failure.

During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. Conclusion In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.

Preconditioning the Myocardium: From Cellular Physiology to Clinical Cardiology. Physiol Rev 83: 1113-1151, 2003; 10.1152/physrev.00009.2003.—The phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning, in which a period of sublethal ischemia can profoundly protect the cell from infarction during a subsequent ischemic insult, has been responsible for an enormous amount of research over the last 15 years. Ischemic preconditioning is associated with two forms of protection: a classical form lasting ∼2 h after the preconditioning ischemia followed a day later by a second window of protection lasting ∼3 days. Both types of preconditioning share similarities in that the preconditioning ischemia provokes the release of several autacoids that trigger protection by occupying cell surface receptors. Receptor occupancy activates complex signaling cascades which during the lethal ischemia converge on one or more end-effectors to mediate the protection. The end-effectors so far have eluded identification, although a number have been proposed. A range of different pharmacological agents that activate the signaling cascades at the various levels can mimic ischemic preconditioning leading to the hope that specific therapeutic agents can be designed to exploit the profound protection seen with ischemic preconditioning. This review examines, in detail, the complex mechanisms associated with both forms of preconditioning as well as discusses the possibility to exploit this phenomenon in the clinical setting. As our understanding of the mechanisms associated with preconditioning are unravelled, we believe we can look forward to the development of new therapeutic agents with novel mechanisms of action that can supplement current treatment options for patients threatened with acute myocardial infarction.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2047876380", "source": "openalex"}

However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the progressive deterioration of myocardial function observed in heart failure remain unclear and may result from apoptosis (programmed cell death).We examined seven explanted hearts obtained during cardiac transplantation for evidence of apoptosis. All seven patients had severe chronic heart failure: four had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and three had ischemic cardiomyopathy. DNA fragmentation (an indicator of apoptosis) was identified histochemically by in situ end-labeling as well as by agarose-gel electrophoresis of end-labeled DNA. Myocardial tissues obtained from four patients who had had a myocardial infarction one to two days previously were used as positive controls, and heart tissues obtained from four persons who died in motor vehicle accidents were used as negative controls for the end-labeling studies.Hearts from all four patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and from one of the three patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy had histochemical evidence of DNA fragmentation. All four myocardial samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy also demonstrated DNA laddering, a characteristic of apoptosis, whereas this was not seen in any of the samples from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Histological evidence of apoptosis was also observed in the central necrotic zone of acute myocardial infarcts, but not in myocardium remote from the infarcted zone. Rare isolated apoptotic myocytes were seen in the myocardium from the four persons who died in motor vehicle accidents.Loss of myocytes due to apoptosis occurs in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy and may contribute to progressive myocardial dysfunction.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088749722", "source": "openalex"}

The relationship between the degree of albuminuria and CV risk is unclear.ObjectivesTo estimate the risk of CV events in high-risk individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and without DM who have microalbuminuria and to determine whether levels of albuminuria below the microalbuminuria threshold increase CV risk.DesignThe Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, a cohort study conducted between 1994 and 1999 with a median 4.5 years of follow-up.SettingCommunity and academic practices in North and South America and Europe.ParticipantsIndividuals aged 55 years or more with a history of CV disease (n = 5545) or DM and at least 1 CV risk factor (n = 3498) and a baseline urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement.Main Outcome MeasuresCardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death); all-cause death; and hospitalization for congestive heart failure.ResultsMicroalbuminuria was detected in 1140 (32.6%) of those with DM and 823 (14.8%) of those without DM at baseline. Microalbuminuria increased the adjusted relative risk (RR) of major CV events (RR, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-2.05), all-cause death (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.84-2.38), and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (RR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.54-4.10). Similar RRs were seen for participants with or without DM, even after adjusting for other CV risk factors (eg, the adjusted RR of the primary aggregate end point was 1.97 [95% CI, 1.68-2.31] in those with DM and 1.61 [95% CI, 1.36-1.90] in those without DM).Compared with the lowest quartile of ACR (&lt;0.22 mg/mmol), the RRs of the primary aggregate end point in the second quartile (ie, ACR range, 0.22-0.57 mg/mmol) was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.95-1.30); third quartile, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.19-1.60; ACR range, 0.58-1.62 mg/mmol); and fourth quartile, 1.97 (95% CI, 1.73-2.25; ACR range, &gt;1.62 mg/mmol) (P for trend &lt;.001, even after excluding those with microalbuminuria). For every 0.4-mg/mmol increase in ACR level, the adjusted hazard of major CV events increased by 5.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-7.0%).ConclusionsOur results indicate that any degree of albuminuria is a risk factor for CV events in individuals with or without DM; the risk increases with the ACR, starting well below the microalbuminuria cutoff.

The mechanisms which are involved in the maintenance of homeostatic equilibrium of these networks are numerous, involving the regulation of genetic expression, growth factor secretion, signalling pathways, secondary messaging systems, and ion channel activity. However, many factors are capable of disrupting these pathways, which leads to an imbalance of homeostatic equilibrium. Ultimately, this leads to changes in the physical nature of skin, both functionally and cosmetically. Although various factors have been identified, including carcinogenesis, ultraviolet exposure, and mechanical stretching of skin, it was discovered that many of them affect similar components of regulatory pathways, such as fibroblasts, lysyl oxidase, and fibronectin. Additionally, it was discovered that the various regulatory pathways intersect with each other at various stages instead of working independently of each other. This review paper proposes a model which elucidates how these molecular pathways intersect with one another, and how various internal and external factors can disrupt these pathways, ultimately leading to a disruption in collagen and elastin networks.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2476542314", "source": "openalex"}

This process, termed replicative senescence, is thought to be a tumor-suppressive mechanism and an underlying cause of aging. There is ample evidence that escape from senescence, or immortality, is important for malignant transformation. By contrast, the role of replicative senescence in organismic aging is controversial. Studies on cells cultured from donors of different ages, genetic backgrounds, or species suggest that senescence occurs in vivo and that organismic lifespan and cell replicative lifespan are under common genetic control. However, senescent cells cannot be distinguished from quiescent or terminally differentiated cells in tissues. Thus, evidence that senescent cells exist and accumulate with age in vivo is lacking. We show that several human cells express a beta-galactosidase, histochemically detectable at pH 6, upon senescence in culture. This marker was expressed by senescent, but not presenescent, fibroblasts and keratinocytes but was absent from quiescent fibroblasts and terminally differentiated keratinocytes. It was also absent from immortal cells but was induced by genetic manipulations that reversed immortality. In skin samples from human donors of different age, there was an age-dependent increase in this marker in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. This marker provides in situ evidence that senescent cells may exist and accumulate with age in vivo.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104908670", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to evaluate plasma Hsp90 in SSc and characterize its association with SSc-related features. Ninety-two SSc patients and 92 age-/sex-matched healthy controls were recruited for the cross-sectional analysis. The longitudinal analysis comprised 30 patients with SSc associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) routinely treated with cyclophosphamide. Hsp90 was increased in SSc compared to healthy controls. Hsp90 correlated positively with C-reactive protein and negatively with pulmonary function tests: forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). In patients with diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc, Hsp90 positively correlated with the modified Rodnan skin score. In SSc-ILD patients treated with cyclophosphamide, no differences in Hsp90 were found between baseline and after 1, 6, or 12 months of therapy. However, baseline Hsp90 predicts the 12-month change in DLCO. This study shows that Hsp90 plasma levels are increased in SSc patients compared to age-/sex-matched healthy controls. Elevated Hsp90 in SSc is associated with increased inflammatory activity, worse lung functions, and in dcSSc, with the extent of skin involvement.

Adult measures are inappropriate, as the lives of children differ markedly from those of adults. The purpose of this study was to create and initially validate a simple practical questionnaire for use in children. One hundred and sixty-nine children, aged 3-16 years, attending a paediatric dermatology clinic, wrote down, with the help of their parents, all the ways in which their skin disease affected their lives. One hundred and eleven different aspects were identified; 10 questions were composed to cover these aspects, using a structure similar to the Adult Dermatology Life Quality Index.

Here, we present a novel wound model based on application of negative pressure and its effects for epidermal regeneration and immune cell behaviour. Importantly, the basement membrane remained intact after blister roof removal and keratinocytes were absent in the wounded area. Upon six days of culture, the wound was covered with one to three-cell thick K14 + Ki67 + keratinocyte layers, indicating that proliferation and migration were involved in wound closure. After eight to twelve days, a multi-layered epidermis was formed expressing epidermal differentiation markers (K10, filaggrin, DSG-1, CDSN). Investigations about immune cell-specific manners revealed more T cells in the blister roof epidermis compared to normal epidermis. We identified several cell populations in blister roof epidermis and suction blister fluid that are absent in normal epidermis which correlated with their decrease in the dermis, indicating a dermal efflux upon negative pressure. Together, our model recapitulates the main features of epithelial wound regeneration, and can be applied for testing wound healing therapies and investigating underlying mechanisms.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3004227146", "source": "openalex"}

Recent progress in the design and fabrication of soft sensors with more advanced capabilities and enhanced reliability suggest an impending translation of these devices from the research lab to clinical environments. Regarding these advances, the first part of this manuscript reviews materials, design strategies, and powering systems used in soft electronics.

Strain sensing performances of recently reported strain sensors are comprehensively studied and discussed, showing that appropriate choice of composite structures as well as suitable interaction between functional nanomaterials and polymers are essential for the high performance strain sensing. Next, simulation results of piezoresistivity of stretchable strain sensors by computational models are reported. Finally, potential applications of flexible strain sensors are described. This survey reveals that flexible, skin‐mountable, and wearable strain sensors have potential in diverse applications while several grand challenges have to be still overcome.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2285847257", "source": "openalex"}

In this review we provide an overview of several components of the physical barrier, explaining how barrier function is regulated and altered in dermatoses. The physical barrier is mainly localized in the stratum corneum (SC) and consists of protein-enriched cells (corneocytes with cornified envelope and cytoskeletal elements, as well as corneodesmosomes) and lipid-enriched intercellular domains. The nucleated epidermis also contributes to the barrier through tight, gap and adherens junctions, as well as through desmosomes and cytoskeletal elements. During epidermal differentiation lipids are synthesized in the keratinocytes and extruded into the extracellular domains, where they form extracellular lipid-enriched layers. The cornified cell envelope, a tough protein/lipid polymer structure, resides below the cytoplasmic membrane on the exterior of the corneocytes. Ceramides A and B are covalently bound to cornified envelope proteins and form the backbone for the subsequent addition of free ceramides, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the SC. Filaggrin is cross-linked to the cornified envelope and aggregates keratin filaments into macrofibrils. Formation and maintenance of barrier function is influenced by cytokines, 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium. Changes in epidermal differentiation and lipid composition lead to a disturbed skin barrier, which allows the entry of environmental allergens, immunological reaction and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. A disturbed skin barrier is important for the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054083814", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were treated for a mean (SD) of 4.5 (2.8) years and had a total follow-up of 6.4 (2.0) years. <h3>Interventions.</h3> —Oral administration of 200 μg of selenium per day or placebo. <h3>Main Outcome Measures.</h3> —The primary end points for the trial were the incidences of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The secondary end points, established in 1990, were all-cause mortality and total cancer mortality, total cancer incidence, and the incidences of lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. <h3>Results.</h3> —After a total follow-up of 8271 person-years, selenium treatment did not significantly affect the incidence of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. There were 377 new cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the selenium group and 350 cases among the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.28), and 218 new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190 cases among the controls (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.39). Analysis of secondary end points revealed that, compared with controls, patients treated with selenium had a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality (108 deaths in the selenium group and 129 deaths in the control group [RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63-1.08]) and significant reductions in total cancer mortality (29 deaths in the selenium treatment group and 57 deaths in controls [RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.80]), total cancer incidence (77 cancers in the selenium group and 119 in controls [RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.85]), and incidences of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Primarily because of the apparent reductions in total cancer mortality and total cancer incidence in the selenium group, the blinded phase of the trial was stopped early. No cases of selenium toxicity occurred. <h3>Conclusions.</h3> —Selenium treatment did not protect against development of basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. However, results from secondary end-point analyses support the hypothesis that supplemental selenium may reduce the incidence of, and mortality from, carcinomas of several sites. These effects of selenium require confirmation in an independent trial of appropriate design before new public health recommendations regarding selenium supplementation can be made.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4295115868", "source": "openalex"}

In addition, unlike other organs, skin is in direct contact with the environment and therefore undergoes aging as a consequence of environmental damage. The primary environmental factor that causes human skin aging is UV irradiation from the sun. This sun-induced skin aging (photoaging), like chronological aging, is a cumulative process. However, unlike chronological aging, which depends on the passage of time per se, photoaging depends primarily on the degree of sun exposure and skin pigment. Individuals who have outdoor lifestyles, live in sunny climates, and are lightly pigmented will experience the greatest degree of photoaging. During the last decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms that bring about chronological aging and photoaging. This emerging information reveals that chronological aging and photoaging share fundamental molecular pathways. These new insights regarding convergence of the molecular basis of chronological aging and photoaging provide exciting new opportunities for the development of new anti-aging therapies. This article reviews our current understanding and presents new data about the molecular pathways that mediate skin damage by UV irradiation and by the passage of time.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994972521", "source": "openalex"}

Intrinsic structural changes occur as a natural consequence of ageing and are genetically determined. The rate of ageing is significantly different among different populations, as well as among different anatomical sites even within a single individual. The intrinsic rate of skin ageing in any individual can also be dramatically influenced by personal and environmental factors, particularly the amount of exposure to ultraviolet light. Photodamage, which considerably accelerates the visible ageing of skin, also greatly increases the risk of cutaneous neoplasms. As the population ages, dermatological focus must shift from ameliorating the cosmetic consequences of skin ageing to decreasing the genuine morbidity associated with problems of the ageing skin. A better understanding of both the intrinsic and extrinsic influences on the ageing of the skin, as well as distinguishing the retractable aspects of cutaneous ageing (primarily hormonal and lifestyle influences) from the irretractable (primarily intrinsic ageing), is crucial to this endeavour.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2052813747", "source": "openalex"}

The human integument is able to resist the penetration of many molecules. However, especially smaller molecules can surpass transcutaneously. They are able to go by the corneal layer, which is thought to form the main deterrent. We argue that the molecular weight (MW) of a compound must be under 500 Dalton to allow skin absorption. Larger molecules cannot pass the corneal layer. Arguments for this “500 Dalton rule” are; 1) virtually all common contact allergens are under 500 Dalton, larger molecules are not known as contact sensitizers. They cannot penetrate and thus cannot act as allergens in man; 2) the most commonly used pharmacological agents applied in topical dermatotherapy are all under 500 Dalton; 3) all known topical drugs used in transdermal drug‐delivery systems are under 500 Dalton. In addition, clinical experience with topical agents such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus and ascomycins gives further arguments for the reality of the 500 Dalton rule. For pharmaceutical development purposes, it seems logical to restrict the development of new innovative compounds to a MW of under 500 Dalton, when topical dermatological therapy or percutaneous systemic therapy or vaccination is the objective.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081159973", "source": "openalex"}

First, since e‐skin will be exposed to prolonged stresses of various kinds and needs to be conformally adhered to irregularly shaped surfaces, materials with intrinsic stretchability and self‐healing properties are of great importance. Second, tactile sensing capability such as the detection of pressure, strain, slip, force vector, and temperature are important for health monitoring in skin attachable devices, and to enable object manipulation and detection of surrounding environment for robotics and prosthetics. For skin attachable devices, chemical and electrophysiological sensing and wireless signal communication are of high significance to fully gauge the state of health of users and to ensure user comfort. For robotics and prosthetics, large‐area integration on 3D surfaces in a facile and scalable manner is critical. Furthermore, new signal processing strategies using neuromorphic devices are needed to efficiently process tactile information in a parallel and low power manner. For prosthetics, neural interfacing electrodes are of high importance. These topics are discussed, focusing on progress, current challenges, and future prospects.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2973569033", "source": "openalex"}

An estimated excess of US$25 billion is spent annually on treatment of chronic wounds and the burden is rapidly growing due to increasing health care costs, an aging population and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide. The annual wound care products market is projected to reach $15.3 billion by 2010. Chronic wounds are rarely seen in individuals who are otherwise healthy. In fact, chronic wound patients frequently suffer from \"highly branded\" diseases such as diabetes and obesity. This seems to have overshadowed the significance of wounds per se as a major health problem. For example, NIH's Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool (RePORT; http://report.nih.gov/ ), directed at providing access to estimates of funding for various disease conditions does list several rare diseases but does not list wounds. Forty million inpatient surgical procedures were performed in the United States in 2000, followed closely by 31.5 million outpatient surgeries. The need for post‐surgical wound care is sharply on the rise. Emergency wound care in an acute setting has major significance not only in a war setting but also in homeland preparedness against natural disasters as well as against terrorism attacks. An additional burden of wound healing is the problem of skin scarring, a $12 billion annual market. The immense economic and social impact of wounds in our society calls for allocation of a higher level of attention and resources to understand biological mechanisms underlying cutaneous wound complications.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056064788", "source": "openalex"}

Objectives This systematic review brings together 75 studies conducted over the past half century to look at geographical variations and trends worldwide in NMSC, and specifically incidence data are compared with recent U.K. cancer registry data. Methods Following the development of a comprehensive search strategy, an assessment tool was adapted to look at the methodological quality of the eligible studies. Results Most of the studies focused on white populations in Europe, the U.S.A. and Australia; however, limited data were available for other skin types in regions such as Africa. Worldwide the incidence for NMSC varies widely with the highest rates in Australia [> 1000/100 000 person‐years for basal cell carcinoma (BCC)] and the lowest rates in parts of Africa (< 1/100 000 person‐years for BCC). The average incidence rates in England were 76·21/100 000 person‐years and 22·65/100 000 person‐years for BCC and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), respectively, with highest rates in the South‐West of England (121·29/100 000 person‐years for BCC and 33·02/100 000 person‐years for SCC) and lowest rates by far in London (0·24/100 000 person‐years for BCC and 14·98/100 000 person‐years for SCC). The incidence rates in the U.K. appear to be increasing at a greater rate when compared with the rest of Europe. Conclusions NMSC is an increasing problem for health care services worldwide.

OBJECTIVE To discuss current epidemiologic data concerning the incidence, morbidity, environmental influences, predisposing, host conditions, precursor lesions, and prevention of melanoma and nonmelanoma (basal and squamous cell) skin cancer. METHODS The current literature ions reviewed in order to provide current epidemiologic data for melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), mid squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). RESULTS Skin cancer is exceedingly common and the incidence is rising rapidly. Although the mortality rate for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is decreasing, that of melanoma is increasing. Both NMSC and melanoma are associated with significant morbidity. Whereas chronic sun exposure is the main cause of NMSC, the development of melanoma appears to be related to intense, intermittent sun exposure. Ozone depletion has contributed to rising incidence rates of both NMSC and melanoma. In contrast to NMSC, there is not a direct relationship between ultraviolet radiation and melanoma. Genetic susceptibility significantly increases the lifetime risk of acquiring melanoma. There is no precursor lesion for BCC. Precursor lesions for invasive SCC include actinic keratoses and SCC in situ. Melanoma may arise from benign nevi and dysplastic nevi. Prevention of melanoma and NMSC is extremely important since prognosis improves with early detection. Prevention may be achieved by educating patients and physicians how to detect skin cancers early and by decreasing or eliminating exposure to ultraviolet light. CONCLUSION The incidence of skin cancer has readied epidemic proportions. Only through heroic efforts by health care professionals and the general public to prevent the development or progression of skin cancer will this epidemic be abated.

The high prevalence of superficial mycotic infections shows that 20–25% of the world’s population has skin mycoses, making these one of the most frequent forms of infection. Pathogens responsible for skin mycoses are primarily anthropophilic and zoophilic dermatophytes from the genera Trichophyton (T.) , Microsporum (M.) and Epidermophyton (E.) . There appears to be considerable inter‐ and intra‐continental variability in the global incidence of these fungal infections. Trichophyton rubrum , T. interdigitale ( mentagrophytes var. interdigitale ), M. canis , M. audouinii , T. tonsurans and T. verrucosum are the most common, but the attack rates and incidence of specific mycoses can vary widely. Local socio‐economic conditions and cultural practices can also influence the prevalence of a particular infection in a given area. For example, tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) is more prevalent in developed countries than in emerging economies and is likely to be caused by the anthropophilic germ T. rubrum . In poorer countries, scalp infections (tinea capitis) caused by T. soudanense or M. audouinii are more prevalent.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2007675231", "title": "Optical coherence tomography in dermatology: a review", "text": "Background/aims: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non‐invasive technique for morphological investigation of tissue. Since its development in the late 1980s it is mainly used as a diagnostic tool in ophthalmology. For examination of a highly scattering tissue like the skin, it was necessary to modify the method. Early studies on the value of OCT for skin diagnosis gave promising results. Methods: The OCT technique is based on the principle of Michelson interferometry. The light sources used for OCT are low coherent superluminescent diodes operating at a wavelength of about 1300 nm. OCT provides two‐dimensional images with a scan length of a few millimeters (mm), a resolution of about 15 μm and a maximum detection depth of 1.5 mm. The image acquisition can be performed nearly in real time. The measurement is non‐invasive and with no side effects. Results: The in vivo OCT images of human skin show a strong scattering from tissue with a few layers and some optical inhomogeneities. The resolution enables the visualization of architectural changes, but not of single cells. In palmoplantar skin, the thick stratum corneum is visible as a low‐scattering superficial well defined layer with spiral sweat gland ducts inside. The epidermis can be distinguished from the dermis. Adnexal structures and blood vessels are low‐scattering regions in the upper dermis. Skin tumors show a homogenous signal distribution. In some cases, tumor borders to healthy skin are detectable. Inflammatory skin diseases lead to changes of the OCT image, such as thickening of the epidermis and reduction of the light attenuation in the dermis. A quantification of treatment effects, such as swelling of the horny layer due to application of a moisturizer, is possible. Repeated measurements allow a monitoring of the changes over time. Conclusion: OCT is a promising new bioengineering method for investigation of skin morphology. In some cases it may be useful for diagnosis of skin diseases. Because of its non‐invasive character, the technique allows monitoring of inflammatory diseases over time.

However, owing to lack of national reporting and previously nonspecific diagnosis classification, accurate measurement of the US incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has been difficult. To estimate the incidence of NMSC (keratinocyte carcinomas) in the US population in 2012 and the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the 2012 Medicare fee-for-service population. This study analyzes US government administrative data including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Physicians Claims databases to calculate totals of skin cancer procedures performed for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 through 2012 and related parameters. The population-based National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey database was used to estimate NMSC-related office visits for 2012. We combined these analyses to estimate totals of new skin cancer diagnoses and affected individuals in the overall US population. Incidence of NMSC in the US population in 2012 and BCC and SCC in the 2012 Medicare fee-for-service population. The total number of procedures for skin cancer in the Medicare fee-for-service population increased by 13% from 2,048,517 in 2006 to 2,321,058 in 2012. The age-adjusted skin cancer procedure rate per 100,000 beneficiaries increased from 6075 in 2006 to 7320 in 2012. The number of procedures in Medicare beneficiaries specific for NMSC increased by 14% from 1,918,340 in 2006 to 2,191,100 in 2012. The number of persons with at least 1 procedure for NMSC increased by 14% (from 1,177,618 to 1,336,800) from 2006 through 2012. In the 2012 Medicare fee-for-service population, the age-adjusted procedure rate for BCC and SCC were 3280 and 3278 per 100,000 beneficiaries, respectively. The ratio of BCC to SCC treated in Medicare beneficiaries was 1.0. We estimate the total number of NMSCs in the US population in 2012 at 5,434,193 and the total number of persons in the United States treated for NMSC at 3,315,554. This study is a thorough nationwide estimate of the incidence of NMSC and provides evidence of continued increases in numbers of skin cancer diagnoses and affected patients in the United States. This study also demonstrates equal incidence rates for BCC and SCC in the Medicare population.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2040600853", "source": "openalex"}

However, the role of microbial communities in the pathogenesis of AD is incompletely characterized. To assess the relationship between skin microbiota and disease progression, 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene sequencing was performed on DNA obtained directly from serial skin sampling of children with AD. The composition of bacterial communities was analyzed during AD disease states to identify characteristics associated with AD flares and improvement post-treatment. We found that microbial community structures at sites of disease predilection were dramatically different in AD patients compared with controls. Microbial diversity during AD flares was dependent on the presence or absence of recent AD treatments, with even intermittent treatment linked to greater bacterial diversity than no recent treatment. Treatment-associated changes in skin bacterial diversity suggest that AD treatments diversify skin bacteria preceding improvements in disease activity. In AD, the proportion of Staphylococcus sequences, particularly S. aureus , was greater during disease flares than at baseline or post-treatment, and correlated with worsened disease severity. Representation of the skin commensal S. epidermidis also significantly increased during flares. Increases in Streptococcus, Propionibacterium , and Corynebacterium species were observed following therapy. These findings reveal linkages between microbial communities and inflammatory diseases such as AD, and demonstrate that as compared with culture-based studies, higher resolution examination of microbiota associated with human disease provides novel insights into global shifts of bacteria relevant to disease progression and treatment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151911433", "source": "openalex"}

The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates of skin cancers are increasing and, therefore, pose a significant public health concern. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the major etiologic agent in the development of skin cancers. UVR causes DNA damage and genetic mutations, which subsequently lead to skin cancer. A clearer understanding of UVR is crucial in the prevention of skin cancer. This article reviews UVR, its damaging effects on the skin and its relationship to UV immunosuppression and skin cancer. Several factors influence the amount of UVR reaching the earth’s surface, including ozone depletion, UV light elevation, latitude, altitude, and weather conditions. The current treatment modalities utilizing UVR (i.e. phototherapy) can also predispose to skin cancers. Unnecessary exposure to the sun and artificial UVR (tanning lamps) are important personal attributable risks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of skin cancer with an emphasis on carefully evaluated statistics, the epidemiology of UVR‐induced skin cancers, incidence rates, risk factors, and preventative behaviors &amp; strategies, including personal behavioral modifications and public educational initiatives.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1540044642", "source": "openalex"}

Across 234 biopsies of sun-exposed eyelid epidermis from four individuals, the burden of somatic mutations averaged two to six mutations per megabase per cell, similar to that seen in many cancers, and exhibited characteristic signatures of exposure to ultraviolet light. Remarkably, multiple cancer genes are under strong positive selection even in physiologically normal skin, including most of the key drivers of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Positively selected mutations were found in 18 to 32% of normal skin cells at a density of ~140 driver mutations per square centimeter. We observed variability in the driver landscape among individuals and variability in the sizes of clonal expansions across genes.

Development of alternative methods requires that the chemicals used to evaluate and validate novel approaches comprise not only confirmed skin sensitizers and non-sensitizers but also substances that span the full chemical mechanistic spectrum associated with skin sensitization. To this end, a recently published database of more than 200 chemicals tested in the mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA) has been examined in relation to various chemical reaction mechanistic domains known to be associated with sensitization. It is demonstrated here that the dataset does cover the main reaction mechanistic domains. In addition, it is shown that assignment to a reaction mechanistic domain is a critical first step in a strategic approach to understanding, ultimately on a quantitative basis, how chemical properties influence the potency of skin sensitizing chemicals.

To ascertain that aging indeed decreased the capacity of human skin to produce vitamin D3, some of the skin samples were exposed to ultraviolet radiation and the content of previtamin D3 was determined in the epidermis and dermis. The epidermis in the young and older subjects was the major site for the formation of previtamin D3, accounting for greater than 80% of the total previtamin D3 that was produced in the skin. A comparison of the amount of previtamin D3 produced in the skin from the 8- and 18-yr-old subjects with the amount produced in the skin from the 77- and 82-yr-old subjects revealed that aging can decrease by greater than twofold the capacity of the skin to produce previtamin D3.

Despite this fact, relatively little progress has been made in the field of pressure recognition compared to the areas of sight and voice recognition, mainly because good artificial “electronic skin” with a large area and mechanical flexibility is not yet available. The fabrication of a sensitive skin consisting of thousands of pressure sensors would require a flexible switching matrix that cannot be realized with present silicon-based electronics. Organic field-effect transistors can substitute for such conventional electronics because organic circuits are inherently flexible and potentially ultralow in cost even for a large area. Thus, integration of organic transistors and rubber pressure sensors, both of which can be produced by low-cost processing technology such as large-area printing technology, will provide an ideal solution to realize a practical artificial skin, whose feasibility has been demonstrated in this paper. Pressure images have been taken by flexible active matrix drivers with organic transistors whose mobility reaches as high as 1.4 cm 2 /V·s.

Melanogenesis is under complex regulatory control by multiple agents interacting via pathways activated by receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms, in hormonal, auto-, para-, or intracrine fashion. Because of the multidirectional nature and heterogeneous character of the melanogenesis modifying agents, its controlling factors are not organized into simple linear sequences, but they interphase instead in a multidimensional network, with extensive functional overlapping with connections arranged both in series and in parallel. The most important positive regulator of melanogenesis is the MC1 receptor with its ligands melanocortins and ACTH, whereas among the negative regulators agouti protein stands out, determining intensity of melanogenesis and also the type of melanin synthesized. Within the context of the skin as a stress organ, melanogenic activity serves as a unique molecular sensor and transducer of noxious signals and as regulator of local homeostasis. In keeping with these multiple roles, melanogenesis is controlled by a highly structured system, active since early embryogenesis and capable of superselective functional regulation that may reach down to the cellular level represented by single melanocytes. Indeed, the significance of melanogenesis extends beyond the mere assignment of a color trait.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043584813", "source": "openalex"}

Pigmentation is highly heritable, being regulated by genetic, environmental, and endocrine factors that modulate the amount, type, and distribution of melanins in the skin, hair, and eyes. In addition to its roles in camouflage, heat regulation, and cosmetic variation, melanin protects against UV radiation and thus is an important defense system in human skin against harmful factors. Being the largest organ of the body that is always under the influence of internal and external factors, the skin often reacts to those agents by modifying the constitutive pigmentation pattern. The focus of this review is to provide an updated overview of important physiological and biological factors that increase pigmentation and the mechanisms by which they do so. We consider endocrine factors that induce temporary (e.g., during pregnancy) or permanent (e.g., during aging) changes in skin color, environmental factors (e.g., UV), certain drugs, and chemical compounds, etc. Understanding the mechanisms by which different factors and compounds induce melanogenesis is of great interest pharmaceutically (as therapy for pigmentary diseases) and cosmeceutically (e.g., to design tanning products with potential to reduce skin cancer risk).", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112467050", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, a crucial role was proposed for the IL-23/IL-17 axis in psoriasis. We hypothesized that IMQ-induced dermatitis in mice can serve as a model for the analysis of pathogenic mechanisms in psoriasis-like dermatitis and assessed its IL-23/IL-17 axis dependency. Daily application of IMQ on mouse back skin induced inflamed scaly skin lesions resembling plaque type psoriasis. These lesions showed increased epidermal proliferation, abnormal differentiation, epidermal accumulation of neutrophils in microabcesses, neoangiogenesis, and infiltrates consisting of CD4+ T cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. IMQ induced epidermal expression of IL-23, IL-17A, and IL-17F, as well as an increase in splenic Th17 cells. IMQ-induced dermatitis was partially dependent on the presence of T cells, whereas disease development was almost completely blocked in mice deficient for IL-23 or the IL-17 receptor, demonstrating a pivotal role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis. In conclusion, the sole application of the innate TLR7/8 ligand IMQ rapidly induces a dermatitis closely resembling human psoriasis, critically dependent on the IL-23/IL-17 axis.

How can filmmakers working between cultures use cinema, a visual medium, to transmit that physical sense of place and culture? In The Skin of the Film Laura U. Marks offers an answer, building on the theories of Gilles Deleuze and others to explain how and why intercultural cinema represents embodied experience in a postcolonial, transnational world. Much of intercultural cinema, Marks argues, has its origin in silence, in the gaps left by recorded history. Filmmakers seeking to represent their native cultures have had to develop new forms of cinematic expression. Marks offers a theory of “haptic visuality”—a visuality that functions like the sense of touch by triggering physical memories of smell, touch, and taste—to explain the newfound ways in which intercultural cinema engages the viewer bodily to convey cultural experience and memory. Using close to two hundred examples of intercultural film and video, she shows how the image allows viewers to experience cinema as a physical and multisensory embodiment of culture, not just as a visual representation of experience. Finally, this book offers a guide to many hard-to-find works of independent film and video made by Third World diasporic filmmakers now living in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada. The Skin of the Film draws on phenomenology, postcolonial and feminist theory, anthropology, and cognitive science.

INTRODUCTION The skin is the largest organ of the body, accounting for more than 10% of body mass, and the one that enables the body to interact most intimately with its environment. Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic illustration of the skin. In essence, the skin consists of four layers: the stratum corneum (nonviable epidermis), the remaining layers of the epidermis (viable epidermis), dermis, and subcutaneous tissues. There are also several associated appendages: hair follicles, sweat ducts, apocrine glands, and nails. Many of the functions of the skin can be classified as essential to survival of the body bulk of mammals and humans in a relatively hostile environment. In a general context, these functions may be classified as protective, maintaining homeostasis, or sensing. The importance of the protective and homeostatic role of the skin is illustrated in one context by its barrier property. This allows the survival of humans in an environment of variable temperature; water content (humidity and bathing); and the presence of environmental dangers, such as chemicals, bacteria, allergens, fungi, and radiation. In a second context, the skin is a major organ for maintaining the homeostasis of the body, especially in terms of its composition, heat regulation, blood pressure control, and excretory roles. It has been argued that the basal metabolic rate of animals differing in size should be scaled to the surface area of the body to maintain a constant temperature through the skin's thermoregulatory control (1). Third, the skin is a major sensory organ in terms of sensing environmental influences, such as heat, pressure, pain, allergen, and microorganism entry. Finally, the skin is an organ that is in a continual state of regeneration and repair.

Although mortality from skin disease is primarily restricted to melanoma, dermatological disorders are ubiquitous in older people with a significant impact on quality of life. The structural and functional deterioration of the skin that occurs with age has numerous clinical presentations, ranging from benign but potentially excruciating disorders like pruritus to the more threatening carcinomas and melanomas.The degenerative changes that occur in the aging skin are increasingly understood at both the molecular and cellular level, facilitating a deeper understanding of the structural and functional deterioration that these changes produce.A loss of both function and structural stability in skin proceeds unavoidably as individuals age, which is the result of both intrinsic and extrinsic processes, which contribute simultaneously to a progressive loss of skin integrity. Intrinsic aging proceeds at a genetically determined pace, primarily caused by the buildup of damaging products of cellular metabolism as well as an increasing biological aging of the cells. Estrogen levels strongly influence skin integrity in women as well; falling levels in midlife, therefore, produce premature aging as compared with similarly aged men. Extrinsic insults from the environment add to the dermatological signs of aging.A deeper understanding of the physiological basis of skin aging will facilitate progress in the treatment of the unwelcome sequelae of aging skin, both cosmetic and pathogenic.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2002520059", "source": "openalex"}

However, these species have been associated with a diversity of dermatological disorders and even systemic infections. Pityriasis versicolor is the only cutaneous disease etiologically connected to Malassezia yeasts. In the other dermatoses, such as Malassezia folliculitis, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis, these yeasts have been suggested to play pathogenic roles either as direct agents of infection or as trigger factors because there is no evidence that the organisms invade the skin. Malassezia yeasts have been classified into at least 14 species, of which eight have been isolated from human skin, including Malassezia furfur , Malassezia pachydermatis , Malassezia sympodialis , Malassezia slooffiae , Malassezia globosa , Malassezia obtusa , Malassezia restricta , Malassezia dermatis , Malassezia japonica , and Malassezia yamatoensis . Distributions of Malassezia species in the healthy body and in skin diseases have been investigated using culture‐based and molecular techniques, and variable results have been reported from different geographical regions. This article reviews and discusses the latest available data on the pathogenicity of Malassezia spp., their distributions in dermatological conditions and in healthy skin, discrepancies in the two methods of identification, and the susceptibility of Malassezia spp. to antifungals.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2213355316", "source": "openalex"}

The mimicry of human skin's sensory ability via electronics is a topic of innovative research that could find broad applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, and human–machine interfaces, all of which promote the development of electronic skin (e‐skin). To imitate tactile sensing via e‐skins, flexible and stretchable pressure sensor arrays are constructed based on different transduction mechanisms and structural designs. These arrays can map pressure with high resolution and rapid response beyond that of human perception. Multi‐modal force sensing, temperature, and humidity detection, as well as self‐healing abilities are also exploited for multi‐functional e‐skins. Other recent progress in this field includes the integration with high‐density flexible circuits for signal processing, the combination with wireless technology for convenient sensing and energy/data transfer, and the development of self‐powered e‐skins.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2566399670", "title": "Skin Wound Healing: An Update on the Current Knowledge and Concepts", "text": "The integrity of healthy skin plays a crucial role in maintaining physiological homeostasis of the human body. The skin is the largest organ system of the body. As such, it plays pivotal roles in the protection against mechanical forces and infections, fluid imbalance, and thermal dysregulation. At the same time, it allows for flexibility to enable joint function in some areas of the body and more rigid fixation to hinder shifting of the palm or foot sole. Many instances lead to inadequate wound healing which necessitates medical intervention. Chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease can lead to impaired wound healing. Acute trauma such as degloving or large-scale thermal injuries are followed by a loss of skin organ function rendering the organism vulnerable to infections, thermal dysregulation, and fluid loss.For this update article, we have reviewed the actual literature on skin wound healing purposes focusing on the main phases of wound healing, i.e., inflammation, proliferation, epithelialization, angiogenesis, remodeling, and scarring.The reader will get briefed on new insights and up-to-date concepts in skin wound healing. The macrophage as a key player in the inflammatory phase will be highlighted. During the epithelialization process, we will present the different concepts of how the wound will get closed, e.g., leapfrogging, lamellipodial crawling, shuffling, and the stem cell niche. The neovascularization represents an essential component in wound healing due to its fundamental impact from the very beginning after skin injury until the end of the wound remodeling. Here, the distinct pattern of the neovascularization process and the special new functions of the pericyte will be underscored. At the end, this update will present 3 topics of high interest in skin wound healing issues, dealing with scarring, tissue engineering, and plasma application.Although wound healing mechanisms and specific cell functions in wound repair have been delineated in part, many underlying pathophysiological processes are still unknown. The purpose of the following update on skin wound healing is to focus on the different phases and to brief the reader on the current knowledge and new insights. Skin wound healing is a complex process, which is dependent on many cell types and mediators interacting in a highly sophisticated temporal sequence. Although some interactions during the healing process are crucial, redundancy is high and other cells or mediators can adopt functions or signaling without major complications.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2566399670", "source": "openalex"}

The lesions have been encountered in elderly patients of both sexes, and the larger tumors have disseminated actively by lymphatic pathways. Trabecular carcinomas may occasion diagnostic difficulty, for they may be misinterpreted as cutaneous metastases from visceral cancers.

Its UV component is the major epidemiologic risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Of the multiple steps in tumor progression, those that are sunlight-related would be revealed if they contained mutations specific to UV. In a series of New England and Swedish patients, we find that 14/24 (58%) of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin contain mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, each altering the amino acid sequence. Involvement of UV light in these p53 mutations is indicated by the presence in three of the tumors of a CC----TT double-base change, which is only known to be induced by UV. UV is also implicated by a UV-like occurrence of mutations exclusively at dipyrimidine sites, including a high frequency of C----T substitutions. p53 mutations in internal malignancies do not show these UV-specific mutations. The dipyrimidine specificity also implicates dipyrimidine photoproducts containing cytosine as oncogenic photoproducts.

Quantitative scanning transmission EM of individual collagen fibrils showed abrupt increases and decreases in mass along their axes, thereby accounting for the irregular outlines and size variability observed in cross-sections.

Regardless of the subjects' status with respect to atopy or their age group, the prevalence of asthma was closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P less than 0.0001), and no asthma was present in the 177 subjects with the lowest IgE levels for their age and sex (greater than 1.46 SD below the mean). The log odds ratio increased linearly with the serum IgE level after we controlled for possible confounders and the degree of reactivity to skin tests. In contrast, allergic rhinitis appeared to be associated primarily with skin-test reactions to common aeroallergens, independently of the serum IgE level. We conclude that asthma is almost always associated with some type of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of common aeroallergens we used to assess atopic status.

These activities are unified under the name skin optics. This paper first reviews the current status of tissue optics, distinguishing between the cases of: dominant absorption, dominant scattering, and scattering about equal to absorption. Then, previously published data as well as some current unpublished data on (human) stratum corneum, epidermis and dermis, have been collected and/or (re)analyzed in terms of absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, and anisotropy factor of scattering. The results are that the individual skin layers show strongly forward scattering (anisotropy factors between 0.7 and 0.9). The absorption and scattering data show that for all wavelengths considered scattering is much more important than absorption. Under such circumstances, solutions to the transport equation for a multilayer skin model and finite beam laser irradiation are currently not yet available.

Here we examine the importance of human skin in the entry of ZIKV and its contribution to the induction of antiviral immune responses. We show that human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells are permissive to the most recent ZIKV isolate, responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia. Several entry and/or adhesion factors, including DC-SIGN, AXL, Tyro3, and, to a lesser extent, TIM-1, permitted ZIKV entry, with a major role for the TAM receptor AXL. The ZIKV permissiveness of human skin fibroblasts was confirmed by the use of a neutralizing antibody and specific RNA silencing. ZIKV induced the transcription of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, and MDA5, as well as several interferon-stimulated genes, including OAS2, ISG15, and MX1, characterized by strongly enhanced beta interferon gene expression. ZIKV was found to be sensitive to the antiviral effects of both type I and type II interferons. Finally, infection of skin fibroblasts resulted in the formation of autophagosomes, whose presence was associated with enhanced viral replication, as shown by the use of Torin 1, a chemical inducer of autophagy, and the specific autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. The results presented herein permit us to gain further insight into the biology of ZIKV and to devise strategies aiming to interfere with the pathology caused by this emerging flavivirus.Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Vector-mediated transmission of ZIKV is initiated when a blood-feeding female Aedes mosquito injects the virus into the skin of its mammalian host, followed by infection of permissive cells via specific receptors. Indeed, skin immune cells, including dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, were all found to be permissive to ZIKV infection. The results also show a major role for the phosphatidylserine receptor AXL as a ZIKV entry receptor and for cellular autophagy in enhancing ZIKV replication in permissive cells. ZIKV replication leads to activation of an antiviral innate immune response and the production of type I interferons in infected cells. Taken together, these results provide the first general insights into the interaction between ZIKV and its mammalian host.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1857453373", "source": "openalex"}

Inspired by the structure and functions of the human fingertip, we fabricated fingerprint-like patterns and interlocked microstructures in ferroelectric films, which can enhance the piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoresistive sensing of static and dynamic mechanothermal signals. Our flexible and microstructured ferroelectric skins can detect and discriminate between multiple spatiotemporal tactile stimuli including static and dynamic pressure, vibration, and temperature with high sensitivities. As proof-of-concept demonstration, the sensors have been used for the simultaneous monitoring of pulse pressure and temperature of artery vessels, precise detection of acoustic sounds, and discrimination of various surface textures. Our microstructured ferroelectric skins may find applications in robotic skins, wearable sensors, and medical diagnostic devices.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2256016128", "source": "openalex"}

As MSCs can easily be isolated from bone marrow, they can be used in various tissue engineering strategies. In this study, we assessed whether MSCs can differentiate into multiple skin cell types including keratinocytes and contribute to wound repair. First, we found keratin 14-positive cells, presumed to be keratinocytes that transdifferentiated from MSCs in vitro. Next, we assessed whether MSCs can transdifferentiate into multiple skin cell types in vivo. At sites of mouse wounds that had been i.v. injected with MSCs derived from GFP transgenic mice, we detected GFP-positive cells associated with specific markers for keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and pericytes. Because MSCs are predominantly located in bone marrow, we investigated the main MSC recruitment mechanism. MSCs expressed several chemokine receptors; especially CCR7, which is a receptor of SLC/CCL21, that enhanced MSC migration. Finally, MSC-injected mice underwent rapid wound repaired. Furthermore, intradermal injection of SLC/CCL21 increased the migration of MSCs, which resulted in an even greater acceleration of wound repair. Taken together, we have demonstrated that MSCs contribute to wound repair via processes involving MSCs differentiation various cell components of the skin.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1920534265", "source": "openalex"}

However, the precise function of macrophages during the healing response has remained a subject of debate due to their functional dichotomy as effectors of both tissue injury and repair. We tested the hypothesis that macrophages recruited during the diverse phases of skin repair after mechanical injury exert specific functions to restore tissue integrity. For this purpose, we developed a mouse model that allows conditional depletion of macrophages during the sequential stages of the repair response. Depletion of macrophages restricted to the early stage of the repair response (inflammatory phase) significantly reduced the formation of vascularized granulation tissue, impaired epithelialization, and resulted in minimized scar formation. In contrast, depletion of macrophages restricted to the consecutive mid-stage of the repair response (phase of tissue formation) resulted in severe hemorrhage in the wound tissue. Under these conditions, transition into the subsequent phase of tissue maturation and wound closure did not occur. Finally, macrophage depletion restricted to the late stage of repair (phase of tissue maturation) did not significantly impact the outcome of the repair response. These results demonstrate that macrophages exert distinct functions during the diverse phases of skin repair, which are crucial to control the natural sequence of repair events.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118654016", "source": "openalex"}

Many instruments are available to measure the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients but no measure has been developed so far to quantify the secondary impact on family members of the patients. Objectives To develop and validate a dermatology‐specific instrument to measure the adverse impact on the HRQoL of family members of patients with skin disease. Methods Detailed semi‐structured interviews were conducted with family members of patients to identify different aspects of HRQoL affected. An initial draft version of the questionnaire based on the main topic areas was pilot tested to assess the face and content validity. A 10‐item questionnaire, the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI), was finalized after modifications to the draft questionnaire based on feedback from families and dermatology professionals and on item reduction. Psychometric evaluation was conducted on a new cohort of family members (n = 132) who completed the FDLQI and the patients (n = 109) who completed the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Results Fifty‐nine different aspects of family members' HRQoL were identified from the analysis of the interviews, which were categorized into main topic areas. Factor analysis of 10 items of the final questionnaire revealed two factors and together these explained 60% of the common variance. The FDLQI demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0·88) and test–retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0·94) reliabilities. The responsiveness of the instrument to change was shown by significant change in the family members' FDLQI scores in cases where patients' clinical condition either improved or worsened. Construct validity was assessed by testing a number of a priori hypotheses. A strong correlation was seen between the family members' FDLQI scores and patients' DLQI scores (r = 0·69), a significantly higher FDLQI score was seen for inflammatory skin diseases compared with noninflammatory diseases/isolated lesions (P < 0·0001), and there was a positive relationship between the family members' FDLQI scores and patients' disease severity (r = 0·49). Conclusions The FDLQI is simple and practical and seems to have the potential to be used as an additional outcome measure in clinical practice and evaluation research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1967972170", "source": "openalex"}

Further, it is an important first-line defense system against pathogens, as fish are continuously exposed to multiple microbial challenges in their aquatic habitat. Fish skin excels in highly developed antimicrobial features, many of which have been preserved throughout evolution, and infection defense principles employed by piscine skin are still operative in human skin. This review argues that it is both rewarding and important for investigative dermatologists to revive their interest in fish skin biology, as it provides insights into numerous fundamental issues that are of major relevance to mammalian skin. The basic molecular insights provided by zebrafish in vivo-genomics for genetic, regeneration and melanoma research, the complex antimicrobial defense systems of fish skin and the molecular controls of melanocyte stem cells are just some of the fascinating examples that illustrate the multiple potential uses of fish skin models in investigative dermatology.

Fitzpatrick skin types IV and darker have an even greater need for skin lightening for social reasons, as well as pigmentary changes that occur around the eyes, in the intertriginous areas, following dermatitis, or with acne and trauma. The gold standard dermatologic agent for skin lightening was hydroquinone, until regulatory agencies in Japan, Europe, and most recently in the United States questioned the safety of this substance. This has encouraged research into alternative agents to inhibit skin pigmentation such as retinoids, mequinol, azelaic acid, arbutin, kojic acid, aleosin, licorice extract, ascorbic acid, soy proteins, and N-acetyl glucosamine. The efficacy and safety of each of these ingredients is examined as possible topical alternatives to hydroquinone.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1953070490", "source": "openalex"}

We learned that neurocutaneous interactions influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological functions, including cell growth, immunity, inflammation, pruritus, and wound healing. This interaction is mediated by primary afferent as well as autonomic nerves, which release neuromediators and activate specific receptors on many target cells in the skin. A dense network of sensory nerves releases neuropeptides, thereby modulating inflammation, cell growth, and the immune responses in the skin. Neurotrophic factors, in addition to regulating nerve growth, participate in many properties of skin function. The skin expresses a variety of neurohormone receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins that are tightly involved in skin homeostasis and inflammation. This neurohormone-receptor interaction is modulated by endopeptidases, which are able to terminate neuropeptide-induced inflammatory or immune responses. Neuronal proteinase-activated receptors or transient receptor potential ion channels are recently described receptors that may have been important in regulating neurogenic inflammation, pain, and pruritus. Together, a close multidirectional interaction between neuromediators, high-affinity receptors, and regulatory proteases is critically involved to maintain tissue integrity and regulate inflammatory responses in the skin. A deeper understanding of cutaneous neuroimmunoendocrinology may help to develop new strategies for the treatment of several skin diseases.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156965630", "source": "openalex"}

By studying the terahertz pulse shape in the time domain we have been able to differentiate between diseased and normal tissue for the study of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Basal cell carcinoma has shown a positive terahertz contrast, and inflammation and scar tissue a negative terahertz contrast compared to normal tissue. In vivo measurements on the stratum corneum have enabled visualization of the stratum corneum–epidermis interface and the study of skin hydration levels.

Like their rodent counterparts, human SKPs grew in suspension as spheres in the presence of the mitogens fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor and expressed nestin, fibronectin, vimentin, and characteristic embryonic transcription factors. Human SKPs could be maintained in culture for long periods of time and would still differentiate into neurons, glia, and smooth muscle cells, including cells with the phenotype of peripheral neurons and Schwann cells. Clonal analysis indicated that single SKP cells were multipotent and could give rise to all of these progeny. Moreover, human SKPs apparently derive from an endogenous precursor within human foreskin; a subpopulation of dissociated primary foreskin cells could differentiate into neurons, a cell type never seen in skin, and the initial spheres to develop from skin expressed the same markers and had the same potential as do passaged SKPs.

Historical records of honey skin uses date back to the earliest civilizations, showing that honey has been frequently used as a binder or vehicle, but also for its therapeutic virtues. Antimicrobial properties are pivotal in dermatological applications, owing to enzymatic H 2 O 2 release or the presence of active components, like methylglyoxal in manuka, while medical‐grade honey is also available. Honey is particularly suitable as a dressing for wounds and burns and has also been included in treatments against pityriasis, tinea, seborrhea, dandruff, diaper dermatitis, psoriasis, hemorrhoids, and anal fissure. In cosmetic formulations, it exerts emollient, humectant, soothing, and hair conditioning effects, keeps the skin juvenile and retards wrinkle formation, regulates p H and prevents pathogen infections. Honey‐based cosmetic products include lip ointments, cleansing milks, hydrating creams, after sun, tonic lotions, shampoos, and conditioners. The used amounts range between 1 and 10%, but concentrations up to 70% can be reached by mixing with oils, gel, and emulsifiers, or polymer entrapment. Intermediate‐moisture, dried, and chemically modified honeys are also used. Mechanisms of action on skin cells are deeply conditioned by the botanical sources and include antioxidant activity, the induction of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase expression, as well as epithelial‐mesenchymal transition in wounded epidermis. Future achievements, throwing light on honey chemistry and pharmacological traits, will open the way to new therapeutic approaches and add considerable market value to the product.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104586385", "source": "openalex"}

The items were derived from the self-reported impacts of their skin condition by 50 dermatology out-patients. The resulting 17 psychosocial items and 12 activities items were assigned five-point scales and self-completed by 118 out-patients. Factor analyses grouped the items into four psychosocial subscales (embarrassment, despair, irritableness, distress) and four activities subscales (everyday, summer, social, sexual). Tests of the psychometric properties indicated that the internal consistency of responses was high, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.92 for the 17 psychosocial items and 0.83 for the 12 activity items. Assessment of reliability based on 41 psoriasis patients attending phototherapy treatment identified good short-term test-retest reliability, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.84 for both the psychosocial and activities scales. Construct validity was confirmed by the ability of the scales to identify clinically expected differences and their greater sensitivity to the impacts of skin problems compared with a widely used generic health status measure. The DQOLS thus form a robust measure of patient-perceived impacts. They were quickly self-completed and provide information that complements traditional clinical indicators. These scales should assist in informing treatment decisions by identifying impacts of different skin conditions and variations in responses among social and cultural groups, as well as guiding priorities for services within the specialty.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020215721", "source": "openalex"}

While the sun is not the only aetiological factor in the dynamic process of skin ageing, it is the primary exogenous cause among several internal and environmental elements. Thus, photo‐ageing, the main focus of this article, is a subset of extrinsic skin ageing. The influence of the sun in extrinsic skin ageing, as well as its role in potentially altering the normal course of intrinsic (also known as natural or cellular) ageing, is discussed. Telomeres, the specialized structures found at the ends of chromosomes, are believed to be integral to cellular ageing as well as in the development of cancer. The ageing process, both intrinsic and extrinsic, is also believed to be influenced by the formation of free radicals, also known as reactive oxygen species. The loss of collagen is considered the characteristic histological finding in aged skin. Wrinkling and pigmentary changes are directly associated with photo‐ageing and are considered its most salient cutaneous manifestations. Such photodamage represents the cutaneous signs of premature ageing. In addition, deleterious consequences of chronic sun exposure, specifically various forms of photo‐induced skin cancer, are also linked to acute and chronic sun exposure. The only known strategies aimed at preventing photo‐ageing include sun avoidance, using sunscreens to block or reduce skin exposure to UV radiation, using retinoids to inhibit collagenase synthesis and to promote collagen production, and using anti‐oxidants, particularly in combination, to reduce and neutralize free radicals.

In addition, the skin has long been recognized to protect the organism from deleterious environmental impacts (physical, chemical,microbiological), and is well-known as crucial for the maintenance of temperature, electrolyte and fluid balance. Now, ever more studies are being published that show the skin to also operate as a huge and highly active biofactory for the synthesis,processing and/or metabolism of an astounding range of e.g. structural proteins, glycans, lipids and signaling molecules. Increasingly, it becomes appreciated that the skin, furthermore, is an integral component of the immune, nervous and endocrine systems, with numerous lines of cross-talk between these systems established intracutaneously (e.g. Ann NY Acad Sci Vol 885, 1999; Endocrine Rev 21:457-487, 2000; Physiol Rev 80:980-1020, 2001; Exp Dermatol 10: 349-367, 2001). All these emerging cutaneous functions beyond the classical image of the skin as a barrier and sensory organ are immediately relevant for many of the quandaries that clinical dermatology, dermatopathology, and dermatopharmacology are still struggling with to-date, and offer the practising dermatologist attractive new targets for therapeutic intervention.

However, the origin of the acidic pH, measurable on the skin surface, remains conjectural. Passive and active influencing factors have been proposed, e.g. eccrine and sebaceous secretions as well as proton pumps. In recent years, numerous investigations have been published focusing on the changes in the pH of the deeper layers of the stratum corneum, as well as on the influence of physiological and pathological factors. The pH of the skin follows a sharp gradient across the stratum corneum, which is suspected to be important in controlling enzymatic activities and skin renewal. The skin pH is affected by a great number of endogenous factors, e.g. skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition and age. In addition, exogenous factors like detergents, application of cosmetic products, occlusive dressings as well as topical antibiotics may influence the skin pH. Changes in the pH are reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases like irritant contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; infections.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2155212585", "title": "Moisturization and skin barrier function", "text": "ABSTRACT: Over the past decade, great progress has been made toward elucidating the structure and function of the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the epidermis. SC cells (corneocytes) protect against desiccation and environmental challenge by regulating water flux and retention. Maintenance of an optimal level of hydration by the SC is largely dependent on several factors. First, intercellular lamellar lipids, organized predominantly in an orthorhombic gel phase, provide an effective barrier to the passage of water through the tissue. Secondly, the diffusion path length also retards water loss, since water must traverse the tortuous path created by the SC layers and corneocyte envelopes. Thirdly, and equally important, is natural moisturizing factor (NMF), a complex mixture of low-molecular-weight, water-soluble compounds first formed within the corneocytes by degradation of the histidine-rich protein known as filaggrin. Each maturation step leading to the formation of an effective moisture barrier—including corneocyte strengthening, lipid processing, and NMF generation—is influenced by the level of SC hydration. These processes, as well as the final step of corneodesmolysis that mediates exfoliation, are often disturbed upon environmental challenge, resulting in dry, flaky skin conditions. The present paper reviews our current understanding of the biology of the SC, particularly its homeostatic mechanisms of hydration.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155212585", "source": "openalex"}

Thus dermatologists should know about their potential to cause adverse events. This review is aimed at addressing this area in a semisystematic fashion. Some agents, particularly Chinese herbal creams, have been shown repeatedly to be adulterated with corticosteroids. Virtually all herbal remedies can cause allergic reactions and several can be responsible for photosensitization. Some herbal medicines, in particular Ayurvedic remedies, contain arsenic or mercury that can produce typical skin lesions. Other popular remedies that can cause dermatological side‐effects include St John's Wort, kava, aloe vera, eucalyptus, camphor, henna and yohimbine. Finally, there are some herbal treatments used specifically for dermatological conditions, e.g. Chinese oral herbal remedies for atopic eczema, which have the potential to cause systemic adverse effects. It is concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048106985", "source": "openalex"}

Following grafting, the dermal portion is populated with fibroblasts and vessels from the wound bed. The anatomic structure of the artificial dermis resembles normal dermis and serves as a template for the synthesis of new connective tissue and the formation of a \"neodermis,\" while it is slowly biodegraded. This artificial skin has physiologically closed excised burn wounds for periods of time up to 46 days before the Silastic epidermis was removed. At the time of election when donor sites are ready for reharvesting, the Silastic epidermis is removed from the vascularized artificial dermis and replaced with 0.004 auto-epidermal graft in sheet or meshed form. Clinical and histologic experience in a relatively short follow-up period (2–16 months) indicates that \"neodermis\" retains some of the anatomic characteristics and behavior of normal dermis, thus promising improvement in the functional and cosmetic results, as well as providing physiologic function as a skin substitute. The artificial skin is easily sterilized and stored at room temperature, capable of large scale production, and immediately available for grafting, indicating its potential for easy and relatively economic use in the burn patient", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006875835", "source": "openalex"}

Actually, there exists no (cellularized) skin equivalent which might be able to satisfactorily mimic native skin. Here, we utilized a laser-assisted bioprinting (LaBP) technique to create a fully cellularized skin substitute. The unique feature of LaBP is the possibility to position different cell types in an exact three-dimensional (3D) spatial pattern. For the creation of the skin substitutes, we positioned fibroblasts and keratinocytes on top of a stabilizing matrix (Matriderm®). These skin constructs were subsequently tested in vivo, employing the dorsal skin fold chamber in nude mice. The transplants were placed into full-thickness skin wounds and were fully connected to the surrounding tissue when explanted after 11 days. The printed keratinocytes formed a multi-layered epidermis with beginning differentiation and stratum corneum. Proliferation of the keratinocytes was mainly detected in the suprabasal layers. In vitro controls, which were cultivated at the air-liquid-interface, also exhibited proliferative cells, but they were rather located in the whole epidermis. E-cadherin as a hint for adherens junctions and therefore tissue formation could be found in the epidermis in vivo as well as in vitro. In both conditions, the printed fibroblasts partly stayed on top of the underlying Matriderm® where they produced collagen, while part of them migrated into the Matriderm®. In the mice, some blood vessels could be found to grow from the wound bed and the wound edges in direction of the printed cells. In conclusion, we could show the successful 3D printing of a cell construct via LaBP and the subsequent tissue formation in vivo. These findings represent the prerequisite for the creation of a complex tissue like skin, consisting of different cell types in an intricate 3D pattern.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162140499", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2129016936", "title": "Filaggrin in the frontline: role in skin barrier function and disease", "text": "Recently, loss-of-function mutations in FLG, the human gene encoding profilaggrin and filaggrin, have been identified as the cause of the common skin condition ichthyosis vulgaris (which is characterised by dry, scaly skin). These mutations, which are carried by up to 10% of people, also represent a strong genetic predisposing factor for atopic eczema, asthma and allergies. Profilaggrin is the major component of the keratohyalin granules within epidermal granular cells. During epidermal terminal differentiation, the approximately 400 kDa profilaggrin polyprotein is dephosphorylated and rapidly cleaved by serine proteases to form monomeric filaggrin (37 kDa), which binds to and condenses the keratin cytoskeleton and thereby contributes to the cell compaction process that is required for squame biogenesis. Within the squames, filaggrin is citrullinated, which promotes its unfolding and further degradation into hygroscopic amino acids, which constitute one element of natural moisturising factor. Loss of profilaggrin or filaggrin leads to a poorly formed stratum corneum (ichthyosis), which is also prone to water loss (xerosis). Recent human genetic studies strongly suggest that perturbation of skin barrier function as a result of reduction or complete loss of filaggrin expression leads to enhanced percutaneous transfer of allergens. Filaggrin is therefore in the frontline of defence, and protects the body from the entry of foreign environmental substances that can otherwise trigger aberrant immune responses.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129016936", "source": "openalex"}

Herein, we explore the biocompatibility of graphene-related materials with controlled physical and chemical properties. The size and extent of exfoliation of graphene oxide sheets was varied by sonication intensity and time. Graphene sheets were obtained from graphene oxide by a simple (hydrazine-free) hydrothermal route. The particle size, morphology, exfoliation extent, oxygen content, and surface charge of graphene oxide and graphene were characterized by wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential. One method of toxicity assessment was based on measurement of the efflux of hemoglobin from suspended red blood cells. At the smallest size, graphene oxide showed the greatest hemolytic activity, whereas aggregated graphene sheets exhibited the lowest hemolytic activity. Coating graphene oxide with chitosan nearly eliminated hemolytic activity. Together, these results demonstrate that particle size, particulate state, and oxygen content/surface charge of graphene have a strong impact on biological/toxicological responses to red blood cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity of graphene oxide and graphene sheets was investigated by measuring mitochondrial activity in adherent human skin fibroblasts using two assays. The methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, a typical nanotoxicity assay, fails to predict the toxicity of graphene oxide and graphene toxicity because of the spontaneous reduction of MTT by graphene and graphene oxide, resulting in a false positive signal. However, appropriate alternate assessments, using the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-8), trypan blue exclusion, and reactive oxygen species assay reveal that the compacted graphene sheets are more damaging to mammalian fibroblasts than the less densely packed graphene oxide. Clearly, the toxicity of graphene and graphene oxide depends on the exposure environment (i.e., whether or not aggregation occurs) and mode of interaction with cells (i.e., suspension versus adherent cell types).", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013328140", "source": "openalex"}

Stem cells can be activated, allowing increased tissue repair and healing. In dermatology, LLLT has beneficial effects on wrinkles, acne scars, hypertrophic scars, and healing of burns. LLLT can reduce UV damage both as a treatment and as a prophylactic measure. In pigmentary disorders such as vitiligo, LLLT can increase pigmentation by stimulating melanocyte proliferation and reduce depigmentation by inhibiting autoimmunity.

These enzymes can be produced by several different types of cells in skin such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes. macro‐phages, endothelial cells, mast cells, and eosinophils and their activity can be specifically inhibited by TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases), which bind to active MMPs with 1:1 stoichiometry. In general, MMPs are not constitutively expressed in skin but are induced temporarily in response to exogenous signals such as various cytokines. growth factors, cell‐matrix interactions and altered cell‐cell contacts. At present, more evidence is accumulating thai MMPs play an important role in proteolytic remodeling of extracellular matrix in various physiologic situations, including developmental tissue morphogenesis, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, MMPs play an important pathogenetic role in excessive breakdown of connective tissue components, e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis, oslteoarthritis, chronic ulcers, dermal photoageing, and periodontitis, as well as in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In this review we discuss the role of MMPs and TIMPs in human skin based on new observations on the regulation of the expression of MMPs, on their substrate specificily, and MMP expression in physiologic and pathologic conditions of skin involving matrix remodeling. Furthermore, therapeutic modalities based on regulating MMP activity will be reviewed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017517432", "source": "openalex"}

The skin is composed of two layers: the epidermal outer layer is highly cellular and provides the barrier function, and the inner dermal layer ensures strength and elasticity and gives nutritional support to the epidermis. Normal skin contains high concentrations of vitamin C, which supports important and well-known functions, stimulating collagen synthesis and assisting in antioxidant protection against UV-induced photodamage. This knowledge is often used as a rationale for the addition of vitamin C to topical applications, but the efficacy of such treatment, as opposed to optimising dietary vitamin C intake, is poorly understood. This review discusses the potential roles for vitamin C in skin health and summarises the in vitro and in vivo research to date. We compare the efficacy of nutritional intake of vitamin C versus topical application, identify the areas where lack of evidence limits our understanding of the potential benefits of vitamin C on skin health, and suggest which skin properties are most likely to benefit from improved nutritional vitamin C intake.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2743764518", "source": "openalex"}

Since 2017, there have been numerous studies assessing the accuracy of algorithms, with some reporting that the accuracy matches or surpasses that of a dermatologist. While the principles underlying these methods are relatively straightforward, it can be challenging for the practising dermatologist to make sense of a plethora of unfamiliar terms in this domain. Here we explain the concepts of AI, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, and explore the principles of how these tasks are accomplished. We critically evaluate the studies that have assessed the efficacy of these methods and discuss limitations and potential ethical issues. The burden of skin cancer is growing within the Western world, with major implications for both population skin health and the provision of dermatology services. AI has the potential to assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions and may have particular value at the interface between primary and secondary care.

Experiments show that cold atmospheric plasmas (CAPs) allow efficient, contact‐free and painless disinfection, even in microscopic openings, without damaging healthy tissue. Plasmas influence biochemical processes and offer new possibilities for the selective application of individually designable medically active substances. In dermatology, new horizons are being opened for wound healing, tissue regeneration, therapy of skin infections, and probably many more diseases.

Anti-itch, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, tissue-stimulating, blood flow-enhancing, and proapoptotic effects were demonstrated in in vivo and in vitro experiments, and until now, no resistance of pathogens against plasma treatment was observed. The combination of the different active agents and their broad range of positive effects on various diseases, especially easily accessible skin diseases, renders plasma quite attractive for applications in medicine. For medical applications, two different types of cold plasma appear suitable: indirect (plasma jet) and direct (dielectric barrier discharge-DBD) plasma sources.

Here, we demonstrate the potential of 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering using human skin as a prototypical example. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used as constituent cells to represent the epidermis and dermis, and collagen was used to represent the dermal matrix of the skin. Preliminary studies were conducted to optimize printing parameters for maximum cell viability as well as for the optimization of cell densities in the epidermis and dermis to mimic physiologically relevant attributes of human skin. Printed 3D constructs were cultured in submerged media conditions followed by exposure of the epidermal layer to the air-liquid interface to promote maturation and stratification. Histology and immunofluorescence characterization demonstrated that 3D printed skin tissue was morphologically and biologically representative of in vivo human skin tissue. In comparison with traditional methods for skin engineering, 3D bioprinting offers several advantages in terms of shape- and form retention, flexibility, reproducibility, and high culture throughput. It has a broad range of applications in transdermal and topical formulation discovery, dermal toxicity studies, and in designing autologous grafts for wound healing.

One cline was generated by high UVR near the equator and led to the evolution of dark, photoprotective, eumelanin-rich pigmentation. The other was produced by the requirement for UVB photons to sustain cutaneous photosynthesis of vitamin D(3) in low-UVB environments, and resulted in the evolution of depigmented skin. As hominins dispersed outside of the tropics, they experienced different intensities and seasonal mixtures of UVA and UVB. Extreme UVA throughout the year and two equinoctial peaks of UVB prevail within the tropics. Under these conditions, the primary selective pressure was to protect folate by maintaining dark pigmentation. Photolysis of folate and its main serum form of 5-methylhydrofolate is caused by UVR and by reactive oxygen species generated by UVA. Competition for folate between the needs for cell division, DNA repair, and melanogenesis is severe under stressful, high-UVR conditions and is exacerbated by dietary insufficiency. Outside of tropical latitudes, UVB levels are generally low and peak only once during the year. The populations exhibiting maximally depigmented skin are those inhabiting environments with the lowest annual and summer peak levels of UVB. Development of facultative pigmentation (tanning) was important to populations settling between roughly 23 degrees and 46 degrees , where levels of UVB varied strongly according to season. Depigmented and tannable skin evolved numerous times in hominin evolution via independent genetic pathways under positive selection.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127501217", "source": "openalex"}

An approximate prevalence of 10-20% was identified for GORD, defined by at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation in the Western world while in Asia this was lower, at less than 5%. The incidence in the Western world was approximately 5 per 1000 person years. A number of potential risk factors (for example, an immediate family history and obesity) and comorbidities (for example, respiratory diseases and chest pain) associated with GORD were identified. Data reported in this systematic review can be interpreted with confidence as reflecting the epidemiology of \"true\" GORD. The disease is more common in the Western world than in Asia, and the low rate of incidence relative to prevalence reflects its chronicity. The small number of studies eligible for inclusion in this review highlights the need for global consensus on a symptom based definition of GORD.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099999179", "source": "openalex"}

Studies were required to be population-based, to include ≥200 individuals, to have response rates ≥50% and recall periods &lt;12 months. GERD was defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation on at least 1 day a week, or according to the Montreal definition, or diagnosed by a clinician. Temporal and geographic trends in disease prevalence were examined using a Poisson regression model. <h3>Results</h3> 16 studies of GERD epidemiology published since the original review were found to be suitable for inclusion (15 reporting prevalence and one reporting incidence), and were added to the 13 prevalence and two incidence studies found previously. The range of GERD prevalence estimates was 18.1%–27.8% in North America, 8.8%–25.9% in Europe, 2.5%–7.8% in East Asia, 8.7%–33.1% in the Middle East, 11.6% in Australia and 23.0% in South America. Incidence per 1000 person-years was approximately 5 in the overall UK and US populations, and 0.84 in paediatric patients aged 1–17 years in the UK. Evidence suggests an increase in GERD prevalence since 1995 (p&lt;0.0001), particularly in North America and East Asia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> GERD is prevalent worldwide, and disease burden may be increasing. Prevalence estimates show considerable geographic variation, but only East Asia shows estimates consistently lower than 10%.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158690779", "source": "openalex"}

During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically. Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidites preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12-24 h, and may have little benefit beyond. Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 h of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis may be useful in delaying intervention, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality. In mild AP, oral feedings can be started immediately if there is no nausea and vomiting. In severe AP, enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent infectious complications, whereas parenteral nutrition should be avoided. Asymptomatic pancreatic and/or extrapancreatic necrosis and/or pseudocysts do not warrant intervention regardless of size, location, and/or extension. In stable patients with infected necrosis, surgical, radiologic, and/or endoscopic drainage should be delayed, preferably for 4 weeks, to allow the development of a wall around the necrosis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1972516036", "source": "openalex"}

The accumulation of knowledge since the previous guideline on nutrition of preterm infants from the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in 1987 has made a new guideline necessary. Thus, an ad hoc expert panel was convened by the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in 2007 to make appropriate recommendations. The present guideline, of which the major recommendations are summarised here (for the full report, see http://links.lww.com/A1480 ), is consistent with, but not identical to, recent guidelines from the Life Sciences Research Office of the American Society for Nutritional Sciences published in 2002 and recommendations from the handbook Nutrition of the Preterm Infant. Scientific Basis and Practical Guidelines , 2nd ed, edited by Tsang et al, and published in 2005. The preferred food for premature infants is fortified human milk from the infant's own mother, or, alternatively, formula designed for premature infants. This guideline aims to provide proposed advisable ranges for nutrient intakes for stable‐growing preterm infants up to a weight of approximately 1800 g, because most data are available for these infants.

Intended for use by physicians and allied health professionals, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible and adjustable for individual patients. Specific recommendations are evidence-based wherever possible, and when such evidence is not available or inconsistent, recommendations are made based on the consensus opinion of the authors. To best characterize the evidence cited in support of the recommendations, the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup with minor modifications (Table 1).2 The strength of recommendations in the GRADE system is classified as strong (1) or weak (2). The quality of evidence supporting strong or weak recommendations is designated by one of three levels: high (A), moderate (B) or low-quality (C).2 This is a practice guideline for clinicians rather than a review article and interested readers can refer to several comprehensive reviews published recently.3-8 NAFLD, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; NAFL,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver; NASH, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis; T2DM, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; AST, Aspartate Aminotransferase; ALT, Alanine Aminotransferase; HOMA,Homeostatic Model Assessment; RCT; Randomized Controlled Trial; PIVENS: Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Non-diabetic patients with Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; TONIC; Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children; NAS, NAFLD Activity Score; CK18; Cytokeratin 18 Fragments; ELF, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Panel; TZD; Thiazolidinediones; UDCA: Ursodeoxycholic Acid; ANA; Anti Nuclear Antibody; ASMA: Anti Smooth Muscle Antibody; US; Ultrasound; CT: Computerized Tomography; MR; Magnetic Resonance. The definition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) requires that (a) there is evidence of hepatic steatosis, either by imaging or by histology and (b) there are no causes for secondary hepatic fat accumulation such as significant alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication or hereditary disorders (Table 2). In the majority of patients, NAFLD is associated with metabolic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. NAFLD is histologically further categorized into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Table 3). NAFL is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with no evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning of the hepatocytes. NASH is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without fibrosis. The incidence of NAFLD has been investigated in a limited number of studies. Two Japanese studies9, 10 reported an incidence rate of 31 and 86 cases of suspected NAFLD per 1,000 person-years respectively, whereas another study from England showed a much lower incidence rate of 29 cases per 100,000 person-years.11 More studies are needed to better understand the incidence of NAFLD across different age, ethnic, and geographic groups. The reported prevalence of NAFLD varies widely depending on the population studied and the definition used. The prevalence of histologically-defined NAFLD was 20% and 51% in two different studies comprised of potential living liver donors.12, 13 The reported prevalence of NAFLD when defined by liver ultrasound ranged between 17% and 46% depending on the population studied.4 In a study consisting of nearly 400 middle aged individuals, the prevalence of NAFLD defined by ultrasonography was 46% and the prevalence of histologically confirmed NASH was 12.2%.14 In the Dallas Heart Study, when assessed by MR spectroscopy the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population was 31%.15 The prevalence of suspected NAFLD when estimated using aminotransferases alone without imaging or histology ranged between 7% and 11%, but aminotransferases can be normal in individuals with NAFLD.4 In summary, estimates of the worldwide prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 6.3% to 33% with a median of 20% in the general population, based on a variety of assessment methods.4 On the other hand, the estimated prevalence of NASH is lower, ranging from 3 to 5%.4 The prevalence of NASH cirrhosis in the general population is not known. Obesity is a common and well documented risk factor for NAFLD. Both excessive BMI and visceral obesity are recognized risk factors for NAFLD. In patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, the prevalence of NAFLD can exceed 90% and up to 5% of patients may have unsuspected cirrhosis.4, 16-20 There is a very high prevalence of NAFLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).4 An ultrasonographic study of patients with T2DM showed a 69% prevalence of NAFLD.21 In another study, 127 of 204 diabetic patients displayed fatty infiltration on ultrasound, and 87% of the patients with fatty infiltration who consented to biopsy had histologic confirmation of NAFLD.22 High serum triglyceride levels and low serum HDL levels are very common in patients with NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD in individuals with dyslipidemia attending lipid clinics was estimated to be 50%.23 Age, gender and ethnicity are also associated with a differential prevalence for NAFLD.4 A number of studies have shown that the prevalence of NAFLD increases with age.24-28 The likelihood of disease progression to advanced fibrosis or mortality increases in older patients with NAFLD.29-31 Many recent studies have reported that male gender is a risk factor for fatty liver disease.4 For example, in a study of 26,527 subjects undergoing medical checkups, the prevalence of NAFLD was 31% in men and 16% in women.32 Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic individuals have significantly higher and non-Hispanic blacks have significantly lower prevalence of NAFLD.15, 33-35 The prevalence of NAFLD in American-Indian and Alaskan-Native populations appears lower, ranging from 0.6% to 2.2%, although the lack of histologic definition makes it likely that is an underestimate.36, 37 There are data to suggest that hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism, sleep apnea, and polycystic ovary syndrome independent of obesity are important risk factors for the presence of NAFLD (Table 4).3 The evolution of hepatic histologic changes in patients with NAFL and NASH has been investigated by several studies, but these generally included smaller number of patients and had relatively modest duration of follow-up.4, 7 Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that patients with simple steatosis have very slow, if any, histological progression, while patients with NASH can exhibit histological progression to cirrhotic-stage disease.4, 7 The long term outcomes of patients with NAFLD and NASH have been reported in several studies.31, 38-45 Their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this guideline, but their findings can be summarized as follows; (a) patients with NAFLD have increased overall mortality compared to matched control populations, (b) the most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD, NAFL and NASH is cardiovascular disease, and (c) patients with NASH (but not NAFL) have an increased liver-related mortality rate. Another piece of indirect evidence that supports the progressive nature of NASH is in the features of cryptogenic cirrhosis which is closely related to NAFLD.46, 47 Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have disproportionately high prevalence of metabolic risk factors (T2DM, obesity, metabolic syndrome) typical of patients with NAFLD, their liver biopsies frequently show one or more features of NASH, and studies have demonstrated the loss of histological features of NASH with the development of cirrhosis.4, 7, 46, 47 Patients with NAFLD are at increased risk for HCC, but this risk is likely limited to those with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.48-53 Several studies investigated the natural history of NASH cirrhosis in comparison to patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis.54-57 One large prospective US-based study55 observed a lower rate of decompensation and mortality in patients with NASH cirrhosis as compared to patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis. However, a more recent international study56 of 247 NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis followed over a mean duration of 85.6 ± 54.5 months showed an overall 10-year survival of 81.5% that was not different from matched patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis. Importantly, both studies have shown that patients with NASH cirrhosis are at significantly lower risk for HCC than patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis.55, 56 By definition, NAFLD indicates the lack of any evidence of ongoing or recent consumption of significant quantities of alcohol. However, the precise definition of significant alcohol consumption in patients with suspected NAFLD is uncertain. A recent consensus meeting58 concluded that, for NASH clinical trials candidate eligibility purposes, significant alcohol consumption be defined as >21 drinks per week in men and >14 drinks per week in women over a 2-year period prior to baseline liver histology. Furthermore, this group recommended that validated questionnaires should be used to quantify the amount of alcohol consumption in the context of clinical trials. The definition of significant alcohol consumption in the published NAFLD literature has been inconsistent and ranged from > 1 alcoholic drink (∼ 10 grams of alcohol per one drink unit) per day to > 40 grams per day, and published studies have not always used gender-specific definitions.59 If self-reported alcohol consumption details are not consistent with clinical suspicion when evaluating a patient with suspected NAFLD, confirmation with a family member or a close friend should be considered. Recommendation 1. Ongoing or recent alcohol consumption > 21 drinks on average per week in men and > 14 drinks on average per week in women is a reasonable definition for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating patients with suspected NAFLD in clinical practice. (Strength – 2, Quality - C) Some patients undergoing thoracic and abdominal imaging for reasons other than liver symptoms, signs or biochemistry may demonstrate unsuspected hepatic steatosis. While this phenomenon is not uncommon in clinical practice, studies have not systematically examined the characteristics or natural history of NAFLD in this patient population. Recommendations 2. When patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked-up accordingly. (Strength – 1, Evidence -A) 3. In patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption or medications. (Strength – 1, Evidence -A) 4. In patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who are asymptomatic and have normal liver biochemistries, a liver biopsy cannot be recommended. (Strength – 1, Evidence -B) It can be argued that there should be systematic screening for NAFLD, at least among higher-risk individuals attending diabetes and obesity clinics. However, at present there are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of NAFLD. As liver biochemistries can be within normal ranges in patients with NAFLD and NASH, they may not be sufficiently sensitive to serve as screening tests, whereas liver ultrasound is potentially more sensitive but it is expensive and cumbersome as a screening test. Recommendation 5. Screening for NAFLD in adults attending primary care clinics or high-risk groups attending diabetes or obesity clinics is not advised at this time due to uncertainties surrounding diagnostic tests and treatment options, along with lack of knowledge related to the long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening. (Strength – 1, Evidence -B) Anecdotal experience and some published studies suggest familial clustering and heritability of NAFLD,60-63 but conclusive studies are lacking. In a retrospective cohort study, Willner et al. observed that 18% of patients with NASH have a similarly affected first degree relative.61 A small familial aggregation study observed that patients with NAFLD have a significantly higher number of first degree relatives with cirrhosis and a trend towards familial clustering of NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis than matched healthy controls.62 In another familial aggregation study63 of overweight children with and without NAFLD, after adjusting for age, gender, race, and BMI, the heritability of MR-measured liver fat fraction was 0.386, and fatty liver was present in 18% of family members of children with NAFLD despite normal ALT and lack of obesity. Recommendation 6. Systematic screening of family members for NAFLD is currently not recommended. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) The diagnosis of NAFLD requires that (a) there is hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology, (b) there is no significant alcohol consumption, (c) there are no competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis, and (d) there are no co-existing causes for chronic liver disease. Common alternative causes of hepatic steatosis are significant alcohol consumption, hepatitis C, medications, parenteral nutrition, Wilson's disease, and severe malnutrition (Table 2). When evaluating a patient with newly suspected NAFLD, it is important to exclude co-existing etiologies for chronic liver disease including hemochromatosis, autoimmune liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and Wilson's disease.3 Mildly elevated serum ferritin is common in patients with NAFLD and it does not necessarily indicate increased iron stores.3, 64 Elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in patients with suspected NAFLD should lead to testing for genetic hemochromatosis. Mutations in the HFE gene occur with variable frequency in patients with NAFLD and their clinical significance is unclear.64 One should consider a liver biopsy to assess hepatic iron concentration and to exclude significant hepatic injury and fibrosis in a patient with suspected NAFLD with elevated serum ferritin and a homozygote or compound heterozygote C282Y mutation in the HFE gene.65 Elevated serum autoantibodies are common in patients with NAFLD and are generally considered to be an epiphenomenon.3 In a recently published large study from the NASH Clinical Research Network, positive serum autoantibodies, defined as ANA > 1:160 or ASMA >1:40 were present in 21% of patients with well-phenotyped NAFLD and were not associated with more advanced histologic features.66 Recommendations 7. When evaluating a patient with suspected NAFLD, it is essential to exclude competing etiologies for steatosis and co-existing common chronic liver disease. (Strength – 1, Evidence - A) 8. Persistently high serum ferritin and increased iron saturation, especially in the context of homozygote or heterozygote C282Y HFE mutations may warrant a liver biopsy. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 9. High serum titers of autoantibodies in association with other features suggestive of autoimmune liver disease (very high aminotransferases, high globulin) should prompt a more complete work-up for autoimmune liver disease. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) The natural history of NAFLD is fairly dichotomous – NAFL is generally benign whereas NASH can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Existing dogma posits that liver biopsy is the most reliable approach for identifying the presence of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, but it is generally acknowledged that biopsy is limited by cost, sampling error, and procedure-related morbidity and mortality. Serum aminotransferase levels and imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, and MR do not reliably assess steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Therefore, there has been significant interest in developing clinical prediction rules and non-invasive biomarkers for identifying steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD,7 but their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this practice guideline. The presence of metabolic syndrome is a strong predictor for the presence of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD3, 7, 67-69 and may be used to best identify patients with persistently abnormal liver biochemistries who would benefit diagnostically and prognostically from a liver biopsy. There has been intense interest in non-invasive methods to identify advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD7;these include the NAFLD Fibrosis Score70, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel70 and transient elastography. The NAFLD Fibrosis Score is based on six readily available variables (age, BMI, hyperglycemia, platelet count, albumin, AST/ALT ratio) and it is calculated using the published formula (http://nafldscore.com). In a meta-analysis of 13 studies consisting of 3,064 patients,7 NAFLD Fibrosis Score has an AUROC of 0.85 for predicting advanced fibrosis (i.e., bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) and a score < −1.455 had 90% sensitivity and 60% specificity to exclude advanced fibrosis whereas a score > 0.676 had 67% sensitivity and 97% specificity to identify the presence of advanced fibrosis. The ELF panel consists of plasma levels of three matrix turnover proteins (hyaluronic acid, TIMP-1, and PIIINP) had an AUROC of 0.90 with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting advanced fibrosis.71 Circulating levels of cytokeratin-18 (CK18) fragments have been investigated extensively as novel biomarkers for the presence of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD.7, 72 Wieckowska et al., measured CK18 fragments in plasma that had been obtained from 44 consecutive patients with suspected NAFLD at the time of liver biopsy, and correlated the findings with hepatic immunohistochemistry data.70 Plasma CK18 fragments were markedly increased in patients with NASH compared with patients with simple steatosis or normal biopsies (median 765.7 U/L versus 202.4 U/L or 215.5 U/L, respectively; P < 0.001), and independently predicted NASH (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.18-3.22 for every 50 U/L increase). This observation was reproduced in several subsequent studies and a recent meta-analysis estimated that plasma CK18 levels have a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 87%, and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88) for steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD.7 Although these are very encouraging results, currently this assay is not commercially available. Furthermore, as each study utilized a study-specific cut-off value, there is not an established cut-off value for identifying steatohepatitis. Transient elastography, which measures liver stiffness non-invasively, has been successful in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Although a recent meta-analysis showed high sensitivity and specificity for identifying fibrosis in NAFLD,7 it has a high failure rate in individuals with a higher BMI. Furthermore, it is not commercially available in the United States. Other imaging tools such as MR elastography, although commercially available in the United States, is rarely used in clinical practice. A major limitation of these prediction models and biomarkers is that they have largely been investigated in cross-sectional studies and thus their utility in monitoring disease natural history, predicting outcomes or response to therapeutic intervention is unknown. Recommendations 10. As the metabolic syndrome predicts the presence of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD, its presence can be used to target patients for a liver biopsy. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 11. NAFLD Fibrosis Score is a clinically useful tool for identifying NAFLD patients with higher likelihood of having bridging fibrosis and/or cirrhosis. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 12. Although serum/plasma CK18 is a promising biomarker for identifying steatohepatitis, it is premature to recommend in routine clinical practice. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for characterizing liver histology in patients with NAFLD. However, it is expensive and carries some morbidity and very rare mortality risk. Thus, it should be performed in those who would benefit the most from diagnostic, therapeutic guidance, and prognostic perspectives. Recommendations 13. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk to have steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 14. The presence of metabolic syndrome and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score may be used for identifying patients who are at risk for steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 15. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected NAFLD in whom competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis and co-existing chronic liver diseases cannot be excluded without a liver biopsy. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) The management of patients with NAFLD consists of treating liver disease as well as the associated metabolic co-morbidities such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and T2DM. As patients with NAFLD without steatohepatitis have excellent prognosis from a liver standpoint, treatments aimed at improving liver disease should be limited to those with NASH. Many studies indicate that lifestyle modification may reduce aminotransferases and improve hepatic steatosis when measured either by ultrasound73-80 or MR imaging and spectroscopy.81-94 In a meta-analysis of 15 early case series and clinical studies spanning between 1967 through 2000, most studies reported reductions in aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis by ultrasound across a broad spectrum of diets of different caloric restriction intensities and macronutrient composition (low vs. high carbohydrate, low vs. high fat, saturated vs. unsaturated fat diets).95 However, these early studies were inconclusive as a result of being small, largely uncontrolled and few using histology as the primary endpoint. More recent uncontrolled studies also showed an improvement in aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis on histology with lifestyle modification.96-98 Orlistat (an enteric lipase inhibitor) in conjunction with lifestyle modification was investigated in two randomized controlled trials. In the study by Ziegler-Sagi et al.,99 orlistat reportedly improved ALT and steatosis by US, but its effect on liver histology could not be evaluated because the majority of patients did not undergo a follow-up liver biopsy. However, in the study by Harrison et al.,100 orlistat did not improve body weight or liver histology. The best evidence for weight loss as a means to improve liver histology in NASH comes from a trial that randomized 31 obese persons with NASH to intensive lifestyle changes (diet, behaviour modification and 200 minutes a week of moderate physical activity for 48 weeks) versus structured basic education alone.101 The intensive arm had 9.3% weight loss (versus 0.2% in the dietary counseling alone arm) and led to an improvement in steatosis, necrosis and inflammation, but not fibrosis. Importantly, participants with ≥ 7% weight loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS).101 There was a similar pattern in the study by Harrison et al.,100 where participants who lost > 5% body weight improved steatosis, whereas individuals with ≥ 9% weight loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and NAS. A number of recent studies used MR spectroscopy to assess changes in hepatic fat in response to lifestyle modification. The results from these studies using a variety of interventions, either by diet alone81, 83, 84, 89, 92, 93 or in combination with different exercise prescriptions,82, 85-88, 92, 94 have consistently reported a significant reduction in liver fat by an average of ∼40% (ranging from 20% to 81%). The degree of hepatic fat reduction was proportional to the intensity of the lifestyle intervention and generally required a body weight loss between ∼5 to 10%.82, 88, 92 The effect of exercise without dietary modification on hepatic steatosis was investigated in four studies using MR spectroscopy.102-105 Exercise programs consisted of 2-3 sessions a week of 30-60 minutes over a period of 6 to 12 weeks. In all but one study101 liver fat content diminished without a significant change in body weight. Recommendations 16. Weight loss generally reduces hepatic steatosis, achieved either by hypocaloric diet alone or in conjunction with increased physical activity. (Strength – 1, Evidence - A) 17. Loss of at least 3-5% of body weight appears necessary to improve steatosis, but a greater weight loss (up to 10%) may be needed to improve necroinflammation. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 18. Exercise alone in adults with NAFLD may reduce hepatic steatosis but its ability to improve other aspects of liver histology remains unknown. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) Several studies investigated the effect of metformin on aminotransferases and liver histology in patients with NASH. Early small, open-label studies demonstrated a reduction in insulin resistance and aminotransferases106-108 but no significant improvement in liver histology.107, 108 An open-label trial consisting of 110 patients with NASH received either metformin 2 grams/day (55 patients), vitamin E 800 IU/day (28 patients) or dietary-induced weight loss (27 patients) for 12 months.109 Aminotransferases improved more with metformin than with vitamin E or diet alone. However, there was only a modest improvement in hepatic steatosis and inflammation in the subset of 17 patients undergoing paired liver biopsies with metformin treatment. In a 48-week open-label study in 26 patients, metformin improved NASH activity in only 30% of patients, although interpretation of the study was confounded by a significant weight loss in the responders (19% lost more than 10 kilograms).110 Haukeland et al.112 reported a similar lack of efficacy in a larger (n=48) randomized control trial (RCT) of metformin vs. placebo with a similar dietary and exercise intervention in both groups. Other studies also failed to show major benefit for metformin on hepatic insulin sensitivity, aminotransferases111-116 or liver histology.111, 113, 116 A recent meta-analysis4 concluded that 6-12 months of metformin plus lifestyle intervention did not improve aminotransferases or liver histology, compared with lifestyle intervention alone, independently of metformin dose or the presence of diabetes. Recommendation 19. Metformin has no significant effect on liver histology and is not recommended as a specific treatment for liver disease in adults with NASH. (Strength – 1, Evidence - A) Several studies investigated the effect of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on aminotransferases and liver histology in adults with NASH. In an early uncontrolled open-label study117 in 22 subjects with biopsy-proven NASH, rosiglitazone improved aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis, ballooning and inflammation scores, but not fibrosis. But in a subsequent RCT, Ratziu et al.118 observed that rosiglitazone improved aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis, but not necroinflammation or fibrosis and its two-year open-label extension phase also showed similar results.119 Belfort et al.120 conducted a RCT of pioglitazone (45 mg/day) in patients with NASH who had impaired glucose tolerance or T2DM. Although there was a significant weight gain (2.5 ± 0.5 kg) with pioglitazone, it significantly improved aminotransferases, steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation. The NAS improved with pioglitazone in 73% compared to 24% of placebo-treated patients (P<0.001) and there was a trend towards improvement in fibrosis among patients randomized to pioglitazone (P=0.08). Aithal et al.121 performed a RCT of lifestyle intervention with either pioglitazone 30 mg/day or placebo for 12 months in a total of 74 patients with NASH. While steatosis did not improve significantly compared to placebo, hepatocellular injury and fibrosis improved significantly.1210 The PIVENS122 study is a large multicenter RCT that randomized 247 non-diabetic patients with NASH to pioglitazone (30 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), or placebo for 24 months. The primary endpoint was an improvement in NAS ≥ 2 points with at least 1 point improvement in hepatocellular ballooning and 1-point improvement in either the lobular inflammation or steatosis score, and no increase in the fibrosis score.122 It was achieved in 19% in the placebo group compared to 34% in the pioglitazone group (P=0.04 vs. placebo) and 43% in the vitamin E group (P=0.001 vs. placebo).122 Because this study consisted of two primary comparisons (pioglitazone vs. placebo and vitamin E vs. placebo), a P-value of 0.025 was considered to be significant a priori. Therefore, although there were histological benefits associated with pioglitazone, this study concluded that pioglitazone did not meet the primary end point. However, resolution of NASH, a key secondary end point, was achieved in significantly higher number of pati", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963683487", "source": "openalex"}

Though the prevalence of this infection appears to be decreasing in many parts of the world, H. pylori remains an important factor linked to the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric malignanc and dyspeptic symptoms. Whether to test for H. pylori in patients with functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), patients taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, with iron deficiency anemia, or who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer remains controversial. H. pylori can be diagnosed by endoscopic or nonendoscopic methods. A variety of factors including the need for endoscopy, pretest probability of infection, local availability, and an understanding of the performance characteristics and cost of the individual tests influences choice of evaluation in a given patient. Testing to prove eradication should be performed in patients who receive treatment of H. pylori for peptic ulcer disease, individuals with persistent dyspeptic symptoms despite the test-and-treat strategy, those with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, and individuals who have undergone resection of early gastric cancer. Recent studies suggest that eradication rates achieved by first-line treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin have decreased to 70-85%, in part due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. Eradication rates may also be lower with 7 versus 14-day regimens. Bismuth-containing quadruple regimens for 7-14 days are another first-line treatment option. Sequential therapy for 10 days has shown promise in Europe but requires validation in North America. The most commonly used salvage regimen in patients with persistent H. pylori is bismuth quadruple therapy. Recent data suggest that a PPI, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin for 10 days is more effective and better tolerated than bismuth quadruple therapy for persistent H. pylori infection, though this needs to be validated in the United States.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152211277", "source": "openalex"}

Sixty-five consecutive patients with well-defined IPF were subjected to 24-h pH monitoring and oesophageal manometry. A total of 133 consecutive patients with intractable asthma and symptoms of GER were used as comparisons. The prevalence of abnormal acid GER in IPF patients was 87%, with 76% and 63% demonstrating abnormal distal and proximal oesophageal acid exposures, respectively. Abnormal acid GER was significantly more common in IPF patients than asthma patients. Only 47% of IPF patients experienced classic GER symptoms. Despite treatment with standard doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), 12 out of 19 patients receiving PPIs during the 24-h pH monitoring had abnormal oesophageal acid exposures by pH probe. There was no correlation between IPF severity and acid GER severity. In conclusion, abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux is highly prevalent, but often clinically occult in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Standard doses of proton pump inhibitors may not suppress the acid gastro-oesophageal reflux in this population. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine if acid abnormal gastro-oesophageal reflux represents an important risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis development or progression, and if optimal suppression of acid gastro-oesophageal reflux slows the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or decreases episodic exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144469870", "source": "openalex"}

In collaboration with United European Gastroenterology, the working group on 'Harmonizing diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis across Europe' (HaPanEU) developed these European guidelines using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: Twelve multidisciplinary review groups performed systematic literature reviews to answer 101 predefined clinical questions. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system and the answers were assessed by the entire group in a Delphi process online. The review groups presented their recommendations during the 2015 annual meeting of United European Gastroenterology. At this one-day, interactive conference, relevant remarks were voiced and overall agreement on each recommendation was quantified using plenary voting (Test and Evaluation Directorate). After a final round of adjustments based on these comments, a draft version was sent out to external reviewers. RESULTS: The 101 recommendations covered 12 topics related to the clinical management of chronic pancreatitis: aetiology (working party (WP)1), diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis with imaging (WP2 and WP3), diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (WP4), surgery in chronic pancreatitis (WP5), medical therapy (WP6), endoscopic therapy (WP7), treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts (WP8), pancreatic pain (WP9), nutrition and malnutrition (WP10), diabetes mellitus (WP11) and the natural course of the disease and quality of life (WP12). Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, 70 of the 101 (70%) recommendations were rated as 'strong' and plenary voting revealed 'strong agreement' for 99 (98%) recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The 2016 HaPanEU/United European Gastroenterology guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations concerning key aspects of the medical and surgical management of chronic pancreatitis based on current available evidence. These recommendations should serve as a reference standard for existing management of the disease and as a guide for future clinical research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2577520851", "source": "openalex"}

Nivolumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated superior overall survival versus chemotherapy at 12-month follow-up in gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the randomized, global CheckMate 649 phase 3 trial 5 (programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score ≥5 and all randomized patients). On the basis of these results, nivolumab plus chemotherapy is now approved as a first-line treatment for these patients in many countries 6 . Nivolumab and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab have distinct but complementary mechanisms of action that contribute to the restoration of anti-tumour T-cell function and induction of de novo anti-tumour T-cell responses, respectively 7–11 . Treatment combining 1 mg kg −1 nivolumab with 3 mg kg −1 ipilimumab demonstrated clinically meaningful anti-tumour activity with a manageable safety profile in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer 12 . Here we report both long-term follow-up results comparing nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone and the first results comparing nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone from CheckMate 649. After the 24.0-month minimum follow-up, nivolumab plus chemotherapy continued to demonstrate improvement in overall survival versus chemotherapy alone in patients with PD-L1 combined positive score ≥5 (hazard ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.61, 0.81) and all randomized patients (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.71, 0.88). Overall survival in patients with PD-L1 combined positive score ≥ 5 for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone did not meet the prespecified boundary for significance. No new safety signals were identified. Our results support the continued use of nivolumab plus chemotherapy as standard first-line treatment for advanced gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220909053", "source": "openalex"}

AIMS To examine the interaction between hiatus hernia and lower oesophageal sphincter hypotension. METHODS In seven normal subjects and seven patients with hiatus hernia, the squamocolumnar junction and intragastric margin of the gastro-oesophageal junction were marked with endoscopically placed clips. Axial and radial characteristics of the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone were mapped relative to the hiatus and clips during concurrent fluoroscopy and manometry. Responses to inspiration and abdominal compression were also analysed. RESULTS In normal individuals the squamocolumnar junction was 0.5 cm below the hiatus and the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone extended 1.1 cm distal to that. In those with hiatus hernia, the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone had two discrete segments, one proximal to the squamocolumnar junction and one distal, attributable to the extrinsic compression within the hiatal canal. Inspiration and abdominal compression mainly augmented the distal one. Simulation of hernia reduction by algebraically summing the proximal segment pressures with the hiatal canal pressures restored normal maximal pressure, radial asymmetry, and dynamic responses of the gastro-oesophageal junction. CONCLUSIONS Hiatus hernia reduces lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and alters its dynamic responsiveness by spatially separating pressure components derived from the intrinsic lower oesophageal sphincter and the extrinsic compression of the oesophagus within the hiatal canal.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156425129", "source": "openalex"}

AIMS To identify and synthesise findings from all articles on the performance of EUS in tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging of gastro-oesophageal carcinoma. SOURCE Published and unpublished English language literature, 1981–1996. METHODS Data on the staging performance of EUS were retrieved and evaluated. Summary receiver operator characteristic methodology was used for synthesis, and a summary estimate of performance, Q*, obtained. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess study validity and investigate reasons for differences in performance. RESULTS Twenty seven primary articles were assessed in detail. Thirteen supplied results for staging oesophageal cancer, 13 for gastric cancer, and four for cancers at the gastro-oesophageal junction. For gastric T staging, Q*=0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.95) and for oesophageal T staging, Q*=0.89 (95% CI 0.88–0.92). For gastro-oesophageal T staging, including cancers at the gastro-oesophageal junction, Q*=0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.93). Inclusion of cases with non-traversable stenosis was found to slightly reduce staging performance. For N staging, Q*=0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.83). In articles that compared EUS directly with incremental computed tomography, EUS performed better. None of the variables assessed in the regression analysis was significant using a Bonferroni correction. Three variables (anatomical location, traversability, and blinding) showed strong relationships for future research and validation. CONCLUSIONS EUS is highly effective for discrimination of stages T1 and T2 from stages T3 and T4 for primary gastro-oesophageal carcinomas. The failure rate of EUS from non-traversability of a stenotic cancer may be a limitation in some patient groups. * CT : computed tomography EUS : endoscopic ultrasound FPR : false positive rate SROC : summary receiver operating characteristic TNM : tumour, node, metastasis TPR : true positive rate", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096810410", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027852470", "title": "Appropriate Acid Suppression for the Management of Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease", "text": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) results from an abnormally prolonged dwell time of acidic gastric contents in the oesophagus. Although GORD is primarily a motor disorder, the injurious effects of gastric acid are central to the pathogenic process of oesophagitis, and the severity of disease correlates with the degree and duration of oesophageal acid exposure. In the majority of patients with mild disease, oesophageal acid exposure occurs predominantly during post-prandial periods. Conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists cannot overcome the integrated stimulus to acid secretion resulting from a meal, and are thus relatively ineffective in preventing daytime, post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure. In patients with more severe grades of oesophagitis, there are abnormally high levels of nocturnal acid exposure, with the intra-oesophageal pH being less than 4.0 for 36% of the time, compared with 5% of the time in patients with mild GORD. Control of nocturnal acid secretion thus becomes increasingly important. This may be made worse by relative gastric acid hypersecretion in some patients with severe GORD. The long duration of action and effective inhibition of meal-stimulated acid secretion probably explains the superiority of omeprazole in treating GORD. Preliminary meta-analysis shows that the healing rate of erosive oesophagitis at 8 weeks by antisecretory agents is directly related to the duration of suppression of gastric acid secretion achieved over a 24-hour period (r = 0.87; p < 0.05).", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027852470", "source": "openalex"}

In female patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, the present study examined the effects on health status of: 1) history of sexual abuse and physical abuse, 2) invasiveness or seriousness of sexual abuse and physical abuse, and 3) age at first sexual and physical abuse. Method: The sample included 239 female patients from a referral gastroenterology clinic who were interviewed to assess sexual and physical abuse history. Results: We found the following: 1) 66.5% of patients experienced some type of sexual and/or physical abuse; 2) women with sexual abuse history had more pain, non-GI somatic symptoms, bed disability days, lifetime surgeries, psychological distress, and functional disability compared to those without sexual abuse; 3) women with physical abuse also had worse health outcome on most health status indicators; 4) rape (intercourse) and life-threatening physical abuse seem to have worse health effects than less serious physical violence, and sexual abuse involving attempts and touch; and 5) those with first abuse in childhood did not appear to differ on health from those whose first abuse was as adults. Conclusions: The authors conclude that asking about abuse should be integrated into history taking within referral-based gastroenterology practices.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070641149", "source": "openalex"}

Methods : A telephone survey of 2500 subjects was performed using a validated questionnaire. The association of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (defined as the presence of heartburn or acid regurgitation) and their clinical characteristics with potential risk factors was summarized using the odds ratios (OR) obtained by multiple logistic regression. Results : The response rate was 71.2%. The annual prevalence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms was 31.6%[95% confidence interval (CI), 29.8–33.4] and the weekly prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI, 8.6–10.9). Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms were associated with excess weight (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.92), obesity (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.30–2.32), the psychosomatic symptom score (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.41–3.67) and the presence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms in a direct family member (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.17–2.23). Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms of ≥ 10 years' duration were more frequent in obese subjects (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14–3.22) and those with a direct family member with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.44–4.06). Factors associated with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms of ≤ 1 year duration were a spouse with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.39–3.9) and the consumption of 1–5 aspirins/week (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.01–2.86). Conclusions : The prevalence of frequent gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms in Spain is lower than that observed in other Western populations. The psychosomatic symptom score is the factor most strongly associated with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms. Long‐term gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms are associated with certain genetic factors (obesity, family history of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms), whereas short‐term gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms are associated with factors of probable environmental nature.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043231857", "source": "openalex"}

By the era of big data, the accumulation of an enormous number of digital images and medical records drove the need for the utilization of AI to efficiently deal with these data, which have become fundamental resources for a machine to learn by itself. Among several DL models, the convolutional neural network showed outstanding performance in image analysis. In the field of gastroenterology, physicians handle large amounts of clinical data and various kinds of image devices such as endoscopy and ultrasound. AI has been applied in gastroenterology in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and image analysis. However, potential inherent selection bias cannot be excluded in the form of retrospective study. Because overfitting and spectrum bias (class imbalance) have the possibility of overestimating the accuracy, external validation using unused datasets for model development, collected in a way that minimizes the spectrum bias, is mandatory. For robust verification, prospective studies with adequate inclusion/exclusion criteria, which represent the target populations, are needed. DL has its own lack of interpretability.

Previous attempts of classification have been based primarily on anatomic location and behavior of disease. However, no uniform definition of patient subgroups has yet achieved broad acceptance. The aim of this international Working Party was to develop a simple classification of Crohn's disease based on objective variables. Eight outcome-related variables relevant to Crohn's disease were identified and stepwise evaluated in 413 consecutive cases, a database survey, and by clinical considerations. Allocation of variables was conducted with well-defined Crohn's disease populations from Europe and North America. Cross-table analyses were performed by chi-square testing. Three variables were finally elected: Age at Diagnosis [below 40 years (A1), equal to or above 40 years (A2)], Location [terminal ileum (L1), colon (L2), ileocolon (L3), upper gastrointestinal (L4)], and Behavior [nonstricturing nonpenetrating (B1), stricturing (B2), penetrating (B3)]. The allocation of patients to these 24 subgroups proved feasible and resulted in specific disease clusters. Cross-table analyses revealed associations between Age at Diagnosis and Location, and between Behavior and Location (all p < 0.001). The Vienna classification of Crohn's disease provides distinct definitions to categorize Crohn's patients into 24 subgroups.

The risk of reflux symptoms was estimated and multivariately calculated as odds ratios in relation to exposure to tobacco smoking, alcohol, coffee, tea, table salt, cereal fibres, and physical exercise.There was a significant dose response association between tobacco smoking and reflux symptoms. Among people who had smoked daily for more than 20 years the odds ratio was 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 1.9) compared with non-smokers. A similar positive association was found for table salt intake. The odds ratio for reflux was 1.7 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.0) among those who always used extra table salt compared with those who never did so. We found moderately strong negative associations between the risk of reflux and exposure to coffee, bread high in dietary fibre content, and frequent physical exercise.

Here, an updated and expanded evidence-based guideline is presented. Literature databases and other sources of information were searched for studies that could inform on 10 formulated questions on symptoms, serology, HLA genetics, and histopathology. Eligible articles were assessed using QUADAS2. GRADE provided a basis for statements and recommendations. Various symptoms are suggested for case finding, with limited contribution to diagnostic accuracy. If CD is suspected, measurement of total serum IgA and IgA-antibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TGA-IgA) is superior to other combinations. We recommend against deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP-IgG/IgA) for initial testing. Only if total IgA is low/undetectable, an IgG-based test is indicated. Patients with positive results should be referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist/specialist. If TGA-IgA is ≥10 times the upper limit of normal (10× ULN) and the family agrees, the no-biopsy diagnosis may be applied, provided endomysial antibodies (EMA-IgA) will test positive in a second blood sample. HLA DQ2-/DQ8 determination and symptoms are not obligatory criteria. In children with positive TGA-IgA <10× ULN at least 4 biopsies from the distal duodenum and at least 1 from the bulb should be taken. Discordant results between TGA-IgA and histopathology may require re-evaluation of biopsies. Patients with no/mild histological changes (Marsh 0/I) but confirmed autoimmunity (TGA-IgA/EMA-IgA+) should be followed closely.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1573236912", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guideline", "text": "INTRODUCTION Constipation is a chronic problem in many patients all over the world. In some groups of patients such as the elderly, constipation is a significant health care problem, but in the majority of cases chronic constipation is an aggravating, but not life threatening or debilitating, complaint that can be managed in primary care with cost-effective control of symptoms. The terminology associated with constipation is problematic. There are 2 pathophysiologies, which differ in principle but overlap: disorders of transit and evacuation disorders. The first can arise secondary to the second, and the second can sometimes follow from the first. This guideline focuses on adult patients and does not specifically discuss children or special groups of patients (such as those with spinal cord injury). Cascades: A Resource-sensitive Approach A gold standard approach is feasible for regions and countries in which the full range of diagnostic tests and medical treatment options are available for the management of all types and subtypes of constipation. A cascade is a hierarchical set of diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options for dealing with risk and disease, ranked according to the resources available. DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS The word “constipation” has several meanings, and the way it is used may differ not only between patients but also between different cultures and regions. In a Swedish population study, it was found that a need to take laxatives was the most common conception of constipation (57% of respondents). In the same study, women (41%) were twice as likely as men (21%) to regard infrequent bowel motions as representing constipation, whereas equal proportions of men and women regarded hard stools (43%), straining during bowel movements (24%), and pain when passing a motion (23%) as representing constipation. Depending on various factors—the diagnostic definition, demographic factors, and group sampling—constipation surveys show a prevalence of between 1% and >20% in western populations. In studies of the elderly population, up to 20% of community-dwelling individuals and 50% of institutionalized elderly persons reported symptoms. Functional constipation is generally defined as a disorder characterized by persistent difficult or seemingly incomplete defecation, and/or infrequent bowel movements (once every 3 to 4 d or less) in the absence of alarm symptoms or secondary causes. Differences in the medical definition and variations in the reported symptoms make it difficult to provide reliable epidemiologic data. Pathogenesis and Risk Factors Functional constipation can have many different causes, ranging from changes in diet, physical activity, or lifestyle to primary motor dysfunctions due to colonic myopathy or neuropathy. Constipation can also be secondary to evacuation disorder. Evacuation disorder may be associated with a paradoxical anal contraction or involuntary anal spasm, which may be an acquired behavioral disorder of defecation in two thirds of patients (Table 1).TABLE 1: Pathophysiology of Functional ConstipationAlthough physical exercise and a high-fiber diet may be protective, the following factors increase the risk of constipation (the association may not be causative): Aging (but constipation is not a physiological consequence of normal aging) Depression Inactivity Low calorie intake Low income and low education level Number of medications being taken (independent adverse effect profiles) Physical and sexual abuse Female sex—higher incidence of self-reported constipation in women Associated Conditions and Medications (Tables 2 and 3)TABLE 2: Possible Causes and Constipation-associated ConditionsTABLE 3: Medications Associated With ConstipationDIAGNOSIS Constipation is a common condition, and although a minority of patients seek medical care, in the United States alone this accounts for several million physician visits per year, whereas in the United Kingdom more than 13 million general practitioner prescriptions were written for laxatives in 2006. Gastrointestinal specialist help should focus on efficiently applying health care resources by identifying those patients who are likely to benefit from specialized diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Constipation An international panel of experts developed uniform criteria for the diagnosis of constipation—the Rome III criteria (Table 4).TABLE 4: Rome III Criteria for Functional ConstipationPatient Evaluation The medical history and physical examination in constipation patients should focus on identifying possible causative conditions and alarm symptoms. Stool consistency: This is regarded as a better indicator of colon transit than stool frequency (Fig. 1).

Markers are ingested on one occasion and the remaining markers are counted on a plain abdominal radiograph 120 hours later. If >20% of the markers remain in the colon, transit is delayed. Distal accumulation of markers may indicate an evacuation disorder, and in typical cases of slow-transit constipation almost all markers remain and markers are seen in both the right and the left colon. Several companies produce markers, but markers can also be made from a patient-safe radiopaque tube by cutting it into small pieces (2 to 3 mm in length). A suitable number of markers (20 to 24) can be placed in gelatin capsules to facilitate ingestion. Clinical Evaluation Classification of the patient's constipation should be possible on the basis of the medical history and appropriate examination and testing (Table 7).TABLE 7: Constipation Categories Based on Clinical EvaluationCascade Options for Investigating Severe and Treatment-refractory Constipation Cascade: a hierarchical set of diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options for dealing with risk and disease, ranked according to the resources available.

A graded approach to treatment is based on recommending changes in lifestyle and diet, stopping or reducing medications that cause constipation, and administering fiber supplementation or other bulk-forming agents. A gradual increase in fiber (either as standardized supplements or incorporated in the diet) and fluid intake is generally recommended. The second step in the graded approach is to add osmotic laxatives. The best evidence is for the use of polyethylene glycol, but there is also good evidence for lactulose. The new drugs, lubiprostone and linaclotide, act by stimulating ileal secretion and thus increasing fecal water. Prucalopride is also approved in many countries and in Europe. The third step includes stimulant laxatives, enemas, and prokinetic drugs. Stimulant laxatives can be given orally or rectally to stimulate colorectal motor activity. Prokinetic drugs are also meant to increase the propulsive activity of the colon, but in contrast to stimulant laxatives, which should only be taken occasionally; they are designed to be taken daily. Diet and Supplements Dietary modification may consist of a high-fiber diet (25 g of fiber) and fluid supplementation (up to 1.5 to 2.0 L/d) and may improve stool frequency and decrease the need for laxatives. There is no evidence that dietary and lifestyle measures have any effect on constipation in the elderly persons; fiber supplements and simple osmotic laxatives are usually an adequate approach for constipation in these patients. In patients with colonic dilation, fiber supplementation should be avoided. Psyllium supplements and lactulose may be appropriate for the treatment of chronic constipation. Medication Evacuation disorders respond poorly to standard oral laxative programs. If an evacuation disorder plays a considerable role in constipation, biofeedback and pelvic muscle training may be considered. Critical success factors are the patient's level of motivation, the frequency of the training program, and participation of a behavioral psychologist and dietitian. If a dietary approach fails, polyethylene glycol (17 g polyethylene glycol laxative for 14 d) or lubiprostone (24 mg twice daily) can be used to promote bowel function in patients with chronic constipation. Prokinetic agents (eg, the 5-HT4 receptor agonist prucalopride) can be used in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Simple laxative agents, such as milk of magnesia, senna, bisacodyl, and stool softeners are a reasonable choice for treating constipation. Surgery If there is persistent treatment failure in slow-transit constipation, then carefully selected, well-evaluated, and informed patients may benefit from total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. The exceptional indication for colectomy must be established in a specialized and experienced tertiary center. Disappointing results may be seen, with fecal incontinence due to surgery and recurrent constipation, especially in patients with evacuation disorder. Only very few patients benefit from a (reversible) colostomy to treat constipation. Evidence-based Summary (Table 9)TABLE 9: Summary: Evidence Base for the Treatment of Constipation*Cascade Options for Treatment of Chronic Constipation The following cascade is intended for patients with chronic constipation without alarm symptoms and with little or no suspicion of an evacuation disorder.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1974062643", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines", "text": "INTRODUCTION Over the past couple of decades, it has become increasingly clear that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are now the number 1 cause of liver disease in the western countries. The prevalence of NAFLD has doubled during last 20 years, whereas the prevalence of other chronic liver diseases has remained stable or even decreased. More recent data confirm that NAFLD and NASH play an equally important role in the Middle East, Far East, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. NAFLD is a condition defined by excessive fat accumulation in the form of triglycerides (steatosis) in the liver. A subgroup of NAFLD patients displays liver cell injury and inflammation in addition to excessive fat (steatohepatitis). The latter condition, designated NASH, is virtually indistinguishable histologically from alcoholic steatohepatitis. While the simple steatosis of NAFLD does not correlate with increased short-term morbidity or mortality, progression of this condition to that of NASH dramatically increases the risks of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The exact cause of NASH has not been elucidated, and it is almost certainly not the same in every patient. Although it is most closely related to insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, not all patients with these conditions have NAFLD/NASH, and not all patients with NAFLD/NASH suffer from one of these conditions. NASH is a potentially fatal condition, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.Table: No title available.Cascades: A Resource-sensitive Approach A gold-standard approach is feasible for regions and countries in which the full scale of diagnostic tests and medical treatment options are available for the management of NASH. However, such resources are not available throughout much of the world. With their diagnostic and treatment cascades, the World Gastroenterology Organisation guidelines provide a resource-sensitive approach.Table: No title available.EPIDEMIOLOGY NASH is an increasingly common chronic liver disease with worldwide distribution that is closely associated with diabetes and obesity, which have both reached epidemic proportions. It is estimated that there are at least 1.46 billion obese adults worldwide. Approximately 6 million individuals in the USA are estimated to have progressed to NASH and some 600,000 to NASH-related cirrhosis. There are significant cultural and geographic differences in the prevalence of obesity. Whereas in most western countries, the preferred body image, especially in women, is very thin with minimal body fat, which is not necessarily true globally. In many other cultures, obesity is considered desirable and also regarded as a distinct sign of prosperity. In the USA, obesity is particularly epidemic in those from lower socioeconomic groups who rely heavily on diets provided by high-fat, high-calorie fast food outlets (junk food). The opposite is true in many poorer countries, where it is the well-to-do, better-educated population that has the highest prevalence of obesity (Table 1).TABLE 1: Estimated Prevalences of NAFLD and NASHDIAGNOSIS Diagnostic Strategy for NASH NASH represents the most severe histologic form of NAFLD, which is defined by fat accumulation in the liver exceeding 5% of its weight. Uniform criteria for diagnosing and staging NASH are still debated. Insulin resistance is related to obesity and is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In addition, oxidative stress and cytokines are important contributing factors, together resulting in steatosis and progressive liver damage in genetically susceptible individuals. The disease can remain asymptomatic for years, or can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Triggers for considering a diagnosis of NASH and starting testing of liver enzymes are: hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, a positive family history, nonblack ethnicity, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and a sedentary lifestyle (Figs. 1–3).Table: No title available.FIGURE 1: Management algorithm for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Studies with atorvastatin and pravastatin have shown improvement in histology in patients with NASH. NAFLD patients with dyslipidemia should be treated with statins. Patients with underlying liver disease do not seem to have any additional risk of statin toxicity. Serious hepatotoxicity from statins is rare.Table: No title available.Improving Insulin Sensitivity: Weight ReductionTable: No title available. Diet: A weight loss of 5% to 10% should be aimed for, and a 25% decrease in calories from the normal diet (ca. 2500 calories/d) for the patient's age and sex. A moderately calorie-restricted diet with modified macronutrient composition produces better results in comparison with a very low-caloric diet. Attention should be given to the role of a hypocaloric diet and counseling about the type of foods to be consumed—avoiding fructose and trans-fats present in soft drinks and fast foods, and increasing omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in diet. This may be difficult for the patient to adhere to, and many patients regain weight after an initial loss. Exercise: A moderate exercise program 3 to 4 times a week should be encouraged to achieve a heart rate of 60% to 75% of the age-based maximum. The efficacy of dietary and exercise measures should be assessed after a 6-month period; if they have been ineffective, additional therapeutic options such as pharmacologic therapy may then be considered. Weight loss (bariatric) surgery may be beneficial for patients with morbid obesity; again, this should be considered early, as most programs will decline such surgery for patients who are already cirrhotic. Limited studies have reported a dramatic improvement in liver disease, as well as other complications of metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance, following successful bariatric surgery. Drugs targeting insulin resistance, such as thiazolidinediones and metformin, are approved for diabetes therapy but not for NAFLD/NASH, and should be considered experimental (see the reference list below for more information and detailed discussion). Antioxidants and Antifibrotic Agents Antioxidants and antifibrotic agents, such as vitamin E and pentoxifylline, have not been approved for NASH/NAFLD treatment. For all of them, there are limited data and few if any data from double-blind controlled trials. They are all considered experimental (see the reference list below for more information and detailed discussion). Cascades: Options for Therapy See Table 3.TABLE 3: Therapy Cascades for Extensive, Medium, and Limited ResourcesSUMMARY NAFLD and NASH represent a major global public health problem, which is pandemic and affects rich and poor countries alike. There is insufficient evidence to justify screening for NASH/advanced liver disease in the general population. The diagnosis should be sought in all patients who present with risk factors for NASH. Not all patients with risk factors will have NAFLD or NASH, and not all patients with NASH will have standard risk factors. Not every person with fatty liver needs aggressive therapy. Diet and exercise should be instituted for all patients. Liver biopsy should be reserved for those patients who have risk factors for NASH and/or other liver diseases. Patients with NASH or risk factors for NASH should first be treated with diet and exercise. Vitamin E or pentoxifylline may be added in these patients. Experimental therapy should be considered only in appropriate hands and only in patients who fail to achieve a 5% to 10% weight reduction over 6 months to 1 year of successful lifestyle changes. Bariatric surgery should be considered in patients in whom the above approaches fail, and it should be performed before the patient becomes cirrhotic. Liver transplantation is successful in patients who meet the criteria for liver failure; however, NASH may recur after transplantation and is likely to be denied to patients with morbid obesity. NAFLD and NASH are also becoming an increasingly serious problem in pediatric patients, including those under the age of 10. Ultimately, NAFLD and NASH are diagnoses of exclusion and require careful consideration of other diagnoses. Just as the clinician cannot diagnose NASH on the basis of clinical data alone, the pathologist can document the histologic lesions of steatohepatitis, but cannot reliably distinguish those of nonalcoholic origin from those of alcoholic origin.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1974062643", "source": "openalex"}

In Western countries, 20-40% of the adult population experience heartburn, which is the cardinal symptom of GORD, but only some 2% of adults have objective evidence of reflux oesophagitis. The incidence of GORD increases with age, rising dramatically after 40 years of age. There is also wide geographical variation in prevalence. Complications, including oesophageal ulcer and stricture, and Barrett's oesophagus, are found in up to 20% of patients with verified reflux oesophagitis. The signs and symptoms of GORD often wax and wane in intensity, and spontaneous remissions have been reported. In most cases, however, GORD is a chronic condition that returns shortly after discontinuing therapy. Although GORD causes substantial morbidity, the annual mortality rate due to GORD is very low (approximately 1 death per 100,000 patients), and even severe GORD has no apparent effect on longevity, although the quality of life can be significantly impaired. There are data to suggest that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contributes to oesophagitis and stricture formation in patients with GORD. Although these data are not conclusive, it seems prudent, if possible, to avoid the use of NSAIDs in patients with GORD, particularly those with oesophageal stricture.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072166021", "source": "openalex"}

To achieve this, the European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group organized a meeting of specialists and experts from around the world, representatives from National Gastroenterology Societies and general practitioners from Europe to establish updated guidelines on the current management of Helicobacter pylori infection. The meeting took place on 21–22 September 2000. A ‘test and treat’ approach is recommended in adult patients under the age of 45 years (the age cut‐off may vary locally) presenting in primary care with persistent dyspepsia, having excluded those with predominantly gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug users and those with alarm symptoms. Diagnosis of infection should be by urea breath test or stool antigen test. As in the previous guidelines, the eradication of H. pylori is strongly recommended in all patients with peptic ulcer, including those with complications, in those with low‐grade gastric mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, in those with atrophic gastritis and following gastric cancer resection. It is also strongly recommended in patients who are first‐degree relatives of gastric cancer patients and according to patients’ wishes after full consultation. It is advised that H. pylori eradication is considered to be an appropriate option in infected patients with functional dyspepsia, as it leads to long‐term symptom improvement in a subset of patients. There was consensus that the eradication of H. pylori is not associated with the development of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in most cases, and does not exacerbate existing gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. It was agreed that the eradication of H. pylori prior to the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs reduces the incidence of peptic ulcer, but does not enhance the healing of gastric or duodenal ulcer in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. Treatment should be thought of as a package which considers first‐ and second‐line eradication therapies together. First‐line therapy should be with triple therapy using a proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine bismuth citrate, combined with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole. Second‐line therapy should use quadruple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline. Where bismuth is not available, second‐line therapy should be with proton pump inhibitor‐based triple therapy. If second‐line quadruple therapy fails in primary care, patients should be referred to a specialist. Subsequent failures should be handled on a case‐by‐case basis by the specialist. In patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, eradication therapy does not need to be followed by further antisecretory treatment. Successful eradica‐ tion should always be confirmed by urea breath test or an endoscopy‐based test if endoscopy is clinically indicated. Stool antigen test is the alternative if urea breath test is not available.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061938579", "source": "openalex"}

Patients diagnosed with inoperable gastro-oesophageal carcinoma and who had measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein concentrations, at the time of diagnosis, were studied (n=258). Clinical information was obtained from a gastro-oesophageal cancer database and analysis of the case notes. Patients with both an elevated C-reactive protein (>10 mg l−1) and hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g l−1) were allocated a GPS score of 2. Patients in whom only one of these biochemical abnormalities was present were allocated a GPS score of 1, and patients with a normal C-reactive protein and albumin were allocated a score of 0.

NO synthase activity was investigated in samples of tissue from the gastro-oesophageal junction obtained during surgery in eight patients with typical achalasia and six non-achalasic controls who underwent oesophagectomy for reasons other than sphincter dysfunction. The NO synthase activity was determined by the transformation of 14C-L-arginine into 14C-L-citrulline in tissue homogenates. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of the tissues was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide sequence of rat brain NO synthase. Furthermore, the relaxant response to an exogenous NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) was measured in vitro in muscle strips obtained from two patients with achalasia and in two non-achalasic controls. NO synthase activity was detected in each of the samples obtained from six control patients (0.59 +/- 0.21 pmol mg-1 min-1; mean +/- SE). By contrast, none of the samples obtained from the eight patients with achalasia had any detectable NO synthase activity. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of NO synthase in the myenteric plexus of the gastro-oesophageal junction of control patients and its absence in achalasia. SNP relaxed muscle strips precontracted with bethanechol in both control samples and those from patients with achalasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056169163", "source": "openalex"}

The gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor type B agonist, baclofen, is a potent inhibitor of TLOSRs in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of baclofen on TLOSRs and postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux disease. Methods: In 20 patients with reflux disease, oesophageal motility and pH were measured, with patients in the sitting position, for three hours after a 3000 kJ mixed nutrient meal. On separate days at least one week apart, 40 mg oral baclofen or placebo was given 90 minutes before the meal. Results: Baclofen reduced the rate of TLOSRs by 40% from 15 (13.8–18.3) to 9 (5.8–13.3) per three hours (p&lt;0.0002) and increased basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Baclofen also significantly reduced the rate of reflux episodes by 43% from 7.0 (4.0–12.0) to 4.0 (1.5–9) per three hours (median (interquartile range); p&lt;0.02). However, baclofen had no effect on oesophageal acid exposure (baclofen 4.9% (1.7–12.4) <i>v</i> placebo 5.0% (2.7–15.5)). Conclusions: In patients with reflux disease, the GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen significantly inhibits gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes by inhibition of TLOSRs. These findings suggest that GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists may be useful as therapeutic agents for the management of reflux disease.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156522371", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2056304431", "title": "American College of Gastroenterology Monograph on the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Chronic Idiopathic Constipation", "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation ((CIC) also referred to as functional constipation) are two of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. IBS is a global problem, with anywhere from 5 to 15% of the general population experiencing symptoms that would satisfy a definition of IBS (1,2). In a systematic review on the global prevalence of IBS, Lovell and Ford (1) documented a pooled prevalence of 11% with all regions of the world suffering from this disorder at similar rates. Given its prevalence, the frequency of symptoms, and their associated debility for many patients and the fact that IBS typically occurs in younger adulthood, an important period for furthering education, embarking on careers, and/or raising families, the socioeconomic impact of IBS is considerable. These indirect medical costs are frequently compounded by the direct medical costs related to additional medical tests and the use of various medical and nonmedical remedies that may have limited impact. CIC is equally common; in another systematic review, Suares and Ford (3) reported a pooled prevalence of 14%, and also noted that constipation was more common in females, in older subjects, and those of lower socioeconomic status (3). Chronic constipation has also been linked to impaired quality of life (4), most notably among the elderly (5). Neither IBS nor CIC are associated with abnormal radiologic or endoscopic abnormalities, nor are they associated with a reliable biomarker; diagnosis currently rests entirely, therefore, on clinical grounds. Although a number of clinical definitions of both IBS and CIC have been proposed, the criteria developed through the Rome process, currently in its third iteration, have been those most widely employed in clinical trials and, therefore, most relevant to any review of the literature on the management of these disorders. According to Rome III, IBS is defined on the basis of the presence of: Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort at least 3 days/month in the past 3 months associated with two or more of the following: Improvement with defecation Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool These criteria should be fulfilled for the past 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis (6). Rome III defines functional constipation as: the presence of two or more of the following: Straining during at least 25% of defecations Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations Manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor) Fewer than three defecations per week Furthermore, loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives and there are insufficient criteria for IBS. Again, these criteria should be fulfilled for the past 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis (6). In Rome III, IBS is subtyped according to predominant bowel habit as IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed type (IBS-M), and unclassified (IBS-U). The definition of bowel habit type is, in turn, based on the patient's description of stool form by referring to the Bristol Stool Scale (7). The recognition that IBS sufferers segregate into subtypes according to predominant bowel habit, together with research findings suggesting that IBS-C and IBS-D may be pathophysiologically distinct entities (8,9,10), led to the development of therapies specifically directed at each of these subtypes. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that symptoms may not be stable over a lifetime and individuals may exhibit one IBS subtype during a period, and then a different IBS subtype during another period in their lives. However, although there is general awareness of the Rome criteria, they are infrequently employed in the assessment of IBS and CIC in clinical practice (11). To provide more \"clinician friendly\" definitions, as well as to permit inclusion of studies that predated the Rome process, American College of Gastroenterology Task Forces suggested the following definitions in prior systematic reviews: IBS is defined by: abdominal discomfort associated with altered bowel habits (12). Constipation is defined as: a symptom-based disorder defined as unsatisfactory defecation and is characterized by infrequent stools, difficult stool passage, or both. Difficult stool passage includes straining, a sense of difficulty passing stool, incomplete evacuation, hard/lumpy stools, prolonged time to stool, or need for manual maneuvers to pass stool. CIC is defined as the presence of these symptoms for at least 3 months (13). It is important to note that the Rome III criteria state that individuals with chronic constipation do not fulfill criteria for IBS, with pain or discomfort being a major determinant in the latter. In practice, a clear separation between CIC and IBS with constipation may be challenging and studies have shown, not only considerable overlap between these entities (14,15,16), but also a significant tendency for patients to migrate between these diagnoses over time (15). It is appropriate therefore that in this update of prior American College of Gastroenterology monographs on IBS and CIC, these entities be addressed in the same exercise (12,13,17). The goal of this exercise, therefore, was to update the most recent systematic reviews commissioned by the American College of Gastroenterology on IBS from 2009 (17) and CIC from 2005 (13). METHODS We have conducted a series of systematic reviews on the efficacy of therapy in IBS and CIC. There have been several systematic reviews of therapy for IBS and CIC published in the past 5 years (18,19,20,21,22). There have been considerable data published in the intervening time, and hence we have, therefore, updated all these systematic reviews of IBS and CIC and synthesized the data, including the information from new trials, where appropriate. The primary objective of this exercise was to assess the efficacy of available therapies in treating IBS and CIC compared with placebo or no treatment. The secondary objectives included assessing the efficacy of available therapies in treating IBS according to predominant stool pattern reported (IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhea, and mixed IBS), as well as assessing adverse events with therapies for both IBS and CIC. Systematic review methodology We evaluated manuscripts that studied adults (aged >16 years) using any definition of IBS or CIC. For IBS, this included a clinician-defined diagnosis, the Manning criteria (23), the Kruis score (24), or Rome I (25), II (26), or III (6) criteria. For CIC, this included symptoms diagnosed by any of the Rome criteria (6,25,26), as well as a clinician-defined diagnosis. We included only parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active intervention with either placebo or no therapy. Crossover trials were eligible for inclusion, provided extractable data were provided at the end of the first treatment period, before crossover. For IBS, the following treatments were considered: Diet and dietary manipulation Fiber Interventions that modify the microbiota: probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics Antispasmodics Peppermint oil Loperamide Antidepressants Psychological therapies, including hypnotherapy Serotonergic agents Prosecretory agents Polyethylene glycol For CIC, the following were considered: Fiber Osmotic and stimulant laxatives 5-HT4 agonists Prosecretory agents Biofeedback Bile acid transporter inhibitors Probiotics Subjects needed to be followed up for at least 1 week. To be eligible, trials needed to include one or more of the following outcome measures: Global assessment of improvement in IBS or CIC symptoms Improvement in abdominal pain for IBS Global IBS symptom or abdominal pain scores for IBS Mean number of stools per week during therapy for CIC Search strategy for identification of studies MEDLINE (1946 to October 2013), EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947 to October 2013), and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched.

The search was limited to humans. No restrictions were applied with regard to language of publication. A recursive search of the bibliography of relevant articles was also conducted. DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW (United European Gastroenterology Week) abstract books were hand searched between 2000 and 2013. Authors of trial reports that did not give enough detail for adequate data extraction were contacted and asked to contribute full data sets. Experts in the field were contacted for leads on unpublished studies. Trials were assessed for risk of bias according to the methods described in the Cochrane handbook [27] using the following characteristics: method used to generate the randomization schedule, method used to conceal treatment allocation, implementation of masking, completeness of follow-up, and conduct of an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligibility, quality, and outcome data were extracted by the lead reviewer (Alexander Ford) and by a masked second reviewer (Paul Moayyedi) on to specially developed forms. Any discrepancy was resolved by discussion between the two reviewers in order to reach a consensus. Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, where all dropouts were assumed to be treatment failures, wherever trial reporting allowed this. Data synthesis For IBS, whenever possible, any improvement of global IBS symptoms as a binary outcome was taken as the primary outcome measure. If this was not available, improvement in abdominal pain was used. For CIC, any improvement of global CIC symptoms as a binary outcome was taken as the primary outcome measure. The impact of interventions was expressed as a relative risk (RR) of IBS or CIC symptoms not improving, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If there were sufficient data, RRs were combined using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model (28) to give a more conservative estimate of the efficacy of individual IBS therapies. For continuous data, such as global IBS symptom scores or individual IBS symptom scores, a standardized mean difference, with 95% CIs, was calculated. It should be noted that some treatments may be beneficial in IBS or CIC because of the effects on outcomes other than global symptoms or abdominal pain, but this was not evaluated and was outside of the scope of this review. Tests of heterogeneity were reported (29). When the test of heterogeneity was significant (P<0.10 and/or I2>25%), the reasons for this were explored by evaluating differences in study population, study design, or study end points in subgroup analyses. Publication bias or other causes of small study effects were evaluated using tests for funnel plot asymmetry (30), where sufficient studies were identified (31). The number needed to treat (NNT), which is the number of patients who would need to receive active therapy, over and above the control therapy, for one to experience an improvement in symptoms, and the number needed to harm (NNH), which is the number of patients who would need to receive active therapy, over and above the control therapy, for one to experience an adverse event were calculated as the inverse of the risk difference from the meta-analysis and checked using the formula: NNT = 100 / RRR × BR, where BR is baseline risk and RRR is relative risk reduction. Methodology for assessing levels of evidence and grading recommendations We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system for grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation for each medical intervention (32). The system has been widely used in evidence-based guidelines and is endorsed by all major gastrointestinal societies (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org). The quality of the evidence is based on the study design, as well as the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias that exists for the evidence supporting the intervention (33). Quality of evidence is described as high to very low, depending on the extent to which further evidence would change the estimate of treatment effect (Box 1). The grading scheme also classifies recommendations as strong or weak, according to the quality of the evidence, applicability to all patient groups, balance of benefits and risks, patient preferences, and cost. With this graded recommendation, the clinician receives guidance about whether or not recommendations should be applied to most patients, and whether or not recommendations are likely to change in the future after production of new evidence. \"Strong\" recommendations represent a \"recommendation that can apply to most patients in most circumstances and further evidence is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect.\" The summary of the evidence for IBS is presented in Table 1, the reasons for the decision on the quality of that evidence in Table 2, and the reasons for the strength of recommendation in Table 3. Similarly, the summary of the evidence for CIC is presented in Table 4, the reasons for the decision on quality of the evidence in Table 5, and the reasons for the strength of recommendation in Table 6.Box 1.: Interpretation of the grading of the quality of evidenceTable 1: Summary of results of monograph on interventions for IBSTable 2: Reasons for quality of evidence of assessment for IBS data according to GRADE criteriaTable 2: Continued.Table 3: Reasons for strength of recommendation for IBS therapies according to GRADE criteriaTable 4: Summary of results of monograph on interventions for CICTable 5: Reasons for quality of evidence of assessment of data on CIC according to GRADE criteriaTable 6: Reasons for strength of recommendation for treatments of CIC according to GRADE criteriaRESULTS Irritable bowel syndrome 1. Diet and dietary manipulation in IBS (a) Role of diet in IBS: Although food intake is one of the most common precipitants of symptoms in IBS (34), responses to food ingestion and interactions with components of the diet have not typically undergone rigorous evaluation in the context of a blinded trial. Based on their own experiences, IBS sufferers have generated their own theories to explain this phenomenon or seek guidance from other, usually unsupported, dietary remedies. Many IBS patients commonly believe that they have an allergy to certain foods, although true food allergies are uncommon in IBS (35). Thus, although the prevalence of true food allergies in Western societies is between 1 and 3% in adults, surveys of gastrointestinal clinic patients found that 30–50% believed that their symptoms represented food allergy or food intolerance (35,36,37). Most food-related IBS symptoms appear to represent food intolerance, although only 11–27% of patients can accurately identify the presumed offending food when re-challenged in a double-blind manner (38). Based on their own experiences with food, and despite a lack of objective evidence to incriminate a specific food, studies have shown that a majority of IBS patients institute dietary changes (39,40,41), sometimes to an extent that may compromise their nutrition (42). (b) Role of dietary manipulation in IBS:Specialized diets may improve symptoms in individual IBS patients. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: very low. We identified 12 RCTs that evaluated dietary intervention in IBS (43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54). Following exclusions due to nonextractable data (46,48,50,52,53,54), lack of relevant symptom data (45,49,51), and an intervention lasting <1 week (46), three evaluable RCTs involving 230 patients remained (43,44,47). The first of these addressed the impact of gluten in IBS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 34 patients with IBS were randomized to either remain on a gluten-free diet or to receive 16 g/day of gluten on completion of an open gluten-free run-in phase (44). In the gluten group, 68% (13/19) reported that their symptoms were not adequately controlled as compared with 6/15 (40%) in the placebo group. Continuous symptom scores for abdominal pain, bloating, satisfaction with stool consistency, and tiredness were statistically significantly better in those who maintained a gluten-free diet. The second of these studies examined the contribution of food allergy or hypersensitivity as assessed, not by immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies, but by IgG antibodies (43). In a double-blind, parallel-group trial, 150 IBS patients were randomized to either an exclusion diet based on the presence of IgG antibodies to various foods or a sham diet. Participants were followed for 12 weeks and symptoms assessed using a global impact score and the IBS severity score. Compared with 11/66 (17%) in the sham diet group (P=0.14), 28% (18/65) in the exclusion diet intervention arm noted a significant improvement in symptoms. The authors reported marginal statistical significance in those with high adherence to their diet. The third study examined the role of FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). Forty-one IBS patients were randomized to a low-FODMAP diet or their regular (habitual) diet for 4 weeks (47). Of those randomized to the low-FODMAP diet, 68% (13/19) reported adequate control of their symptoms compared with 5/22 (23%) of the habitual diet group (P=0.005). Stool consistency did not differ between groups; stool frequency was less in the low-FODMAP diet group. A significant limitation of this study was the lack of blinding regarding the dietary intervention. Summary: Belatedly perhaps, the role of dietary components in the precipitation of symptoms, or even in the basic pathogenesis of IBS, is now being addressed. To date, two mechanisms, intolerance and hypersensitivity, have been addressed in clinical trials, although it is highly plausible that other mechanisms (e.g., stimulation of gut hormones and interactions with the microbiota) may also be relevant to the effects of food or food components. While recognizing the challenges that any investigation of the role of an individual's diet or of a specific food component in IBS present, the current data provide limited guidance on the role of diet in the management of IBS. Gluten-free and low-FODMAP diets show promise but their precise role(s) in the management of IBS need to be defined. 2. Fiber in IBS Fiber provides overall symptom relief in IBS. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: moderate. Psyllium, but not bran, provides overall symptom relief in IBS. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: moderate. Increased intake of dietary fiber is frequently recommended to improve bowel function for IBS, particularly for constipation-related symptoms. However, insoluble fibers frequently cause bloating and abdominal discomfort. In updating our prior systematic review (18), we identified two additional studies for a total of 14 RCTs (55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69) involving 906 patients. All but five trials did not differentiate IBS by subtype and only two restricted recruitment to IBS-C (58,66). In the largest study to date, 275 patients, of whom 53–58% were IBS-C and 19–29% were IBS-D, were randomized to one of three arms: 10 g of the soluble fiber psyllium, 10 g of the insoluble fiber bran, or 10 g of a placebo once daily for 12 weeks (57). During the first month, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving psyllium, but not bran, reported adequate symptom relief for at least 2 weeks compared with placebo (57% vs. 35% psyllium vs. placebo; RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13–2.26). Bran was more effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% vs. 32%; 1.70, 1.12–2.57). After 3 months of treatment, symptom severity in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points compared with 49 points in the placebo group (P=0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P=0.61 vs. placebo). No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Dropout was most common in the bran group; most commonly because of exacerbation in IBS. Data on overall adverse events were only provided by six trials (57,58,60,64,65,69). These trials evaluated 566 patients, but as numbers of adverse events were so small in 5 of the trials, pooling of data was not carried out. A total of 130 (38.8%) of 335 patients receiving fiber reported adverse events compared with 63 (27.3%) of 231 in the placebo arms. Summary: Although its use in the management of IBS is time honored, the status of fiber, in general, in IBS, is far from straightforward. Insoluble fibers may exacerbate symptoms and provide little relief; soluble fibers and psyllium, in particular, provide relief in IBS. These latter effects appear to transcend expected benefits in terms of relief of constipation. 3. Interventions that modify the microbiota: probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics The suggestion that the gut bacteria could be relevant to IBS first came from the observation that a small, although definite, proportion of individuals who suffer an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis will go on to develop IBS de novo; postinfectious IBS (70). Although bacterial fermentation has been linked to bloating and flatulence and changes in the microbiota have been described in IBS, the contribution of the microbiota to these, or other symptoms in IBS, is unclear. Thus, although both small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (71) and quantitative and qualitative changes in the fecal microbiota (72) have also been linked to IBS (73), the overall contribution of SIBO to IBS remains controversial (74), and findings in relation to the microbiota require confirmation in larger patient populations. Prebiotics, probiotics, and prebiotic–probiotic preparations have been used for decades on an empirical basis by IBS sufferers; they have only recently been subjected to scrutiny in clinical trials. The interpretation of probiotic studies in IBS remains challenging as studies have employed different species, strains, preparations, and doses in various patient populations and often in substandard trials. Although initial studies, employing the lactulose hydrogen breath test, suggested that more than \"three quarters\" of all IBS sufferers had SIBO (75), subsequent studies have, in general, failed to confirm such a high prevalence of SIBO in IBS (73,74). These divergent results may relate to problems inherent to the lactulose breath hydrogen test that may provide an overestimation of the true positive rate (73). Nevertheless, this finding provided a rationale for assessing antibiotics in IBS. Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in IBS-D, and although statistically significant improvements were demonstrated over placebo in global IBS symptoms as well as in bloating, it is important to note that tests for SIBO were not performed in these pivotal trials, leaving the mechanism of action of rifaximin in IBS unclear (76). (a) Prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend prebiotics or synbiotics in IBS. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: very low.

The prevalence, clinical spectrum and health care‐seeking behaviour of subjects with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were studied. Methods : Ethnic Chinese (3605) were invited to participate in a telephone survey using a validated gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results : A total of 2209 subjects (58% female; mean age, 40.3 years) completed the interview. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence rates of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were 29.8%, 8.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms were associated with non‐cardiac chest pain [odds ratio (OR), 2.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7–3.1], dyspepsia (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.5), globus (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.7), acid feeling in the stomach (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 4.5–7.5) and the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.6), but not with dysphagia, bronchitis, asthma, hoarseness and pneumonia. Patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease had a significantly higher anxiety and depression score and required more days off work when compared with subjects without.

In order to assess the validity of this suggestion, we examined the risk of oesophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's and with GORD compared with the general population in a community based cohort study.Cohorts of patients with Barrett's (n = 1677), oesophagitis (n = 6392), and simple reflux (n = 6328), and a reference cohort (n = 13416) were selected from the General Practice Research Database. The last three cohorts were matched to the Barrett's cohort by general practitioner practice, age, and sex. Cox's regression analysis was used to calculate relative risks for oesophageal cancer. Standardised incidence ratio methodology was used to estimate the relative risks for oesophageal adenocarcinoma.A total of 137 oesophageal cancers were identified, of which 94 prevalent cases were excluded. The hazard ratios for oesophageal cancer were 10.6 (5.1-22.0), 2.2 (0.9-5.2), and 1.7 (0.7-4.5) in the Barrett's, oesophagitis, and reflux cohorts compared with the reference cohort, respectively. The corresponding relative risks for oesophageal adenocarcinoma were 29.8 (9.6-106), 4.5 (1.04-19.6), and 3.1 (0.6-14.2).Barrett's oesophagus increases the risk of oesophageal cancer approximately 10 times and oesophageal adenocarcinoma approximately 30 times compared with the general population. There is only a modestly increased risk of oesophageal cancer in patients with reflux who have no record of Barrett's oesophagus. Our findings therefore do not support the suggestion that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease itself predisposes to cancer.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100503989", "source": "openalex"}

The symptom‐based management of GERD in primary care may be further optimised with the use of a questionnaire. Aim To assess the diagnostic validity of the GerdQ questionnaire in patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD . Methods Patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD without alarm features, underwent upper endoscopy, and if normal, pH‐metry. Patients were followed for 4 weeks and GerdQ was completed blinded to the investigator at both visits. Reflux oesophagitis or pathological acid exposure was used as diagnostic references for GERD . The diagnostic accuracy for GERD on symptom response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was assessed. Results Among the 169 patients, a GerdQ cutoff ≥9 gave the best balance with regard to sensitivity, 66% (95% CI: 58–74), and specificity, 64% (95% CI: 41–83), for GERD . The high prevalence of reflux oesophagitis (81%) resulted in a high proportion of true positives, but at the same time a high proportion of false‐negatives. Consequently, GerdQ had a high positive predictive value, 92% (95% CI: 86–97), but a low negative predictive value, 22% (95% CI: 13–34), for GERD . Symptom resolution on PPI therapy had high sensitivity, 76% (95% CI: 66–84), but low specificity, 33% (95% CI: 17–53), for GERD . Conclusions GerdQ is a useful complementary tool for the diagnosis of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in primary care. The implementation of GerdQ could reduce the need for upper endoscopy and improve resource utilisation. Symptom resolution on proton pump inhibitor did not predict gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132709597", "source": "openalex"}

Aim : To determine the natural history of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease presenting in primary care in the UK. Methods : Patients with a first diagnosis of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease during 1996 were identified in the UK General Practice Research Database and compared with age‐ and sex‐matched controls. We investigated the incidence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, potential risk factors and comorbidities, and relative risk for subsequent oesophageal complications and mortality. Results : The incidence of a gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease diagnosis was 4.5 per 1000 person‐years (95% confidence interval: 4.4–4.7). Prior use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, smoking, excess body weight and gastrointestinal and cardiac conditions were associated with an increased risk of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease diagnosis. Subjects with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease had an increased risk of respiratory problems, chest pain and angina in the year after diagnosis, and had a relative risk of 11.5 (95% confidence interval: 5.9–22.3) of being diagnosed with an oesophageal complication.

Early detection of cholestatic jaundice by the primary care physician and timely, accurate diagnosis by the pediatric gastroenterologist are important for successful treatment and a favorable prognosis. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in the infant. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee, consisting of a primary care pediatrician, a clinical epidemiologist (who also practices primary care pediatrics), and five pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature integrated with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through the Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee examined the value of diagnostic tests commonly used for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice and how those interventions can be applied to clinical situations in the infant. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, indications for consultation by a pediatric gastroenterologist, and recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee recommends that any infant noted to be jaundiced at 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin. However, breast-fed infants who can be reliably monitored and who have an otherwise normal history (no dark urine or light stools) and physical examination may be asked to return at 3 weeks of age and, if jaundice persists, have measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin at that time. This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition on the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also endorsed these recommendations. These recommendations are a general guideline and are not intended as a substitute for clinical judgment or as a protocol for the care of all patients with this problem.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994271325", "source": "openalex"}

One suggestion is that gastric juice is aspirated into the tracheal and upper airways but detection of these events is difficult and involves radioisotopic studies. A new method of making direct measurements of tracheal and oesophageal pH over a 24 hour period is described, together with its application to patients with asthma. METHODS--The technique involves insertion of simultaneous tracheal and oesophageal pH probes under general anaesthesia. Continuous monitoring of pH over a 24 hour period is possible, permitting comparison with peak flow readings during wakefulness and at night should the patient be disturbed. Representative data from four patients with asthma (mean FEV1 62% predicted) and symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, together with data from three non-asthmatics, is presented. RESULTS--Thirty seven episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux lasting more than five minutes were recorded. Of these, five were closely followed by a fall in tracheal pH from a mean (SE) of 7.1 (0.2) to 4.1 (0.4) and a fall in peak expiratory flow (PEFR) of 84 (16) l/min. When gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred without tracheal aspiration the fall in PEFR was 8 (4) l/min. CONCLUSIONS--This new technique was well tolerated and allowed quantitation of the number, duration, and timing of episodes of tracheal micro-aspiration. Unlike acid reflux without aspiration, these events appear to be related to significant acute changes in lung function in asthmatic patients. Further studies with this new method may elucidate the role of gastro-oesophageal reflux in asthma.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963799705", "source": "openalex"}

It is a widely employed approach to retain the dosage form in the stomach for an extended period of time and release the drug slowly that can address many challenges associated with conventional oral delivery, including poor bioavailability. Different innovative approaches like magnetic field assisted gastro-retention, plug type swelling system, muco-adhesion technique, floating system with or without effervescence are being applied to fabricate GRDDS. Apart from in vitro characterization, successful GRDDS development demands well designed in vivo study to establish enhanced gastro-retention and prolonged drug release. Gama scintigraphy and MRI are popular techniques to evaluate in vivo gastric residence time. However, checking of their overall in-vivo efficacy still remains a major challenge for this kind of dosage form, especially in small animals like mice or rat. Reported in vivo studies with beagle dogs, rabbits, and human subjects are only a handful in spite of a large number of encouraging in vitro results. In spite of the many advantages, high subject variations in gastrointestinal physiological condition, effect of food, and variable rate of gastric emptying time are the challenges that limit the number of available GRDDS in the market.

It reduces lower oesophageal sphincter length and pressure, and impairs the augmenting effects of the diaphragmatic crus. It is associated with decreased oesophageal peristalsis, increases the cross‐sectional area of the oesophago‐gastric junction, and acts as a reservoir allowing reflux from the hernia sac into the oesophagus during swallowing. The overall effect is that of increased oesophageal acid exposure. The presence of a hiatus hernia is associated with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux, increased prevalence and severity of reflux oesophagitis, as well as Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of treatment with proton pump inhibitors is reduced. Our view on the significance of the sliding hiatus hernia in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease has changed enormously in recent decades. It was initially thought that a hiatus hernia had to be present for reflux oesophagitis to occur. Subsequently, the hiatus hernia was considered an incidental finding of little consequence. We now appreciate that the hiatus hernia has major patho‐physiological effects favouring gastro‐oesophageal reflux and hence contributing to oesophageal mucosal injury, particularly in patients with severe gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2004830815", "source": "openalex"}

These functional challenges partly explain the relatively high morbidity and mortality of neonates. Preterm birth interrupts prenatal organ maturation, including that of the GIT, and increases disease risk. Exemplary is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) which is associated closely with GIT immaturity, enteral feeding and bacterial colonization. Infants with NEC may require resection of the necrotic parts of the intestine, leading to short bowel syndrome (SBS), characterised by reduced digestive capacity, fluid loss, and dependency on parenteral nutrition. This review presents the preterm pig as a translational model in pediatric gastroenterology that has provided new insights into important pediatric diseases such as NEC and SBS. We describe protocols for delivery, care, and handling of preterm pigs, and show how the immature GIT responds to delivery method and different nutritional and therapeutic interventions. The preterm pig may also provide a sensitive model for postnatal adaptation of weak term piglets showing high mortality. Attributes of the preterm pig model include close similarities with preterm infants in body size, organ development, and many clinical features, thereby providing a translational advantage relative to rodent models of GIT immaturity. On the other hand, the need for a sow surgical facility, a piglet intensive care unit, and clinically trained personnel may limit widespread use of preterm pigs. Studies on organ adaptation in preterm pigs help to identify the physiological basis of neonatal survival for hypersensitive newborns and aid in defining the optimal diet and rearing conditions during the critical neonatal period.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014156095", "source": "openalex"}

Forms returned between June 1 and August 31, 1995, were tabulated and analyzed for differences between the bleeding group and procedure-matched controls.A total of 1235 forms were returned by respondents, 60% of whom were in private practice. Patient demographics indicated that bleeding patients were significantly older, more likely to be male, and more likely to use alcohol, tobacco, and prescription or over-the-counter aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulants than were controls. Upper GI bleeding accounted for 76% of bleeding events, with duodenal and gastric ulcers being the source in more than 50% of the upper GI bleeders. Diverticula was the most common bleeding source identified in lower GI bleeders. In the bleeding group, 78.8% were anemic, with 60.9% having hemoglobin of <10 g/dl; 31% presented with orthostatic changes in blood pressure or shock. Most bleeding subjects, regardless of source, were hospitalized, 58.2% received blood transfusions, and 45.5% received endoscopic therapy. Rebleeding (11.2%), need for surgery (7.1%), and fatalities (2.1%) were uncommon. Over-the-counter aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used significantly more often in the bleeding population (47.6%) than in controls (19.4%).The success of the GI Bleeding Registry supports the feasibility of surveying ACG members about common clinical problems. Data suggest that ACG members manage sick patients with severe gastrointestinal bleeding who require hospitalization, transfusions, and endoscopic treatment.

Marked changes in the contraction pattern were observed in early manometric studies. The orocecal transit time, particularly small intestinal transit, has generally been reported to be prolonged, which has been demonstrated in multiple investigations to be related to the severity of the liver disease (e.g., Child-Pugh class), the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) as well as a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Bacteriologically proven SIBO in proximal jejunal aspiration has been reported to be present in up to 59% of cirrhotic patients and is associated with systemic endotoxemia. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that delayed small bowel transit in liver cirrhosis may lead to SIBO, which could contribute to the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea. In addition to autonomic neuropathy, metabolic derangements and diabetic state, SIBO itself may delay intestinal transit in cirrhotic patients. Several studies, both from the West and the East, have shown that the gut microbiota is altered in cirrhotic patients and particularly those with HE. Further, a quantitative change in &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides/Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; ratio, with a prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;) and reduction in specific commensals (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt;), has been described. Structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosa that contribute to increases in intestinal permeability for bacteria and their products have been observed in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is considered as an important pathogenetic factor for several complications. The mechanism of intestinal barrier dysfunction in cirrhosis is multifactorial, including alcohol, portal hypertension (vascular congestion and dysregulation), endotoxemia, SIBO, local inflammation and, most likely, immunological factors and medications. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This review summarizes major achievements regarding intestinal dysfunction in cirrhosis for future gastroenterology research. The question of whether this intestinal barrier dysfunction is accompanied and/or at least partly caused by structural and functional changes in the epithelial tight junction proteins is as yet unsolved.

Subjects In all, 10 537 subjects, aged 20–59 years, were recruited from seven general practices. Subjects provided data on frequency and severity of dyspeptic symptoms and anthropometric measurements were taken. Main outcome measure Relationship between overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m2 and ≤30 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and frequency and severity of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Results Body mass index was strongly positively related to the frequency of symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of heartburn and acid regurgitation occurring at least once a week in overweight participants compared with those of normal weight were 1.82 (95% CI: 1.33–2.50) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.13–1.99) respectively.

Host genetic polymorphisms that lead to high-level pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to infection increase cancer risk. Pathogenesis is dependent upon inflammation, a Th-1 acquired immune response and hormonal changes including hypergastrinaemia. Antral-predominant inflammation leads to increased acid production from the uninflamed corpus and predisposes to duodenal ulceration; corpus-predominant gastritis leads to hypochlorhydria and predisposes to gastric ulceration and adenocarcinoma.

The normal non-anemic dog absorbs little iron but chronic anemia due to blood loss brings about considerable absorption-perhaps 5 to 15 times normal. In general the same differences are observed in man (1). Sudden change from normal to severe anemia within 24 hours does not significantly increase iron absorption. As the days pass new hemoglobin is formed. The body iron stores are depleted and within 7 days iron absorption is active, even when the red cell hematocrit is rising. Anoxemia of 50 per cent normal oxygen concentration for 48 hours does not significantly enhance iron absorption. In this respect it resembles acute anemia. Ordinary doses of iron given 1 to 6 hours before radio-iron will cause some \"mucosa block\"-that is an intake of radio-iron less than anticipated. Many variables which modify peristalsis come into this reaction. Iron given by vein some days before the dose of radio-iron does not appear to inhibit iron absorption. Plasma radio-iron absorption curves vary greatly. The curves may show sharp peaks in 1 to 2 hours when the iron is given in an empty stomach but after 6 hours when the radio-iron is given with food. Duration time of curves also varies widely, the plasma iron returning to normal in 6 to 12 hours. Gastric, duodenal, or jejunal pouches all show very active absorption of iron. The plasma concentration peak may reach a maximum before the solution of iron is removed from the gastric pouch-another example of \"mucosa block.\" Absorption and distribution of radio-iron in the body of growing pups give very suggestive experimental data. The spleen, heart, upper gastro-intestinal tract, marrow, and pancreas show more radio-iron than was expected. The term \"physiological saturation\" with iron may be applied to the gastro-intestinal mucosal epithelium and explain one phase of acceptance or refusal of ingested iron. Desaturation is a matter of days not hours, whereas saturation may take place within 1 to 2 hours. We believe this change is a part of the complex protein metabolism of the cell.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1971958166", "source": "openalex"}

Wistar male rats, 120 in all, each weighing approximately 250 g, were used. Three experimental procedures were performed to produce gastro-duodeno-esophageal reflux, duodeno-esophageal reflux and gastro-esophageal reflux, for comparison with 2 control procedures, Roux-en-Y reconstruction and a sham operation. The animals were fed a standard diet and were examined 50 weeks after surgery.

CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination.

Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer—in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every 3 years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM.

Apart from the physical discomfort and the economic burden, GERD may increase morbidity and mortality through its association with oesophageal carcinoma. The pathophysiology of GERD differs between obese and lean subjects. First, obese subjects are more sensitive to the presence of acid in the oesophagus. Second, hiatal hernia, capable of promoting GERD by several mechanisms, is more prevalent among the obese. Third, obese subjects have increased intra‐abdominal pressure that displaces the lower oesophageal sphincter and increases the gastro‐oesophageal gradient. Finally, vagal abnormalities associated with obesity may cause a higher output of bile and pancreatic enzymes, which makes the refluxate more toxic to the oesophageal mucosa. The altered body composition associated with obesity affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. There are no data regarding the efficacy of any of the drugs used for GERD treatment. The dosages of cimetidine and ranitidine should be calculated according to the patient’s ideal body weight, not their actual weight. Of the operative procedures used for weight loss, Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass was found to be most effective for GERD, while gastric banding was associated with a high prevalence of reflux. This review outlines the pathophysiology and the treatment of GERD in obesity with emphasis on the therapeutic considerations in this population of patients.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143090957", "source": "openalex"}

Stage and additional organ resection predicted surgical (technical) complications. <b>Conclusions</b> Many patients undergoing surgery for gastro-oesophageal cancer have major comorbid disease, which strongly influences their risk of postoperative death. Technical complications do not seem to be influenced by preoperative factors but reflect the extent of surgery and perhaps surgical judgment. Detailed prospective multicentre cooperative audit, with appropriate risk adjustment, is fundamental in the evaluation of cancer care and must be properly resourced.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099972879", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2922240680", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines", "text": "This is the second WGO guideline published to complement World Digestive Health Day themes. WGO guidelines are intended to highlight appropriate, context-sensitive and resource-sensitive management options for all geographical regions, regardless of whether they are considered to be “developing,” “semi-developed,” or “developed.” There is a concern that guidelines from developed countries, by emphasizing high-tech investigations and Barrett esophagus (BE) surveillance, for example, may divert research and clinical resources from more urgent problems in developing and semideveloped countries. However, one could argue that there are similar problems in developed countries and that an overemphasis on complications or “proposed GERD associations” (as in the Montreal Consensus1) is leading to inappropriate investigations and resource utilization even in developed regions. It is also important to emphasize to health care insurers and funding bodies that appropriate, effective therapy is both therapeutic and diagnostic and that conducting mandatory investigations [eg, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to permit proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is not patient-centered and, more importantly, is likely not to be cost-effective. WGO Cascades are thus context-sensitive, and the context is not necessarily defined solely by resource availability. Neither the epidemiology of the condition, nor the availability of resources for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is sufficiently uniform throughout the world to support the provision of a single, gold-standard approach. WGO Cascades: a hierarchical set of diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options for dealing with risk and disease, ranked by the resources available. GERD is now widely prevalent around the world (Table 1), with clear evidence of increasing prevalence in many developing countries. Prevalence estimates show considerable geographic variation, but it is only in East Asia that they are currently consistently lower than 10%.2 The high prevalence of GERD, and hence of troublesome symptoms, has significant societal consequences, impacting adversely on work productivity3 and many other quality-of-life aspects for individual patients.4,5TABLE 1: GERD Symptoms: Range of IncidencePractice recommendations should be sensitive to context, with the goal of optimizing care in relation to local resources and the availability of health care support systems. The expression of the disease is considered to be similar across regions, with heartburn and regurgitation as the main symptoms. For initial management, the patient may purchase over-the-counter (OTC) medication for heartburn relief or seek further advice from a pharmacist. When patients perceive that their symptoms are more troublesome, they may seek a doctor’s advice; depending on the patient’s circumstances and the structure of the local health care system, patients may seek advice at the primary care level or they may consult a gastroenterology specialist or surgeon, directly or by referral. The WGO Cascade approach aims to optimize the use of available health care resources for individual patients, based on their location and access to various health care providers. CLINICAL FEATURES Predisposing and Risk Factors GERD is a sensorimotor disorder associated with impairment of the normal antireflux mechanisms (eg, lower esophageal sphincter function, phrenicoesophageal ligament), with changes in normal physiology (eg, impaired esophageal peristalsis, increased intragastric pressure, increased abdominothoracic pressure gradient) or, very rarely, excess gastric acid secretion (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Eating and Lifestyle An increase in GERD symptoms occurs in individuals who gain weight.6 A high body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk of GERD.7 High dietary fat intake is linked to a higher risk of GERD and erosive esophagitis (EE).8 Carbonated drinks are a risk factor for heartburn during sleep in patients with GERD.9 The role of coffee as a risk factor for GERD is unclear; coffee may increase heartburn in some GERD patients,10 but the mechanism is unknown and it may be due to caffeine, rather than coffee per se. Coffee is not a dominant risk factor. The role of alcohol consumption as a risk factor for GERD is unclear. Excessive, long-term use may be associated with progression to esophageal malignancy, but this may be independent of an effect of alcohol on GERD.11,12 The role of smoking as a risk factor for GERD is unclear, although like alcohol, it is associated with an increased risk of malignancy.13,14 Medication—Certain Medications May Affect GERD See the Patient history and physical examination section. The treatment of comorbidities (eg, with calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may negatively affect GERD and its treatment.15 Some medications (eg, potassium supplements, tetracycline, bisphosphonates) may cause upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract injury and exacerbate reflux-like symptoms or reflux-induced injury. Pregnancy Heartburn during pregnancy usually does not differ from the classic presentation in the adult population, but it worsens as pregnancy advances. Regurgitation occurs with approximately the same frequency as heartburn, and GERD in the first trimester is associated with a number of altered physiological responses.16,17 Factors that increase the risk of heartburn18 are: heartburn before pregnancy, parity, and duration of pregnancy. Maternal age is inversely correlated with the occurrence of pregnancy-related heartburn.19 Symptomatology GERD has a wide spectrum of clinical symptom-based and injury-based presentations, which may manifest either separately or in combination. Symptom evaluation is key to the diagnosis of GERD, particularly in the evaluation of the effectiveness of therapy. Heartburn and regurgitation are the most common symptoms, but atypical symptoms of GERD may occur, with or without the common symptoms. Atypical symptoms may include epigastric pain20 or chest pain,1,21 which may mimic ischemic cardiac pain, as well as cough and other respiratory symptoms that may mimic asthma or other respiratory or laryngeal disorders. Dysphagia may also occur. A minority of GERD patients have multiple unexplained symptoms, which may be associated with psychological distress22 (Table 2).TABLE 2: GERD Symptoms23,24Natural History Most cases of GERD are mild and are not associated with a significant increase in morbidity or mortality in comparison with the general population. In most GERD patients, the severity of the condition remains stable or improves over a 5-year observation period during current routine clinical care.26 There is a relationship between GERD and obesity: a higher BMI or larger waist circumference and weight gain are associated with the presence of symptoms and complications of GERD, including BE.27 Complicated GERD is characterized by stricture, BE, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The Montreal consensus includes EE as a complication of GERD (recognizing that the definition of “mucosal breaks” used in the Los Angeles classification includes esophageal ulceration in the range of reflux esophagitis).28 Nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) may progress to EE in approximately 10% of GERD patients,29 and EE may therefore be considered as a manifestation of more severe reflux disease. EE is associated with BE and is a major risk factor for BE. In comparison with patients who were free of GERD at follow-up, those with EE had a 5-fold increased risk of BE after 5 years, in a cohort of the general population in Sweden.30 Globally, BE is rare in patients with GERD. It is more common in western populations. It is not known when BE develops relative to the onset of GERD; however, it appears to be more prevalent in older individuals and is strongly associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.31 There is a well-documented association between BMI and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia, although the risk of malignancy in a given individual with GERD is very low.32 Alarm Features Most alarm features are not specific for GERD; many are associated with alternative diagnoses that are unrelated to GERD. In most countries, many of these features relate to gastric cancer, complicated ulcer disease, or other serious illnesses. Dysphagia.33 Odynophagia (painful swallowing). Recurrent bronchial symptoms, aspiration pneumonia. Dysphonia. Recurrent or persistent cough. GI tract bleeding. Frequent nausea and/or vomiting. Persistent pain. Iron-deficiency anemia. Progressive unintentional weight loss. Lymphadenopathy. Epigastric mass. New-onset atypical symptoms at age 45 to 55 years (a lower age threshold may be appropriate, depending on local recommendations). Family history of either esophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma.34 The WGO Global Guideline on common GI symptoms may also be consulted: http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines/common-gi-symptoms and http://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2014/08000/Coping_With_Common_Gastrointestinal_Symptoms_in.4.aspx. DIAGNOSIS Diagnostic Considerations The presence of heartburn and/or regurgitation symptoms 2 or more times a week is suggestive of GERD.35 Clinical, endoscopic, and pH-metric criteria provide a comprehensive characterization of the disease, although investigations are usually not required to establish a diagnosis of GERD—with the caveat that the pretest probability of GERD varies markedly between geographical regions. The initial evaluation should document the presence, severity, and frequency of heartburn, regurgitation (acid or otherwise), and alarm features; atypical esophageal, pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, and oral symptoms should also be sought. It may be helpful to evaluate precipitating factors such as eating, diet (fat), activity (stooping), and recumbence; and relieving factors (bicarbonate, antacids, milk, OTC medications). At this point, it is important to rule out other GI diagnoses, particularly upper GI cancer and ulcer disease, especially in areas in which these are more prevalent. It is also important to consider other, non-GI diagnoses, especially ischemic heart disease. Diagnostic questionnaire tools for GERD (reflux disease questionnaires, RDQs) have been developed for epidemiological studies. However, RDQs did not perform particularly well in the Diamond study.36 In fact, diagnosis by a physician such as the family practitioner or GI specialist showed better sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of GERD than did the RDQ. Questionnaires are generally difficult to use in clinical practice. A careful history is the basis for symptomatic diagnosis, with EGD being reserved for identifying or excluding significant structural lesions in selected cases. A region-based assessment of the local “pretest probability” may provide some guidance with regard to the choices and sequence of diagnostic tests needed, given the relatively poor predictive value of most symptoms. PPI Treatment as an Aid to Diagnosis “PPI trial.” It is no longer recommended to administer an empirical short-term (1 to 2 week) course of high-dose PPI treatment to determine whether or not the patient’s symptoms are acid related,36 since this is neither sensitive nor specific. Nonetheless, this is commonly done in practice. A formal course of PPI therapy, of adequate duration (usually 8 weeks) is required to assess the treatment response in GERD patients. Weakly acidic reflux episodes may be a substantial proportion of all reflux episodes. If this is the case, such patients may not respond well to PPI therapy (20% to 40% of GERD patients may not respond to PPI treatment).20 In addition, genuinely alkaline reflux may comprise up to 5% of all reflux episodes. In a subset of PPI nonresponders, reflux-like symptoms may be due to functional heartburn, rather than GERD.20 Alternative diagnoses, including peptic ulcer disease, upper GI malignancy, functional dyspepsia, eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia of the cardia, and cardiovascular disease should also be considered. In patients with cases that are refractory to PPI treatment, ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH/impedance monitoring, with the patient off PPI therapy, may be considered to help characterize symptoms.37 If there has been complete failure to respond to PPI treatment, the PPI should be stopped at least 1 week before 24-hour pH monitoring is performed (rescue antacid may be allowed when necessary), to assess for acid reflux. If the refractory reflux symptoms have responded partially, 24-hour pH monitoring (with or without esophageal impedance monitoring) should be performed with PPI administration being continued, to assess for acid reflux that is persistent despite treatment. Occasionally, 24-hour pH monitoring with esophageal impedance monitoring may be required, with the patient both on and off PPI therapy.38 Helicobacter pylori Infection39 In many countries with a high prevalence of H. pylori infection, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer continue to be more common than GERD and cause much higher morbidity and mortality.40 In this setting, any approach to the diagnosis and management of upper gut symptoms must include an assessment of the risks of infection with H. pylori and an awareness of the overlap among, and difficulty of discriminating between, symptoms of GERD, peptic ulcer disease, and functional symptoms—with a decision regarding the relative merits of a test-and-treat approach in comparison with EGD to test for H. pylori and related diseases before empirical antireflux therapy. Although epidemiological studies show a negative association between the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the presence and severity of GERD, this is not proof of causation. H. pylori infection should be sought and eradication therapy given when indicated in accordance with international, national, or local guidelines.41 Although there may be an inverse correlation between H. pylori infection and GERD prevalence and severity, this may well reflect differing effects of a separate, distinct factor or factors on the 2 conditions, rather than a causal relationship between H. pylori and GERD. Physiological studies using pH monitoring have shown that abnormal esophageal acid exposure, which is the hallmark of esophageal reflux, is not influenced by the presence or absence of H. pylori infection. In most patients, H. pylori status has no effect on symptom severity, symptom recurrence, or treatment efficacy in GERD. H. pylori eradication does not exacerbate preexisting GERD or affect treatment efficacy.42 Indeed, in patients with H. pylori-positive uninvestigated dyspepsia, eradication therapy is associated with a lower prevalence of reflux-like symptoms (36%) than control therapy (49%).43 A subgroup of patients infected with more proinflammatory strains of H. pylori (virulence factors vacA and cagA) may be less likely to have severe esophagitis or BE. This may be because infection in these patients more often causes severe corpus gastritis with atrophy, resulting in reduced acid output. However, these patients are at much greater risk of developing gastric cancer. Eradication therapy in these patients has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric malignancy.41 PPIs and H. pylori PPIs are associated with a worsening of the histologic grade of gastritis in H. pylori-infected patients, accompanied by an increased prevalence of gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia44 that occurs earlier, as well as more frequently, than in H. pylori-infected patients who do not take PPIs. As gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia are known to be the major risk factors for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma, most expert guidelines recommend testing and treating for H. pylori before long-term PPI therapy, particularly in younger patients. Endoscopy EGD is usually performed for new-onset upper GI symptoms, almost irrespective of age, in regions where it is available and affordable and where both the frequency of ulcer disease and the concern about malignancy are high, as in most of Asia.45 The Cascades given below address the limited availability of endoscopy in less well-resourced areas by suggesting the use of empiric H. pylori eradication therapy as a first-line strategy. If EGD is performed in regions where the prevalence of GERD is low, the majority of GERD patients will have NERD; in these circumstances, the sensitivity of EGD for the diagnosis of GERD will be low and the main outcome will therefore be the exclusion of other upper GI diagnoses. Endoscopy is particularly recommended for patients with alarm features suggestive of GERD with complications or of other significant upper GI disease such as dysphagia, bleeding, odynophagia, or weight loss. Patients with dysphagia should undergo investigation for a potential complication or for an underlying motility disorder, achalasia, stricture, ring, eosinophilic esophagitis, or malignancy.25 In several Asian countries, the preference for EGD is driven by the risk of malignancy at an early age and by the availability of “affordable, direct-access” endoscopy—an “endoscopy first” approach. Additional investigations other than EGD are rarely needed; furthermore, they have variable accuracy and are often unavailable. Patient History and Physical Examination The goals of patient evaluation include the assessment of symptoms and risk factors for the diagnosis of GERD and the prediction of long-term sequelae. In this regard, it is important to consider the regional epidemiology of upper GI disease and the pretest probability of GERD relative to other conditions. In Asia, for instance, BE is uncommon and it is not therefore an important risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is itself uncommon. The prevalence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer are the greater drivers of endoscopy in Asia where, unlike in the west, esophageal adenocarcinoma is less common. Personal and Family History Features The following features may be helpful in making a diagnosis and assessing the severity of GERD: Predisposing factors and risk factors, including family history. Duration of symptoms. Daytime symptoms, including time of day and relationship to meals. Nocturnal symptoms, including impact on sleep and the effects of a recumbent position and large, late evening meals. Treatments and remedies tried, including symptomatic response to therapy; symptom improvement with acid-lowering medications including antacids supports a diagnosis of GERD. Periodic dysphagia or food bolus impaction may suggest reflux-related esophageal injury, stricture or malignancy, as well as eosinophilic esophagitis or esophageal dysmotility.46 Drug History The patient should be asked about any medications that may contribute to upper gut symptoms (not necessarily GERD): Aspirin/NSAIDs, iron, potassium, quinidine, tetracycline, bisphosphonates. Zidovudine, anticholinergic agents, α-adrenergic antagonists, barbiturates. β2-adrenergic agonists, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines, dopamine. Estrogens, narcotic analgesics, nitrates, progesterone, prostaglandins, theophylline. Tricyclic antidepressants, chemotherapy. Dietary History In some patients, bloating or constipation may be associated with an increased risk of GERD or gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (GERS).47 Several studies suggest that stopping smoking and some physical measures, as well as modification of meal size and timing, can be beneficial, but there is limited evidence for the avoidance of alcohol and certain dietary ingredients including carbonated drinks, caffeine, fat, spicy foods, chocolate, and mint.48 In those who are overweight, weight loss may be associated with improvement in GERD or GERS.49 Fermentable carbohydrates may increase the propensity for reflux.50 Physical Evaluation There are usually no physical signs of GERD. Waist circumference, weight, and BMI are relevant to risk. Peripheral stigmata of scleroderma may, rarely, be present. Evaluation and inspection to exclude other medical problems such as asthma, cardiac disease, and cancer. Diagnostic Tests for GERD A presumptive diagnosis of GERD can be established in the setting of typical symptoms: heartburn and regurgitation. In pregnancy, GERD can be reliably diagnosed on the basis of symptoms alone. If the dominant or most troublesome symptoms are atypical for GERD, other diagnoses should be considered, including H. pylori-related diseases and NSAID-related disease. In regions with a high prevalence of H. pylori infection, an initial H. pylori test-and-treat strategy, or endoscopy if available, should be considered. Radiologic examinations are seldom required. Esophageal pH or pH-impedance monitoring and esophageal manometry can be performed safely, but are seldom required except to assess structural disorders (eg, hiatal hernia) in patients with dysphagia symptoms. Intractable reflux symptoms or GERD complications can be evaluated safely using EGD16,17 (Table 3).TABLE 3: Diagnostic Options for GERDDifferential Diagnosis Peptic ulcer disease. Upper gut malignancy. Functional heartburn—differentiate NERD and functional heartburn on the basis of a clinical response to therapeutic acid suppression, pH monitoring, or impedance pH monitoring. Schatzki ring, stricture—esophageal web. Achalasia of the cardia. Esophageal body motility disorders—scleroderma; diffuse esophageal spasm. Eosinophilic esophagitis. Infection—Candida, herpes simplex, etc. “Pill esophagitis.” Cardiac disease—ischemic heart disease, pericardial disease. Esophageal diverticulum. Other chest pathology. Cascades for the Diagnosis of GERD For EGD, perform esophageal biopsy in abundantly resourced regions or biopsy for selected patients in regions with “medium resources” if features suggest eosinophilic esophagitis. For screening EGD, consider this only if there is a high prevalence of BE in the local population and if there are abundant resources. For most purposes, EGD will not alter the management, in the absence of alarm features or access to antireflux surgery. There is no role for upper GI series in the investigation of routine upper GI symptoms (uninvestigated dyspepsia) (Table 4). TABLE 4: Cascades for the Diagnosis of GERDMANAGEMENT Management Principles General Principles Although the severity and frequency of symptoms vary greatly between GERD patients, occasional reflux symptoms (GERS) do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of GERD and are managed with low-level intermittent treatments and lifestyle adjustments, as required. More frequent or severe symptoms interfere significantly with patients’ quality of life and warrant therapy sufficient to normalize their quality of life. Generally, the management of GERD follows a stepwise approach, both with respect to the treatments and to the health care professionals who guide or provide therapy. Core Principles The core principles of GERD management are lifestyle interventions and reduction of esophageal luminal acid either by local acid neutralization or by suppression of gastric acid secretion using medical treatment; or, rarely, antireflux surgery. The primary goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, improve the patient’s health-related quality of life, heal esophagitis, prevent symptom recurrence, and prevent or treat GERD-associated complications in the most cost-effective manner. Stepwise Therapy Infrequent heartburn occurring less than twice per week will probably respond to self-care with an antacid or alginate-antacid, taken once a week or less often. These medications are very unlikely to have any deleterious effects. Alginate-antacid combinations are useful and are superior to antacids alone.53 Particularly in this group of patients, avoidance of foods or events that trigger symptoms and avoidance of large meals eaten late at night may be helpful. Weight reduction in those who are overweight may also reduce the frequency of symptoms. Patients who have more frequent symptoms should be assessed for longer-term therapy. A diagnosis of GERD—that is, troublesome symptoms 2 or more times per week—warrants empirical therapy with an acid inhibitor [PPI or, if unavailable, histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA)]. Antacids/alginates may also be used if PPIs or H2RAs are unavailable, or for prompt symptom relief in patients taking a PPI. If OTC or lifestyle measures fail, patients will often present initially to a pharmacist or primary care physician. The definition of treatment failure depends to a large extent on the treatment being tried. In contrast, treatment may fail because the patient does not actually have GERD; in contrast, it may be that the treatment is inadequate to address the severity of the GERD. In the latter case, there may be a partial response to treatment, and subsequent management will be guided by the availability and optimization of more potent therapies. These latter steps may require referral to secondary care if initial management fails.54 Approaches to reflux should focus on best clinical practice, with treatment of the symptoms being the priority. It is wise to choose the lowest effective dose of prescription drugs. For patients with mild symptoms, and some patients with NERD, self-directed, intermittent PPI therapy (“on-demand therapy”) is a useful management strategy in many cases. At the primary care level, PPIs or a combination of alginate-antacid and acid-suppressive therapy can be prescribed at the physician’s discretion for combination therapy, which may be more beneficial than acid-suppressive therapy alone.54 For better symptom control, patients should be informed about how to use PPI treatment properly; optimal therapy may be defined as taking the PPI 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast, and in the case of twice-daily dosing, 30 to 60 minutes before the last meal of the day as well.55 Patients in whom full-dose PPI treatment fails, with or without adjuvant therapies, may benefit from a trial of step-up therapy to a twice-daily PPI. Twice-daily PPI therapy may not work for a proportion of patients, either because the symptoms are not due to acid reflux—when an alternative diagnosis should be considered—or because the degree of acid suppression achieved is insufficient to control the symptoms. Referral to secondary care should be considered for “PPI-refractory” patients. OTC antacids show disappointing results in patients with EE. Self-care Controlled weight reduction in the overweight and obese is an important part of the long-term management of GERD and should not be ignored as a therapeutic intervention, as it may reduce the frequency and intensity of symptoms and lessen the grade of EE, if present. Lifestyle—small meals, avoidance of late meals, avoidance of precipitating factors, use of a sleep positioning device (pillow).56 OTC medicines (antacids or alginate-antacids) offer the most rapid, but usually transient, symptom relief and can be taken as required. Alarm features (see the Alarm features section). Options for Pharmacist-assisted Self-medication Reinforce lifestyle advice. Guide patients in the selection of medical OTC treatment by confirming the diagnosis, referring patients with alarm symptoms to physicians, and educating patients on the proper use of their OTC medication—which in some jurisdictions may include PPIs.57 N.B.: the availability of treatment choices varies between countries. Antacids—recommended for short-term or intermittent relief: Simple antacids neutralize gastric acid—that is, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts. Alginate-containing agents: these include alginic acid with small doses of antacids: minimal buffering effects. H2RAs—recommended for short-term to medium-term use. Widely available OTC. Cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine. More prolonged action than antacids. Tachyphylaxis. OTC PPIs: Patients seeking pharmacy advice for frequent reflux symptoms may benefit from OTC PPI treatment. Esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, which have different OTC availability in individual countries—see the Association of the European Self-Medication Industry Web site (http://www.aesgp.eu/facts-figures/otc-ingredients/). Other OTC PPIs may be available in other jurisdictions. Alarm features (see the Alarm features section). Check medication interactions. Self-treatment without investigation should be avoided in the presence of the following conditions58–61: Heartburn or regurgitation symptoms when: Duration >3 months with severe or nocturnal heartburn. Continuing after 2 weeks of treatment with an OTC H2RA or PPI. Occurring when taking a prescription H2RA or PPI. New-onset heartburn or regurgitation at age 45 to 55 years—lower age in several Asian regions. Dysphagia or odynophagia. Symptoms or signs of GI bleeding: hematemesis and melena, iron-deficiency anemia. Symptoms or signs of laryngitis: hoarseness, wheezing, coughing, or choking. Unexplained weight loss. Continuous nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Symptoms suggestive of cardiac-type chest pain: radiating to shoulder, arm, neck or jaw, shortness of breath, sweating. In pregnant women or nursing mothers. Children below 12 years of age for antacids/H2RA, or below 18 years for PPIs. Follow-up Action The goals of self-treatment are that the patient should become symptom-free and return to an optimal quality of life, with the most cost-effective therapy. If satisfactory and complete symptom relief is not achieved, patients should be recommended to visit a health care professional for diagnostic evaluation. PPI overuse—people who need sustained gastric acid suppression should have an appropriate indication for long-term PPI use; the long-term need for PPIs should be reassessed regularly.

Methods Literature search was focused on indications and technical recommendations for GERD testing and phenotypes definitions. Statements were proposed and discussed during several structured meetings. Key Results Reflux testing should be performed after cessation of acid suppressive medication in patients with a low likelihood of GERD . In this setting, testing can be either catheter‐based or wireless pH ‐monitoring or pH ‐impedance monitoring. In patients with a high probability of GERD (esophagitis grade C and D, histology proven Barrett's mucosa &gt;1 cm, peptic stricture, previous positive pH monitoring) and persistent symptoms, pH ‐impedance monitoring should be performed on treatment. Recommendations are provided for data acquisition and analysis. Esophageal acid exposure is considered as pathological if acid exposure time ( AET ) is greater than 6% on pH testing. Number of reflux episodes and baseline impedance are exploratory metrics that may complement AET . Positive symptom reflux association is defined as symptom index ( SI ) &gt;50% or symptom association probability ( SAP ) &gt;95%. A positive symptom‐reflux association in the absence of pathological AET defines hypersensitivity to reflux. Conclusions and Inferences The consensus group determined that grade C or D esophagitis, peptic stricture, histology proven Barrett's mucosa &gt;1 cm, and esophageal acid exposure greater &gt;6% are sufficient to define pathological GERD .

Aims: To assess the impact of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease on reduced work productivity and to identify the predictors of reduced productivity. Methods: A sample of employed individuals reporting chronic heartburn was selected from US household mail survey respondents. Heartburn severity and frequency were recorded using a diary, and work productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Patients with Symptoms of Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease. Predictors of reduced productivity were evaluated. Results: Over 30% of heartburn sufferers reported reduced productivity. Individuals with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ( n = 1003) reported 6.0% reduced productivity attributable to symptoms. Over 48% of respondents with severe symptoms reported reduced productivity, compared with 40% and 12% of respondents with moderate and mild symptoms, respectively. Using logistic regression, severity, a younger age and nocturnal symptoms were associated with increased odds of reduced productivity. In those reporting nocturnal heartburn, medication use and sleep interference increased the odds of reduced productivity. Conclusions: Reduced work productivity is seen in a large proportion of subjects on prescription medication for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.

The importance of detecting early neoplasia has taken on greater significance in this era of minimally invasive, organ-preserving endoscopic therapy. In this position statement we describe 38 recommendations to improve diagnostic endoscopy quality. Our goal is to emphasise practices that encourage mucosal inspection and lesion recognition, with the aim of optimising the early diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal disease and improving patient outcomes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2748482932", "source": "openalex"}

Impedance-pH recordings were used for GOR detection. Pepsin and bile acid levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). A total of 48% of patients had increased GOR, of which 27% had exclusively increased nonacid reflux. Cystic fibrosis patients had the highest prevalence of GOR. Pepsin was found in BALF of all patients and bile acids in BALF of 50% of the patients. Patients with BOS had neither increased GOR nor elevated pepsin in BALF. However, 70% of the patients with BOS had bile in BALF compared with 31% of stable patients. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment reduced acid reflux but did not affect nonacid reflux. Moreover, pepsin and bile levels in BALF were not reduced by PPI. One-half of the lung transplant patients had increased reflux, and nonacid reflux was common. Gastric aspiration occurred in most lung transplant patients. Pepsin was a more general marker and bile acids a more specific marker that might be associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

The goal of this pilot study was to determine if CBCS training improves gastroenterology (GI) fellows' patient-based colonoscopy skills. METHODS Competency at colonoscopy among 4 novice GI fellows who completed a 6-h CBCS curriculum was compared with 4 novice fellows who were not CBCS-trained. Measurements of competency were rendered by supervising faculty by recording \"insertion time,\"\"depth of unassisted insertion,\"\"independent procedure completion,\"\"ability to identify endoscopic landmarks,\"\"inserts in a safe manner,\"\"adequately visualizes mucosa on withdrawal,\" and \"responds appropriately to patient discomfort\" with each colonoscopy. RESULTS Simulator-trained fellows outperformed traditionally trained fellows during their initial 15 colonoscopies in all performance aspects except \"insertion time\" (pp < 0.05). Simulator-trained fellows inserted the endoscope significantly further and reached the cecum independently nearly twice as often during this early training period. Three parameters (\"depth of insertion,\"\"independent completion,\" and \"ability to identify landmarks\") demonstrated a continued advantage out to 30 colonoscopies. Beyond 30 procedures, there was no difference in the performance of the two groups. CONCLUSION In this pilot study, a 6-h CBCS curriculum provides an early training advantage by enhancing competency at the early stages of patient-based colonoscopy. These advantages are negligible after approximately 30 patient-based procedures. CBCS-enhanced training may allow faculty to be more efficient with their colonoscopy practice.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001400823", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system. Results: Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast‐feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non–breast‐fed infants and young children, lactose‐free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii , diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti‐infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires safety clearance given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates. Conclusions: Acute gastroenteritis is best managed using a few simple, well‐defined medical interventions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137535087", "source": "openalex"}

Methods : Following endoscopy 424 patients presenting with heartburn as the predominant symptom of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were randomized to treatment with omeprazole 20 or 10 mg once daily, or cisapride 10 mg four times daily, in a double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel group, multicentre study. Symptoms and quality of life were assessed at 4 weeks. Patients still experiencing heartburn continued therapy for a further 4 weeks and the assessments were repeated. Results : At 4 weeks, heartburn was resolved in 65% (95% CI: 57–73%), 56% (48–64%) and 41% (32%–49%) of patients treated, respectively, with omeprazole 20 mg and 10 mg once daily, and cisapride.

The impact of new HRM motor paradigms on reflux burden needs further definition, leading to a modern approach to motor testing in GERD . Methods Focused literature searches were conducted, evaluating pathophysiology of GERD with emphasis on HRM . The results were discussed with an international group of experts to develop a consensus on the role of HRM in GERD . A proposed classification system for esophageal motor abnormalities associated with GERD was generated. Key Results Physiologic gastro‐esophageal reflux is inherent in all humans, resulting from transient lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) relaxations that allow venting of gastric air in the form of a belch. In pathological gastro‐esophageal reflux, transient LES relaxations are accompanied by reflux of gastric contents. Structural disruption of the esophagogastric junction ( EGJ ) barrier, and incomplete clearance of the refluxate can contribute to abnormally high esophageal reflux burden that defines GERD . Esophageal HRM localizes the LES for pH and pH ‐impedance probe placement, and assesses esophageal body peristaltic performance prior to invasive antireflux therapies and antireflux surgery. Furthermore, HRM can assess EGJ and esophageal body mechanisms contributing to reflux, and exclude conditions that mimic GERD. Conclusions &amp; Inferences Structural and motor EGJ and esophageal processes contribute to the pathophysiology of GERD . A classification scheme is proposed incorporating EGJ and esophageal motor findings, and contraction reserve on provocative tests during HRM .", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2617435753", "source": "openalex"}

It is suggested that these patients might exhibit enhanced oesophageal sensation, akin to the heightened perception of both physiological and provocative stimuli in the gut that has been described in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. This study tested the hypothesis by measuring the sensory thresholds for oesophageal balloon distension and discomfort in 20 patients with symptoms of GORD, in whom ambulatory pH monitoring had shown normal acid exposure times, but in whom the symptom index for reflux events was 50% or greater, and compared these with 15 healthy volunteer controls, and with control groups with confirmed excess reflux.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2022785032", "title": "NASPGHAN Guidelines for Training in Pediatric Gastroenterology", "text": "1. OVERVIEW The field of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition (referred to subsequently as pediatric gastroenterology) continues to expand and evolve and is far different from 1999, when the previous guidelines on fellowship training in this field were published (1). Although still a relatively young field, this subspecialty is increasingly recognized and accepted throughout the world (2), albeit with varying degrees of medical resources and access to care. Tremendous medical advances, especially in the fields of genetics, infectious disease, pharmacology, and immunology, have changed our fundamental understanding of pathophysiology, and along with technological innovations, such as wireless imaging technology and intraesophageal impedance monitoring, have affected the way we diagnose and manage disease. At the same time, economic factors have become increasingly important in discussions of health care and graduate medical education (3). With rapidly escalating health care costs, care must be demonstrated to be not only high in quality but also cost-effective. Moreover, in response to pressure from the public to ensure practitioners are competent, accrediting agencies are imposing new and increasingly complex constructs for assessing the competency of our trainees. These factors demand that the training of pediatric gastroenterology fellows be continuously revised and reevaluated. It is not sufficient to focus exclusively on the clinical aspects of training, however. Although the primary mission of fellowship programs is to create competent clinicians, ensuring the health of future generations requires a broader training mission that recognizes that some of our trainees will choose careers as researchers and medical educators. Fellowship training, therefore, must provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue other essential career pathways. The necessity of providing this more inclusive training must be reconciled with evolving lifestyle expectations of trainees (4) and duty hour restrictions (5). In response to these enumerated factors, the Executive Council of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) charged its Training Committee with the task of updating the 1999 fellowship training guidelines. The goals outlined by the Steering Committee were to consider existing guidelines and seek consistency where possible; specifically incorporate the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies; create a framework that would permit consistent updating; reflect the unique aspects of pediatric gastroenterology, including the breadth of the field and unique nature of the patients, especially the changing presentation of disease as children develop; and respond to the practical needs of pediatric gastroenterology program directors. In addition to the original NASGPHAN guidelines, other existing guidelines were reviewed in the preparation of this document. Table 1 provides a list of the primary guidelines and the means to access them. ACGME's Residency Review Committee issues standards for fellowship training in pediatric gastroenterology and updates them every 5 years, with the most recent update in 2009 (6,7). ACGME establishes detailed training program requirements that are not included in these NASPGHAN guidelines. Requirements for training as a pediatric gastroenterologist in Canada are enumerated by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada (RCPSC) (8,9). The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) reviewed training issues and developed a curriculum for fellows in 2002 (2). The task force also reviewed the gastroenterology core curriculum generated by 4 adult gastroenterology societies that was updated in 2007 (10) and the recent guidelines for fellowship training in pediatric cardiology, a subspecialty with similar training issues, including procedure training and advanced training opportunities (11).TABLE 1: Guide to existing guidelinesUnique Characteristics of a Pediatric Gastroenterologist A pediatric gastroenterologist is expected to be an expert in the anatomy and physiology of a large segment of the human body that includes the esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, biliary tree, and pancreas, as well as the diverse array of acute, subacute, and chronic illnesses that may affect these organs. Trainees must have the ability to analyze and integrate the clinical data, instead of limiting their thought processes to a particular organ or segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In pediatric gastroenterology, an assessment of growth and nutrition is an especially integral part of any patient's evaluation and care. Diseases of the digestive system can negatively affect the nutritional status of the child; conversely, the nutritional status of the child can profoundly affect the diagnostic evaluation of the patient. In addition, the practitioner must possess exemplary interpersonal and communication skills, because the field of pediatric gastroenterology is truly multidisciplinary and requires routine consultations and collaborations with myriad allied providers, including endoscopy suite and operating room personnel, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, surgeons, intensivists, radiologists, pathologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Many of the diseases encountered by a pediatric gastroenterologist also are of relevance to other subspecialties, including endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and metabolism/genetics, necessitating collaborative relationships with these experts. A pediatric gastroenterologist, unlike an adult gastroenterologist, interacts extensively with both the patient and the patient's care provider(s). As such, it is imperative that the care not only be evidence-based and cost-effective but also be delivered in a compassionate manner that respects patients’ families and their cultures. The fiscal aspects of health care, especially in the United States, are undergoing seismic modifications and it is anticipated that events in the next 5 years will be characterized by vastly different reimbursement models and accountability in medicine. A pediatric gastroenterologist will need to be adept at demonstrating added value to health care dollars and strive for continuous quality enhancement of care. Knowledge of the dollar footprint of care will be imperative, especially as the subspecialist will have increasing access to an ever-expanding array of technological tools and diagnostic modalities, including medical genetic and pharmacogenetic testing. Furthermore, it is likely that as medical homes are established, pediatric subspecialists will need to develop new relationships with primary care providers. The other trend affecting fellowship programs is the juxtaposition of personal lifestyle choices and career choices. A subset of pediatric gastroenterologists works part-time for a variety of reasons, including needs for childcare, personal (or family) health issues, or other personal obligations or pursuits. Because these needs affect the training years, programs have increasingly adapted to trainee lifestyle requests. In the early years of this subspecialty, the majority of practitioners entered academic institutions, and this later expanded to private practice options. Presently, graduating trainees also consider hybrid practices in which they have an academic appointment with some role in trainee education, but otherwise maintain an independent practice. In summary, the field of pediatric gastroenterology is undergoing rapid transformation and these updated guidelines aim to address the changes occurring in the training of this subspecialty during the last decade and, more important, to prepare us for the future. Competencies ACGME was established in 1981 with a goal of developing a uniform set of guidelines that could be applied to ensure and improve the quality of resident and fellow education. As part of its Outcome Project, 6 core competencies that could serve as focal points in the development of residency and fellowship training program curricula were identified in 1999 and became part of program requirements in 2002 (12). Similarly, the RCPSC developed a set of core competencies that are an integral part of fellowship training program curricula (Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists, or CanMEDS competencies) (13). Although the CanMEDS competencies are not identical to those of the ACGME, their goals are similar (Table 2). Application of these core competencies and implementation of assessment tools by program directors of pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training are required for program certification by the ACGME and the RCPSC. Table 3 indicates how the ACGME competencies are presented in this guideline document.TABLE 2: ACGME and CanMEDS core competenciesTABLE 3: Mapping ACGME competencies to guidelinesThe competency of medical knowledge (CanMEDS Medical Expert and Scholar) requires that fellows demonstrate knowledge of relevant biomedical, clinical, epidemiological, and sociobehavioral sciences and their application to patient care. Areas that are particularly applicable to understanding the clinical manifestations and treatment of GI disease include developmental biology, pharmacology, host/microbial interactions, immunology, and genetics. Fellows should develop an understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the disorders that are encountered in ambulatory and inpatient settings. Medical knowledge should be obtained through didactic conferences, self-directed learning, and in the course of supervised clinical care. Concepts important for training in pediatric gastroenterology are included in the individual content areas. The competency of patient care (CanMEDS Medical Expert and Manager) is directed at ensuring that fellows are able to provide competent and compassionate care to their patients. They must be able to gather appropriate information via the performance of a complete clinical history and comprehensive physical examination, review of medical records, and appraisal of up-to-date scientific evidence. They must be able to develop and implement patient management plans, taking into consideration patient/family preferences. They must be able to interpret diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and develop the clinical judgment necessary to make informed decisions. Fellows also are expected to develop technical competency in the performance of GI procedures that are considered essential for the practice of pediatric gastroenterology and should understand the indications, benefits, risks, and limitations of all procedures commonly used in the evaluation of children with GI disorders. Enumeration of the patient care experiences required for training in pediatric gastroenterology is included in the individual patient content areas of this document. Recommendations for procedural training are reviewed in a separate section of this overview and in more detail in the final section of these guidelines. The competency of practice-based learning and improvement (CanMEDS Scholar) emphasizes lifelong learning. Instruction in this competency should help fellows to develop a set of skills that will empower them to serially assess and reflect upon their perceived strengths and weaknesses as clinicians, and to develop strategies and realistic goals to improve their clinical practice. This includes the ability to incorporate constructive feedback provided by supervisors, colleagues, other health care providers, administrative staff, and patients. In addition, this process of continuous improvement requires the ability to use information technology to support their education and an understanding of the principles and application of evidence-based medicine. Fellows must perform practice-based improvement, which involves obtaining information about their own population of patients, instituting a change, and assessing the effect using a systematic methodology. This competency also includes the development of specific teaching skills that will permit fellows to effectively educate patients and families, students, residents, other fellows, and consulting physicians. The competency of interpersonal and communication skills (CanMEDS Communicator) encompasses more than the performance of specific tasks or behaviors. Fellows should demonstrate interpersonal skills such as the ability to be present in the moment; awareness of the importance of the relationships among physician, patient, and family members; respect for others and treating others as one would like to be treated; and the capacity to adjust interpersonal skills based on the needs of different patients and families (14). Fellows must be able to create and sustain therapeutic and ethically sound relationships with patients, use effective listening skills to facilitate relationships, and work effectively with others as a member or leader of a health care team. Physician providers must be able to communicate across cultural and socioeconomic boundaries. In addition, fellows should begin to learn the skills necessary to communicate their findings and experiences with colleagues and other health care providers, both orally and in the form of written reports, manuscripts, and case series. Such skills are critical in practicing medicine effectively in a multidisciplinary setting. The competency of professionalism (CanMEDS Professional) includes training to ensure that fellows will be able to provide compassionate care to their patients in a manner that is sensitive to language, age, culture, sex/sexual orientation, religious persuasion, and disabilities. Professionalism is realized through partnership between a patient and doctor, based on mutual respect, individual responsibility, and appropriate accountability. It should include such areas as honesty and integrity, self-awareness and knowledge of limits, reliability, respect for others, compassion, altruism and advocacy, continuous self-improvement, collaboration, and working in partnership with members of the health care team (15). Moral reasoning and judgment also are essential components of professional behavior. Fellows should receive formal training in bioethics to equip them in addressing complex problems, such as parental unwillingness or inability to provide lifesaving care for their child. The content areas of this document include examples of the specific application of this competency to disorders encountered in the course of pediatric gastroenterology practice. The competency of systems-based practice (CanMEDS Health Advocate, Manager, and Collaborator) challenges fellows to conduct their clinical efforts in a manner that is medically sound, of high quality, and cost-effective. This requires that fellows understand different types of medical practice and delivery systems. Fellows must learn skills that will enable them to advocate for their patients and to coordinate services drawn from throughout the health care system. Upon completion of training, the fellow should be able to demonstrate his or her understanding of the roles of members of a multidisciplinary team and how to lead a multidisciplinary group that ensures optimal management of complex conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or intestinal failure. The content areas of this document also include examples of the specific application of this competency to disorders encountered in the course of pediatric gastroenterology practice. A number of metrics can be used to evaluate fellow performance, and specific competencies may be best addressed through the application of different methodologies (16,17). Medical knowledge may be best assessed with traditional tools such as written examinations or standardized oral examinations. Other competencies are better assessed using a variety of tools, including record review, chart-stimulated recall, checklists, logs/portfolios, standardized patient examinations, objective structured clinical examinations, simulations, patient surveys, and 360o global ratings. Although the particular choice of evaluation metrics may vary from institution to institution, it is essential that all pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training programs develop a process that facilitates the longitudinal collection of information/data and provision of constructive feedback to fellows in a manner that is timely, respectful, and most likely to positively contribute to their long-term personal and career development. Faculty development is key to the establishment of these metrics and to an effective feedback process. At present, few faculty are expert in these areas (18). A fundamental difficulty in assessing trainees based on the ACGME competencies is that supervising physicians often are asked to do this outside the environment of clinical care and without knowledge of the longitudinal development of trainees (19). A proposed solution to this dilemma is the creation of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) (20,21). According to ten Cate and Scheele, EPAs are part of the essential professional work; must require adequate knowledge, skill, and attitude; lead to recognized output of professional labor; be independently executable; and be observable and measureable in its process and outcome. An example of a possible EPA in pediatric gastroenterology is the medical management of the postoperative liver transplant patient. EPAs provide a clinical context in which to judge a trainee's competence in >1 of the 6 areas defined by ACGME. In this example, trainees’ competency in systems-based practice could be assessed in his or her ability to work on a multidisciplinary team and the competency in communication assessed in his or her ability to provide compassionate and respectful anticipatory guidance to the transplant patient and family. ten Cate and Scheele suggest that one could create a matrix listing specific EPAs on 1 axis and the ACGME general competencies that could pertain to the EPAs on another. Successful training, then, would require reaching the entrustable level of each EPA within a set time period by satisfying all of the relevant competencies. To assist program directors in conceptualizing the application of ACGME competencies, the content areas of this document include the development of tables that relate possible EPAs in each specific area to appropriate competencies. In the future, guidelines for training in pediatric gastroenterology may be based on a series of carefully defined EPAs. ACGME and the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) initiated a pediatrics milestones project to better define the competencies and improve the assessment of outcomes (22,23). The project specifies 52 subcompetencies and proposes a series of developmental levels for assessment. Application of the milestones to subspecialty training must await further study and validation. Clinical Training Guidelines ACGME requirements for subspecialty training in pediatric gastroenterology specify that the training program should be 3 years in length and ensure trainee competence as defined by their 6 competencies in the treatment of infants, children, and adolescents with diseases of the GI tract, the pancreas, the hepatobiliary tract, and nutrition. Current RCPSC guidelines require only 2 years of fellowship for certification in pediatric gastroenterology (8). To meet all of the recommendations enumerated below for a 3-year fellowship, candidates training in Canada could arrange an additional year of fellowship or obtain equivalent training after completing their fellowship. Acknowledging the increasing complexity of pediatric gastroenterology practice and the ACGME requirements, we recommend that at least 15 months should be devoted to clinical training in inpatient and ambulatory settings (Table 4). This length of clinical training would still permit the fellow to be supported by research training grants that restrict clinical activities after a first clinical year. Traditionally, the majority of fellowship training has occurred in the inpatient setting; however, given that clinical pediatric gastroenterology is predominantly an outpatient practice, consideration should be given to providing a significant component of training in the ambulatory setting. A continuity care outpatient opportunity of at least ½ day/week should be provided during the entire 3 years of fellowship. Throughout the training period, duty hours should conform to the guidelines issued by ACGME and be monitored closely (5).TABLE 4: Apportionment of training timeThe fellow should assume progressively increasing responsibility for clinical care and demonstrate increasing competence, both in the inpatient and ambulatory settings, during the course of the fellowship. Fellows also should demonstrate increasing competence in the performance of routine diagnostic and therapeutic GI procedures. Fellows have differing career goals that may affect their training. The current flexibility of training should allow trainees with specific interests to obtain additional clinical training, including training in selected areas, such as neurogastroenterology and motility, nutrition, intestinal failure, IBD, therapeutic endoscopy, hepatology or liver, small bowel, and multivisceral transplantation after the required 15 months of clinical training. For example, if a fellow seeks to obtain expertise (without formal certification) in areas such as motility or management of intestinal failure, additional training, up to 9 months during the 3-year fellowship, could be devoted to this special interest. Alternatively, such specialized training could occur after completion of the pediatric gastroenterology fellowship, as a separate fourth year or in a mentored clinical practice. Such training should not interfere with completion of the scholarly work product. Depending on local institutional resources, the flexibility also should permit fellows who are interested in academic careers to pursue advanced degrees, such as a master's degree in public health or clinical science. Trainees interested in a career in investigation (basic, translational, or clinical) would receive research training during their fellowship; however, fellows and programs should recognize that the path to independence as an investigator commonly requires that at least 4 to 5 years of training is needed to equip a fellow to work independently as an investigator in his or her area of interest. Whether this career path is included as an extra 1 to 2 years as a trainee or as junior faculty depends on local institutional resources, availability and type of funding to support further research training, and the individual needs of trainees. Table 5 suggests lengths of total training for pediatric gastroenterologists seeking different career pathways.TABLE 5: Overall training for different career pathwaysEndoscopy and Other Procedures Procedures are an integral part of the practice of pediatric gastroenterology, and trainees are expected to demonstrate competency in the performance of a wide array of procedures. Endoscopy and related procedures, such as liver biopsy and motility procedures, are in a continual state of evolution as a result of technological advances in equipment, changes in other diagnostic disciplines (eg, radiology), and shifts in the health care delivery system. Nevertheless, it remains important to establish guidelines for pediatric gastroenterology training programs so that trainees are up to date in the most current techniques available. Certain core principles of procedure training will remain important regardless of the details of specific procedures. Trainees must understand the appropriate indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Each program must have formal mechanisms for monitoring and documenting trainees’ development of skills in the performance of each procedure on a regular basis. Ideally, trainees should maintain a log detailing procedures performed and problems encountered. This will facilitate the regular feedback that must be given to trainees throughout their training as to their level of skill acquisition and whether they are meeting expectations for their level of experience. Trainees who are not achieving expected goals should be given constructive guidance in how to achieve the necessary level of endoscopic competence for their level of training. Adequate training and the minimal threshold number of procedures recommended to achieve competency for each procedure are defined in the endoscopy and procedure guideline for training that follows. Each trainee does not necessarily have to attain competence in all of the procedures outlined, but it is important that each trainee become familiar with every procedure and understand its application, interpretation, and limitations. Endoscopic competency is recognized as a continuum. As such, it is recognized that some trainees will achieve procedural competency at a lower number of procedures because of superior hand–eye coordination and other factors that determine procedural success, whereas others will require more instruction or experience to achieve the same level of proficiency. Although emphasizing that true procedural competency rather than volume is the more appropriate goal, careful review of the published literature allows for estimation of minimal numbers that should be achieved before performing procedures independently. Trainees are expected to achieve competence in the procedures that they intend to perform without supervision after completion of training. At completion of training, trainees who have not achieved adequate procedural competence in a procedure that they wish to perform will require mentoring by an experienced proceduralist until such time as procedural competency has been met. Therefore, an essential aspect of all training programs is to ensure that each trainee is adequately exposed to relevant procedures, which include diagnostic and therapeutic upper GI endoscopy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopy, endoscopic examination of the small intestine (capsule endoscopy and/or small bowel enteroscopy), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous liver biopsy, rectal biopsy, manometry (esophageal, antroduodenal, colonic and anorectal), esophageal pH and impedance monitoring, and breath test analysis. Since the publication of the 1999 North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition training guidelines (1), the 2009 ACGME update has moved several procedures from the “demonstrate competence” list to the “understand the principles” list, including paracentesis and percutaneous liver biopsy (7). This change was driven by the recognition that some of the procedures are being increasingly performed by interventional radiologists. These trends will continue to affect the training of pediatric gastroenterologists and certification requirements. As a result, guidelines for procedure training will require regular updates. Scholarship Integral to the advancement of the care of children with GI, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and nutritional disorders is the elucidation of basic disease mechanisms and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In addition, a greater understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular processes controlling the development and function of the GI tract, liver, and related organs is essential to progress in disease prevention and health maintenance during childhood. The continuation of these advances requires the availability of individuals with training in basic, clinical, and translational sciences, medical education, health services, and health policy. All clinicians in the subspecialty of pediatric gastroenterology must understand the foundations of the field and be prepared to assess the impact of new information on clinical care and thus practice evidence-based medicine. Congruent with ACGME and ABP guidelines (7,24), subspecialty training in pediatric gastroenterology must emphasize scholarship. All fellows must receive formal training in scholarly pursuits and participate in basic, clinical, or translational research, or another scholarly activity. The inclusion of forms of scholarship other than research recognizes the importance of all contributions vital for the continued advancement of the field of pediatric gastroenterology. Scholarship, in this context, can be conceived as 4 interrelated domains of academic activity (25). The scholarship of discovery encompasses the activities involved in original basic science and clinical research. The scholarship of education involves the development of educational strategies, curricula, and assessment tools for the communication of knowledge to students and the public. The scholarship of integration is concerned with making connections among diverse disciplines such as the use of communication technology in telemedicine, engineering methods in genomics research, or ethics in patient care. The scholarship of application involves the use of knowledge to solve problems of individuals and society. The types of scholarly work described by this domain include clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. Many translational biomedical activities are included within the domains of integration and application. Trainees need to acquire knowledge in all aspects of scholarship through a combination of didactics and direct participation in a meaningful scholarly project with appropriate mentorship. The experience must begin during the first year and continue throughout the period of training. The ABP sets requirements for the nature of the scholarly project and its output, but it does not stipulate the amount of time that must be devoted to this activity. To meet the goals established by the ABP, at least 12 months of fellowship training should be committed to scholarship activities, although some activities, such as a basic science project, clearly require a longer time commitment. Ideally, at least some contiguous blocks of time will be designated for completion of the scholarly activity. During these designated periods, 80% of the trainees’ time should be committed to scholarly work. Trainees must participate in a formal core curriculum in scholarship. The curriculum should be presented in a format that stimulates learning behavior through the use of diverse educational modalities, including lectures, group discussions, journal clubs, and research conferences. The curriculum should provide trainees with the opportunity to achieve an in-depth understanding of biostatistics, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory research methodology, study design, critical literature review, ethical norms governing scholarly activities (presentation of data, collaborative activities, confidentiality in peer review, authorship designation, social responsibility, human rights, and animal welfare), application of research to clinical practice, and evidence-based medicine. The curriculum also should include principles of teaching and adult learning, curriculum development, and assessment of educational outcomes. Trainees should acquire the necessary skills to deliver information in oral and written forms, prepare applications for approval and potential funding of clinical and research protocols, and complete abstracts and manuscripts for publication. Furthermore, the trainees should develop as effective teachers of individuals and groups of learners in clinical settings, classrooms, and seminars. Per ABP requirements (24), all fellows are to complete a supervised scholarly activity. This activity must be directly related to the field of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, or nutrition, with the objective to prepare trainees to become effective subspecialists and to contribute to the advancement of scholarship in the field. Participation in the scholarly activity should lead to the development of skills to critically analyze the work of others; gather and analyze data; assimilate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques; formulate clear and testable questions from a body of data; derive conclusions from available data; and translate ideas into written and oral forms. The scholarly activity may include basic, clinical, and translational sciences, medical education, health services, and health policy. Acceptable projects include basic, clinical, and translational research; meta-analysis or systematic review of the literature; critical analysis of health services or policies; and curriculum development. The project must be hypothesis driven or have clearly stated objectives, and requires in-depth integration and analysis of information or data. Trainees must actively participate and acquire comprehensive knowledge of all aspects of their scholarly activity. Trainees should practice reflective critique during the performance of the scholarly activity by thinking about the work, seeking the opinion of others, and responding positively to criticism. The scholarly activity is to lead to a work product for which trainees are responsible for a significant portion of its completion. Examples of an acceptable work product are a peer-reviewed publication, a formal report extensively describing a completed or complex ongoing activity, a peer-reviewed extramural grant application, and a thesis. Fellowship training in scholarship is to be performed in a supportive, stimulating, and inquisitive environment. Trainees must have the opportunity to discuss and critically analyze current literature, present their work in conferences, and interact with other trainees and faculty in a wide variety of disciplines. To provide an appropriate scholarly environment, faculty of the program must include people with established skills in scholarship, preferably in different areas of basic science, clinical science, health services, health policy, and education. Trainees should designate a faculty member to provide mentorship during their scholarly activity. The mentor is fundamental to the training process and must commit to support trainees during the extent of their scholarly activity. The mentor should have an established record of productivity in scholarship, have attained excellence in a field related to pediatric gastroenterology, and be aware of the opportunities for trainees to apply for grant support, participate in national conferences, and collaborate with others in the subspecialty of pediatric gastroenterology. The mentor must ensure that the support, facilities, and equipment required for the completion of the specific scholarly activity are available to the fellow and must monitor his or her progress and provide ongoing feedback. Each trainee is to have a scholarship oversight committee (SOC), governed by written guidelines (24). The SOC, in conjunction with the designated mentor and program director, is responsible for the guidance of trainees through the completion of the scholarly activity and for the assessment of whether a specific activity and the product of that activity meets the current ABP guidelines for certification. The SOC, as stipulated by the ABP, is to comprise at least 3 individuals (including the mentor), with 1 member from outside the subspecialty of pediatric gastroenterology. The program director can serve as a mentor and participate in committee activities, but he or she is not formally a member of the SOC. The committee is to meet on a regular basis during the period of training, at least twice per year. The committee is to assist trainees in the development of a course of study to acquire knowledge and skills beyond those provided by the core curriculum to ensure successful completion of the scholarly activity. The SOC will evaluate each fellow's progress, involvement in the specific scholarly activity, product of the scholarly activity, and defense of the product of the scholarly activity at its completion. The SOC will advise the program director on each fellow's progress during the training period and determine whether the scholarly activity was performed and completed according to the local program and ABP guidelines. Advanced Training Given the explosion of knowledge and technology, some pediatric gastroenterologists have restricted their practices to certain highly specialized clinical areas. Preparation to practice in these areas may require further training to develop the medical knowledge and clinical and technological skills necessary to achieve competency. At present, the field of pediatric cardiology includes multiple areas of subspecialization, and guidelines for training in each of these were published in 2006 (11). As the discipline of pediatric gastroenterology develops further, it is likely that new subspecialties will develop and others will change. The goal of advanced training in pediatric gastroenterology is to provide specialized clinical instruction for subspecialty trainees exceeding what would be expected in a traditional 3-year fellowship training program. Examples of areas in which advanced training can be appropriate include but are not limited to pediatric transplant hepatology, neurogastroenterology and motility, therapeutic endoscopy, IBD, intestinal rehabilitation and small bowel/multivisceral transplantation, and nutrition. Such training could be obtained in 1 of 3 ways: within the context of a standard 3-year fellowship, assuming all of the basic requirements for clinical training and scholarship are met; during an additional, dedicated fourth year of fellowship training; or postfellowship in the course of mentored, specialized practice. The only current official mechanism for obtaining advanced training in pediatric gastroenterology is that which exists for pediatric transplant hepatology (26). Obtaining a certificate of added qualification in this subspecialty requires the completion of an additional year of fellowship training in pediatric transplant hepatology and passing a certifying examination, offered jointly by the ABP and the American Board of Internal Medicine (27). Although the original NASPGHAN guidelines specified requirements for advanced training in other areas of subspecialty within pediatric gastroenterology (1), clear pathways for advanced fellowship training do not exist and, therefore, specifications for achieving this training were not included in this document. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the ABP will be able to offer certifying examinations, given the expected small numbers of applicants. We do, however, recommend that NASPGHAN consider defining the requirements for programs that may offer advanced training in areas other than pediatric transplant hepatology and for fellowship training in these areas. Format of the Content Areas Traditional approaches to enumerating the medical knowledge and clinical skills that trainees must develop to master a specialty field have resulted in lengthy and detailed lists of specific items. In practice, such lists have been rarely accessed by program directors and therefore been of little practical benefit. The Guidelines Steering Committee established a number of guiding principles for the development of content areas. First, the committee believes that to be effective, the format of the content areas should be simplified by avoiding repetitious language and emphasizing concepts rather than details. In the current era of expanding medical knowledge, retention of all relevant facts is impossible and problem-based learning, often on a Web-based platform, is becoming an essential part of practice and should be encouraged. Another goal was to create a format that could be updated easily periodically in response to changes in medical knowledge and practice. Finally, a link to the ACGME competencies for each content area was thought to be important to help embrace all aspects of trainee development that are necessary to meet both professional and lay concepts of acceptable practice. The Steering Committee identified 11 areas of content that best encompassed the breadth of pediatric gastroenterology without resulting in needless complexity: acid-peptic disease, congenital anomalies of the GI tract, GI bleeding, GI infections, hepatobiliary disorders, IBDs, malignancies and premalignant conditions, motility and functional GI disorders, nutritional disorders, pancreatic disorders, and intestinal failure. For each of these content areas, acknowledged experts were drafted to lead task forces, and they in turn invited additional experts to serve on these task forces. The format of each content area acknowledges the key role of the competencies in fellowship training. The outline of the content areas and the relation of the format to the general AGCME competencies are shown in Table 6. The last section of Table 6 emphasizes the importance of the developmental context in understanding the field of pediatric gastroenterology.TABLE 6: Format of the content areasAcknowledgments The authors acknowledge the role of the advisory group and especially the task force leaders and members for their work in creating the content areas.

It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA-for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss.Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel.IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease- with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians.

British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for the initial histopathological diagnosis of IBD were published in 1997. Changes since then include: more widespread use of full colonoscopy; greater recognition of the effects of time and treatment; improved documentation of variations in anatomical distribution; better understanding of the mimics of IBD; significant progress in clinical management; and modifications of terminology. Accordingly, an update is required. These revised guidelines aim to optimise the quality and consistency of reporting of biopsies taken for the initial diagnosis of IBD by summarising the literature and making recommendations based on the available evidence. Advice from existing clinical guidelines is also taken into account. Among the subjects discussed are: distinguishing IBD from other colitides, particularly infective colitis; subclassification of IBD (as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or IBD unclassified); the discriminant value of granulomas; aspects of disease distribution, including discontinuity in ulcerative colitis; time-related changes; differences between paediatric and adult IBD; the role of ileal and upper gastrointestinal biopsies; differential diagnoses such as diverticular colitis and diversion proctocolitis; and dysplasia. The need to correlate the histological features with clinical and endoscopic findings is emphasised.

Moreover, there has been an increased clinical recognition and characterization of these neoplasms. They show extremely variable biological behavior and clinical course. Most NETs have endocrine function and secrete peptides and neuroamines that cause distinct clinical syndromes, including carcinoid syndrome; however, many are clinically silent until late presentation with mass effects. Investigation and management should be individualized for each patient, taking into account the likely natural history of the tumor and general health of the patient. Management strategies include surgery for cure or palliation, and a variety of other cytoreductive techniques, and medical treatment including chemotherapy, and biotherapy to control symptoms due to hormone release and tumor growth, with somatostatin analogues (SSAs) and alpha-interferon. New biological agents and somatostatin-tagged radionuclides are under investigation.

The aim of the study was to estimate and compare the prevalence of EED in a population with symptomatic GERD presenting as either erosive reflux disease (ERD) or non-erosive reflux disease (NERD).Baseline data were collected from a prospective, multicentre, open cohort study (ProGERD) in which patients will be followed for 5 years after initial treatment with esomeprazole. Within the framework of this trial, all patients underwent gastroscopy and filled out a questionnaire designed to assess EED. The influence of potential prognostic factors on the prevalence of EED was analysed by multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analysis.6215 patients (3303 male, 2912 female; mean age 54 years) presenting with heartburn were included. EED was detected in 32.8% of all patients. The proportion was significantly higher (P = 0.0002) in ERD patients (34.9%) than in NERD patients (30.5%). As judged from the multivariate analysis, female gender, age, oesophagitis of LA grade C/D, duration of GERD disease greater than 1 years and smoking were significantly associated with EED. ERD patients with oesophagitis of LA grade A or B did not have a significantly higher risk of EED than patients with NERD.Patients with GERD have a high probability of experiencing EED, which may be associated with a number of prognostic factors such as duration and severity of GERD. Extra-oesophageal disorders are slightly, but statistically, more prevalent in ERD than in NERD patients.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039020133", "source": "openalex"}

Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), calculated by logistic regression with multivariate adjustments for covariates, were the measures of association. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Reflux symptoms occurring at least once a week more than five years before the interview were reported by 135 (16%) of the 820 interviewees. Among those who had ever been overweight during adulthood (body mass index (BMI) ⩾25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the OR of having recurrent reflux symptoms was 0.99 (95% CI 0.66–1.47) compared with those who were never overweight. There was no association between BMI at age 20, BMI 20 years before the interview, or maximum adult BMI and occurrence of reflux symptoms: ORs per unit increase in BMI were 1.00 (95% CI 0.93–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI 0.96–1.10), and 1.01 (95% CI=0.95 1.07), respectively.

Eight clinical questions addressing diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic topics were formulated. A systematic literature search was performed from October 1, 2008 (if the question was addressed by 2009 guidelines) or from inception to June 1, 2015 using Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials. The approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to define and prioritize outcomes. For therapeutic questions, the quality of evidence was also assessed using GRADE. Grading the quality of evidence for other questions was performed according to the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS) and Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tools. During a 3‐day consensus meeting, all recommendations were discussed and finalized. In cases where no randomized controlled trials (RCT; therapeutic questions) or diagnostic accuracy studies were available to support the recommendations, expert opinion was used. The group members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique. With this approach, recommendations regarding evaluation and management of infants and children with GERD to standardize and improve quality of care were formulated.

Aim : To explore the racial differences in the frequency of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and its complications. Methods : We reviewed endoscopy reports and medical records for data on race and complications of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in 2477 consecutive patients who had endoscopic examinations at the general endoscopy unit of an academic hospital. In addition, we prospectively interviewed 129 out‐patients attending general medical clinics in the hospital and in an Asian community health centre in Boston to obtain data on race and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Results : One or more gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease complications (peptic oesophageal ulcer, stricture or Barrett's oesophagus) were observed in 267 of 2174 white patients (12.3%), seven of 249 black patients (2.8%), one of 21 West Asian patients (4.8%) and none of 33 East Asian patients seen at the general endoscopy unit ( P &lt; 0.001); 34.6% of whites, 46.1% of blacks and 2.6% of East Asian patients interviewed claimed that they had heartburn ( P &lt; 0.01), but the term ‘heartburn’ was understood by only 34.6%, 53.8% and 13.2% of whites, blacks and East Asians, respectively ( P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions : Asian patients in Boston infrequently complain of heartburn, whereas heartburn is commonly reported by both white and black patients. Many patients do not understand the meaning of the term heartburn, however, and so physicians should be cautious when using the term during patient interviews.

However, gastroenterology societies have called for more data before making a formal recommendation. Aim To determine whether the detection of suspected NAFLD in overweight and obese children through screening in primary care and referral to paediatric gastroenterology resulted in a correct diagnosis of NAFLD . Methods Information generated in the clinical evaluation of 347 children identified with suspected NAFLD through screening in primary care and referral to paediatric gastroenterology was captured prospectively. Diagnostic outcomes were reported. The diagnostic performance of two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) was assessed. Results Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed in 55% of children identified by screening and referral. Liver disease other than NAFLD was present in 18% of those referred. Autoimmune hepatitis was the most common alternative diagnosis. Children with NAFLD had significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher screening ALT (98 ± 95) than children with liver disease other than NAFLD (86 ± 74). Advanced fibrosis was present in 11% of children.

Mature collagen is broken down by the action of specific enzyme collagenase. This has been estimated by a tissue-culture method and is produced by viable explants of mucosa. There is a significant increase in the amount of this enzyme produced post-operatively and it is suggested that this is responsible for the decrease in collagen and weakness of the colon. An increased amount of enzyme is produced by explants from the colon than from those of other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. This is regarded as an important reason for the high incidence of colonic and rectal anastomotic breakdown compared with breakdown of anastomoses in other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. Following colonic anastomosis there is increased collagenase production not only locally but throughout the gastro-intestinal tract, suggesting that wound healing is not only under local control.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2012147690", "source": "openalex"}

However, advances in diagnosis and treatment which are commonplace in the West, have yet to reach many developing countries. Clinical guidelines, based on these advances and collated in resource-rich environments, lose their relevance outside these settings. In this two-part review, we first highlight the global burden of gastroenterological disease in three major areas: diarrhoeal diseases, hepatitis B, and Helicobacter pylori. Recent progress in their management is explored, with consideration of future solutions. The second part of the review focuses on the delivery of clinical services in developing countries. Inadequate numbers of healthcare workers hamper efforts to combat gastroenterological disease. Reasons for this shortage are examined, along with possibilities for increased specialist training. Endoscopy services, the mainstay of gastroenterology in the West, are in their infancy in many developing countries. The challenges faced by those setting up a service are illustrated by the example of a Nigerian endoscopy unit. Finally, we highlight the limited scope of many clinical guidelines produced in western countries.

Aim To review systematically the effects of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease on work productivity. Methods Studies of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and work productivity were identified in a systematic literature search and their results were valued in US dollars using the human capital method. Work productivity loss was defined as absence from work (absenteeism) plus reduced effectiveness while working (presenteeism). Results Eight eligible studies were included. Reported work productivity loss among individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ranged from 6% to 42% and was primarily because of presenteeism (6–40%) rather than absenteeism (&lt;1% to 7%). Reported losses were greatest in patients experiencing sleep disturbance because of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, and lowest in individuals from the general population taking appropriate prescription medication. Work productivity impairment correlated with symptom severity and responded to acid‐suppressive therapy. Assuming a 40‐h working week and average wages in the US, the weekly mean productivity loss per employee with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease can be estimated between 2.4 ($62) and 16.6 h ($430), depending on the population studied.

Many reasons have been given for the lower prevalence of GORD in Asia. Low dietary fat and genetically determined factors, such as body mass index and maximal acid output, may be important. Other dietary factors appear to be less relevant. Increased intake of carbonated drinks or aggravating medicines may influence the increasing rates of GORD in some Asian countries but no strong evidence links other factors, such as the age of the population, smoking or alcohol consumption, to GORD. The management of GORD in Asia is similar to that in Europe and North America but the lower incidence of severe oesophagitis in Asia may alter the approach slightly. Also, because Asians tend to develop stomach cancer at an earlier age, endoscopy is used routinely at an earlier stage of investigation. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease is essentially a motility disorder, so short‐term management of the disease can usually be achieved using prokinetic agents (or histamine (H 2 )‐receptor antagonists). More severe and recurrent GORD may require proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or a combination of prokinetic agents and PPI. The choice of long‐term treatment may be influenced by the relative costs of prokinetic agents and PPI. © 2000 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2008180072", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2030602908", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines on Celiac Disease", "text": "CONTENTS 1 Definitions 2 Key points 3 Epidemiology 4 Diagnosis of celiac disease 5 Management of celiac disease DEFINITIONS Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, immunologically determined form of enteropathy affecting the small intestine in genetically predisposed children and adults. It is precipitated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods.1,2 It is also referred to as celiac sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or nontropical sprue. Gluten can be defined as the rubbery protein mass that remains when wheat dough is washed to remove starch.3 The major protein fractions of gluten, gliadin and glutenin are storage proteins in wheat. They are present in wheat, rye, and barley and gives the dough its desired baking properties. Gluten is widely used as an ingredient in food processing. KEY POINTS Gluten and gluten-related proteins present in wheat, rye, and barley are the causative external antigens of CD. The prevalence of CD in an adult population varies between roughly 1 in 100 and 1 in 300 in most parts of the world. First-degree and (to a lesser extent) second-degree relatives have an increased risk for CD. Its clinical presentation varies widely, and the onset of the disease or symptoms may occur at any time in life. Many patients with CD have few symptoms or present atypically, whereas a minority of patients have malabsorption (classical CD). Patients with active CD have an increased risk of complications, including death, in comparison with the general population. However, this excess rate of major complications seems to return to normal after 3 to 5 years on a strictly gluten-free diet. Key Diagnostic Findings Include: Histopathologic changes in an intestinal biopsy, characterized by crypt hyperplasia, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and destruction of the surface epithelial lining Evidence that the small bowel enteropathy is dependent on gluten shown by positive CD-specific antibodies and/or clinical and/or histologic improvement in response to a gluten-free diet Serological Tests Can: Confirm CD in patients with a demonstrated characteristic enteropathy Screen for individuals at risk Identify patients in whom biopsy may be warranted. Be used to identify gluten consumption during follow-up in diagnosed patients The presence of autoantibodies directed against transglutaminase-2 suggests that CD has an autoimmune component.4 In adults, CD is diagnosed on average >10 years after the first symptoms appear.5 Patients with CD should not eat products containing wheat, rye, or barley. Patients usually need to follow a strictly gluten-free diet for the rest of their lives.6 Oats may be consumed, but they are very often contaminated by wheat, and pure oats are often not available. A small subgroup of patients with CD (<5%) may also be intolerant to pure oats.7 EPIDEMIOLOGY Introduction CD is common throughout the world and affects around 1 in 100 to 1 in 300 of the population.8,9 This prevalence is significantly higher than that recognized 20 years ago.10,11 The epidemiology of CD has iceberg characteristics that there are far more undiagnosed cases (below the waterline) than diagnosed cases (above the waterline). A key study by Fasano et al12 in 2003 found that the prevalence of CD was as follows: At risk, first-degree relatives: 1 in 10 At risk, second-degree relatives: 1 in 39 At risk, symptomatic patients: 1 in 56 Groups not at risk: 1 in 100 Ethnicity Early epidemiology studies regarded CD as a disease of individuals with white ancestry, mainly located in Europe and North America.13,14 However, although there is a lack of worldwide epidemiological information, further studies in other areas of the world have shown a similar prevalence.15,16 Some of these studies detected CD among people with Amerindian or African American ancestry.17–19 Recent reports have shown that CD is a common disorder in North Africa, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan.20–22 Very recent reports from China have shown that both, the CD-predisposing HLA-DQ alleles and the disorder itself are not rare in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, at least.23 In summary, worldwide distribution of gluten-containing foods, predisposing genotypes, and factors involved in the pathogenesis of CD, are likely to be responsible to the widespread and almost universal emergence of the disorder. At-risk Populations CD should be considered in the following cases (estimated prevalence are given in brackets, if available)6,24: First-degree and second-degree relatives of celiac patients (10% and 5%, respectively) Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia (3% to 15%) Unexplained folic acid, iron, or vitamin B12 deficiency Reduced serum albumin Unexplained hypertransaminasemia (2% to 9%) Osteoporosis and osteomalacia of premature onset (2% to 4%) Recurrent abdominal pain or bloating Other autoimmune disorders: type 1 diabetes mellitus (2% to 15%), thyroid dysfunction (2% to 7%), Addison disease, and autoimmune hepatitis (3% to 6%) Ataxia and idiopathic neuropathy Down syndrome and Turner syndrome (6% each) Irritable bowel syndrome (3%) DIAGNOSIS OF CD Introduction The considerable increase in the number of patients being diagnosed with CD correlates with the recognition of a remarkably wide variety of clinical manifestations of the disorder, the development of accurate screening tests, and also a true increase in the incidence. Current Diagnosis In current practice, the diagnosis of CD hinges on a diagnostic intestinal biopsy and the concomitant presence of a positive CD-specific serology.6,14,24–28 A second (posttreatment) biopsy is not necessary for most patients if they respond satisfactorily to the specific treatment and should be reserved for patients in whom the first biopsy and serological test are inconclusive (eg, seronegative enteropathy) or for patients on a strict gluten-free diet but fail to respond.26,27 A gluten challenge, in which the offending agent is reintroduced while the patient is on a restrictive diet, should be reserved for patients who are receiving treatment but have a doubtful diagnosis.24–28 Diagnostic Tests Intestinal Biopsy An intestinal biopsy together with positive serology represents the gold standard in diagnosing CD. In 1992, Marsh14 reviewed the intensity of mucosal damage observed in treated CD patients who were confronted with increased amounts of gluten (Fig. 1).FIGURE 1: Diagnosis of celiac disease.Histologic Characteristics of Celiac Enteropathy Histologic damage is considered characteristic, but not pathognomonic, of CD, as similar lesions are seen in several other disorders.29 CD affects the mucosa of the proximal small intestine, with damage gradually decreasing in severity toward the distal small intestine, although in severe cases the lesions can extend to more distal areas.14,26 The severity and extent of the histologic damage seem to correlate with the intensity of the clinical symptoms.26,28 The proximal damage may be very mild in atypical or silent cases, with little or no abnormality histologically detectable in the intestine. Abnormalities in the gastric and rectal mucosa may be observed in some cases.14 The lesion in the duodenum/upper jejunum may be patchy, as a result of which it may be missed if there is insufficient mucosal sampling.24 Four to 6 biopsy samples must be taken: 3 or 4 from the second part of the duodenum distal to the papilla and at least 1 from the duodenal bulb.30 A negative histologic diagnosis may justify a second biopsy in selected patients who have positive autoantibodies such as endomysial antibodies (EMA).26,31 Biopsy samples taken from the proximal duodenum above the papilla of Vater may have artifacts (eg, stretching of villi) produced by submucosal Brunner glands, which may be falsely interpreted as flat mucosa.30 Under light microscopy, the most characteristic histologic findings in patients who are taking a gluten-containing diet are14,29: Blunted or atrophic villi Crypt hyperplasia Mononuclear cell infiltration in the lamina propria Epithelial changes, including structural abnormalities in epithelial cells Intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration A series of well-designed studies by Marsh made it possible to interpret the wide range of mucosal damage induced by gluten, with the celiac histologic modifications being categorized as ranging from normal mucosa to complete flat villi. The modified Marsh classification is widely used in clinical practice to characterize the histologic damage.32,33 Key factors to be considered for making histologic diagnosis reliable include: Number of biopsies procured Quality of biopsy samples Handling of samples Patchiness of mucosal damage Different grades of lesion Subjective histologic interpretation Serum Antibodies for Suspicion and Diagnosis of CD CD-specific serological tests, which have been in use for >20 years now, are important for 2 purposes: to select patients in whom biopsies are appropriate and to confirm the diagnosis in cases in which an enteropathy has been detected.34–37 A number of serological markers have been shown repeatedly in many studies to be highly sensitive and specific for untreated CD. On the basis of the target antigens, serological tests for CD can be divided into 2 groups: Autoantibodies: antiendomysial (EMA) and antitissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody tests4,34 Antibodies targeting the offending agent (gliadin): conventional antigliadin antibodies (nowadays considered obsolete for diagnostic purposes).35 Antibodies against synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs)37–40 All of these antibodies are based on immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG). Specifically, IgG-based tests are useful for detecting CD in selected IgA-deficient patients.40 Choosing the Most Appropriate Serological Test in Different Clinical Scenarios To confirm gluten dependence in patients with a demonstrated enteropathy while consuming a gluten-containing diet. Both IgG DGP seems to be very helpful in IgA-deficient patients and for some EMA-negative and tTG-negative patients. To select patients for duodenal biopsy: to reduce the need for duodenal biopsies, and on the basis of the different accuracy of serological tests, a series of serological algorithms are used to select patients for biopsy in different clinical scenarios: From the general population (screening). tTG and DGPs show similar performance and have a high sensitivity. These tests have low positive predictive values in the general (low risk) population (with a prevalence of 1%). A serological algorithm, with serial use of more specific screening assays (eg, EMA) has therefore been widely used to improve the diagnostic accuracy in the general population. A recent study has suggested that the single assay detecting IgA and IgG subtypes of tTG and DGP is the most sensitive test. Simultaneous or serial use of 2 tests (eg, IgA and IgG DGP/tTG plus either IgA tTG or IgA DGP or IgG DGP) provides the highest positive and negative predictive values. A combination of tests therefore improves suspicion of cases.37–44 Case finding in high-risk populations. Any of the given tests can be used as a single assay, as they all show similar performance as a single test, or in combination. A combination of tests does not improve case finding. The EMA test requires expert observers, and ELISA tests for detecting tTG antibodies should therefore be recommended in settings with low expertise.35,36 Genetic Testing for Diagnosis Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 are found in virtually all patients (almost 100% sensitivity) and also in 30% to 40% of the population in Europe, where the great majority will never develop CD. These haplotypes are essential for the recognition of gliadin epitopes by antigen-presenting cells and are therefore a key factor in the development of adaptive immunity. On the basis of its extremely high-negative predictive value, HLA typing can help support exclusion of a diagnosis of CD in equivocal cases in which the patient lacks HLA-DQ2 and DQ8.14,45,46 Role of Endoscopy Endoscopy is a valuable tool for obtaining duodenal biopsy samples. Endoscopy may show typical duodenoscopic features that are highly predictive of mucosal damage.47–49 Characteristic findings on endoscopy include: scalloped folds, fissures, and a mosaic pattern; flattened folds; and smaller size and/or disappearance of folds with maximum insufflation. Although endoscopic signs of mucosal atrophy have a low sensitivity for diagnosing CD in the general population,50 the procedure is very helpful when these signs are detected during endoscopies that are being conducted for other reasons. In such cases, the endoscopist can follow-up with an intestinal biopsy due to a strong suspicion of mucosal atrophy (Table 1).TABLE 1: Cascade for Diagnosing Celiac DiseaseMANAGEMENT OF CD Introduction The only treatment for CD is a strictly gluten-free diet for life. No foods or medications containing gluten from wheat, rye, and barley, or their derivatives can be taken, as even small quantities of gluten may be harmful.6,14,24,27,31 Oats are not toxic in over 95% of patients with CD, but there is a small subgroup (<5%) in whom oats are not safe. In addition, there is reluctance in some countries to advise liberal use of oats, because of difficulties in guaranteeing that commercially available oats are free of contamination with other grains.7,51 Complete removal of gluten from the diet will result in symptomatic, serological, and histologic remission in most patients.52 Growth and development in children returns to normal with adherence to the gluten-free diet and many disease complications in adults are avoided, with an improvement in the quality of life.53–55 Approximately 70% of patients reported an improvement in symptoms within 2 weeks after starting the gluten-free diet.52 With strict dietary control, antibody levels may decrease very soon after the diet has been instituted. In contrast, complete histologic resolution is not always achieved, or may take years. Monitoring Compliance is difficult, and patients should therefore be advised of the importance of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet.55–57 A multidisciplinary approach can produce more meaningful outcome information. The following is a summary of recommendations for follow-up after diagnosis and tools for monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet, during the first year after diagnosis (with follow-up appointments every 3 to 6 mo): Clinical visits: check symptoms and laboratory tests. CD serology tests (best predictors: quantitative determination of DGP IgA and tTG IgA) Visit to an expert nutritionist: assessment of nutritional status and adherence to a gluten-free diet based on an interview, a food diary, and the frequency of consumption (coinciding with the clinical visit) After the first year and once the patient is stable, visits for consultation can be reduced to 1 per year. Follow-up intestinal biopsy is not required. Laboratory Assessment Specific serological tests should be less frequent, depending on the degree of compliance and the length of time spent on a gluten-free diet. Recent studies suggest that periodical testing for IgA DGP and/or IgA tTG is the preferred method for monitoring compliance.36,52 Although these tests do not identify minor dietary indiscretions, a continued reduction in serum concentrations helps to assess compliance with the diet.52 Nutritionist Consultation58–64 An expert dietitian should be consulted in order to: Assess the patient's current nutritional status Identify macronutrient and/or micronutrient intake and detect deficiencies and/or excesses Analyze eating habits and potential factors affecting access to the diet Provide information and initiate the gluten-free diet Provide dietary education Monitor and evaluate dietary compliance and reinforce alimentary counseling Patients who are unable to adhere to the diet may require support with psychological counseling. Persistence of Symptoms The persistence of symptoms is almost always caused by continued ingestion of gluten.55 A common difficulty with the gluten-free diet is cross-contamination and the presence of unsuspected gluten in processed foods and/or medicines (although the latter is rare). Gluten may be a hidden ingredient, so it is prudent for patients to routinely check the ingredient list before purchasing any product; available lists should be checked for allowable foodstuffs.60,62,64 Serology can detect major and continued lapses in dietary adherence.52,55,56 Note Further details and evidence are available in the full text of this guideline on the World Gastroenterology Organization web site, at: http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/celiac-disease.html.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030602908", "source": "openalex"}

On day 5 of each dosing period, 24‐h intragastric pH and pharmacokinetic variables were measured. Results: Thirty‐six patients aged 29–58 (mean 45) years completed the study. Esomeprazole 40 and 20 mg maintained intragastric pH &gt; 4 for (mean) 16.8 and 12.7 h, respectively, vs. 10.5 h for omeprazole 20 mg ( P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.01).

In an allergy department, GER prevalence was evaluated in asthmatics, with a view to judging the potential influence of GER on asthma. One hundred and five asthmatics were recruited and co-investigated for GER and lung function. Descriptive analysis was performed, patients with (GER+) and without (GER-) GER were then compared, and finally, stepwise regression analysis was used. GER prevalence was 32%. Lung parameters did not differ between GER+ and GER- patients. When restricting analysis to GER+ patients, bronchial reactivity was closely correlated to the number of reflux episodes (NRE) (r=0.983; p=0.001). When comparing patients with more than 15 reflux episodes x day(-1) (n=50), with those having less (n=43), no differences were found in lung function and GER parameters. However, there was a positive correlation between the provocative dose of methacholine causing forced expiration volume to fall 20% from the baseline and NRE in patients with NRE&gt;15 (r=0.561; p=0.05).

Methods: Subjects were recruited from 10 international sites by a total of 5581 face-to-face interviews conducted with randomly selected members of the general population aged 18 years and over (50.6% female; mean age 44 years). The sample was divided according to whether subjects reported 1 or more of 14 GI symptoms, or no GI symptoms. Those with any of 11 upper GI symptoms were then subdivided according to their most bothersome symptom: gastro-oesophageal reflux (GORD)-like symptoms, ulcer-like symptoms or dysmotility-like symptoms. Symptoms were classified as relevant if they were of at least moderate severity and/or occurred at least once a week. Results: A mean of 46.4% of subjects reported experiencing one or more of the 14 GI symptoms, with 28.1% experiencing upper GI symptoms classified as relevant. Significant differences between the prevalences of relevant symptoms were evident between sampling sites. The estimated prevalence of GORD-like symptoms for the pooled sample was 7.7%. For ulcer-like symptoms, prevalence was 4.1%, and for dysmotility-like symptoms 15.5%. Significant differences were observed in the prevalence rates of symptom groups between countries. Women were significantly more likely than men to experience relevant symptoms, with gender differences also observed in the rates of GORD-like and dysmotility-like symptoms. The proportion of those with relevant symptoms experiencing GORD-like symptoms increased significantly with age; ulcer-like symptoms showed no significant relationship with age; and dysmotility-like symptoms decreased significantly with age. The prevalence of relevant symptoms increased with increasing BMI.

Patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are less responsive than patients with oesophagitis to acid‐suppressive therapy. Aim: To assess the role of acid reflux in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Methods: The spatio‐temporal characteristics of reflux events were analysed and related to reflux perception in 45 patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and 20 patients with erosive oesophagitis. Results: Compared with healthy controls, all patients showed a higher intra‐oesophageal proximal spread of acid, which was prominent in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (&gt; 50% of events lasting for 1–2 min). Irrespective of mucosal injury, the risk of reflux perception was very high when acid reached proximal sensors (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.6–12.5), being maximal in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease with normal acid exposure time (odds ratio, 11; 95% confidence interval, 5.2–22.3). Conclusions: Patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are characterized by a significantly higher proportion of proximal acid refluxes and a higher sensitivity to short‐lasting refluxes when compared with patients with oesophagitis. The highest proximal acid exposure and highest perception occurred in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease presenting with a normal pH‐metric profile. The assessment of acid distribution and its perception in the oesophageal body can better identify reflux patients who should benefit from acid‐suppressive treatment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046430423", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2810026625", "title": "American College of Gastroenterology Monograph on Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "text": "INTRODUCTION Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Current estimates are that IBS affects up to 10–12% of adults in North America [1, 2]. Although it can affect all individuals regardless of age, creed, or gender, IBS is more common among women and is most commonly diagnosed in younger individuals (<age 50) [2, 3]. IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits; bloating and distention frequently coexist. The diagnosis of IBS is made by taking a careful history, eliciting key symptoms, as well as performing a physical examination and limited diagnostic testing [4–6]. IBS is categorized into four main subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit: IBS with constipation (IBC-C); IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D); IBS with mixed symptomology (IBSM); and unclassified IBS [5]. IBS imposes a significant burden to the health care system and to individuals. Direct medical costs attributed to IBS in the US, excluding prescription and over-the-counter medicines, were estimated at $1.5-$10 billion per year in 2005 [7]. Patients with IBS enrolled in a large Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) had significantly more outpatient visits and incurred nearly 50% more in total costs than individuals without IBS [8]. A retrospective case-control study from another large HMO reported that patients with IBS had significantly more diagnostic tests, imaging, and surgery compared with patients without a diagnosis of IBS [9]. Significant variations in care across the United States related to the diagnosis and treatment of IBS also play a role in excessive health care costs [10]. The burden of IBS on individuals can be measured in a number of ways. Studies have demonstrated consistently that IBS impairs work-related activities (e.g., lost work time, reduced productivity while at work) and also reduces quality of life [11, 12]. The development of effective and efficient treatment strategies for IBS assumes considerable importance, therefore, not just for the individual sufferer, but for society at large. Given the clinical heterogeneity that is a hallmark of the disorder and the absence of a single effective therapy for all sufferers, available therapies tend to focus on predominant symptomatology at presentation (i.e., altered bowel habits, abdominal pain, or bloating) [4–6]. Based on their purported mode of action, many pharmacological therapies for IBS developed in recent decades have been directed towards those with a particular bowel habit, whether diarrhea or constipation. However, treating IBS patients can be difficult as no validated treatment algorithm exists, not all patients respond to treatment, and patients with similar symptoms frequently respond to the same treatment differently. Fortunately, a variety of novel therapeutic strategies are being explored and new compounds have appeared since the last iteration of the ACG monograph on IBS [4]. The goal of this document, therefore, is to provide an updated, evidence-based document on the therapy of this common and, at times, debilitating disorder. AN OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF IBS THERAPY Prior to the last evidence-based systematic review on the management of irritable bowel syndrome commissioned and published by the ACG in 2014 [4], and the work that underpinned this, there had been several systematic reviews of available therapies for IBS [13–22]. We have previously shown that these had either not synthesized the data correctly, or contained inaccuracies in applying eligibility criteria and data extraction [23]. We have, therefore, updated all the rigorously performed meta-analyses [24–27], which informed the ACG position statement in 2014, according to the following protocol: Objectives Primary outcome. To assess the efficacy of available pharmacological therapies in treating IBS compared with placebo, or, in the case of psychological and dietary therapies, in comparison with either no treatment or standard/usual care. Secondary outcomes. To assess the efficacy of available pharmacological, psychological, and dietary therapies in treating IBS according to predominant stool pattern reported (IBS-C, IBS-D, or IBS-M), and to assess adverse events with pharmacological and other therapies for IBS. Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies. Only parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological therapies with placebo, or comparing psychological and dietary therapies with either no treatment or standard/usual care, were considered for this review. Cross-over trials were eligible for inclusion, provided extractable data were provided at the end of the first treatment period, prior to cross-over. Types of participants. Adults over 16 years of age recruited from primary, secondary, or tertiary care with IBS symptoms diagnosed by any criteria (including clinical impression). Types of interventions. The following treatments were considered eligible: Exercise, diet, and dietary manipulation 2. Fiber Interventions that modify the microbiota: prebiotics, synbiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics Antispasmodics and peppermint oil Antidepressants Psychological interventions Pro-secretory agents: linaclotide, plecanatide, and lubiprostone Eluxadoline Loperamide Serotonergic agents Polyethylene glycol 5-aminosalicylates Types of outcome measures.

The search was limited to humans. No restrictions were applied with regard to language of publication. A recursive search of the bibliography of relevant articles was also conducted. Abstracts. ACG, DDW, and UEGW abstract books between 2000 and 2016 were hand-searched. Authors of trial reports published only as abstracts were contacted and asked to contribute full datasets or completed papers. Correspondence. Experts in the field were contacted for leads on unpublished studies. Methods of the review Selection of studies. The lead reviewer screened titles and trial abstracts that had been identified by the search strategy for articles that could possibly be eligible for the review. The lead reviewer then screened the selected trials to confirm eligibility, using pre-designed eligibility forms. A second reviewer, masked to the initial assessment, also evaluated all identified trials for eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and a consensus view was taken. Assessment of study quality. Only trials that used the word 'random', 'randomly', or 'randomized' in the description of their methodology were considered in this review and assessed for quality according to four characteristics: Method used to generate the randomization schedule (truly random or not stated/unclear). Computer generated random numbers, coin toss, or card shuffles, etc. were defined as truly random. Method used to conceal treatment allocation (adequate, inadequate, or unclear). If investigators were unaware of each participant's allocation to a treatment when they were recruited, then the allocation was said to be adequately concealed. Methods such as central randomization systems, or serially numbered opaque envelopes, fit these criteria. Implementation of masking (patients masked, clinicians masked, outcome assessors masked). When an identical placebo was used it was assumed that the participants were masked to their treatment allocation. Completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis. Wherever possible, completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis was recorded, as were dropout rates by group. Study quality was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data extraction. All data were extracted independently by two investigators on to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XP professional edition; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA). Any disagreement between investigators was resolved by discussion. The following characteristics were recorded for each trial: - Setting: population-based, primary care, secondary care, tertiary care - Country of origin and number of centers involved - Dose of therapy - Duration of therapy - Adverse events: both total number and individual adverse events, if available - Definition of IBS used - Primary outcome measure used Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, with all dropouts assumed to be treatment failures, wherever trial reporting allowed this. Data synthesis and analysis. For binary outcomes, (global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain improved or cured), the impact of interventions were expressed as relative risks (RR) of global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain not improving, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data were pooled using a random effects model, in order to give a more conservative estimate of the efficacy of individual IBS therapies [28]. The number needed to treat (NNT) for treatment efficacy, and the number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse events, were calculated using the formula NNT or NNH = 1/(control event rate × (1-RR)). These provide useful summary estimates for efficacy and safety for each of the active interventions of interest over a placebo or control intervention, corresponding to the number of extra patients needing to be treated with the active intervention over and above placebo or the control intervention to see one of the events of interest (i.e., a patient experiencing an improvement of symptoms or an adverse event). However, it should be pointed out that these cannot be used to compare the relative efficacy of one active intervention versus another, as they are not based on head-to-head studies. In addition, for NNHs, which are derived from summaries of adverse events it is important to point out that the definitions of these adverse events are also not standardized between individual trials, so again should not be compared. For continuous data, such as global IBS symptom scores or individual IBS symptom scores, a standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% CIs, was calculated. The results of individual studies can be diverse, and this inconsistency within a single meta-analysis can be quantified with a statistical test of heterogeneity, to assess whether the variation across trials is due to true heterogeneity, or chance. This quantity is termed I2, and its value ranges from 0 to 100%, with 0% representing no observed heterogeneity, and larger values indicating increasing heterogeneity. A value ≤50%, accompanied by a P value of >0.10 for the ÷2 test, was arbitrarily chosen to represent low levels of heterogeneity [29]. Review Manager version 5.3.5 (RevMan for Windows 2014, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to generate Forest plots of pooled RRs and SMDs for primary and secondary outcomes with 95% CIs, as well as funnel plots. The latter were assessed for evidence of asymmetry, and therefore possible publication bias or other small study effects, using the Egger test [30], if there were sufficient (10 or more) eligible studies included in the meta-analysis, in line with published recommendations [31]. GRADEpro version 3.6 (GRADE working group 2004–2007) was used to grade the quality of the evidence. Consensus was reached using a consensus-oriented decision-making framework [32], culminating in a face-to-face meeting to discuss the evidence and reach a unanimous decision on the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. EXERCISE, DIET AND DIETARY MANIPULATION Exercise We suggest exercise for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of Evidence: very low) Exercise and physical fitness are key elements of maintaining physical and mental health [33, 34]. Studies from healthy volunteers and patients suggest that physical activity protects against gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms [35, 36], and bears an inverse relationship with colonic transit time [37]. Based upon these observations, it is reasonable to hypothesize that exercise might be beneficial to patients with IBS. To date, there have been few RCTs that have rigorously evaluated the benefits of exercise in IBS patients. Daley et al. invited 305 IBS patients to participate in a RCT that compared 12 weeks of an exercise intervention with usual care [38]. Fifty-six IBS patients (18%) agreed to participate. Quality of life (IBS-QOL) and IBS symptoms (Birmingham IBS symptoms questionnaire) were assessed before and after the interventions. Exercise led to statistically significant benefits for constipation (95% CI: -1.6 to -20.1) but not for other outcomes such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, total symptom score, or quality of life. In a second trial, Johannesson et al. randomized 102 IBS patients to a rigorous exercise program monitored by a physiotherapist or usual care for 12 weeks [39]. Seventy-five IBS patients completed the trial. IBS symptom severity scores improved to a greater degree in the exercise arm compared with the control arm (P = 0.003). The same authors reported long-term follow-up data (median follow-up 5.2 years) for 39 of the originally enrolled IBS patients [40]. Increases in physical activity and improvements in symptom scores compared with baseline were maintained at follow-up. Summary. Although it is clear that exercise offers general health benefits and, whenever possible, should be encouraged the Task Force did not feel that the weight or strength of available evidence justified a strong recommendation regarding exercise for IBS. Although encouraging, the Task Force feels that the current body of evidence should be viewed as hypothesis-generating, and in need of validation by methodologically rigorous, appropriately powered, RCTs. Diet and dietary manipulation for IBS We suggest a low FODMAP diet for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: very low) We suggest against a gluten-free or exclusion diet based upon antibody or leukocyte activation test for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: very low) The majority of IBS patients associate symptom onset or worsening with eating a meal. Although true food allergy is uncommon in IBS patients, perceived food intolerances or sensitivities are quite common. Up to 90% of IBS patients exclude certain foods in the hopes of avoiding or improving their GI symptoms [41]. Since the publication of the last IBS Task Force evidence-based review in 2014 [4], there have been numerous studies that have evaluated dietary therapies in IBS patients [42]. Although various diets have been suggested to benefit IBS patients, the largest body of evidence relates to two specific diets; a diet low in fermentable oligo-saccharides, di-saccharides, and mono-saccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and a gluten-free diet. We identified seven eligible RCTs (evaluating 397 participants) that provided dichotomous outcomes for a low FODMAP diet versus an alternative diet [43–49]. There was an overall effect of the low FODMAP diet in reducing IBS symptoms with a RR of remaining symptomatic on a low FODMAP diet of 0.69 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.88). The NNT was 5 (95% CI 3 to 11) (Table 1).Table 1: Summary of evidence from randomized controlled trials of pharmacological, psychological, and dietary therapies in irritable bowel syndromeSimilar to another recent systematic review [50], our analysis found that all trials were subject to high risk of bias. Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded as very low, which related to imprecision resulting from the relatively small number of patients included in the trials, significant heterogeneity, and issues around blinding. Three trials in 271 IBS patients compared the low FODMAP diet with an alternative diet [43, 44, 47], two with usual diet [46, 48], and one with a high FODMAP diet [45]. The three trials that had adequate concealment of allocation and an alternative dietary intervention in the control arm showed no statistically significant benefit of a low FODMAP diet (RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.02) with no heterogeneity between studies [43, 44, 47]. The results of these trials are more difficult to interpret as they were not placebocontrolled, but rather, comparative effectiveness trials assessing two active dietary interventions. In each of these RCTs, the low FODMAP diet led to adequate relief of IBS symptoms in roughly half of the patients. None of the RCTs have evaluated the long-term efficacy of, or adherence to, a low FODMAP diet, or the personalized maintenance diet that is instituted after individual FODMAP reintroduction. Potential harms, which should be balanced with benefit, include impact on quality of life (e.g., social encounters) and effects on the colonic microbiome, which could exert negative effects on colonic health [45, 51–53]. We identified two eligible trials evaluating a gluten-free diet in 111 patients with IBS [54, 55]. Both were re-challenge trials involving IBS patients that reported that their symptoms were controlled with a gluten-free diet, but in whom celiac disease had been rigorously excluded. Participants were then randomized to have this diet spiked with gluten or not. This design only indirectly addresses the research question, as withdrawing a significant food group from the diet and then introducing it may enhance the likelihood of a nocebo response. There was no statistically significant impact on IBS symptoms in the gluten challenge versus gluten-free diet (RR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.28) with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 86%, P = 0.008) (Table 1). Another RCT evaluated 150 patients with IBS randomized to exclude all foods for which they had abnormal levels of IgG antibodies, or a sham diet where patients were asked to avoid a similar number of foods, but this was not based upon the IgG antibody test results [56]. This trial had an unclear risk of bias. Participants were followed for 12 weeks and 18 (28%) of 65 in the active intervention arm noted a significant improvement in symptoms, compared with 11 (17%) of 66 in the sham diet arm. This difference in response rates was not statistically significant (P = 0.14). The authors reported marginal statistical significance in those that adhered to their diet. A more recent RCT utilized leukocyte activation testing to evaluate a true vs. sham elimination diet in 58 IBS patients [57]. This study reported no difference in the proportion of patients with adequate relief of their IBS symptoms (P = 0.31) or quality of life (P = 0.92) after 4 weeks (secondary endpoints). However, there was a significantly greater increase in IBS global improvement scale score (primary endpoint) with the true vs. sham elimination diet (P = 0.04) after 4 weeks. Summary. Dietary therapies for IBS are of growing interest to patients, providers, and investigators. At present, the largest body of literature pertains to the low FODMAP diet. The available evidence supports a possible benefit for overall IBS symptoms in roughly half of sufferers. There are much less data for a gluten-free diet or elimination diets based upon IgG antibody or leukocyte activation testing. Importantly, there are little or no data that address the longterm efficacy, adherence, or harms of dietary therapies for IBS. FIBER IN IBS We recommend fiber for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: strong; Quality of evidence: moderate) We recommend psyllium, but not wheat bran, for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: strong; Quality of evidence: moderate) The updated systematic review and meta-analysis on fiber in IBS performed for this guideline identified 15 RCTs, involving 946 patients [58–72]. Only one trial was at low risk of bias [70]. There was a statistically significant effect in favor of fiber compared with placebo (RR of IBS not improving = 0.87; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94) (Table 1). There was no significant heterogeneity between results (I2 = 0%, P = 0.53). Six studies used bran in a total of 411 patients [58, 59, 64, 65, 69, 70], seven studies ispaghula husk in a total of 499 patients [60–63, 66, 67, 70], and the remaining three studies used \"concentrated fiber\" [68], linseeds [71], or rice bran [72]. Bran had no significant effect on treatment of IBS (RR of IBS not improving = 0.90; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03), but ispaghula was effective in treating IBS (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94). The NNT with ispaghula was 7 (95% CI 4 to 25). Data on overall adverse events were only provided by seven trials [63, 64, 66, 68, 70–72]. These trials evaluated 606 patients. A total of 130 (36.6%) of 355 patients receiving fiber reported adverse events, compared with 63 (25.1%) of 251 in the placebo arms (RR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). There were insufficient data from individual studies to assess adverse events according to type of fiber administered. Summary. Poorly fermentable, soluble fiber remains an evidence-based treatment for IBS. Insoluble fiber may exacerbate pain and bloating in IBS, and has no evidence for efficacy. The low cost and lack of significant side effects makes soluble fiber a reasonable first-line therapy for IBS patients and, in combination with the moderate quality of evidence, is the basis of a strong recommendation. The ability to improve stool viscosity and frequency logically argues for the use of fiber in patients with IBS-C, although the evidence base to support this contention is far from conclusive. INTERVENTIONS THAT MODIFY THE MICROBIOTA: PREBIOTICS, SYNBIOTICS, PROBIOTICS AND ANTIBIOTICS Prebiotics and synbiotics We suggest against the use of prebiotics and synbiotics for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: very low) The concept that alterations in the gut microbiome might be relevant to IBS arose from observations that symptoms of IBS developed after an infection (post-infectious IBS) [73], that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may cause symptoms indistinguishable from IBS [74], and that the colonic microbiota is altered in IBS [75, 76]. In addition, some IBS symptoms (e.g., bloating, slowed intestinal transit, and early satiety) have been associated with specific gut microbiota profiles [77, 78]. These observations have also led to the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics, as well as antibiotics, in the treatment of IBS. Prebiotics are food or dietary supplements that result in specific changes in the composition and/or activity of the GI microbiota. Probiotics have been defined as \"live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\" [79]. Synbiotics, which are also food or dietary supplements, are a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics that act synergistically to promote the growth and survival of beneficial organisms. The previous monograph identified no trials of prebiotics in IBS [4]. The updated search identified one RCT [80]. In this study 128 patients with IBS-D were recruited, and randomized to receive either prebiotics (derived from chicory) or placebo for 8 weeks. This double-blind trial was at unclear risk of bias due to failure to report the method used to conceal treatment allocation. Neither global IBS symptoms nor abdominal pain were reported as a dichotomous outcome by the investigators. Mean abdominal pain relief scores at 8 weeks were significantly higher with the prebiotic vs. the placebo (4.92 ± 0.86 vs. 3.13 ± 1.36, P < 0.001). Flatulence scores were also significantly improved with prebiotic (4.97 vs. 2.98, P = 0.037). Data on adverse events were incompletely reported. With regard to synbiotics, no new RCTs were identified since the last version of the monograph [4], but there were two studies that recruited a total of 198 patients [81, 82]. The first was a single-blind RCT conducted in Italy [81], recruiting 68 patients with IBS, and which used a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and helveticus, with Bifidobacterium species, in a vitamin and phytoextract-enriched medium for 12 weeks. Only this trial reported dichotomous data. There were 7 (20.6%) of 34 patients assigned to synbiotics with persistent symptoms, compared with 30 (88.2%) of 34 assigned to control therapy (P < 0.01). The second study, conducted in South Korea [82], used Bifidobacterium lactis in combination with acacia fiber for 8 weeks in 130 patients. This double-blind trial was at unclear risk of bias due to failure to report the method used to conceal treatment allocation. Both trials assessed IBS symptoms on a continuous scale in 185 patients. Even though both trials were individually positive, there was no statistically significant effect of synbiotics in reducing symptoms, due to significant heterogeneity between studies (SMD = -1.73; 95% CI -3.73 to 0.27, I2 = 96%, P = 0.09). In both synbiotic studies adverse events were reported, and no significant events occurred in either treatment arm. Probiotics We suggest probiotics, taken as a group, to improve global symptoms, as well as bloating and flatulence in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: low) Since the previous monograph a total of 18 new trials were identified [47, 83–99]. Therefore, in total, there were 53 RCTs [47, 83–134], involving 5545 patients. Twenty-six trials were at low risk of bias, [47, 83, 84, 87–90, 92, 93, 96, 98, 99, 103, 105, 110, 112, 114, 115, 119, 121, 123, 124, 126, 130, 132, 133] with the remainder being unclear. There were 37 RCTs involving 4403 patients that gave outcomes as a dichotomous variable [47, 84, 86–89, 91, 92, 94–104, 110, 112, 113, 115, 118, 119, 121, 123, 125–134].

This updated consensus focuses on proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease and Barrett9s oesophagus. <h3>Methods</h3> A steering committee identified three areas to address: (1) burden of disease and diagnosis of reflux disease; (2) proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease; (3) Barrett9s oesophagus. Three working groups formulated draft statements with supporting evidence. Discussions were done via email before a final face-to-face discussion. We used a Delphi consensus process, with a 70% agreement threshold, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to categorise the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 32 statements were proposed and 31 were accepted by consensus. A rise in the prevalence rates of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Asia was noted, with the majority being non-erosive reflux disease. Overweight and obesity contributed to the rise. Proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease was recognised to be common. A distinction was made between refractory symptoms and refractory reflux disease, with clarification of the roles of endoscopy and functional testing summarised in two algorithms. The definition of Barrett9s oesophagus was revised such that a minimum length of 1 cm was required and the presence of intestinal metaplasia no longer necessary. We recommended the use of standardised endoscopic reporting and advocated endoscopic therapy for confirmed dysplasia and early cancer. <h3>Conclusions</h3> These guidelines standardise the management of patients with refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and Barrett9s oesophagus in the Asia-Pacific region.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2417894215", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To develop and test a short questionnaire to aid patient–doctor communication. Methods The Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale was developed from a systematic literature review, focus groups of patients and primary care physicians, and patient cognitive interviews. A psychometric validation study was conducted based on two consultations in new ( n = 100) or chronic ( n = 105) gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients. Results The Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.68 to 0.82), reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient in stable patients ranged from 0.61 to 0.72) and construct validity (Spearman correlations with Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia instrument and Reflux Disease Questionnaire: 0.5–0.8 in both patient groups). Effect sizes in new and chronic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 and 0.32 to 0.42, respectively. Doctors reported altering their treatment decision based on information provided by the Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale in 35% of patients, and 77% of doctors found it to be useful. Conclusions The Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties in newly diagnosed gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients and those already receiving treatment.

Moreover, AI, through machine or deep learning, permits the ability to develop predictive models from large datasets. Possibilities of predictive model development in machine learning are numerous dependent on the clinical question. For example, binary classifiers aim to stratify allocation to a categorical outcome, such as the presence or absence of a gastrointestinal disease. In addition, continuous variable fitting techniques can be used to predict quantity of a therapeutic response, thus offering a tool to predict which therapeutic intervention may be most beneficial to the given patient. Namely, this permits an important opportunity for personalization of medicine, including a movement from guideline-specific treatment algorithms to patient-specific ones, providing both clinician and patient the capacity for data-driven decision making. Furthermore, such analyses could predict the development of GI disease prior to the manifestation of symptoms, raising the possibility of prevention or pre-treatment. In addition, computer vision additionally provides an exciting opportunity in endoscopy to automatically detect lesions.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2333557250", "title": "Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition", "text": "Thirty years ago, responding to the growing interest, rapid expansion, and increase in research in pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition, we established the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (JPGN). The editorial of the first edition began, quo vadis? (1). Thirty years later, we are asking the same question. What should the vision of JPGN be? It seems mandatory to provide the pediatric gastroenterologist with research and knowledge of gastrointestinal ontogenic function and malfunction during early life. It was hoped that the Journal would serve as an intellectual stimulus and an international forum for the presentation and discussion of advances and controversies within the discipline. The findings of differential timing of the expression of the genes controlling various small intestinal disaccharidases, pancreatic exocrine enzymes, and so on, led to a new practical paradigm on gut development (2). The paradigm included interaction of genetic endowment, gene expression, intrinsic biological clocks, endogenous regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamic-hypophysial-thyroid-adrenal axis, gastrointestinal receptors and mediators, and environmental influences. The environmental influences affecting gut ontogeny included intrauterine growth retardation and malnutrition early in life (2). Barker (3) hypothesized that the effect of intrauterine growth retardation increases the risk of later-onset disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults (3). The ontogeny of gut enzymes in early infancy and the recognition of pancreatic amylase deficiency and the early appearance of intestinal α-glucosidases and salivary amylase led to another ontogenic paradigm of alternate pathways of digestion and absorption in early infancy. The pragmatic outcome of ontogenic research was to use α-glucosides, such as sucrose, maltose, maltodextrins, and short polymers of glucose, during the neonatal period and for the compromised infant. Studies focused on the investigation and clinical applications of gastrointestinal ontogeny exemplify the early emphasis of JPGN. The potential for new therapeutic modalities attributable to age-related changes in the gut can stimulate clinical and basic research. The human genome project, the availability of stem cell biology, advances in molecular mechanisms of growth and development, and discoveries of mucosal growth factors and receptors that occurred as a result of the inception of JPGN have led to dramatic expansion of the basic, translational, and clinical studies in the Journal. We aspired to be one of the journals that publish original articles on gut ontogeny. In addition, we decided to invite ontogenic review articles that provided a basis for understanding the importance of gut ontogeny. Conversely, we were successful publishing age-related clinical studies in pediatric gastroenterology, with an emphasis on early life. An example of clinical disorders that we began to address successfully is celiac disease (CD). Clinical studies in CD emerged in the Journal, including global prevalence and high prevalence of silent preschool- and school-aged children, association with autoimmune disorders, Down syndrome, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and atypical presentations. Mechanistic studies of the effect of several genetic factors together with an environmental trigger were published. The genetic predisposition to CD was studied as a complex of HLA-DQA1*05/DQB1*02 and HLA-DQA*0301/DQB*0302 genes as major factors. Two strategies of genetic research—linkage and association studies—led to the discovery of several susceptibility loci and genes such as a region on 5q, MYO9B, and CTLA4. In addition, a genomewide association study identified 8 new risk regions, 7 of which harbour genes controlling the immune response. Again, we solicited review articles on genetic molecular biology research and the pathogenesis of CD. Another example for specific age-related clinical presentation and therapeutic considerations is failure to gain weight and short stature associated with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Pediatric IBD is different in some major aspects from adult IBD. Early-onset IBD has a distinct phenotype with disease manifestations that are primarily colonic with severe perianal disease and extragastrointestinal manifestations. Furthermore, early-onset IBD is unique in its association with metabolic diseases, neutrophil defects, immunodeficiency states, chronic granulomatous disease, and leukocyte adhesion defects. IBD is thought to result from a complex interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. Large-scale genotyping techniques have resulted in identification of >30 IBD-associated genes. Pediatric IBD management must consider lifelong disease and treatment. Twenty-five percent of patients with IBD develop the disease in childhood and adolescence. Clinicians need to weigh the risks and benefits of selected therapies, particularly the effects of medications, such as steroids, on growth and development and lifetime of exposure. For the last 30 years, the Journal has published a significant number of articles addressing issues specifically focused on pediatric IBD. We realized that the greatest challenge facing JPGN was reaching out to the world in general and developing countries in particular. We solicited articles from developing countries and found worthwhile clinical observations, but we were challenged by the flaws of study design, such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, and statistical analyses; data presentation; results; and conclusions. We were confronted with English and grammatical mistakes, leading us to correct and rewrite articles, provided they had a sound scientific message for the pediatric gastroenterology community. A new dimension of the Journal was added when the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition started to develop and update clinical practice guidelines and recommendations (4,5). Overall, it is apparent that JPGN has evolved to become an important cornerstone for the discipline and a reference journal for the societies of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition. My suggestion for the future is that the clinical research emphasizes acute and chronic gut diseases, all the while continuing to consider the effect of the ontogeny of the gut. In the quest to improve the knowledge of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition, we should develop new areas of focus and analysis, perspectives, policy forums, and technical comments, similar to the journal Science. Presentation of the basic science news on the ontogeny of the gut, including cell biology, genetics, and immunology, should be a stimulus for inquiry and research to advance the frontiers of pediatric gastroenterology.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2333557250", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To perform a meta‐analysis assessing the effectiveness of medical or surgical therapy for reflux disease in adult patients with laryngeal or pharyngeal symptoms presumed to be due to gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Methods Randomized controlled trials comparing medical or surgical treatments for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease against placebo were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966–September 2005), EMBASE (1974–September 2005), the CCRCT (until September 2005) and abstracts from gastroenterology and ENT meetings. The relative risks of reporting symptomatic improvement or resolution of symptoms was evaluated using a random‐effects model. Results Five studies using high‐dose proton pump inhibitor as intervention met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta‐analysis. No surgical studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled relative risk was 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.74). There was no heterogeneity between studies but evidence of significant publication bias. Sub‐group analysis performed evaluating Jadad scores and symptom type, did not change the relative risk. Conclusions Therapy with a high‐dose proton pump inhibitor is no more effective than placebo in producing symptomatic improvement or resolution of laryngo‐pharyngeal symptoms.

The aim of this study was thus to establish the optimal alternative posture for reducing reflux. <h3>METHODS</h3> 24 infants (&lt; 5 months) with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux were studied prospectively with 48 h pH monitoring. They were randomly assigned to one of the 24 permutations of the four positions (supine, prone, right, left). During the first 24 hours the infant was held horizontally, and then the permutation was repeated at 30 degrees head elevation, giving a total of eight study segments for each infant. Data were edited to remove all time when the infants were not in the prescribed positions.

The diagnostic value of a treatment test with omeprazole is unclear. Methods: Patients with dyspepsia including heartburn admitted for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind Scandinavian multicentre study. Before entry 188 patients were enrolled, and 160 were randomized to 1-week treatment with 20 mg omeprazole twice daily or placebo. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was defined as reflux oesophagitis Savary-Miller grades II-III at endoscopy or pH &lt;4 exceeding 4% of the total time at 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring and was found in 135 patients. The treatment test was considered positive when the patient's symptoms improved during the treatment week compared with the pretreatment day. Results: The sensitivity in diagnosing reflux disease was 71-81% with omeprazole as a diagnostic test, compared with 36-47% for placebo during treatment days 3-7. The specificity was similar for the two treatment arms during the first days of the study. During the end of the week a larger proportion of the patients with normal endoscopy and pH test responded to omeprazole treatment, giving omeprazole lower specificity than placebo. The investigators' overall evaluation of whether the patient was a responder to the test had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 55% in the omeprazole-treated patients. The corresponding figures in the placebo group were 17% and 92%, respectively. Conclusion: One week of omeprazole treatment is a simple diagnostic test with a fairly high sensitivity. The specificity is poor owing to the placebo effect and to the lack of a gold standard in diagnosing reflux disease.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153841251", "source": "openalex"}

Studies, however, differed greatly as far as design, population methods of diagnosing GERD, duration of follow-up and, consequently, findings. The median prevalence of DE in GERD patients was 24%, with a large range (5-47.5%), and the median prevalence of GERD in DE adults patients was 32.5% (range: 21-83%) and in paediatric population 17% (range: 14-87%). Children with GERD are found by a majority of studies at increased risk of developing DEs in comparison with healthy subjects, as are intellectually disabled people.This systematic review shows that there is a strong association between GERD and DE.

When data are not available that will withstand objective scrutiny, a recommendation may be made based on a consensus of experts. Guidelines are intended to apply to the clinical situation for all physicians without regard to specialty. Guidelines are intended to be flexible, not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach, and should be distinguished from standards of care, which are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of choices in any health care problem, the physician should select the course best suited to the individual patient and the clinical situation presented. These guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its practice parameters committee. These guidelines are also approved by the governing boards of American College of Gastroenterology and Practice Parameters Committee. Expert opinion is solicited from the outset for the document. Guidelines are reviewed in depth by the committee, with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields. The final recommendations are based on the data available at the time of the production of the document and may be updated with pertinent scientific developments at a later time. The following guidelines are intended for adults and not for pediatric patients.To develop practice guidelines for the management of gastrointestinal bleeding in adult patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.Randomized controlled trials published through October of 1993 were evaluated by members of the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee. Each paper was reviewed by three members of the committee and rated for quality of design by predetermined criteria. Meta-analysis of the studies for each treatment were evaluated for both outcome and quality of design and formed the basis for recommendations for treatment. Randomized controlled trials published between October of 1993 and August of 1995 have been added to update and modify the recommendations. The reader is referred to an excellent article by D'Amico et al. (The treatment of portal hypertension: A meta-analytic review. Hepatology 1995;22:332-354), which presents most of the meta-analyses reviewed by this committee.Once esophageal varices have been established by endoscopy as the site of bleeding, either sclerotherapy or endoscopic variceal ligation should be performed to control the bleeding episodes. Concomitant use of vasoactive drugs lowers portal pressure, potentially offers the endoscopist a clearer field in which to work, and is the only noninvasive treatment for nonesophagogastric variceal sites of bleeding related to portal hypertension. For patients failing medical therapy, the transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunt procedure is a reasonable alternative to an emergency surgically created shunt. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are the only proven therapy for prevention of first variceal hemorrhage. Both nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation (which has replaced sclerotherapy for this indication) are effective in reducing the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding. For patients failing these approaches, selective or total shunts or, in selected patients, liver transplantation are appropriate rescue procedures.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2410280742", "source": "openalex"}

Multiple regression analysis revealed that GORD symptoms were significantly associated with the occurrence of exacerbations (p&lt;0.01; relative risk 6.55, 95% CI 1.86 to 23.11). EBC pH was inversely correlated with FSSG score in both groups (p = 0.01, r = –0.37, 95% CI –0.55 to −0.14 in patients with COPD, and p&lt;0.01, r = –0.45, 95% CI –0.67 to −0.16 in control subjects). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> GORD symptoms were identified as an important factor associated with COPD exacerbation.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130915993", "source": "openalex"}

Typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are heartburn and regurgitation but gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis. The pathogenesis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease can be considered as the result of a complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W61329766", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of reflux perception in patients on PPI therapy. <h3>Patients and methods:</h3> 20 patients with typical gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation) despite double-dose PPIs (twice daily) were included in this study. Ambulatory 24 h pH–impedance studies were performed in all patients. The characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic reflux episodes were compared. Symptoms were considered globally and separately for heartburn and regurgitation. <h3>Results:</h3> A total of 1273 reflux episodes were detected including 243 (19.1%) acidic, 1018 (80.0%) weakly acidic and 12 (0.9%) weakly alkaline reflux episodes. Overall, 312 (24.5%) reflux episodes were symptomatic. The only factor associated with reflux perception was high proximal extent (p = 0.037). Compared with regurgitation, reflux episodes associated with heartburn were more frequently pure liquid (p = 0.009) and acidic (p = 0.027), had a lower nadir pH (p&lt;0.001), were more frequently preceded by acid reflux episodes (p&lt;0.001) and had a longer reflux bolus clearance time (p&lt;0.001). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> High proximal extent of the refluxate is the only factor associated with reflux perception in patients on double-dose PPI.

Design Population-based multi-centre prospective survey. Setting 29 public hospitals and 96 private specialists in gastroenterology in four administrative areas in France during 1996. Subjects A total of 2133 AUGIH patients 18 years and over were included in the six-month study. Outcome measures Incidence and mortality. Results The overall incidence in France was 143 cases per 100 000 persons per year, classified as out-patients (16%), emergency admissions (59%) and in-patients (25%). The incidence rates increased with age except for in-patients, and were higher in males. Peptic ulcer (36.6%), varices (13.7%) and erosive disease (12.3%) were the most frequent diagnoses. In 677 patients (31.7%), aspirin, antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids were taken on the 7 days before bleeding. The overall mortality (out-patients excluded) was 14.3% (10.7% for emergency patients and 23% for in-patients). Mortality was associated with comorbidities (especially malignancies, cirrhosis, asthma or respiratory deficiency), was lower in emergency patients using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and higher in in-patients using corticosteroids. Conclusions In France, patients with AUGIH are frequently managed as out-patients. Gastrotoxic drug use is frequently associated with AUGIH and constitutes a strategic opportunity for preventive treatment. Discrepancies between countries are not clearly explained either by demographic factors or by drug use, but this may be related to the emphasis on AUGIH in in-patients.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol12:175-181 © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology 2000, 12:175-181", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048106278", "source": "openalex"}

Products designed to have a moderately reduced allergenicity have also been proposed and marketed in Europe as hypoallergenic formulas. The European Society for Paediatric Allergology and Clinical Immunology (ESPACI) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) have commented previously on these issues,1 2 and the Commission of the European Union has issued a regulation for the requirements of infant formulas with reduced allergenicity or reduced antigenicity.3 This paper comments on the current developments and unresolved issues in the dietary treatment and prevention of food allergy in infancy to help inform paediatricians and other health care professionals, as well as manufacturers of infant foods. Adverse reactions to foods are a problem, particularly in infancy and early childhood, and can present with a wide spectrum of clinical reactions such as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, or other symptoms. Reproducible adverse reactions to food(s) can be the result of one or more immune mechanism(s) or they can be non-immunologically mediated. Immunologically mediated reactions, which are often immediate IgE mediated reactions, are defined as food protein allergy. Non-immunologically mediated reactions can be divided into enzymatic or transport defects (for example, lactase deficiency, or glucose/galactose malabsorption), pharmacological or other (undefined) reactions.2 4 The pattern and threshold of adverse reactions to foods varies. None of the symptoms related to immunologically or non- immunologically mediated adverse reactions to foods are pathognomonic, and no single laboratory test is diagnostic of food allergy.

Methods : Patients with GERD ( n = 6215) were included in a prospective cohort study (ProGERD). All patients underwent endoscopy and received esomeprazole. At baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment, symptoms and quality of life were assessed. Factors that influenced changes in the quality of life were determined by multiple regression analyses. Results : At baseline, the quality of life in GERD patients was lower than that in the general population, and was similar to that in patients after acute coronary events. No differences in symptoms or quality of life were observed between the subgroups of patients with non‐erosive GERD, erosive GERD and Barrett's oesophagus. After treatment with esomeprazole, the symptoms and quality of life were improved in all subscales within 2 weeks ( P &lt; 0.001). The mean score of the disease‐specific quality of life instrument (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Patients) increased from 4.6 to 6.2 points, representing a highly relevant clinical improvement. The generic quality of life (SF‐36) reached levels similar to those in the general population, but, again, no difference was found between the three different subgroups of GERD patients. The main factors associated with an improvement in the quality of life after treatment were symptom relief, severe erosive reflux disease, absence of extra‐oesophageal disorders, avoidance of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug intake and positive Helicobacter pylori status. Conclusions : GERD causes a significant impairment in the quality of life that can be attenuated or normalized within a time period as short as 2 weeks by treatment with esomeprazole.

All patients received antacids or prokinetic drugs or both for three to six months. Nineteen of 33 patients still had symptoms at the end of treatment, of whom five had developed erosive changes of the oesophageal mucosa. The other 14 discontinued treatment and remained asymptomatic during a six month follow up period. Comparison of the pretreatment pH-metry data of the 19 symptomatic patients and the 14 asymptomatic patients showed no differences in the pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the two groups. We conclude that in a substantial proportion of patients with pathological reflux without oesophagitis symptoms may persist and mucosal lesions may develop during conventional treatment without any apparent change in the reflux.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167382039", "source": "openalex"}

A number of self-administered questionnaires are available for assessing depression severity, including the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9). Because even briefer measures might be desirable for use in busy clinical settings or as part of comprehensive health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item version of the PHQ depression module, the PHQ-2. Methods. The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The PHQ-2 was completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics–gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. Results. As PHQ-2 depression severity increased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-2 score ≥3 had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 92% for major depression. Likelihood ratio and receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a PHQ-2 score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening purposes.

However, instruments for identifying and monitoring somatic symptoms are few in number and not widely used. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief measure of the severity of somatic symptoms. Methods The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-15 comprises 15 somatic symptoms from the PHQ, each symptom scored from 0 (\"not bothered at all\") to 2 (\"bothered a lot\"). The PHQ-15 was administered to 6000 patients in eight general internal medicine and family practice clinics and seven obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Outcomes included functional status as assessed by the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20), self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Results As PHQ-15 somatic symptom severity increased, there was a substantial stepwise decrement in functional status on all six SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. PHQ-15 scores of 5, 10, 15, represented cutoff points for low, medium, and high somatic symptom severity, respectively. Somatic and depressive symptom severity had differential effects on outcomes. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

Yet it is poorly documented in the literature. METHODS Three hundred seventy patients with PC from non-gynecologic malignancies were followed prospectively: the PC was of gastric origin in 125 cases, of colorectal origin in 118 cases, of pancreatic origin in 58 cases, of unknown origin in 43 cases, and of miscellaneous origins in 26 cases. A previously reported PC staging system was used to classify these 370 patients. RESULTS Mean and median overall survival periods were 6.0 and 3.1 months, respectively. Survival rates were mainly affected by the initial PC stage (9.8 months for Stage I with malignant peritoneal granulations less than 5 mm in greatest dimension, versus 3.7 months for Stage IV with large, malignant peritoneal masses more than 2 cm in greatest dimension). The presence of ascites was associated with poor survival of patients with gastric or pancreatic carcinoma. Differentiation of the primary tumor did not influence the prognoses of patients with PC. CONCLUSIONS A better knowledge of the natural history of PC is needed, in view of the many Phase I, II, and III trials currently being conducted to evaluate aggressive multimodal therapeutic approaches to treating patients with PC from non-gynecologic malignancies.

Systematic analysis of obstetrics and gynecology-related risk management files allows a more complete examination of ways that human and systems factors may contribute to adverse events. OBJECTIVE: To learn the medical complaints of patients who experienced apparent adverse events, the general causes of those adverse events, and the significant specific causal factors involved in obstetrics and gynecology-related risk management cases. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 90 consecutive obstetrics and gynecology-related internal review files opened by a medical center's risk managers between 1995 and 2001. Each file was analyzed to identify factors that may have contributed to or caused unanticipated adverse events. The main outcome was the pattern of contributing factors when they were aggregated into categories. RESULTS: Fifty percent of cases were associated with inpatient obstetrics. Factors that may have contributed to adverse events were identified in 78% of cases, and most had more than one contributing factor. Thirty-one percent of adverse events were associated with apparent communication problems. Clinical performance issues were identified in 31% of cases, diagnostic issues in 18% of cases, and patient behavior contributed to 14% of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic, therapeutic, and communication issues were the most common factors identified. Although the generalizability of these data are unknown, all obstetrics and gynecology departments face multiple challenges in assuring consistent quality care. Analysis of claims files may help identify opportunities for improvement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-3 A cause-and-effect analysis shows that significant proportions of adverse outcomes in an obstetrics-gynecology department seem to be related to issues of diagnosis, communication, and surgical care.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061691229", "source": "openalex"}

The goals were to determine the superior chemoradiation regimen and to quantitate the relative toxicities. METHODS: All patients had biopsy-proven invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Patients underwent standard clinical staging studies and their tumors were found to be International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stages IIB, III, or IVA. Negative cytologic washings and para-aortic lymph nodes were required for entry. Patients were randomized to receive either standard whole pelvic RT with concurrent 5-FU infusion and bolus CF or the same RT plus oral HU. RESULTS: Of 388 randomized patients, 368 were eligible; 177 were randomized to CF and 191 to HU. Adverse effects were predominantly hematologic or gastrointestinal in both regimens. Severe or life-threatening leukopenia was more common in the HU group (24%) than in the CF group (4%). The difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically significant in favor of the CF group (P = .033). The sites of progression in the two treatment groups were not substantially different. Survival was significantly better for the patients randomized to CF (P = .018). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that for patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix, the combination of 5-FU and CF with RT offers patients better PFS and overall survival than HU, and with manageable toxicity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1935824237", "source": "openalex"}

There are tens of thousands of chemicals in global commerce, and even small exposures to toxic chemicals during pregnancy can trigger adverse health consequences. Exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and related health outcomes are inequitably distributed within and between countries; universally, the consequences of exposure are disproportionately borne by people with low incomes. Discrimination, other social factors, economic factors, and occupation impact risk of exposure and harm. Documented links between prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals and adverse health outcomes span the life course and include impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and cancer. The global health and economic burden related to toxic environmental chemicals is in excess of millions of deaths and billions of dollars every year. On the basis of accumulating robust evidence of exposures and adverse health impacts related to toxic environmental chemicals, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) joins other leading reproductive health professional societies in calling for timely action to prevent harm.

Patients and Methods A retrospective review of demographic, pathologic, treatment, and outcome data from 1,895 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III EOC who had undergone primary surgery followed by six cycles of intravenous platinum/paclitaxel was conducted. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of prognostic factors with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Increasing age was associated with increased risks for disease progression (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11 for an increase every 10 years) and death (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.18).

Methods: A total of 3472 pregnant women age 18 and older were screened while waiting for their prenatal care visits in 10 obstetrics clinics using a brief (10 minute) screening questionnaire. This screen measured demographics, tobacco and alcohol (TWEAK problem alcohol use screening measure), and depression measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), use of antidepressant medications, past history of depression, and current treatment (i.e., medications, psychotherapy, or counseling) for depression. Results: Of women screened, 20% (n = 689) scored above the cutoff score on the CES-D, and only 13.8% of those women reported receiving any formal treatment for depression. Past history of depression, poorer overall health, greater alcohol use consequences, smoking, being unmarried, unemployment, and lower educational attainment were significantly associated with symptoms of depression during pregnancy. Conclusions: These data show that a substantial number of pregnant women screened in obstetrics settings have significant symptoms of depression, and most of them are not being monitored in treatment during this vulnerable time. This information may be used to justify and streamline systematic screening for depression in clinical encounters with pregnant women as a first step in determining which women may require further treatment for their mood symptoms. As elevations in depressive symptomatology have been associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes, further study of the impact of psychiatric treatment in gravid women is essential.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992853570", "source": "openalex"}

AI is already part of our daily life; it is behind face recognition technology, speech recognition in virtual assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) and self‐driving cars. AI software has been able to beat world champions in chess, Go and recently even Poker. Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology. The list of medical image‐analysis AI applications with USA Food and Drug Administration or European Union (soon to fall under European Union Medical Device Regulation) approval is growing rapidly and covers diverse clinical needs, such as detection of arrhythmia using a smartwatch or automatic triage of critical imaging studies to the top of the radiologist's worklist. Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good‐quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary. In this article, we explore the fundamentals of medical imaging AI, from theory to applicability, and introduce some key terms to medical professionals in the field of ultrasound. We believe that wider knowledge of AI will help accelerate its integration into healthcare. © 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: A validated survey by the American College of Surgeons was modified and distributed to all fellowship program directors in four subspecialties within obstetrics and gynecology: female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, gynecologic oncology, maternal–fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology–infertility. The 59-item survey explored five domains concerning preparedness for fellowship: professionalism, independent practice, psychomotor ability, clinical evaluation, and academic scholarship. A Likert scale with five responses was used and tailored to each subspecialty. Standard statistical methods were used to compare responses between subspecialties and to analyze data within each subspecialty individually. RESULTS: One hundred thirty directors completed the survey, for a response rate of 60%. In the domain of professionalism, more than 88% of participants stated that incoming fellows had appropriate interactions with faculty and staff. Scores in this domain were lower for gynecologic oncology respondents (P=.046). Responses concerning independent practice of surgical procedures (hysterectomy, pelvic reconstruction, and minimally invasive) were overwhelmingly negative. Only 20% of first-year fellows were able to independently perform a vaginal hysterectomy, 46% an abdominal hysterectomy, and 34% basic hysteroscopic procedures. Appropriate postoperative care (63%) and management of the critically ill patient (71%) were rated adequate for all subspecialties. CONCLUSION: Graduating residents may be underprepared for advanced subspecialty training, necessitating an evaluation of the current structure of resident and fellow curriculum.

The benefit of prophylactic gynecologic surgery for women with this syndrome has been uncertain. We designed this study to determine the reduction in the risk of gynecologic cancers associated with prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with the Lynch syndrome.Three hundred fifteen women with documented germ-line mutations associated with the Lynch syndrome were identified. Women who had undergone prophylactic hysterectomy (61 women) and women who had undergone prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (47 women) were matched with mutation-positive women who had not undergone the procedure in question (210 women for the analysis of endometrial cancer and 223 for the analysis of ovarian cancer). Women who had undergone prophylactic surgery and their matched controls were followed from the date of the surgery until the occurrence of cancer or until the data were censored at the time of the last follow-up visit.There were no occurrences of endometrial, ovarian, or primary peritoneal cancer among the women who had undergone prophylactic surgery. Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 69 women in the control group (33 percent), for an incidence density of 0.045 per woman-year, yielding a prevented fraction (the proportion of potential new cancers prevented) of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 90 to 100 percent). Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 12 women in the control group (5 percent), for an incidence density of 0.005 per woman-year, yielding a prevented fraction of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -62 to 100 percent).These findings suggest that prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is an effective strategy for preventing endometrial and ovarian cancer in women with the Lynch syndrome.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035624229", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2020685660", "title": "The Race of Hysteria: \"Overcivilization\" and the \"Savage\" Woman in Late Nineteenth-Century Obstetrics and Gynecology", "text": "Hysteria, we learned from feminist historical scholarship in the 1970s, was never just a disease. It was also the way nineteenth-century U.S. and European cultures made sense of women's changing roles. Industrialization and urbanization wrought one set of changes, while the women's rights movement brought another. Together, these included higher education for women, their increasing participation in a (rapidly changing) public sphere, paid employment, and declining fertility. These cultural changes were accompanied by a virtual epidemic of \"nervous weakness\" largely among women, causing feminist historians to begin asking whether the diagnostic category of hysteria was simply a way of keeping women in the home. 1 In light of recent work in race theory, it is worth examining these scholarly insights to ask: could hysteria equally be said to be about race? I will argue that it was, centrally, in two senses. First, nervousness was often characterized as an illness caused by \"overcivilization,\" 2 which located it in a scientific and popular discourse that defined cultural evolution as beginning with the \"savage,\" culminating in the \"civilized,\" but also containing the possibility of degeneration--\"overcivilization.\" In this literature, \"savage\" or \"barbarian\" was applied to indigenous peoples, Africans, Asians, Latin Americans, and sometimes poor people generally. As a disease of \"overcivilization,\" hysterical illness was the provenance almost exclusively of Anglo-American, native-born whites, specifically, white women of a certain class. Second, the primary symptoms of [End Page 246] hysteria in women were gynecologic and reproductive--prolapsed uterus, diseased ovaries, long and difficult childbirths--maladies that made it difficult for these hysterical (white) women to have children. As such, hysteria also implicitly participated in a discourse of race and reproduction, one which identified white women of the middle and upper classes as endangering the race through their low fertility, while non-white women, immigrants, and poor people had many children. A reading of the American Journal of Obstetrics suggests that its physician-contributors understood and deployed these distinctions extensively, characterizing white women as weak, frail, and nervous while non-white women and poor people were described as strong, hardy, and prolifically fertile. Ultimately, this doubled discourse of women had profound consequences for medicine and science: the frailty and nervousness of one group provided the raison d'être of obstetrics and gynecology, while the insensate hardiness of the other offered the grounds on which they became the experimental \"material\" that defined its progress. Hysteria in the nineteenth century was not a single disease or entity but entailed a profusion of symptoms. As a description, \"nervousness\" did heroic labor, and accounted for the most various distresses of body and mind. \"Hysteria\" and its variants neurasthenia and nervousness were part of the lexicon of psychiatry, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology and also of reformers cautioning about the dangers of cities or of women's education or labor. 3 One physician, George Beard, wrote a catalogue of symptoms that ran to seventy-five pages, and he counted it incomplete. 4 Both women and men suffered from neurasthenia, but the overwhelming majority of its victims were women. The treatments were drastic: bleeding, extended bed rest and for women, surgery to remove the ovaries. Scholars of women and gender have long argued that hysteria participated in powerful narratives of cultural crisis, which goes a long way toward explaining the logical glue that held together an apparently endless catalogue of symptoms as a singular syndrome. The hysterical woman, women's historians suggest, is both sign and symptom of conflict over the cultural meaning of gender. In this scholarship, hysteria is at once a diagnostic gesture of dismissal of women as competent participants in public life, a social role uncomfortably inhabited by suffering women, and a warning about the dangerous consequences for women of engaging in \"unfeminine\" behavior. 5 Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, for example, [End Page 247] consider hysteria virtually a diagnostic fiction, arguing that nineteenth...", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020685660", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2095543034", "title": "Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Neoplasms of Soft Tissue and Gynecologic Origin", "text": "PEComas, occasionally associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex, are defined by the presence of perivascular epithelioid cells that coexpress muscle and melanocytic markers. This family of tumors includes angiomyolipoma (AML), clear cell sugar tumor of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and very rare tumors in other locations. Because non-AML/non-LAM PEComas are extremely rare and their natural history and prognostic features undefined, we present our experience with 26 PEComas of soft tissue and the gynecologic tract, the largest series to date. We also performed a detailed review of the literature, with special attention to features predictive of clinical behavior. All PEComas exclusive of AML and LAM were retrieved from our consultation files. Immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (CK), S-100 protein, smooth muscle actins (SMA), desmin, vimentin, HMB45, Melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), TFE3, CD117, and CD34 was performed. Clinical follow-up information was obtained. Fisher's exact test was performed. The median patient age was 46 years (range, 15-97 years); there was a marked female predominance (22 females, 4 males). Sites of involvement included the omentum or mesentery (6 cases), uterus (4 cases), pelvic soft tissues (3 cases), abdominal wall (2 cases), uterine cervix (2 cases), and vagina, retroperitoneum, thigh, falciform ligament, scalp, broad ligament, forearm, shoulder, and neck (1 case each). The tumors ranged from 1.6 to 29 cm in size (median, 7.8 cm). Tumors were epithelioid (N = 9), spindled (N = 7), or mixed (N = 10). Multinucleated giant cells were present in 18 cases. High nuclear grade was noted in 10 cases, high cellularity in 7 cases, necrosis in 8 cases, and vascular invasion in 3 cases. Mitotic activity was 0 to 50 mitotic figures (MF)/50 high power fields (HPF) (median, 0 MF/50 HPF) with atypical MF in 6 cases. IHC results were: SMA (20/25), desmin (8/22), HMB45 (22/24), Melan-A (13/18), MITF (9/18), S-100 protein (8/24), CK (3/23), vimentin (12/14), TFE3 (5/17), c-kit (1/20), and CD34 (0/7). Clinical follow-up (24 of 26 patients, 92%; median, 30 months; range, 10-84 months) showed 3 local recurrences and 5 distant metastases. At last available clinical follow-up, 2 patients (8%) were dead of disease, 4 patients (17%) were alive with metastatic or unresectable local disease, and 18 patients (75%) were alive with no evidence of disease. No patient in our series had a history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Recurrence and/or metastasis was strongly associated tumor size > median size (8 cm), mitotic activity greater than 1/50 HPF, and necrosis. We conclude that PEComas of soft tissue and gynecologic origin may be classified as \"benign,\" \"of uncertain malignant potential,\" or \"malignant.\" Small PEComas without any worrisome histologic features are most likely benign. PEComas with nuclear pleomorphism alone (\"symplastic\") and large PEComas without other worrisome features have uncertain malignant potential. PEComas with two or more worrisome histologic features should be considered malignant. Occasional PEComas express unusual markers, such as S-100 protein, desmin, and rarely CK. The role of TFE3 in PEComas should be further studied.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2095543034", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: We used the National Cancer Database to identify women with cervical cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2015. Using clinical and pathologic data, each patient's stage was classified using three staging schemas: American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition, FIGO 2009 and FIGO 2018. The FIGO 2018 revised staging classifies stage IB tumors into three substages based on tumor size (IB1–IB3) and classifies patients with positive lymph nodes (pathologically or clinically detected) as stage IIIC1 (positive pelvic nodes) or IIIC2 (positive para-aortic nodes). Five-year survival rates were estimated for each stage grouping. We sought to determine whether the 2018 FIGO staging system was able to offer improved 5-year survival rate differentiation compared with older staging schemas. RESULTS: A total of 62,212 women were identified. The classification of stage IB tumors into three substages improved discriminatory ability. Five-year survival in the FIGO 2018 schema was 91.6% (95% CI 90.4–92.6%) for stage IB1 tumors, 83.3% (95% CI 81.8–84.8%) for stage IB2 neoplasms, and 76.1% (95% CI 74.3–77.8%) for IB3 lesions. In contrast, for women with stage III tumors, higher FIGO staging was not consistently associated with worse 5-year survival rates: stage IIIA (40.7%, 95 CI 37.1–44.3%), stage IIIB (41.4%; 95% CI 39.9–42.9%), stage IIIC1 (positive pelvic nodes) was 60.8% (95% CI 58.7–62.8%) and stage IIIC2 37.5% (95% CI 33.3–41.7%). CONCLUSION: The FIGO 2018 staging schema provides improved discriminatory ability for women with stage IB tumors; however, classification of all women with positive lymph nodes into a single stage results in a very heterogeneous group of patients with highly variable survival rates.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2952695966", "source": "openalex"}

Patients completed QoL assessments at baseline; at 1, 3, and 6 weeks; and at 6 months postsurgery.In an intent-to-treat analysis, laparoscopy patients reported significantly higher Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scores (P = .001), better physical functioning (P = .006), better body image (BI; P < .001), less pain (P < .001) and its interference with QoL (P < .001), and an earlier resumption of normal activities (P = .003) and return to work (P = .04) over the 6-week postsurgery period, as compared with laparotomy patients. However, the differences in BI and return to work between groups were modest, and the adjusted FACT-G scores did not meet the minimally important difference (MID) between the two surgical arms over 6 weeks. By 6 months, except for better BI in laparoscopy patients (P < .001), the difference in QoL between the two surgical techniques was not statistically significant.Although the FACT-G did not show a MID between the two surgical groups, and only modest differences in return to work and BI were found between the two groups, statistically significantly better QoL across many parameters in the laparoscopy arm at 6 weeks provides modest support for the QoL advantage of using laparoscopy to stage patients with early endometrial cancer.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117934623", "source": "openalex"}

Methods This was a prospective educational study. Balint training was introduced into the obstetrics and gynecology residency curriculum in July 2005. All 36 residents were approached for this study. The Psychological Medicine Inventory, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy were administered prior to initiating training and at 12 months. Baseline and 12-month scores were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results Seventeen residents completed baseline and 12-month questionnaires: 6 were postgraduate year (PGY) 1, 3 were PGY-2, 6 were PGY-3, and 2 were PGY-4. At baseline, 70% of participating residents reported high burnout scores. Burnout and empathy remained unchanged at 12 months. Psychological medicine skills improved at 12 months. Conclusions This study showed that obstetrics and gynecology residents are at high risk for burnout. Interest and confidence in handling psychological aspects of patient care improved at 12 months after the introduction of Balint training.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038487560", "source": "openalex"}

The questionnaire included demographic questions, a validated, generic supportive care needs measure, and a supplementary, newly developed, lymphedema needs module.Ten percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-12%) of participants reported being diagnosed with lymphedema, and a further 15% (95% CI, 13%-17%) reported undiagnosed \"symptomatic\" lower limb swelling.

For uterine and ovarian cancer survivors, those who had lymph nodes removed or who were overweight or obese had higher odds of developing swelling. Gynecological cancer survivors with lymphedema had higher supportive care needs in the information and symptom management domains compared with those who had no swelling.This population-based study provided evidence that lymphedema is a morbidity experienced by a significant proportion of gynecological cancer survivors and that there are considerable levels of associated unmet needs.

A gynecologic oncology group study", "text": "Background. The histologic grade of endometrial adenocarcinoma is related to the aggressiveness of the tumor and probability of death from disease. However, the ideal system for assignment of histologic grade remains controversial. In 1988, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) revised its recommendations for grading typical endometrial adenocarcinoma, such that grade is determined primarily by the architecture of the tumor and secondarily modified in the presence of \"notable nuclear atypia\"; this phrase, however, has never been defined, and therefore the prognostic validity of this system is unknown. Methods. Seven hundred and fifteen women with clinical Stage I and occult Stage II endometrial adenocarcinomas (excluding serous or clear cell type) entered on a Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol, and those treated by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oo-phorectomy, and selective pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling formed the study population. All cases were centrally reviewed and assigned an architectural grade and a nuclear grade using specific criteria. The FIGO grade was then determined. The various grading methods were examined based on ability to stratify patients into groups with differing rates of disease progression and relative survival at five years. Results. The architectural grade, nuclear grade, and FIGO grade of tumors each were used to separate patients into groups with statistically significant different rates of progression of disease and relative survival. The FIGO modification of architectural grade resulted in the reassignment of 44 patients into a higher grade. The outcome for these 44 was worse than for the remaining patients in the initial grade but was similar to the group into which they were moved. Conclusions. If clearly specified criteria for architectural and nuclear grading are used and \"notable nuclearatypia\" is defined as grade 3 nuclei, the 1988 FIGO grading system has prognostic utility. The authors recommend this system as the standard method for the grading of typical endometrial adenocarcinoma.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980688154", "source": "openalex"}

The emphasis in the new FIGO system was changed to the pathologic findings in the uterus, cervix, adnexa, and pelvic and/or periaortic nodes, and peritoneal cytologic findings. The major changes in this staging system were (1) the use of the depth of myometrial invasion and (2) the identification of tumor cells in peritoneal cytologic examination and of invasion in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Preoperative endocervical curettage was no longer necessary. Currently, the high level of operability of patients with endometrial carcinoma makes this staging system a viable one, which will provide information about the need for additional treatment. The use of the grading system for the tumor also was refined to upgrade nuclear changes that were inappropriate for the architectural grade. In serous adenocarcinomas, clear cell adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas, nuclear grading took precedence.

The questionnaires asked about demographics, perceptions about careers in academic medicine, and residents' experiences with mentorship.Response rates were 96.8% for residents and 40.6% for FELLOWS: Of the residents, 26.1% indicated they would not consider a career in academic medicine. First-year women residents were more inclined to pursue careers in academic medicine than were first-year men (p =.042), but their interest declined during residency. Women residents (43%)-especially minorities-felt that men were mentored and recruited more for faculty positions, while men (38%) felt that women were mentored and recruited more. Fellows' reports of recruitment did not differ by gender. Most white residents did not perceive racial or ethnic bias in mentoring or recruiting, while most non-white residents did.

Cochrane Collaboration's tool and ROBINS-I tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Summary of evidence tables were created using the United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table for Evidence Reviews.Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms.Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics. Further well-designed studies are needed to examine these interventions and others to generate evidence that can inform decisions about implementation of newer telehealth technologies into obstetrics and gynecology practice.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3002030059", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Anonymous, self-administered surveys to third-year medical students rotating on the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. Results: Eighty-one of 91 students participated (89% response rate): 33 men, 46 women, 2 declined to reveal their gender. No significant gender differences existed regarding number of interactions with residents and faculty; number of deliveries, surgeries, or examinations performed; perceived quality of teaching; or feeling included as part of the clinical team. Male students were more likely to report performing specific surgical procedures, such as operating the bovie cautery during gynecological surgeries (p = 0.005). More men experienced patients refusing to allow them to participate in the clinical interview (p < 0.0001) and physical examination (p < 0.0001). Male students were also more likely to report feeling that their gender negatively impacted their clerkship experience (p < 0.0001). Although less likely to report preclerkship and postclerkship career interest in obstetrics and gynecology, male students were more likely to report that their interest increased at the end of the clerkship. Conclusions: Male students were more likely to experience gender bias from patients on the obstetrics and gynecology service. Male students also described feeling socially excluded from female-dominated clinical teams.

For this report, the authors evaluated the effects of primary surgery by a gynecologic oncologist on treatment outcome. METHODS The hospital files from 680 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who were diagnosed between 1994 and 1997 in the northern part of the Netherlands were abstracted. Treatment results were analyzed according to the operating physician's education by using survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS Primary surgery was performed on 184 patients by gynecologic oncologists, and on 328 patients by general gynecologists. Gynecologic oncologists followed surgical guidelines more strictly compared with general gynecologists (patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stage I–II disease, 55% vs. 33% [ P = 0.01]; patients with FIGO Stage III disease, 60% vs. 40% [ P = 0.003]) and more often removed all macroscopic tumor in patients with FIGO Stage III disease (24% vs. 12%; P = 0.02). When patients were stratified according to FIGO stage, the 5‐year overall survival rate was 86% versus 70% ( P = 0.03) for patients with Stage I–II disease and 21% versus 13% ( P = 0.02) for patients with Stage III–IV disease who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists and general gynecologists, respectively. The hazards ratio for patients who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.61–1.03; adjusted for patient age, disease stage, type of hospital, and chemotherapy); when patients age 75 years and older were excluded, the hazards ratio fell to 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54–0.94) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The surgical treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma by gynecologic oncologists occurred more often according to surgical guidelines, tumor removal more often was complete, and survival was improved.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays an important role in the patient journey from the initial evaluation of the extent of the disease to appropriate treatment selection and follow-up. The purpose of this review is to highlight the added role of MR imaging in the treatment stratification and overall care of patients with endometrial, cervical, or ovarian cancer. Several MR imaging techniques used in evaluation of patients with gynecologic malignancies are described, including both anatomic MR imaging sequences (T1- and T2-weighted sequences) and pulse sequences that characterize tissue on the basis of physiologic features (diffusion-weighted MR imaging), dynamic contrast agent-enhanced MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy. MR imaging findings corresponding to the 2009 revised International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging of gynecologic malignancies are also described in detail, highlighting possible pearls and pitfalls of staging. With the growing role of the radiologist as a core member of the multidisciplinary treatment planning team, it is crucial for imagers to recognize that MR imaging has become central in tailoring treatment options and therapy in patients with gynecologic malignancies.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146862777", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study. The gender of department-based leaders (chair, vice chair, division director) and residency program directors was determined from websites of 950 academic departments of anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Each specialty's representation ratio—proportion of leadership roles held by women in 2013 divided by proportion of residents in 1990 who were women—and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A ratio of 1 indicates proportionate representation. RESULTS: Women were significantly underrepresented among chairs for all specialties (ratios 0.60 or less, P≤.02) and division directors for all specialties except anesthesiology (ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.87–1.46) and diagnostic radiology (ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81–1.16). The representation ratio for vice chair was below 1.0 for all specialties except anesthesiology; this finding reached statistical significance only for pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Women were significantly overrepresented as residency program directors in general surgery, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics (ratios greater than 1.19, P≤.046). Obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics had the highest proportions of residents in 1990 and department leaders in 2013 who were women. CONCLUSION: Despite having the largest proportion of leaders who were women, representation ratios demonstrate obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in progression of women to departmental leadership. Women's overrepresentation as residency program directors raises concern because education-based academic tracks may not lead to major leadership roles. Representation ratios, which allow meaningful comparisons across specialties, demonstrate that obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in the progression of women to departmental leadership roles.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2286701001", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Study patients were 472 women receiving cancer care in an urban public medical center. Women had a primary diagnosis of breast (stage 0 to III) or gynecologic cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 0 to IIIB). A diagnostic depression screen and baseline questionnaire were administered before or during active treatment or during active follow-up. Self-report data were collected on receipt of depression treatment, use of supportive counseling, pain and receipt of pain medication, functional status and well-being, and perceived barriers to cancer care. Results Twenty-four percent of women reported moderate to severe levels of depressive disorder (30% of breast cancer patients and 17% of gynecologic cancer patients). Only 12% of women meeting criteria for major depression reported currently receiving medications for depression, and only 5% of women reported seeing a counselor or participating in a cancer support group. Neither cancer stage nor treatment status was correlated with depression. Primary diagnosis of breast cancer, younger age, greater functional impairment, poorer social and family well-being, anxiety, comorbid arthritis, and fears about treatment side effects were correlated with depression. Conclusion Findings indicate that depressive disorder among ethnic minority, low-income women with breast or gynecologic cancer is prevalent and is correlated with pain, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Because these women are unlikely to receive depression treatment or supportive counseling, there is a need for routine screening, evaluation, and treatment in this population.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2136833425", "source": "openalex"}

There has been a rise in the prevalence of large newborns over a few decades in many parts of the world. There is ample evidence that fetal macrosomia is associated with increased risk of complications both for the mother and the newborn. In current obstetrics, the macrosomic fetus represents a frequent clinical challenge. Evidence is emerging that being born macrosomic is also associated with future health risks. Objective. To provide a review of causes and risks, prevention, prediction and clinical management of suspected large fetus/fetal macrosomia, primarily aimed at clinical obstetricians. Methods. Medline and EMBASE were searched between 1980 and 2007 by combining either ‘fetal macrosomia’ or ‘large for gestational age’ with other relevant terms. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for the term ‘fetal macrosomia’. Results and conclusions. Although the causes of high birthweight include both genetic and environmental factors, the rapid increase in the prevalence of large newborns has environmental causes. The evidence is extensive that maternal overweight and associated metabolic changes, including type 2 and gestational diabetes, play a central role. There is a paucity of studies of the effect of intervention before and/or during pregnancy on the risk of having an ‘overweight newborn’. It appears rational, however, that preventive measures should primarily be implemented before pregnancy and should include guidance about nutrition and physical activity in order to reduce the prevalence of overweight. In pregnancy, limited weight gain, especially in obese women, seems to reduce the risk of macrosomia, as do good control of plasma glucose among those with diabetes. Prediction of fetal macrosomia remains an inaccurate task even with modern ultrasound equipment. There is little evidence that routine elective delivery (induction or caesarean section) for the mere reason of suspected macrosomia should be employed in a general population. Vaginal delivery of a macrosomic fetus requires considered attention by an experienced obstetrician and preparedness for operative delivery, shoulder dystocia and newborn asphyxia.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022707347", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, the authors evaluated these phenomena in a dose-response study. Methods Two groups of 12 patients each who were undergoing major intraabdominal gynecologic surgery were assigned randomly to receive 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer's solution in a dosage of 30 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1). The pH, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, and total protein were measured in 30-min intervals. The serum bicarbonate concentration was calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and also using the Stewart approach from the strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid. The strong ion difference was calculated as serum sodium + serum potassium - serum chloride - serum lactate. The amount of weak plasma acid was calculated as the serum total protein concentration in g/dl x 2.43. Results Infusion of 0.9% saline, but not lactated Ringer's solution, caused a metabolic acidosis with hyperchloremia and a concomitant decrease in the strong ion difference. Calculating the serum bicarbonate concentration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Stewart approach produced equivalent results. Conclusions Infusion of approximately 30 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1) saline during anesthesia and surgery inevitably leads to metabolic acidosis, which is not observed after administration of lactated Ringer's solution. The acidosis is associated with hyperchloremia.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987303342", "source": "openalex"}

The current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grading scheme provides prognostic information that can be used to guide the extent of surgery and use of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. We recommend moving toward a binary scheme to grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas by considering International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics defined grades 1 and 2 tumors as “low grade” and grade 3 tumors as “high grade.” The current evidence base does not support the use of a 3-tiered grading system, although this is considered standard by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the College of American Pathologists. As for the 4 genomic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma (copy number low/p53 wild-type, copy number high/p53 abnormal, polymerase E mutant, and mismatch repair deficient), which only recently have been identified, there is accumulating evidence showing these categories can be reproducibly diagnosed and accurately assessed based on biopsy/curettage specimens as well as hysterectomy specimens. Furthermore, this subclassification system can be adapted for current clinical practice and is of prognostic significance independent of conventional variables used for risk assessment in patients with endometrial carcinoma (eg, stage). It is too soon to recommend the routine use of genomic classification in this setting; however, with further evidence, this system may become the basis for the subclassification of all endometrial carcinomas, supplanting (partially or completely) histotype, and grade.

In addition, 32 experts from these same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of approximately 700.The literature was searched using MEDLINE and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for their conference presentations with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience.The panel, answering predefined questions, developed their conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately following its release at the conference and was updated with the panel's final revisions.Osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages. Though more prevalent in white postmenopausal females, it often goes unrecognized in other populations. Osteoporosis is a devastating disorder with significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. The risks for osteoporosis, as reflected by low bone density, and the risks for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions known to be associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important, but as yet poorly validated, role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing risk of fracture, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation of these two components in bioavailable forms may be necessary in individuals who do not achieve recommended intake from dietary sources. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce the risk of falls in older individuals. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary goal in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. These include therapies that enhance bone mass and reduce risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for the presence of osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W175660244", "source": "openalex"}

In the vascular and nervous systems distinct isoforms generate NO to act as a signal transduction mechanism. The isoform induced by cytokines, on the other hand, provides a sustained release of NO which mediates some cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of the immune system. Solid tumors are a heterogeneous population of cell types, including tumor, vascular, and infiltrating immune cells. Studies in vitro show that NO synthase can be present in many of these cells. However, its presence in situ in solid human tumors has not been reported. In this study, we have investigated NO synthase activity and its cellular localization in malignant and nonmalignant human gynecological tissue. Nitric oxide synthase activity was observed in malignant tissue, was highest (> or = 250 pmol/min/g tissue) in poorly differentiated tumors, and was below detectable levels in normal gynecological tissue. Furthermore, investigations with a polyclonal NO synthase antibody revealed immunoreactivity only in malignant tissue. This was associated with NO synthase activity and localized to tumor cells. Thus NO synthase is present in human gynecological tumors, and its presence seems to correlate inversely with the differentiation of the tumor.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099048452", "source": "openalex"}

Some informed consent challenges are universal to medicine, whereas other challenges arise more commonly in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology than in other specialty areas. This Committee Opinion focuses on informed consent for adult patients in clinical practice and provides new guidance on the practical application of informed consent through shared decision making. The principles outlined in this Committee Opinion will help support the obstetrician–gynecologist in the patient-centered informed consent process.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4205756642", "source": "openalex"}

Worldwide, FGR is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term morbidity. Ongoing advances in clinical care, especially in definitions, diagnosis, and management of FGR, require efforts to effectively translate these changes to the wide range of obstetric care providers. This article highlights agreements based on current research in the diagnosis and management of FGR, and the areas that need more research to provide further clarification of recommendations. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of available evidence along with practical recommendations concerning the care of pregnancies at risk of or complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. To achieve these goals, FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) brought together international experts to review and summarize current knowledge of FGR. This summary is directed at multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, healthcare delivery organizations and providers, FIGO member societies, and professional organizations. Recognizing the variation in the resources and expertise available for the management of FGR in different countries or regions, this article attempts to take into consideration the unique aspects of antenatal care in low-resource settings (labelled \"LRS\" in the recommendations). This was achieved by collaboration with authors and FIGO member societies from low-resource settings such as India, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Aspects of FGR addressed in this article include prediction, diagnosis, investigation, management, and postpartum counselling. The main recommendations are given below and are summarized in Table 1 (section 8) and in the management algorithms for high-resource settings (Figure 1a) and low-resource settings (Figure 1b) (section 4). This article is directed at multiple stakeholders with the intention of bringing attention to the assessment of fetal growth, with a particular focus on the screening, diagnosis, and management of FGR, which is a leading cause of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This article proposes to standardize and provide guidance for the screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management of FGR. The intended target audience includes: Healthcare providers: all those qualified to care for pregnant women (obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, general practitioners, midwives, nurses, advance practice clinicians, radiologists, sonographers, pediatricians, and neonatologists). Healthcare delivery organizations and providers: governments, federal and state legislators, healthcare management organizations, health insurance organizations, international development agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. Professional organizations: international, regional, and national professional organizations of obstetricians and gynecologists, obstetric ultrasound, family practitioners, pediatricians, neonatologists, and worldwide national organizations dedicated to the care of pregnant women and their offspring. In assessing the quality of evidence and grading of strength of recommendations, the article follows the terminology proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group.5 This system uses consistent language and graphical descriptions for the strength and quality of the recommendations and the evidence on which they are based. Recommendations are classified as strong or conditional (weak) (Table S1).6 The strength of recommendation is dependent not only on the quality of evidence, but also on factors such as risk–benefit, cost, resource allocation, values, and preferences. Thus, some recommendations may be based on low-quality evidence but still represent a benefit that outweighs the risks and burdens, and therefore may be strongly recommended. The overall quality of evidence was assessed for each of the recommendations and expressed using four levels of quality: very low, low, moderate, and high (Table S2).7 Considerations for quality of evidence include primarily the study design and methodology. As such, evidence based on randomized controlled trials is considered high-quality evidence, observational studies provide moderate or low quality of evidence, and all others are very low. However, other parameters must be considered while assessing the level of evidence: risk of bias, study limitations, consistency of results, precision, publication bias, indirectness of evidence, and scarcity of evidence. For the quality of evidence, cross-filled circles are used: ⊕○○○ denotes very low-quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○ low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○ moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕ high-quality evidence. FGR is a common pregnancy complication that worldwide is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term neonatal morbidity.8-15 The definition, diagnosis, and optimal management of FGR have generated controversy as clinicians strive for more harmonized care. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the available evidence and provide recommendations regarding the early prediction and prevention, diagnosis, investigation, monitoring, and timing of delivery of pregnancies complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this pregnancy complication. Given the variation in resources and expertise available for the assessment and monitoring of pregnancies complicated by FGR in different countries or regions, we have included, in addition to the standard of care or \"best\" recommendations, specific recommendations for low-resource settings, which are marked as in the recommendation tables. Management algorithms for women in high-resource and low-resource settings are summarized in Figure 1a,b, respectively. FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Clinically, this is reflected by a drop in fetal size percentiles over the course of gestation. However, fetal growth potential is difficult to determine, and serial assessments of fetal size to detect a drop in fetal weight percentile are usually not available. Instead, care providers most commonly have only a \"snapshot\" of fetal weight estimation at a given point in time. Therefore, in clinical practice, small for gestational age (SGA), defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference below a certain threshold such as the 10th or 3rd percentile, is most commonly used to suspect FGR. The use of SGA as a proxy for FGR has several limitations that need to be recognized. First, most SGA fetuses are constitutionally healthy small fetuses, whose smallness is merely the result of their predetermined growth potential (i.e. false-positive diagnosis of FGR). Second, some growth-restricted fetuses, depending on their original growth potential and timing of insult, may remain above the percentile threshold described above and may thus not be SGA (i.e. false-negative diagnosis of FGR). Third, the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR is limited by the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation, which has an estimation error of up to ±15%–20%. Finally, the diagnosis of SGA is highly dependent on the growth chart being used, which can therefore have a considerable effect on the proportion of fetuses or infants flagged as SGA in a given population. It should be noted that there is inconsistency in the literature regarding the terminology described above, where some use the term FGR to describe a fetus with an estimated weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and the term SGA to describe an infant with birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. However, for the purpose of this article, the term SGA is used to indicate an EFW or birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, and the term FGR to refer to a small fetus that has failed to achieve its growth potential because of a pathologic process. The major member societies of FIGO follow a definition using the 10th percentile as a means of diagnosing an SGA fetus, which then leads to further testing, assessment, and follow-up. There are proposals to address the limitations of this definition, but their validity regarding reduction in adverse outcomes needs to be tested. For example, in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations described above, a consensus-based definition for placenta-mediated FGR has been proposed via a Delphi procedure.1 To decrease the likelihood of false-positive and false-negative diagnosis of FGR, the consensus definition was based on a combination of measures of fetal size (fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference) and abnormal Doppler findings in the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries, as described in Box 1. The implementation of this definition is limited by the lack of a recommendation on which growth chart should be used to define the 10th and 3rd percentiles for EFW and fetal abdominal circumference. In addition, further research is needed to correlate this definition with adverse perinatal outcomes. Early-onset FGR (<32 weeks) Late-onset FGR (≥32 weeks) Abbreviations: AC, fetal abdominal circumference; AREDV, absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity; CPR, cerebroplacental ratio; EFW, estimated fetal weight; PI, pulsatility index; UA, umbilical artery; UtA, uterine artery. Adapted from Gordijn et al.1 It has been suggested that FGR should be broadly classified, based on gestational age at the time of diagnosis, into early-onset FGR (<32 weeks) and late-onset FGR (≥32 weeks). The rationale underlying this classification is based on differences between these two phenotypes of FGR in severity, natural history, Doppler findings, association with hypertensive complications, placental findings, and management.16-18 Early-onset FGR has a prevalence of 0.5%–1%, is usually more severe, and is more likely to be associated with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler than late-onset FGR. The underlying placental pathology is frequently similar to that observed in cases of early-onset pre-eclampsia (maternal vascular malperfusion), which explains the strong association of early-onset FGR with pre-eclampsia. Therefore, early-onset FGR is usually easier to detect, and the natural history tends to follow a predictable sequence of Doppler changes in the umbilical artery and ductus venosus. The main challenge in cases of early-onset FGR is management (i.e. timing of delivery), by attempting to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity.19 Late-onset FGR is more common than early-onset FGR with a prevalence of 5%–10%. In contrast to early-onset FGR, it is usually milder, is less likely to be associated with pre-eclampsia, and is usually associated with normal umbilical artery Doppler. Therefore, the main challenge with regard to late-onset FGR is diagnosis, while management (i.e. delivery) is relatively simple given that the diagnosis is commonly made during the late-preterm or term periods, where the risks associated with delivery are relatively small. The diagnosis of late-onset FGR mainly relies on adaptive changes in the cerebral circulation (\"redistribution\" or \"brain-sparing effect\"), which is reflected by low resistance to flow in the middle cerebral artery thereby generating a low cerebroplacental ratio, as described in section 8.1.7. Given that the umbilical artery and ductus venosus Doppler studies are usually normal in cases of late-onset FGR, the natural history in these cases is less predictable and there is a risk of sudden decompensation and stillbirth.16, 19 FGR is often the result of one or more maternal, placental, or fetal disorders that interfere with the normal mechanisms regulating fetal growth.20, 21 The most common etiologies of FGR are listed in Box 2. It is important to note that there is often confusion in the literature between \"etiologies\" (or pathogenetic pathways) and \"risk factors\" for FGR. For example, although maternal conditions such as chronic hypertension, kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and long-standing diabetes are often listed as \"maternal etiologies\" for FGR, these conditions should probably be viewed instead as maternal risk factors for abnormal placentation that may result in placenta-mediated FGR. Given that maternal nutrition and fetal growth are closely related,22, 23 maternal undernutrition is an important cause of FGR worldwide.24-26 The impact of maternal undernutrition on fetal growth depends on its timing and severity.20 To date, maternal interventions in dietary advice and modifications have lacked significant success in preventing FGR. While the mechanisms by which maternal anemia contribute to FGR are unclear, both impaired nutrient transport to the fetus 27 and abnormal placental adaptation to low maternal hemoglobin 28 have been suggested as potential mechanisms. Abnormal placentation is a common cause of FGR, 29 which is often diagnosed by ultrasound Doppler studies 30 and typical histopathological placental findings.31-33 Chromosomal abnormalities have been suggested to contribute to up to 5% of FGR cases; triploidy and trisomy 13 and 18 are important considerations in early-onset FGR and the risk of many aneuploidies is higher in the presence of structural fetal anomalies.34-36 In 1%–6% of cases of FGR with normal karyotype, submicroscopic (micro) duplications/deletions can be found using chromosomal microarray analysis,35 even when FGR is an apparently isolated finding.37 FGR is also more prevalent in fetuses with structural malformations, and the risk increases when multiple anomalies are present.38 FGR is related to intrauterine infection in up to 5% of cases.20, 39 Viral agents such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and Zika are common causes of infection-related FGR.40-44 Protozoan infections like toxoplasmosis and malaria are another important cause, especially in endemic areas.45, 46 The main mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of FGR in these cases is a decline in cell population.20 Finally, maternal exposure to teratogens such as radiation,47 illicit drugs,48, 49 and alcohol50 is another important etiology for FGR. The main short- and long-term risks associated with FGR are listed in Box 3. It is associated with both fetal and obstetric complications. The most devastating complication is stillbirth,51-53 and there is a well-established inverse relationship between weight percentile and the risk of stillbirth,54-57 which is more pronounced in the early preterm period than at term.58 FGR is an important cause of iatrogenic preterm birth,59 as early delivery remains the main and perhaps only strategy for the prevention of stillbirth in cases of severe FGR.16, 60 FGR is also an independent risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth.61 Other obstetric complications associated with FGR include pre-eclampsia and placental abruption, as the pathophysiology of these conditions is often closely related.29, 30, 62-66 Despite ongoing improvements in neonatal care, FGR is associated with increased neonatal mortality and short-term morbidity. The risk of perinatal mortality in term FGR is reported to be five- to 10-fold higher than in appropriately grown neonates.57, 61, 67 The severity of FGR, Doppler abnormalities, and associated prematurity are independent predictors of neonatal complications.68 Among preterm infants, the co-presence of FGR further increases the risk of certain prematurity-related complications such as respiratory morbidity, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and metabolic disorders.57 Among term infants, FGR increases the risks of low cord artery pH,69 low Apgar score,69 and neonatal complications such as hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and jaundice.70-72 Growth-restricted infants are also at risk of long-term complications including neurodevelopmental impairment 11, 73-78 and noncommunicable diseases.15, 79-82 This is discussed in greater detail in section 9.1 (Infant follow-up). Early prediction of FGR is important as it can identify women at high risk of FGR who may benefit from preventive interventions and close monitoring during pregnancy. Box 4 lists the most common risk factors for FGR. While the predictive value of individual risk factors is low, clinical prediction models that are based on combinations of the risk factors outlined below can considerably improve the prediction of FGR. One important limitation of most of the studies on early prediction of FGR is the lack of a gold standard for the antenatal or postnatal diagnosis of FGR. As such, there is wide variation among studies regarding the outcomes being predicted, including either SGA (birth weight below the 10th or 3rd percentile) or adverse perinatal outcomes that are associated with (but are not specific to) FGR. As many SGA infants are constitutionally small and healthy, differentiating between healthy small fetuses and those that are small due to FGR is critically important. As a rule, the prediction of early-onset severe FGR is better than of late-onset FGR.

Several maternal factors influence fetal growth and the risk of FGR: advanced maternal age, racial/ethnic origin (e.g. South Asian), consanguinity, low body mass index, nulliparity, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, assisted reproductive technology, and medical disorders such as chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune conditions (Box 4).83-89 Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for FGR and reduces birth weight by an average of 200 g in a dose–response manner.90 In a cohort of 33 602 pregnancies, maternal characteristics predicted 37% of women who subsequently delivered SGA neonates (birth weight <5th percentile) at a false-positive rate of 10%.83 Some risk factors for FGR are especially relevant in low-resource countries. In a recent review from Africa, the main risk factors reported were low maternal nutritional status, HIV infection, malaria, and hypertensive diseases. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that to a large extent FGR in Africa is preventable through established interventions for malaria, HIV, and maternal undernutrition.42 In addition, exposure during pregnancy and lactation to toxic environmental chemicals and heavy metals has become a growing problem, especially in low-resource countries.91 At this point there is no role for routine screening with serum biomarkers for FGR. However, when biochemical markers are available as part of prenatal genetic screening for trisomy 21, it may be reasonable to use this information for the purpose of risk stratification for FGR. The placenta releases multiple factors into maternal circulation from the early stages of pregnancy, and first-trimester serum levels of some of these factors have been shown to be associated with subsequent placenta-mediated complications.92, 93 Low levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a placental glycoprotein produced by the syncytiotrophoblast layer, have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. A meta-analysis including 32 studies and 175 240 pregnancies found that PAPP-A levels below the 5th percentile had a moderate association with birth weight below the 10th percentile (OR 2.08, positive predictive value of 18%), while the association was stronger for PAPP-A levels below the 1st percentile (OR 3.4; positive predictive value of 28%).94 Thus, although women with low PAPP-A are at increased risk for FGR, the majority of these women will have a normal pregnancy outcome, especially as an isolated biomarker in healthy women. However, a low PAPP-A level is often considered an indication for closer monitoring of fetal growth.95 Elevated second-trimester maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein are thought to reflect abnormal placental permeability and are associated with increased risk of placenta-mediated complications including FGR and stillbirth.96, 97 The combination of low PAPP-A in the first trimester and high alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester is particularly predictive of severe FGR.98 Elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels greater than 2.5 MoM in the second trimester, alone or combined with high alpha-fetoprotein levels, are also associated with an increased risk of SGA.99 Angiogenic factors play a key role in the regulation of placental vascular development.100 Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a proangiogenic factor highly expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast and the maternal endothelium. Impaired placentation is associated with reduced placental production of this protein. Low first-trimester PlGF levels have been shown to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome including pre-eclampsia and SGA.101-104 In a case–control study of 296 pregnancies with SGA and 609 controls, the detection rate of low PlGF for SGA at a false-positive rate of 5% and 10% was 15% and 21%, respectively. The combined use of PlGF and PAPP-A increased the detection rate to 19% and 27%, respectively.103 A multicenter screening study found that the detection rate of a combined screening by maternal factors, fetal biometry, and serum PlGF and alpha-fetoprotein at 19–24 weeks for the delivery of SGA infants below the 5th percentile at less than 32, 32–36, and greater than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation was 100%, 76%, and 38%, respectively, at a false-positive rate of 10%.96 Findings are less consistent for soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an antiangiogenic factor released from the placenta that results in maternal endothelial dysfunction characteristic of pre-eclampsia.105 Although maternal serum sFlt-1 levels are known to be elevated in pre-eclamptic pregnancies, a large case–control study demonstrated that high levels of sFlt-1 at 10–14 weeks were actually associated with a slightly reduced risk of SGA (OR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.96).101 Therefore, the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio test used to diagnose pre-eclampsia should not be used in the first trimester as a screening test for FGR.106 Several ultrasound-based markers have been shown to be predictive of FGR, including uterine artery Doppler, placental morphology, and placental volumes. However, given their modest predictive accuracy, they cannot be recommended for universal screening for FGR. Increased uterine artery resistance largely reflects a failure of extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion and transformation of the spiral arteries and is associated with the development of pre-eclampsia and FGR due to maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta.107 First- and second-trimester abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, defined as mean pulsatility index above the 95th percentile, have been shown to be associated with FGR.108-110 In a large prospective cohort study of 4610 nulliparous women, uterine artery pulsatility index at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks predicted 60% of preterm and 17% of term SGA infants at a false-positive rate of 10%.111 Although uterine artery Doppler shows promise, especially for the prediction of early-onset FGR, current evidence does not support routine screening with uterine artery Doppler for FGR in low- or high-risk pregnancies.112 Sonographic evaluation of the placenta is a routine part of the obstetric ultrasound examination. A method for systematic two-dimensional (2D) placental ultrasound examination has been described, often in combination with other parameters 30, 113, 114 Abnormal placental morphology is defined by placental dimensions, shape, texture, and cord insertion. Placental shape is considered abnormal when the placental thickness is above 4 cm or greater than 50% of placental length. Placental texture is defined as normal when it is homogenous, and abnormal when the placenta is heterogeneous and contains multiple echogenic cystic lesions or has a jelly-like appearance with turbulent uteroplacental flow.115, 116 Placental cord insertion is defined as central (>2 cm from placental disc margin), marginal (within 2 cm of margin), or velamentous (inserting into the surrounding membranes).114 In a cohort of 60 high-risk women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler, women with abnormal placental shape at 19–23 weeks had higher odds of FGR (OR 4.7) than women with normal placental shape.108 However, the use of 2D placental imaging has significant limitations, including difficulty in assessing nonanterior placentas and a wide variability in the morphology of normal placentas. Furthermore, there are no large-scale prospective studies validating the use of this modality for prediction of FGR.114 Improvements in ultrasonographic imaging provide a tool for estimating placental volume using three- and four-dimensional scanning techniques. Placental volume has been proposed as a marker for various obstetric complications related to defective placental function, including FGR.117, 118 A systematic review estimating the value of first-trimester 3D placental volume for the prediction of SGA found a detection rate of 24.7% at a 10% false-positive rate.119 Another parameter is the placental quotient, defined as the ratio of the placental volume to the fetal crown–rump length. The placental quotient was reported to have a high negative predictive value for perinatal complications but was not very useful when used for screening of SGA in a low-risk population, with a sensitivity of 27.1%.120 The discriminatory ability of placental volume alone for SGA appears to be modest, but may be integrated into a multivariable screening model. However, the use of 3D placental volume as a routine screening tool for FGR is limited by the need for proper equipment and training required to obtain these measurements in a reproducible manner. Currently there is no single screening test sufficiently predictive of FGR to recommend routine clinical use. Investigations are underway to combine various tests, but such prediction models have not been sufficiently validated in terms of outcomes studies and therefore must be considered investigative protocols at this time. In a prospective cohort of 4970 women, the combination of first-trimester maternal serum PAPP-A, beta hCG, maternal blood pressure, and uterine artery Doppler performed in the first trimester had a detection rate of 73% for early SGA (<34 weeks) but only 32% for late SGA (≥34 weeks).19 A different model that included maternal characteristics, first-trimester blood pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, PlGF, and sFlt-1 was evaluated in a larger cohort of 9150 women and achieved a detection rate of 86% for early-onset FGR and 66% for late-onset FGR, both at a false-positive rate of 10%.19, 121 In the second trimester, the SCOPE consortium examined 5606 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies and found that the combination of clinical risk factors, 15-week biomarkers (53 biomarkers were used), and 20-week ultrasound (fetal biometry and Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries) had only a moderate detection rate for SGA below the 10th percentile, with a positive predictive value of 32% and a negative predictive value of 91%.122 Ideally, all women should plan their pregnancies, adopting a healthy lifestyle and optimizing any medical conditions and their body mass index. The preconception period provides an opportunity for health promotion with the aim of reducing accepted risk factors, including those associated with FGR.123 Insufficient gestational weight gain has been associated with an increased risk of FGR, especially in women with low body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).124 Recognizing that these associations are only based on observational data, we still believe that it would be reasonable to recommend monitoring of weight gain and informing women of the target weight gain range, as recommended by the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines.125 These guidelines recommend a total gestational weight gain of 12.5–18 kg (28–40 lb) for underweight women (BMI <18.5); 11.5–16 kg (25–35 lb) for the normal weight group (BMI 18.5–24.9); 7–11.5 kg (15–25 lb) for overweight women (BMI 25.0–29.9); and 5–9 kg (11–20 lb) for obese women (BMI ≥30).126 Substance use, including smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs, is associated with low birth weight and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.90 Interventions to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy have been shown to result in a reduction in low birth weight (RR 0.81) and an increase in mean birth weight (+33 g).127 Women should be advised that smoking cessation at any point in gestation is of benefit, and that the greatest benefit is associated with cessation before 15 weeks of pregnancy.128 The risk of SGA with alcohol intake is increased with as little as one drink per day.129 Most studies on early prevention of placental complications have focused on pre-eclampsia, with the results often being extrapolated to FGR due to the common pathophysiology. However, to date, other than lifestyle modifications, no medical interventions to prevent FGR have been clearly established. Aspirin is recommended for women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia, but there is some evidence that it may a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3139210974", "source": "openalex"}

Complications, transfusion, reoperation, length of stay, death, and cost for women who underwent robotic hysterectomy compared with both abdominal and laparoscopic procedures were analyzed.Use of robotically assisted hysterectomy increased from 0.5% in 2007 to 9.5% of all hysterectomies in 2010. During the same time period, laparoscopic hysterectomy rates increased from 24.3% to 30.5%. Three years after the first robotic procedure at hospitals where robotically assisted hysterectomy was performed, robotically assisted hysterectomy accounted for 22.4% of all hysterectomies. The rates of abdominal hysterectomy decreased both in hospitals where robotic-assisted hysterectomy was performed as well as in those where it was not performed. In a propensity score-matched analysis, the overall complication rates were similar for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic hysterectomy (5.5% vs 5.3%; relative risk [RR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.86-1.24). Although patients who underwent a robotic-assisted hysterectomy were less likely to have a length of stay longer than 2 days (19.6% vs 24.9%; RR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.67-0.92), transfusion requirements (1.4% vs 1.8%; RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.55-1.16) and the rate of discharge to a nursing facility (0.2% vs 0.3%; RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.35-1.76) were similar. Total costs associated with robotically assisted hysterectomy were $2189 (95% CI, $2030-$2349) more per case than for laparoscopic hysterectomy.Between 2007 and 2010, the use of robotically assisted hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disorders increased substantially. Robotically assisted and laparoscopic hysterectomy had similar morbidity profiles, but the use of robotic technology resulted in substantially more costs.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164803605", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 301 mixed mesodermal tumors (MMT), 167 were homologous (HO), and 134 were heterologous (HE). Fifty‐nine tumors were leiomyosarcomas (LM). The remaining 93 sarcomas were predominantly stromal cell and adenosarcomas. For this study, only the MMT or LM tumors were analyzed. The recurrence rate for all MMT was 53% (HO, 44%; HE, 63%). The recurrence rate for LM was 71%. The site of the first recurrence included the pelvis in 21% of MMT and 14% in LM. Factors significantly related to progression‐free interval (PFI) by univariate analysis among MMT were adnexal spread, lymph node metastases, tumor size, lymphatic‐vascular space involvement, histologic grade, cell type, age, peritoneal cytologic findings, and depth of uterine tumor site of invasion.

As an obstetrics and gynecology physician or provider, you will likely encounter women who are at risk of development or relapse of a mental disorder during this vulnerable time. Objective The aim of this review is to examine theory and research on mood and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period with an emphasis on screening recommendations. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed and PsycINFO search for English-language publications about perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and screening was performed and included studies on subtopics. Results The literature reviewed suggests that perinatal mood and anxiety symptoms are prevalent and have significant consequences, and best practices for early detection are through routine depression and anxiety screening in the obstetrics setting. This includes overcoming barriers to care and use of liaison services to potentially reduce risk. Conclusions and Relevance High-quality prenatal care systems should develop the capacity for depression and anxiety risk assessment and treatment. Providers should routinely screen using validated screening tools, provide maternal mental health education, and be aware of the various medical, psychological, and complementary approaches for treating mood and anxiety disorders, to best guide and refer patients. The use of this practice will increase the quality of life in pregnant women with depression and anxiety and may help to reduce the likelihood of adverse birth outcomes, postpartum mental health problems, and adverse effects on offspring. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to name 3 adverse birth outcomes related to prenatal symptoms of depression and anxiety; identify symptoms, prevalence, and consequences of depression and anxiety in pregnancy and postpartum; and contrast and apply reliable, valid, and widely used screening tools to assess for depression and anxiety and practice appropriate referral for this population.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2751991476", "source": "openalex"}

From 1975 to 2000, medical malpractice costs for obstetrician–gynecologists have risen nearly four-fold higher than that of other medical costs. In addition, it has been estimated that defensive medicine may cost society $80 billion per year. Most importantly, many obstetrician–gynecologists are frustrated and seem to be abandoning the parts of their practice they perceive to put them at higher liability risk. This article discusses other medical specialty society efforts that have been successful in addressing the area of patient safety. Efforts to better track quality outcomes has been initiated by the American College of Surgeons through the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists has demonstrated both dramatically improved outcomes and reduced liability costs through a concerted patient safety effort. The author proposes changes in four areas to specifically address patient safety in obstetrics and gynecology, including: the development of reliable and reproducible quality control measures (and a system to track them); national closed claim reviews to better understand and address the most important safety and liability areas for obstetrician–gynecologists; work prospectively with pharmaceutical and surgical device manufacturers to develop innovative new products that would increase the likelihood of safe outcomes; and create a culture of safety in obstetrics and gynecology by incorporating safety education into all levels of training. Systematic focus on patient safety, with specific recommendations for improvements, is needed in obstetrics and gynecology.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980825397", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Three groups of 10 doctors with different levels of ultrasound experience in obstetrics and gynecology were included. The novices had less than 1 month of experience, the intermediate group had 12-60 months of experience and the senior participants were all consultants. Fifteen participants performed transabdominal fetal biometry and the other 15 participants performed systematic transvaginal gynecological ultrasound scans. All scans were video-recorded and assessed by two blinded consultants using the OSAUS scale. The OSAUS scores were compared between the groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and pass/fail scores were determined using the contrasting-groups method of standard setting. RESULTS: For the transabdominal fetal biometry examinations, the mean ± SD OSAUS scores of the novices, intermediates and senior participants were 1.5 ± 0.4, 3.3 ± 0.6 and 4.4 ± 0.4, respectively (P = 0.003). For the systematic transvaginal scans, the mean ± SD OSAUS scores of the novices, intermediates and senior participants were 1.8 ± 0.2, 3.1 ± 0.1 and 3.9 ± 0.5, respectively (P = 0.003). Post-hoc comparisons showed significant differences between each of the groups for both types of scans. The pass/fail score was 2.5 for the transvaginal scan and 3.0 for the transabdominal biometry examinations. The inter-rater reliability was 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound competence can be assessed in a reliable and valid way using the OSAUS scale.

Compared to the number of registered treatments in 2008, when the cycle‐based registry was newly introduced, there was a 2.07‐fold increase in the total number of treatments and a 2.25‐fold increase in the number of cycles with a live birth. As the average age of patients who receive assisted reproductive technology has become markedly higher year by year, the most common age of those patients who received assisted reproductive technology in 2014 was 40 years. Conclusion The total numbers of both assisted reproductive technology treatments and assisted reproductive technology live births are likely to be higher in the future. In addition, the trend toward aging patients seems to be continuing into the future.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606313022", "source": "openalex"}

Three of four (75.5%) respondents reported working between 61 and 100 hours each week. Most (71.3%) reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call. Eight of ten reported having postcall clinical responsibilities. The reported number of hours on call declined and the reported number of hours of sleep increased with year of residency. Three of four residents wanted limits on their work hours. Residents who reported longer on-call hours or less sleep during night shift were significantly more likely to want a restriction on work hours. Fatigue was the most commonly selected reason (77.6%) followed by \"need more personal time\" (76.3%), and \"fear of compromising quality of care\" (59.8%). Women were more concerned about fatigue than were men. Among residents who did not want work hour restrictions, \"additional surgical experience\" was the most commonly selected reason (69.0%).Residents in obstetrics and gynecology report working long hours, and experiencing periods of little sleep. Most want their work hours to be limited. Fatigue is a major concern among residents that want their hours limited.

This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3006809786", "source": "openalex"}

However, it has been used widely in obstetrics and gynecology practice because of its effectiveness, low cost, stability in light and hot climate conditions, and ease of administration compared with its licensed counterparts—dinoprostone and gemeprost. A large number of studies have shown that misoprostol is effective in first and second trimester abortion, late pregnancy labor induction, and third stage of labor management (misoprostol has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for these indications). Because misoprostol is not registered for such use, it has not undergone the extensive testing for appropriate dosage and safety required for registration. Serious complications such as teratogenesis after failed abortions and uterine rupture during second trimester abortions and third trimester labor induction have been reported as the result of increasingly wide use of misoprostol in obstetric and gynecology practice.

The extent of the professional barriers physicians face trying to integrate abortion into their practice is unknown.In 2006, in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 obstetrician-gynecologists who had graduated 5-10 years earlier from residency programs that included abortion training. Interviews about physicians' experiences with abortion training and practice were coded and analyzed using a grounded theoretical approach.Eighteen physicians had wanted to offer elective abortions after residency, but only three were doing so at the time of the interview. The majority were unable to provide abortions because of formal and informal policies imposed by their private group practices, employers and hospitals, as well as the strain that doing so might put on relationships with superiors and coworkers. Restrictions on abortion provision sometimes were made explicit when new physicians interviewed for a job, but sometimes became apparent only after they had joined a practice or institution. Several physicians mentioned the threat of violence as an obstacle to providing abortions, but few considered this the greatest deterrent.The stigma and ideological contention surrounding abortion manifest themselves in professional environments as barriers to the integration of abortion into medical practice.

Prolonged median survival can be achieved in those patients entirely free of tumor after surgery by the administration of postsurgical platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. However, residual tumor is present in the majority of patients, which limits survival prognosis. Different therapy approaches should be utilized to improve prognosis in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce “downstaging” of the tumor and thus improve operability. Here, evidence of large ascites volume (>500 mL) can be used to identify those patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS In a prospective, nonrandomized Phase II study, 31 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received 3 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy, followed by tumor debulking surgery and 3 additional cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy. During the same period, 32 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received conventional therapy (tumor debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy). The two groups were investigated and compared with respect to tumor resection rates, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery, duration of surgery, and median survival. RESULTS The tumor resection rate in the patient group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that of the conventionally treated group; the median survival time of 42 months versus 23 months also was significantly longer (P = 0.007). Time spent in surgery, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of FIGO Stage IIIC who will benefit only marginally from conventional therapy can be identified by evidence of large ascites volume. Higher tumor resection rates and longer median survival can be achieved in these patients by the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A prospective randomized multicenter study currently is being performed by the Society for Gynecological Oncology in Germany to confirm these findings.

METHODS: This is an observational study conducted through web sites of U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residency programs accredited in 2012–2013. RESULTS: In obstetrics and gynecology departmental administrative leadership roles, women comprised 20.4% of chairs, 36.1% of vice chairs, and 29.6% of division directors. Among educational leaders, women comprised 31.9% of fellowship directors, 47.3% of residency directors, and 66.1% of medical student clerkship directors. Chairs were most likely to be maternal–fetal medicine faculty (38.2%) followed by specialists in general obstetrics and gynecology (21.8%), reproductive endocrinologists (15.6%), and gynecologic oncologists (14.7%). Among chairs, 32.9% are male maternal–fetal medicine specialists.

Currently, no studies of US OB/GYN residents exist that question their knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward discussing age-related fertility decline and oocyte cryopreservation with patients.A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the fall of 2014 among residents in American Council for Graduate (ACOG) Medical Education-approved OB/GYN residency programs. Program directors were emailed via the ACOG Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology server listing and asked to solicit resident participation.Participants included 238 residents evenly distributed between post-graduate years 1-4 with varied post-residency plans; 90% of residents were women and 75% were 26-30 years old. The survey was divided into three sections: demographics, fertility awareness, and attitudes toward discussing fertility preservation options with patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted.A strong majority of residents (83%) believed an OB/GYN should initiate discussions about age-related fertility decline with patients (mean patient age 31.8), and 73% percent believed these discussions should be part of an annual exam. One third of residents overestimated the age at which there is a slight decline in female fertility, while nearly half of residents overestimated the age at which female fertility markedly declines. Over three-quarters of residents (78.4%) also overestimated the likelihood of success using assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). Residents were likely to support oocyte cryopreservation in cancer patients irrespective of the woman's age, but much less likely to support elective oocyte cryopreservation. For elective oocyte cryopreservation, 40% believed OB/GYNs should initiate discussions with patients (mean age 31.1), while only 20% believed this topic should be part of an annual exam.Because the study invitation was sent through US OB/GYN residency program directors rather than directly to residents, it is possible that some residents did not receive the invitation to participate. This limits the generalizability of the findings.Within the USA, there appears to be a critical need for improved education on fertility decline in OB/GYN residency programs. To promote informed reproductive decision-making among patients, efforts should be made to help OB/GYNs provide comprehensive fertility education to all women, while also respecting patient choices.None.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2235432447", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Methodologic criteria for reporting logistic regression analyses were developed to identify problems affecting accuracy, precision, and interpretation of this approach to multivariable statistical analysis. These criteria were applied to 193 articles that reported multivariable logistic regression in the issues of four generic obstetrics and gynecology journals in 1985, 1990, and 1995. Rates of compliance with the methodologic criteria and their time trends were analyzed. Results: The proportion of articles using logistic regression analysis increased over time: 1.7% in 1985, 2.8% in 1990, and 6.5% in 1995 (P < .001 for trend). Violations and omissions of methodologic criteria for reporting logistic models were common. The research question, in terms of dependent and independent variables, was not clearly reported in 32.1%. The process of variable selection was inadequately described in 51.8% of the articles. Among articles with ranked independent variables, 85.1% did not report assessment of conformity to linear gradient. Tests for goodness of fit were not given in 93.2% of articles. The contribution of the independent variables could not be evaluated in 36.2% of the articles because of a lack of coding of the variables. Interactions between variables were not assessed in 86.4% of articles. Analysis of variations in the quality of logistic regression analyses over time showed no increase in reporting of the criteria concerning variable selection and goodness of fit. However, the proportion of articles reporting one quality criterion concerning interpretation of the substantive significance of independent variables showed a trend toward improvement: 42.3% in 1985, 73.6% in 1990, and 75.4% in 1995 (P = .004 for trend). Conclusion: The reporting of multivariable logistic regression models in the obstetrics and gynecology literature is poor, and the time trends of improvement in quality of reporting are not particularly encouraging.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994059850", "source": "openalex"}

Two of the newer genetic technologies in the prenatal setting are chromosomal microarray and whole-exome sequencing. Chromosomal microarray analysis is a method of measuring gains and losses of DNA throughout the human genome. It can identify chromosomal aneuploidy and other large changes in the structure of chromosomes as well as submicroscopic abnormalities that are too small to be detected by traditional modalities. Prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis is recommended for a patient with a fetus with one or more major structural abnormalities identified on ultrasonographic examination and who is undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis. Whole-genome sequencing analyzes the entire genome, including noncoding regions (introns) and coding regions (exons). However, because the introns are typically of little clinical relevance, there has been a focus instead on whole-exome sequencing, which examines the coding regions (exons) of the genome. The exons generally have greater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. However, the routine use of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4244360267", "source": "openalex"}

Outcome measurements include the number and stage of screen-detected cancers, the number and stage of cancers not detected at screening, the number of equivocal screening results requiring recall/repetition, and the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease.Thirteen epithelial ovarian malignancies (12 invasive and one borderline), developed in the cohort. Ten tumors were detected at screening: three International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I (including borderline), two stage II, four stage III, and one stage IV. Of the three cancers not detected by screening, two were stage III and one was stage IV; 29 women underwent diagnostic surgery but were found not to have ovarian cancer.Annual surveillance by transvaginal ultrasound scanning and serum CA-125 measurement in women at increased familial risk of ovarian cancer is ineffective in detecting tumors at a sufficiently early stage to influence prognosis. With a positive predictive value of 17% and a sensitivity of less than 50%, the performance of ultrasound does not satisfy the WHO screening standards. In addition, the combined protocol has a particularly high false-positive rate in premenopausal women, leading to unnecessary surgical intervention.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170878671", "source": "openalex"}

Prolonged median survival can be achieved in those patients entirely free of tumor after surgery by the administration of postsurgical platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. However, residual tumor is present in the majority of patients, which limits survival prognosis. Different therapy approaches should be utilized to improve prognosis in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce \"downstaging\" of the tumor and thus improve operability. Here, evidence of large ascites volume (>500 mL) can be used to identify those patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In a prospective, nonrandomized Phase II study, 31 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received 3 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy, followed by tumor debulking surgery and 3 additional cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy. During the same period, 32 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received conventional therapy (tumor debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy). The two groups were investigated and compared with respect to tumor resection rates, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery, duration of surgery, and median survival.The tumor resection rate in the patient group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that of the conventionally treated group; the median survival time of 42 months versus 23 months also was significantly longer (P = 0.007). Time spent in surgery, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery were not significantly different.Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of FIGO Stage IIIC who will benefit only marginally from conventional therapy can be identified by evidence of large ascites volume. Higher tumor resection rates and longer median survival can be achieved in these patients by the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The questionnaire asked patients about their comfort levels with having medical students present during commonly encountered clinical situations. A random subsample of these patients were also asked whether they would allow a medical student to be present during future visits, and why or why not.A total of 229 patients completed the survey and 124 responded to the supplemental survey. Sixteen respondents were excluded due to missing data or a lack of an adequate comparison group. A majority responded they would feel comfortable having a medical student present during most clinical situations. Almost half of the patients preferred to see the doctor and medical student together, while less than a quarter wanted to see just the physician. Patients with more experience with medical students were more likely to favor medical student involvement and would feel more comfortable having a medical student present during obstetrics or gynecology clinical situations.Patients are willing to involve and feel comfortable with medical students in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic.

Evidence based on meta-analyses of individual case-control studies is accumulating, defining specific individual variations in disease susceptibility. For example, genetic variations of the estradiol metabolism have been described as significant contributors to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. In the field of obstetrics and gynecology, the genetic contribution of polymorphic markers to a series of disorders has been characterized. These disorders include recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-related complications such as thrombosis. Among other genetic markers, thrombophilic genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A polymorphisms, as well as genetic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for example, CYP19 and CYP1B1, have been established as genetic risk markers and disease modifiers of recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss and HRT-independent and -dependent breast cancer, respectively. In addition, meta-analyses of data in the literature established the TGFBR1*6A, GSTP I105V, and TP53 R72P polymorphisms, as well as the GSTM1 gene deletion as low-penetrance genetic risk factors of sporadic breast cancer. With respect to genetic modulation of therapeutic effects, beneficial effects of estrogen replacement therapy and HRT are modulated by the carriage of single nucleotide polymorphisms, for example, osteoprotection and blood lipid changes by the estrogen receptor-α (ER-a) PvuII polymorphism. Polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), ER-α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and Factor V genes have been demonstrated to modulate the timing of natural menopause. Lastly, a strong genetic contribution of polymorphisms to the development and the clinical course of endometriosis has been established with data pointing to polymorphisms of the COMT, GST, NAT-2, and ER-α genes as susceptibility markers. In summary, the available evidence points to a number of polymorphisms of a wide variety of genes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign and malignant gynecologic and obstetric conditions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160293805", "source": "openalex"}

New insights and more experience were gained since the first consensus meeting 5 years ago. METHODS: Members of the European Society of Gynecological Oncology task force \"Cancer in Pregnancy\" in concert with other international experts reviewed the existing literature on their respective areas of expertise. The summaries were subsequently merged into a complete article that served as a basis for discussion during the consensus meeting. All participants approved the final article. RESULTS: In the experts' view, cancer can be successfully treated during pregnancy in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, optimizing maternal treatment while considering fetal safety. To maximize the maternal outcome, cancer treatment should follow a standard treatment protocol as for nonpregnant patients. Iatrogenic prematurity should be avoided. Individualization of treatment and effective psychologic support is imperative to provide throughout the pregnancy period. Diagnostic procedures, including staging examinations and imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging and sonography, are preferable. Pelvic surgery, either open or laparoscopic, as part of a treatment protocol, may reveal beneficial outcomes and is preferably performed by experts. Most standard regimens of chemotherapy can be administered from 14 weeks gestational age onward. Apart from cervical and vulvar cancer, as well as important vulvar scarring, the mode of delivery is determined by the obstetrician. Term delivery is aimed for. Breast-feeding should be considered based on individual drug safety and neonatologist-breast-feeding expert's consult. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited evidence-based information, cancer treatment during pregnancy can succeed. State-of-the-art treatment should be provided for this vulnerable population to preserve maternal and fetal prognosis.

Patients and Methods A retrospective review of 360 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV EOC who underwent primary surgery followed by six cycles of intravenous platinum/paclitaxel was performed. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of potential prognostic factors with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results The median PFS and OS for this group of stage IV ovarian cancer patients was 12 and 29 months, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that histology, malignant pleural effusion, intraparenchymal liver metastasis, and residual tumor size were significant prognostic variables. Whereas patients with microscopic residual disease had the best outcome, patients with 0.1 to 1.0 cm residual disease and patients with 1.1 to 5.0 cm residual disease had similar PFS and OS. Patients with a residual size more than 5 cm had a diminished PFS and OS when compared with all other groups. Median OS for microscopic, 0.1 to 5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm residual disease was 64, 30, and 19 months, respectively. Conclusion Patients with more than 5 cm residual disease have the shortest PFS and OS, whereas patients with 0.1 to 1.0 and 1.1 to 5.0 cm have similar outcome. These findings suggest that ultraradical cytoreductive procedures might be targeted for selected patients in whom microscopic residual disease is achievable. Patients with less than 5.0 cm of disease initially and significant disease and/or comorbidities precluding microscopic cytoreduction may be considered for alternative therapeutic options other than primary cytoreduction.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167610363", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2722685099", "title": "FIGO's updated recommendations for misoprostol used alone in gynecology and obstetrics", "text": "In 2012, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) produced a chart detailing recommended dosages of misoprostol when used alone, for a variety of gynecologic and obstetric indications. In light of new evidence1-13 and through expert deliberation, this chart has now been revised and expanded (Fig. 1). Some areas were particularly challenging to develop given the limited, low-quality, or inconsistent evidence. The present commentary is intended to explain some of the changes and decisions made. The layout is now categorized vertically by gestation and horizontally by indication. Gestation is labelled and referred to as the number of weeks of gestation (<13 weeks, 13–26 weeks, and >26 weeks), with the final column being for postpartum use. However, in the case of incomplete abortion under 13 weeks, and inevitable abortion between 13–26 weeks, women should be treated on the basis of their uterine size rather than last menstrual period dating. Recommendations have been added for inevitable abortion and cervical preparation between 13 and 26 weeks, and for termination of pregnancy at more than 26 weeks. For less than 13 weeks' gestation, we decided to recommend a fixed number of doses without specifying a maximum. This is because many early pregnancy regimens will be used on an outpatient basis, so it is useful for healthcare providers to know in advance how many doses to give the client; there is also sufficient evidence to support a fixed number of doses for use in pregnancies of less than 13 weeks' gestation, as well as evidence that it is safe to give further doses if they are required.1-4, 14 For 13–26 weeks' gestation, the notion of a maximum number of doses has been extrapolated from clinical research in which maximum doses are commonly noted not on the basis of patient safety issues or efficacy,9 but rather as tangible endpoints. In clinical practice, however, they might not have great utility, and dosing should continue until expulsion, in the absence of rare complications. Suggesting that providers should discontinue dosing could actually increase risks, particularly when providers have few alternatives available if expulsion has not yet occurred. Some unpublished studies and clinical experience have shown that complete expulsion can be safely achieved by continuing the regimen up to 72 hours, without compromising the woman's safety.9 Given recently published evidence,2-9 we have added alternative routes for taking misoprostol; in most cases, this has meant the addition of the buccal route, in which the tablets are placed in the cheek for 30 minutes after which any remnants are swallowed. This route has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to the vaginal route. Further ongoing studies are indicating this to be a promising route for other indications on the chart, but these indications have not been included because data on efficacy have not been reported. Future studies will continue to provide evidence on what might be a variety of effective regimens and routes of administration. Although this could result in several available options for providers, it will also enable women's preferences to be taken into consideration. Women's preferences can vary, with some preferring the vaginal route (if inserting the pills themselves) and some preferring non-vaginal routes. However, the vaginal route should be avoided when there is bleeding and/or signs of infection. The chart does not include the rectal route. We recommend against using this route because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. The use of misoprostol at 13–26 weeks' gestation in women with previous cesarean or transmural uterine scar was debated because of concerns about an increased risk of uterine rupture. For fetal death, a Cochrane meta-analysis15 reported mixed findings, concluding that the data were insufficient to assess the occurrence of uterine rupture. A few studies have reported no increased likelihood of rupture,16 but often women with prior cesarean or uterine surgery are excluded from studies or reviews, or trials are insufficiently powered to detect a difference in safety outcomes as a result of the rarity of major adverse events. There is some evidence that, for terminations in this period, the risk of uterine rupture among women with a prior cesarean delivery using misoprostol is less than 0.3%1, 17; other studies9, 18-20 concluded that there are no significant differences in outcomes for women with previous cesarean(s). We therefore concluded that misoprostol can be used for women with previous cesarean or other transmural uterine scar throughout 13–26 weeks. There is insufficient evidence available to recommend a regimen of misoprostol for use at more than 26 weeks' gestation in women who have had a previous cesarean or transmural uterine scar. Therefore, without evidence to support a safe regimen, we do not provide one, other than to recommend following local protocol in these cases. Although there is some evidence to support a decreasing dose with increasing gestational age, there is little evidence to support the advice given in some international and national clinical guidelines to use lower doses of misoprostol in cases of fetal death. Irrespective of the issue of recommendations for different doses, various reviews15, 20, 21 have concluded that there is insufficient evidence overall of superiority of one dose or schedule of misoprostol over another for use in pregnancies at or over 13 weeks' gestation. In making recommendations, we acknowledged that providers might be keen to identify lowest possible doses because of reduced adverse effects,21 but that it was also important to consider success rates and time to delivery: low doses have been shown to be associated with a longer induction-to-delivery interval and lower overall effectiveness,15, 21 and evidence has supported the safety of the \"higher\" doses for women.7-9 Recommendations in the chart were compiled with this in mind, while also acknowledging that it is possible that a range of dosages could be effective and safe. There have been two studies of the use of misoprostol for the treatment of retained placenta following live birth, neither of which show any benefit over placebo.22 We therefore do not recommend misoprostol for retained placenta in late pregnancy. Secondary prevention is a community-based strategy that has been shown to be a comparable alternative to a universal prophylaxis approach in two large community trials (one in press).12 Rather than medicating all women during the third stage of labor with a prophylactic dose, a regimen of 800 μg sublingual misoprostol (the same as for treatment) can be used to treat only women with higher-than-average bleeding (e.g. approximately 350 mL or more). Although there is limited published data, it was agreed that secondary prevention of PPH is a strong alternative approach to universal prophylaxis, because it involves medicating far fewer women (5%–10% vs 100%), thus causing fewer adverse effects and reducing costs. The FIGO Misoprostol-only Recommended Regimens 2017 chart (Fig. 1) is the result of extensive collaboration among an international expert group. It has been endorsed by the FIGO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion Working Group and the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee, and approved by the FIGO Officers. Available in other languages and formats from http://figo.org, it is hoped that it will be as widely distributed and used as the previous version. Although these recommended dosages have been decided on the basis of current evidence available and expert opinion, new evidence is regularly emerging and thus there is a need to review and revise these recommendations in the future. Misoprostol is an important medicine and, although it should not be used in preference over oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage, or instead of mifepristone plus misoprostol for pregnancy termination, it could be the only medicine available in some circumstances, which is why FIGO believes this \"misoprostol-only\" chart is needed. Misoprostol must continue to be highlighted as an essential medicine and included in international documents, national guidelines, and essential medicines lists. Further, we must work to ensure the availability of high-quality misoprostol, and the establishment of policy and programs that support its availability and use. The recent WHO guidelines on health worker roles in providing safe abortion care23 outline a wide variety of healthcare providers who can manage medical abortion and postabortion care in the first trimester, with auxiliary nurses, nurses, and midwives listed, as well as lay health workers and doctors of complementary systems for some subtasks. Women can also fulfill some of the components of assessment and management themselves outside of a healthcare facility. It is anticipated that this misoprostol chart can be used by all healthcare providers identified in the WHO publication and that by implementing both, we will come closer to achieving optimal care for the women we aim to serve.

This study was designed to investigate the components of physician empathy, its measurement properties, and group differences in empathy scores.A revised version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (with 20 Likert-type items) was mailed to 1,007 physicians affiliated with the Jefferson Health System in the greater Philadelphia region; 704 (70%) responded. Construct validity, reliability of the empathy scale, and the differences on mean empathy scores by physicians' gender and specialty were examined.Three meaningful factors emerged (perspective taking, compassionate care, and standing in the patient's shoes) to provide support for the construct validity of the empathy scale that was also found to be internally consistent with relatively stable scores over time. Women scored higher than men to a degree that was nearly significant. With control for gender, psychiatrists scored a mean empathy rating that was significantly higher than that of physicians specializing in anesthesiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, radiology, cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and general surgery. No significant difference was observed on empathy scores among physicians specializing in psychiatry, internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and family medicine.Empathy is a multidimensional concept that varies among physicians and can be measured with a psychometrically sound tool.

However, this relationship has not been well evaluated within clinical learning environments.To evaluate the relationship between student attendance and academic performance in a medical student obstetrics/gynecology clinical rotation.A prospective cohort study of student attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities during a full academic year (September 2011 to June 2012) within a publicly funded university teaching hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Students were expected to attend 64 activities (26 clinical activities and 38 tutorial-based activities) but attendance was not mandatory. All 147 fourth-year medical students who completed an 8-week obstetrics/gynecology rotation were included.Student attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities, recorded using a paper-based logbook.The overall examination score (out of a possible 200 points) was obtained using an 11-station objective structured clinical examination (40 points), an end-of-year written examination comprising 50 multiple-choice questions (40 points) and 6 short-answer questions (40 points), and an end-of-year long-case clinical/oral examination (80 points). Students were required to have an overall score of 100 points (50%) and a minimum of 40 points in the long-case clinical/oral examination (50%) to pass.The mean attendance rate was 89% (range, 39%-100% [SD, 11%], n = 57/64 activities). Male students (84% attendance, P = .001) and students who failed an end-of-year examination previously (84% attendance, P = .04) had significantly lower rates. There was a positive correlation between attendance and overall examination score (r = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.44-0.70]; P < .001). Both clinical attendance (r = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.32-0.64]; P < .001) and tutorial-based attendance (r = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40-0.70]; P < .001) were positively correlated with overall examination score. The associations persisted after controlling for confounding factors of student sex, age, country of origin, previous failure in an end-of-year examination, and the timing of the rotation during the academic year. Distinction grades (overall score of ≥60%) were present only among students with attendance rates of 80% or higher. The odds of a distinction grade increased with each 10% increase in attendance (adjusted odds ratio, 5.52; 95% CI, 2.17-14.00). The majority of failure grades (6/10 students; 60%) occurred in students with attendance rates lower than 80%. The adjusted odds ratio for failure with attendance rates of 80% or higher was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.72).Among fourth-year medical students completing an 8-week obstetrics/gynecology clinical rotation, attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities was positively correlated with overall examination scores. Further research is needed to understand whether the relationship is causal, and whether improving attendance rates can improve academic performance.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995734588", "source": "openalex"}

Data sources and methods: We reviewed the published literature on calcium channel blockers and their pharmacology and therapeutic applications in obstetrics and gynecology. We paid particular attention to methods of animal research and recent clinical evaluations. Conclusions: The dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers (type II calcium blockers) and, specifically, nifedipine are safe for use in pregnancy. They have little teratogenic or fetotoxic potential. Nifedipine's mechanism of action is through smooth-muscle relaxation secondary to blockage of the slow calcium channels into the cells. In vivo, there is minimal effect on the cardiac conducting system. Multiple studies in women have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of nifedipine as an antihypertensive. Therapeutic doses range from 10-30 mg orally every 6-8 hours. For acute control of hypertension, 10 mg of sublingual nifedipine may be used. Nifedipine is as effective as betamimetics in decreasing uterine activity. As a tocolytic agent, it is more effective as there are fewer patients who have to discontinue nifedipine because of side effects. The side effects of nifedipine include flushing, headache, or, rarely, hypotension in the hypovolemic patient. Nifedipine has potential and theoretical indications for dysmenorrhea and bladder irritability.(Obstet Gynecol 1994;83:616-24)", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991694792", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS A questionnaire-based study was administered to residents taking the 2001 Council on Residency Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology examination. RESULTS More than 90% of the residents reported that their institution had a maternity leave policy. The leave was usually 4–8 weeks long and was paid. Nearly 95% of residents reported that they had to take over the work of residents on maternity leave. Most women residents worked more than 80 hours weekly throughout pregnancy, and few took time off before delivery. Most pregnancies occurred during the fourth year of training and did not seem to be adversely affected by the long work hours. CONCLUSION This study, performed before the institution of the new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education resident duty hour policies, demonstrated that, although women house officers continued to work more than 80 hours per week during pregnancy, most had a good pregnancy outcome. Nevertheless, there was a higher frequency of preterm labor, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction in female residents than in spouses or partners of male residents. Most women residents in obstetrics and gynecology work more than 80 hours per week throughout pregnancy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4235304294", "source": "openalex"}

Current applications in gynecology and their associated outcomes will be analyzed.Since the late 1990s, the use of computer-assisted or robotic technology in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery has increased. Much of this experience revolves around the da Vinci surgical system, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for gynecologic applications in April 2005. The largest body of experience exists with robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, particularly those classified as American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists type IVE or Laparoscopic Supracervical Hysterectomy III. Other notable applications are in the areas of myomectomy, tubal reanastomosis, sacrocolpopexy, and cancer staging. Advantages of the robotic approach are the improved dexterity and precision of the instruments coupled with three-dimensional imaging. Limitations include the absence of haptic (tactile) feedback, bulkiness of the system, lack of vaginal access, and cost.Current evidence demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the robotic approach for gynecologic surgery. Experience is still in its infancy, however, and prospective trials are needed to compare the efficacy against conventional laparoscopy and to help determine not only who should be doing robotic-assisted surgery but also for which applications.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036223919", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: An investigator-designed questionnaire about abortion training in obstetrics and gynecology residency programs was mailed to all U.S. residency directors. Collected data included program information, abortion training, and numbers of residents trained. Data were analyzed to estimate differences in abortion training by region, program size, and type of training offered. RESULTS: Of the 252 questionnaires mailed, 185 (73%) were returned. Of the 185, 94 (51%) program directors reported routine instruction in elective abortion, 72 (39%) optional training, and 19 (10%) no training. Large programs and programs located in the Northeast and West Coast were significantly more likely to offer routine training in terminations (P < .01). In the programs offering routine training, more than 50% of residents received instruction in termination practices. Of those practices, the most common were first-trimester surgical abortion (85% of programs), followed by medical abortion (59%), second-trimester induction (51% of programs), and dilation and extraction (36%). As compared with those in programs with optional training, residents in programs with routine training were significantly more likely to receive instruction in all modalities of abortion provision and performed proportionally more first- and second-trimester terminations (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Routine training in elective abortion resulted in greater exposure to abortion practices and greater experience in more complicated abortion techniques during residency.

The use of robotics in gynecologic surgery is increasing in the United States. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries in gynecology include benign hysterectomy, myomectomy, tubal reanastomoses, radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissections, and sacrocolpopexies. The majority of the current literature includes case series of various robotic surgeries. Recently, comparative retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this particular type of surgery. Although individual studies vary, robot-assisted gynecologic surgery is often associated with longer operating room time but generally similar clinical outcomes, decreased blood loss, and shorter hospital stay. Robot-assisted gynecologic surgery will likely continue to develop as more gynecologic surgeons are trained and more patients seek minimally invasive surgical options. Well-designed, prospective studies with well-defined clinical, long-term outcomes, including complications, cost, pain, return to normal activity, and quality of life, are needed to fully assess the value of this new technology. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has several applications in gynecologic surgery, including simple and radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissection, tubal reanastomosis, myomectomy, and sacrocolpopexy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054088885", "source": "openalex"}

DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were consulted from January 1990 to June 2005. Additional studies were identified by screening reference lists from identified studies and experts' suggestions. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies of clinical practice guidelines implementation strategies in obstetric care and reviews of such studies were selected. Randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies were evaluated according to Effective Practice and Organization of Care criteria standards. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Studies were reviewed by two investigators to assess the quality and the efficacy of each strategy. Discordances between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus. In obstetrics, educational strategies with medical providers are generally ineffective; educational strategies with paramedical providers, opinion leaders, qualitative improvement, and academic detailing have mixed effects; audit and feedback, reminders, and multifaceted strategies are generally effective. These findings differ from data on the efficacy of clinical practice guidelines implementation strategies in other medical specialties. Specific barriers to behavior change in obstetrics and methods to overcome these barriers could explain these differences. The proportion of effective strategies is significantly higher among the interventions that include a prospective identification of barriers to change compared with standardized interventions. CONCLUSION: Prospective identification of efficient strategies and barriers to change is necessary to achieve a better adaptation of intervention and to improve clinical practice guidelines implementation. In the field of obstetric care, multifaceted strategy based on audit and feedback and facilitated by local opinion leaders is recommended to effectively change behaviors. In obstetrics, multifaceted strategy based on audit and feedback is effective in changing behavior.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2021456087", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to determine whether the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) soft tissue sarcoma (STS) staging system is more accurate in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Patients with uterine LMS who presented at our institution from 1982 to 2005 were staged retrospectively according to a modified FIGO staging system and the AJCC STS staging system. The predictive accuracy of the two staging systems was compared using concordance estimation.Two hundred nineteen patients had sufficient clinical and pathologic information to be staged under both systems; 132 patients were upstaged using the AJCC staging system, whereas only four were downstaged. Stage-specific PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III differed substantially between the two staging systems. In both systems, there was prognostic overlap between stages II and III. Thus, despite the marked stage-specific differences in 5-year PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III, both systems had similar concordance indices.Estimates of stage-specific PFS and OS for uterine LMS were altered substantially when using the AJCC versus FIGO staging system. Adjuvant treatment strategies should be tested in patients at substantial risk for disease progression and death.

We used the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey to assess job burnout, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale to identify depression, and we incorporated questions regarding job satisfaction and self care activities.Of the surveyed residents, 13% satisfied all three subscale scores for high burnout and > 50% have high levels of depersonalization and emotional exhaustion. Residents with high levels of emotional exhaustion were less satisfied with their careers (P = 0.001), regretted choosing ObGyn (P < 0.001), and had higher rates of depression (P < 0.001). A high level of depersonalization was inversely correlated to job satisfaction and personal accomplishment, and strongly correlated to depression. A high level of personal accomplishment was strongly correlated with job satisfaction and satisfaction with the specialty but was inversely correlated with a sense of depersonalization. There was no correlation between burnout and self-care activities.Burnout is strongly correlated with depression and inversely correlated with job satisfaction. Burnout and depression were highly prevalent among ObGyn residents.

The use of POCUS enables the clinician to perform the ultrasound scan either at the medical office or the patient’s bedside and used as an extension of the physical examination. Real-time images can immediately be correlated with the patient’s symptoms, and any changes in a (critical) patient’s condition can be more rapidly detected. POCUS in OBGYN POCUS is also suitable for time-critical scenarios, and depending on the situation and its dynamics, the course and results of any therapy may be observed in real time. POCUS should be considered to be a routine extension of practice for most OB/GYN clinicians as it can give immediate answers to what could be life-threatening situations for the mother and/or baby. With its proven usefulness, the applications and use of POCUS should be incorporated in teaching programs for medical students, OBGYN residents and emergency physicians.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127327146", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: One hundred thirty-six ultrasound program directors from 254 accredited obstetrics and gynecology residency programs completed a web-based survey regarding obstetric ultrasound training for residents. Questions were presented in yes-or-no, ranking, short-answer, and open-comment formats that examined general teaching environment and curriculum content. These results were compared with a mandatory fetal ultrasound training survey that was independently administered to 4,666 obstetrics and gynecology residents during the 2003 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) In-Training Examination. Friedman one-way analysis of variance was used to compare ranked nonparametric data with the Dunn posttest. Statistical significance was taken at the P < .05 level. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of accredited obstetrics and gynecology residencies responded to the survey of ultrasound directors from November 2000 to April 2003. Nearly all responding directors were obstetrician-gynecologists, many of whom had subspecialty training in maternal-fetal medicine. Full-time faculty and sonographers were the most important individuals contributing to ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residents. Hands-on scanning and observation were the most significant educational activities for ultrasound training. Ultrasound program directors generally rated the overall preparedness of residents as ranging from adequate to excellent. The most important learning obstacles were limited curriculum and faculty time. Most programs evaluated competency by direct observation of scanning skills. According to the CREOG survey, only 16.3% of residents indicated that the performance and interpretation of fetal ultrasound examinations were mandatory program requirements. Nearly two thirds of residents believed that their training would be adequate by the time of graduation. Only 18.4% of residents, however, were planning to perform or interpret fetal ultrasound scans in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Fetal ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residents is perceived by most ultrasound program directors and residents to be adequate. Future development of standardized guidelines and competency assessment tools should consider that approximately one fifth of obstetrics and gynecology residents are currently planning to use this diagnostic modality in clinical practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2 Fetal ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residencies is perceived as being adequate, although limited curriculum and faculty time are potential obstacles.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2069394172", "source": "openalex"}

Utilizing Cox proportional hazards modeling and relative survival rates analysis of 17,119 cases of cervical cancer indicated that the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histology, histological grade, lymph node status, and age at diagnosis were all independently prognostic. No evidence was found of survival differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Younger women were not found to have a poorer prognosis, survival declined with increased age. Analysis of 41,120 cases of endometrial cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, lymph node status, age at diagnostic, and race were all prognostic factors. Clear cell adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and mixed mullerian tumors were all found to have poorer prognosis. Analysis of 21,240 cases of ovarian cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, lymph node status, age at diagnosis, presence of ascites, and race were all prognostically significant. Analysis of 2,575 cases of vulvar cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, age, and race were all prognostically significant. Analysis of 916 cases of vaginal cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histologic grade, lymph node status, and age are all prognostically significant. Additional analysis of the data by combinations of independent prognostic factors indicates that the interaction of factors may be more predictive of outcome than any one factor separately. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1953222123", "title": "<scp>WHO</scp> Statement on Caesarean Section Rates", "text": "In 1985 when a group of experts convened by the World Health Organization in Fortaleza, Brazil, met to discuss the appropriate technology for birth, they echoed what at that moment was considered an unjustified and remarkable increase of caesarean section (CS) rates worldwide.1 Based on the evidence available at that time, the experts in Fortaleza concluded: 'there is no justification for any region to have a caesarean section rate higher than 10–15%'.1 Over the years, this quote has become ubiquitous in scientific literature, being interpreted as the ideal CS rate. Although this reference range was intended for 'populations', which are defined by geopolitical boundaries, in many instances it has been mistakenly used as the measurement for healthcare facilities regardless of their complexity or other characteristics. In addition to the case mix of the obstetric population served, the use of CS at healthcare facilities is also affected by factors such as their capacity to handle cases, availability of resource and the clinical management protocols used locally. Since its publication and for the last 30 years, this reference rate for CS has received intense criticism and has led to controversy, concern, polarised opinions and heated debates, while in parallel, the use of CS as a mode of delivery has continued its worrying rise worldwide. The need to revisit the recommended CS rate has been considered more and more necessary in view of the significant improvements in clinical obstetric care and in the methodology to assess evidence and issue recommendations in the last three decades. The global concern around CS rates is understandable. When medically justified, a CS can prevent maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. There is no evidence, however, showing the benefits of the procedure for women or infants where it is not required. CS is associated with short- and long-term risk, which can extend beyond the current delivery and affect future pregnancies. In addition, the increase in CS rates seems uncontrollable, with no signs that it is slowing down. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the causes of the rise are not fully understood but emerge as a complex multifactorial labyrinth involving health systems, health care providers, women, societies, and even fashion and media.2-6 Lastly, non-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary CS have shown limited effectiveness to date.7 In light of these issues, WHO convened a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on 8–9 October 2014 with the objective of (1) establishing the current WHO position on the CS rate or range for optimal maternal and perinatal outcomes at population level, and (2) agreeing on a proposal for a tool to monitor CS rates at facility level. The Statement on Caesarean Section Rates recently released by WHO summarises the results of the systematic reviews and analyses conducted for this purpose and conveys the thinking emerging from the discussions of the meeting.8 A systematic review and an ecological analysis were performed and concluded that at population level, CS rates higher than 10% were not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.9, 10 The Statement notes, however, that the association between CS rates and other relevant outcomes such as stillbirths, maternal and perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes and psychological or social well-being could not be determined due to the lack of data on these other outcomes at the population level. This lack of data represents a limitation of these analyses that needs to be borne in mind. Beyond numbers and rates, the Statement emphasises that the critical role played by the quality of care in this equation cannot be overstated. As with any surgery, CS is associated with short- and long-term risks, particularly in settings that lack the facilities or capacity to conduct safe surgery or treat surgical complications properly, or where access to labour care or repeat CS in subsequent pregnancies cannot be taken for granted. On the other hand, inadequate access to timely CS may result in perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, uterine rupture or obstetric fistula, a marker for exceptionally prolonged, obstructed labour.11 Thus, CS should be undertaken when medically necessary, and rather than striving to achieve a specific rate, efforts should focus on providing caesarean section to all women in need. How to define the woman 'in need' can only be ascertained by the health care providers caring for the woman on a case-by-case basis. Most importantly, at the healthcare facility level, clinicians and administrators struggle to monitor CS rates in a meaningful, reliable and action-oriented manner. Historically, caesarean sections have often been categorised using its indications as the unit being classified. Using indications to classify CS has always been problematic due to the lack of uniform definitions for most common indications and has resulted in poor reproducibility and unsatisfactory comparisons.12 In 2001, Dr Michael Robson proposed a system of 10 groups that classifies all women admitted for delivery (and not indications) according to five obstetric characteristics that are generally routinely collected in most maternities.13 Two systematic reviews conducted at WHO identified this classification as the most appropriate system to fulfil current international and local needs.12, 14 The WHO Statement proposes the use of the Robson classification as the global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing CS rates within healthcare facilities over time, and between facilities. In the last decade, this classification has witnessed an extraordinary expansion in its use worldwide, particularly in healthcare facilities, due to its intrinsic appealing characteristics: simplicity of design, validity of purpose, ease of implementation and directness of initial interpretation.14 WHO envisions that the information stemming from the classification can be a powerful tool to inform practice. The classification will allow not only for stratification of CS rates in more uniform groups of women but also the assessment of CS rates in relation to other perinatal outcomes and processes (e.g. rates of oxytocin usage, postpartum haemorrhage, newborn outcomes, length of labour). WHO will guide and support countries in the use, implementation and interpretation of the classification so that we can start comparing CS rates in a meaningful, targeted, transparent and useful manner. By endorsing the Robson classification, this Statement should become a catalyst for action. The time has come to put the debate about the preferable rate of CS on hold. Let's start to collect data uniformly so that in the near future we will be able to move our focus from CS rates at population level to monitoring and discussing CS rates and outcomes in each group of the Robson classification. Only then will we have the data and evidence that will lead us more clearly to actions to improve care.15 Ultimately, we hope the debate can recommence with more valuable, solid and informative data to support our discussions.

The author offers a conceptual framework for understanding this excess in prevalence of disorder in terms of minority stress--explaining that stigma, prejudice, and discrimination create a hostile and stressful social environment that causes mental health problems. The model describes stress processes, including the experience of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, hiding and concealing, internalized homophobia, and ameliorative coping processes. This conceptual framework is the basis for the review of research evidence, suggestions for future research directions, and exploration of public policy implications.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125568653", "source": "openalex"}

The SF-36 was designed for use in clinical practice and research, health policy evaluations, and general population surveys. The SF-36 includes one multi-item scale that assesses eight health concepts: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. The survey was constructed for self-administration by persons 14 years of age and older, and for administration by a trained interviewer in person or by telephone. The history of the development of the SF-36, the origin of specific items, and the logic underlying their selection are summarized.

Yet considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive selfevaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought. Moreover, these illusions appear to promote other criteria of mental health, including the ability to care about others, the ability to be happy or contented, and the ability to engage in productive and creative work. These strategies may succeed, in large part, because both the social world and cognitive-processing mechanisms impose niters on incoming information that distort it in a positive direction; negative information may be isolated and represented in as unthreatening a manner as possible. These positive illusions may be especially useful when an individual receives negative feedback or is otherwise threatened and may be especially adaptive under these circumstances. Decades of psychological wisdom have established contact with reality as a hallmark of mental health. In this view, the well-adjusted person is thought to engage in accurate reality testing, whereas the individual whose vision is clouded by illusion is regarded as vulnerable to, if not already a victim of, mental illness. Despite its plausibility, this viewpoint is increasingly difficult to maintain (cf. Lazarus, 1983). A substantial amount of research testifies to the prevalence of illusion in normal human cognition (see Fiske& Taylor, 1984;Greenwald, 1980; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Sackeim, 1983; Taylor, 1983). Moreover, these illusions often involve central aspects of the self and the environment and, therefore, cannot be dismissed as inconsequential. In this article, we review research suggesting that certain illusions may be adaptive for mental health and well-being. In particular, we examine evidence that a set of interrelated positive illusions—namely, unrealistically positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism—can serve a wide variety of cognitive, affective, and social functions.

An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward-and successful-genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models.

Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0];<i>P</i> = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei;<i>P</i> &lt; .001).

Dimensions and scales of subjective well-being are reviewed and conceived of as mental health symptoms. A diagnosis of the presence of mental health, described as flourishing, and the absence of mental health, characterized as languishing, is applied to data from the 1995 Midlife in the United States study of adults between the ages of 25 and 74 (n = 3,032). Findings revealed that 17.2 percent fit the criteria for flourishing, 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy, 12.1 percent of adults fit the criteria for languishing, and 14.1 percent fit the criteria for DSM-III-R major depressive episode (12-month), of which 9.4 percent were not languishing and 4.7 percent were also languishing. The risk of a major depressive episode was two times more likely among languishing than moderately mentally healthy adults, and nearly six times greater among languishing than flourishing adults. Multivariate analyses revealed that languishing and depression were associated with significant psychosocial impairment in terms of perceived emotional health, limitations of activities of daily living, and workdays lost or cutback. Flourishing and moderate mental health were associated with superior profiles of psychosocial functioning. The descriptive epidemiology revealed that males, older adults, more educated individuals, and married adults were more likely to be mentally healthy.

Studies are needed to systematically assess the mental health of members of the armed services who have participated in these operations and to inform policy with regard to the optimal delivery of mental health care to returning veterans.We studied members of four U.S. combat infantry units (three Army units and one Marine Corps unit) using an anonymous survey that was administered to the subjects either before their deployment to Iraq (n=2530) or three to four months after their return from combat duty in Iraq or Afghanistan (n=3671). The outcomes included major depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which were evaluated on the basis of standardized, self-administered screening instruments.Exposure to combat was significantly greater among those who were deployed to Iraq than among those deployed to Afghanistan. The percentage of study subjects whose responses met the screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or PTSD was significantly higher after duty in Iraq (15.6 to 17.1 percent) than after duty in Afghanistan (11.2 percent) or before deployment to Iraq (9.3 percent); the largest difference was in the rate of PTSD. Of those whose responses were positive for a mental disorder, only 23 to 40 percent sought mental health care. Those whose responses were positive for a mental disorder were twice as likely as those whose responses were negative to report concern about possible stigmatization and other barriers to seeking mental health care.This study provides an initial look at the mental health of members of the Army and the Marine Corps who were involved in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

This perspective on self can lead to habitual body monitoring, which, in turn, can increase women's opportunities for shame and anxiety, reduce opportunities for peak motivational states, and diminish awareness of internal bodily states. Accumulations of such experiences may help account for an array of mental health risks that disproportionately affect women: unipolar depression, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders.

Tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, and alcohol use together account for almost one million deaths each year in the United States alone. Smoking prevalence in the United States has dropped by half since the first Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health was published in 1964, but tobacco use still causes over 400,000 premature deaths each year. The World Health Organization has warned that the worldwide spread of the tobacco epidemic could claim one billion lives by the end of this century. The rising prevalence of childhood obesity could place the United States at risk of raising the first generation of children to live sicker and die younger than their parents, and the spreading epidemic of obesity among children and adults threatens staggering global health and economic tolls. The four leading behavioral risks factors and a great many others (for example, nonadherence to prescribed medical screening and prevention and disease management practices, risky sexual practices, drug use, family and gun violence, worksite and motor vehicle injuries) take disproportionate tolls in low-income and disadvantaged racial and ethnic populations, as well as in low-resource communities across the world. Addressing these behavioral risks and disparities, and the behaviors related to global health threats, such as flu pandemics, water shortages, increasingly harmful sun exposure, and the need to protect the health of the planet itself, will be critical to world health in the twenty-first century. In the past two decades since the publication of the first edition of Health Education and Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice in 1990, there has been extraordinary growth in our knowledge about interventions needed to change health behaviors at both individual and population levels. This progress can be measured in the proliferation of science-based recommendations issued by authoritative evidence review panels, including the U.S. Clinical Preventive Services Task Force, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control Task Force on Community Preventive Services, and the international Cochrane Collaboration. Today, there are evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for most major behavioral health risks, including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, risky drinking, and diabetes management. And there are parallel research-based guidelines for the health care system changes and policies needed to assure their delivery and use. New community practice guidelines offer additional evidence-based recommendations for a wide array of population-level school-, worksite-, and community-based programs and public policies to improve vaccination rates and physical activity levels for children and adults, improve diabetes self-management, reduce harmful sun exposure, reduce secondhand smoke exposure, prevent youth tobacco use and help adult smokers quit, reduce workplace and motor vehicle injuries, and curb drunk driving and family and gun violence.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090214829", "source": "openalex"}

The hospital has set up a 24-h fever clinic, two mild suspected infection patient screening wards, and one severe suspected infection patient screening ward. In addition to the original medical staff at the infectious disease department, volunteer medical staff have been recruited from multiple other departments. The Second Xiangya Hospital—workplace of the chairman of the Psychological Rescue Branch of the Chinese Medical Rescue Association—and the Institute of Mental Health, the Medical Psychology Research Center of the Second Xiangya Hospital, and the Chinese Medical and Psychological Disease Clinical Medicine Research Center responded rapidly to the psychological pressures on staff. A detailed psychological intervention plan was developed, which mainly covered the following three areas: building a psychological intervention medical team, which provided online courses to guide medical staff to deal with common psychological problems; a psychological assistance hotline team, which provided guidance and supervision to solve psychological problems; and psychological interventions, which provided various group activities to release stress. However, the implementation of psychological intervention services encountered obstacles, as medical staff were reluctant to participate in the group or individual psychology interventions provided to them. Moreover, individual nurses showed excitability, irritability, unwillingness to rest, and signs of psychological distress, but refused any psychological help and stated that they did not have any problems. In a 30-min interview survey with 13 medical staff at The Second Xiangya Hospital, several reasons were discovered for this refusal of help. First, getting infected was not an immediate worry to staff—they did not worry about this once they began work. Second, they did not want their families to worry about them and were afraid of bringing the virus to their home. Third, staff did not know how to deal with patients when they were unwilling to be quarantined at the hospital or did not cooperate with medical measures because of panic or a lack of knowledge about the disease. Additionally, staff worried about the shortage of protective equipment and feelings of incapability when faced with critically ill patients. Many staff mentioned that they did not need a psychologist, but needed more rest without interruption and enough protective supplies. Finally, they suggested training on psychological skills to deal with patients' anxiety, panic, and other emotional problems and, if possible, for mental health staff to be on hand to directly help these patients. Accordingly, the measures of psychological intervention were adjusted. First, the hospital provided a place for rest where staff could temporarily isolate themselves from their family. The hospital also guaranteed food and daily living supplies, and helped staff to video record their routines in the hospital to share with their families and alleviate family members' concerns. Second, in addition to disease knowledge and protective measures, pre-job training was arranged to address identification of and responses to psychological problems in patients with COVID-19, and hospital security staff were available to be sent to help deal with uncooperative patients. Third, the hospital developed detailed rules on the use and management of protective equipment to reduce worry. Fourth, leisure activities and training on how to relax were properly arranged to help staff reduce stress. Finally, psychological counsellors regularly visited the rest area to listen to difficulties or stories encountered by staff at work, and provide support accordingly. More than 100 frontline medical staff can rest in the provided rest place, and most of them report feeling at home in this accomodation.

The purpose of this framework is twofold. First, it is designed to emphasize that the professional requirements for future psychiatrists will demand a greater knowledge of the structure and functioning of the brain than is currently available in most training programs. Second, it is designed to illustrate that the unique domain which psychiatry occupies within academic medicine, the analysis of the interaction between social and biological determinants of behavior, can best be studied by also having a full understanding of the biological components of behavior.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121629542", "source": "openalex"}

Through much of this era of great challenge and greater achievement, however, concerns regarding mental illness and mental health too often were relegated to the rear of our national consciousness. Tragic and devastating disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, the mental and behavioral disorders suffered by children, and a range of other mental disorders affect nearly one in five Americans in any year, yet continue too frequently to be spoken of in whispers and shame. Fortunately, leaders in the mental health field-fiercely dedicated advocates, scientists, government officials, and consumers-have been insistent that mental health flow in the mainstream of health. I agree and issue this report in that spirit. This report makes evident that the neuroscience of mental health-a term that encompasses studies extending from molecular events to psychological, behavioral, and societal phenomena-has emerged as one of the most exciting arenas of scientific activity and human inquiry. We recognize that the brain is the integrator of thought, emotion, behavior, and health.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2582550385", "title": "A network theory of mental disorders", "text": "In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self‐sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2582550385", "source": "openalex"}

Innovations compared to earlier versions of the CIDI include expansion of the diagnostic sections, a focus on 12‐month as well as lifetime disorders in the same interview, detailed assessment of clinical severity, and inclusion of information on treatment, risk factors, and consequences. A computer‐assisted version of the interview is available along with a direct data entry software system that can be used to keypunch responses to the paper‐and‐pencil version of the interview. Computer programs that generate diagnoses are also available based on both ICD‐10 and DSM‐IV criteria.

The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043705607", "source": "openalex"}

Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement--a reporting guideline published in 1999--there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram.

Method A narrative review within a conceptual framework. Results Many members of the public cannot recognise specific disorders or different types of psychological distress. They differ from mental health experts in their beliefs about the causes of mental disorders and the most effective treatments. Attitudes which hinder recognition and appropriate help-seeking are common. Much of the mental health information most readily available to the public is misleading. However, there is some evidence that mental health literacy can be improved. Conclusions If the public's mental health literacy is not improved, this may hinder public acceptance of evidence-based mental health care.

[1] It has been published by the American Psychiatric Association and two years ago the fifth edition was released. [2] Croatian was among the first languages this book was translated to. [3] DSM-5 was translated by psychiatrists and psychologists, mainly from the University hospital Vrapce and published by the Naklada Slap publisher.DSM has always been more publicly debated than the other main classification - the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). [4] The same happened with this fifth edition. Even before it was released, numerous individuals, organizations, groups and associations were publicly speaking about the classification, new diagnostic entities and changing criteria. [5]Although there is a tendency of authors of both DSM and ICD to synchronize these two classifications and to make them more harmonized with each new edition, there are several differences among them. While ICD covers all the diseases, disorders and reasons for making a contact with the health system, DSM covers only mental disorders. Other disorders (medical conditions, as they are named in DSM-5) are not included, except in situations when they lead to a development of a mental disorder. The other main difference is that DSM is more operational zed, and gives criteria for each of the disorders, listing how many criteria have to be met to make a diagnosis of a particular disorder, and what excluding criteria are.Due to the fact that it is used all around the globe and since it has become the most used manual, it is sometimes said that DSM is a psychiatric Bible. [6]Some critics of DSM say that it stigmatizes people and that in each edition it includes more diagnostic entities. It is true that in each edition of DSM there are more disorders listed, but this is due to the fact that medicine is a developing area and new insights are made every year, so some disorders are separated into different subtypes or subgroups and different new diagnoses, giving the impression more behaviour are being pathologized. The intention of the authors was to make more homogenous groups. But, the truth is that, compared with ICD, it is more difficult to get a diagnosis in DSM, than in ICD, with the same clinical presentation. [7] DSM requires functional impairment or distress to pathologize behaviour, while in ICD this criterion is not present in every case.During the process of developing DSM-5 there was an open public discussion. [2] For over a year any person was able to participate in the discussion about future criteria, inclusion or exclusion of diagnostic entities from DSM. More than 21000 letters was sent to the authors. This was the unprecedented way of developing a classification that ICD now tries to follow in preparation of its 11th edition.As a direct consequence of such an open and wide discussion, some new disorders were included (e.g. hoarding disorder), some were excluded even though they were included during the proposal period (e.g. hypersexual disorders), some were heavily debated (e.g. narcissistic personality disorder). [8-10]As previously mentioned, DSM and ICD systems try to harmonize more. There were more non-American authors included in DSM-5 than ever before and some of the experts in the field were in the task force of DSM-5 and ICD-11. [2, 11]What is new in DSM-5, compared to DSM-IV. The organization of the chapters has been changed, so now the flow of the disorders follow life cycle. The book starts with neurodevelopmental disorders, followed by schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, and closing with neurocognitive disorders. …", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2336678555", "source": "openalex"}

Data from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) were obtained in 5388 face-to-face household interviews conducted between 1990 and 1992, and data from the NCS Replication were obtained in 4319 interviews conducted between 2001 and 2003. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and substance-abuse disorders that were present during the 12 months before the interview were diagnosed with the use of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). Treatment for emotional disorders was categorized according to the sector of mental health services: psychiatry services, other mental health services, general medical services, human services, and complementary-alternative medical services.The prevalence of mental disorders did not change during the decade (29.4 percent between 1990 and 1992 and 30.5 percent between 2001 and 2003, P=0.52), but the rate of treatment increased. Among patients with a disorder, 20.3 percent received treatment between 1990 and 1992 and 32.9 percent received treatment between 2001 and 2003 (P<0.001). Overall, 12.2 percent of the population 18 to 54 years of age received treatment for emotional disorders between 1990 and 1992 and 20.1 percent between 2001 and 2003 (P<0.001).

The ten-year collaborative research directed by Hollingshead, a sociologist, and Redlich, a psychiatrist, has already produced some twenty-five papers; and the general drift of their work is very well known. But in Social Class and Mental Illness most of the major data of their project are given for the first time in detail.

The entire project represents trends of capital importance that are affecting the nature and destiny of psychiatry. One trend is the sociologizing of psychiatric research\\p=m-\\meaningthe incorporation of sociological perspectives into the study of mental disease and its treatment. The parallel and conjoint researches of sociologists and psychiatrists have supported the movement toward a social psychiatry, itself a close relative of what has come to be called, rather broadly, of course, milieu therapy.

An enriched convenience sample of 155 respondents was administered all screening scales followed by the 12-month Structured Clinical Interview for<i>DSM-IV</i>and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). We defined SMI as any 12-month<i>DSM-IV</i>disorder, other than a substance use disorder, with a GAF score of less than 60. <h3>Results</h3> All screening scales were significantly related to SMI. However, neither the CIDI-SF nor the WHO-DAS improved prediction significantly over the K10 or K6 scales. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of SMI was 0.854 for K10 and 0.865 for K6. The most efficient screening scale, K6, had a sensitivity (SE) of 0.36 (0.08) and a specificity of 0.96 (0.02) in predicting SMI. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The brevity and accuracy of the K6 and K10 scales make them attractive screens for SMI. Routine inclusion of either scale in clinical studies would create an important, and heretofore missing, crosswalk between community and clinical epidemiology.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066709094", "source": "openalex"}

To date, no systematic analysis of this program has been conducted, and studies have not assessed the impact of these deployments on mental health care utilization after deployment.ObjectivesTo determine the relationship between combat deployment and mental health care use during the first year after return and to assess the lessons learned from the postdeployment mental health screening effort, particularly the correlation between the screening results, actual use of mental health services, and attrition from military service.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsPopulation-based descriptive study of all Army soldiers and Marines who completed the routine postdeployment health assessment between May 1, 2003, and April 30, 2004, on return from deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan (n = 16 318), Operation Iraqi Freedom (n = 222 620), and other locations (n = 64 967). Health care utilization and occupational outcomes were measured for 1 year after deployment or until leaving the service if this occurred sooner.Main Outcome MeasuresScreening positive for posttraumatic stress disorder, major depression, or other mental health problems; referral for a mental health reason; use of mental health care services after returning from deployment; and attrition from military service.ResultsThe prevalence of reporting a mental health problem was 19.1% among service members returning from Iraq compared with 11.3% after returning from Afghanistan and 8.5% after returning from other locations (P&lt;.001). Mental health problems reported on the postdeployment assessment were significantly associated with combat experiences, mental health care referral and utilization, and attrition from military service. Thirty-five percent of Iraq war veterans accessed mental health services in the year after returning home; 12% per year were diagnosed with a mental health problem. More than 50% of those referred for a mental health reason were documented to receive follow-up care although less than 10% of all service members who received mental health treatment were referred through the screening program.ConclusionsCombat duty in Iraq was associated with high utilization of mental health services and attrition from military service after deployment. The deployment mental health screening program provided another indicator of the mental health impact of deployment on a population level but had limited utility in predicting the level of mental health services that were needed after deployment. The high rate of using mental health services among Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans after deployment highlights challenges in ensuring that there are adequate resources to meet the mental health needs of returning veterans.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110023280", "source": "openalex"}

Over the years it has become the standard textbook in the field world-wide. It mirrors the huge expansion of the field of economic evaluation in health care. This new edition builds on the strengths of previous editions being clearly written in a style accessible to a wide readership. Key methodological principles are outlined using a critical appraisal checklist that can be applied to any published study. The methodological features of the basic forms of analysis are then explained in more detail with special emphasis of the latest views on productivity costs, the characterization of uncertainty and the concept of net benefit. The book has been greatly revised and expanded especially concerning analyzing patient-level data and decision-analytic modeling. There is discussion of new methodological approaches, including cost effectiveness acceptability curves, net benefit regression, probalistic sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis. There is an expanded chapter on the use of economic evaluation, including discussion of the use of cost-effectiveness thresholds, equity considerations and the transferability of economic data. This new edition is required for anyone commissioning, undertaking or using economic evaluations in health care, and will be popular with health service professionals, health economists, pharmacists and health care decision makers. It is especially relevant for those taking pharmacoeconomics courses.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3151002452", "source": "openalex"}

Although more prevalent among people with disadvantaged social status, results show that perceived discrimination is common in the total population, with 33.5 percent of respondents in the total sample reporting exposure to major lifetime discrimination and 60.9 percent reporting exposure to day-to-day discrimination. The associations of perceived discrimination with mental health are comparable in magnitude to those of other more commonly studied stressors, and these associations do not vary consistently across subsamples defined on the basis of social status. Even though perceived discrimination explains only a small part of the observed associations between disadvantaged social status and mental health, given its high prevalence, wide distribution, and strong associations with mental health, perceived discrimination needs to be treated much more seriously than in the past in future studies of stress and mental health.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975404309", "source": "openalex"}

Our primary goal in this book is to sharpen the skill, sophistication, and in- tuition of the reader in the interpretation of mental test data, and in the construction and use of mental tests both as instruments of psychological theory and as tools in the practical problems of selection, evaluation, and guidance. We seek to do this by exposing the reader to some psychologically meaningful statistical theories of mental test scores. Although this book is organized in terms of test-score theories and models, the practical applications and limitations of each model studied receive substantial emphasis, and these discussions are presented in as nontechnical a manner as we have found possible. Since this book catalogues a host of test theory models and formulas, it may serve as a reference handbook. Also, for a limited group of specialists, this book aims to provide a more rigorous foundation for further theoretical research than has heretofore been available.One aim of this book is to present statements of the assumptions, together with derivations of the implications, of a selected group of statistical models that the authors believe to be useful as guides in the practices of test construction and utilization. With few exceptions we have given a complete proof for each major result presented in the book. In many cases these proofs are simpler, more complete, and more illuminating than those originally offered. When we have omitted proofs or parts of proofs, we have generally provided a reference containing the omitted argument. We have left some proofs as exercises for the reader, but only when the general method of proof has already been demonstrated. At times we have proved only special cases of more generally stated theorems, when the general proof affords no additional insight into the problem and yet is substantially more complex mathematically.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084398551", "source": "openalex"}

Face-to-face community surveys were conducted in seventeen countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. The combined numbers of respondents were 85,052. Lifetime prevalence, projected lifetime risk, and age of onset of DSM-IV disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a fully-structured lay administered diagnostic interview. Survival analysis was used to estimate lifetime risk. Median and inter-quartile range (IQR) of age of onset is very early for some anxiety disorders (7-14, IQR: 8-11) and impulse control disorders (7-15, IQR: 11-12). The age-of-onset distribution is later for mood disorders (29-43, IQR: 35-40), other anxiety disorders (24-50, IQR: 31-41), and substance use disorders (18-29, IQR: 21-26). Median and IQR lifetime prevalence estimates are: anxiety disorders 4.8-31.0% (IQR: 9.9-16.7%), mood disorders 3.3-21.4% (IQR: 9.8-15.8%), impulse control disorders 0.3-25.0% (IQR: 3.1-5.7%), substance use disorders 1.3-15.0% (IQR: 4.8-9.6%), and any disorder 12.0-47.4% (IQR: 18.1-36.1%). Projected lifetime risk is proportionally between 17% and 69% higher than estimated lifetime prevalence (IQR: 28-44%), with the highest ratios in countries exposed to sectarian violence (Israel, Nigeria, and South Africa), and a general tendency for projected risk to be highest in recent cohorts in all countries. These results document clearly that mental disorders are commonly occurring. As many mental disorders begin in childhood or adolescents, interventions aimed at early detection and treatment might help reduce the persistence or severity of primary disorders and prevent the subsequent onset of secondary disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1731053727", "source": "openalex"}

Design: A cross-sectional survey, in 1995, with structured interviews using vignettes of a person with either depression or schizophrenia. Participants: A representative national sample of 2031 individuals aged 18–74 years; 1010 participants were questioned about the depression vignette and 1021 about the schizophrenia vignette. Results: Most of the participants recognised the presence of some sort of mental disorder: 72% for the depression vignette (correctly labelled as depression by 39%) and 84% for the schizophrenia vignette (correctly labelled by 27%). When various people were rated as likely to be helpful or harmful for the person described in the vignette for depression, general practitioners (83%) and counsellors (74%) were most often rated as helpful, with psychiatrists (51%) and psychologists (49%) less so. Corresponding data for the schizophrenia vignette were: counsellors (81%), GPs (74%), psychiatrists (71%) and psychologists (62%). Many standard psychiatric treatments (antidepressants, antipsychotics, electroconvulsive therapy, admission to a psychiatric ward) were more often rated as harmful than helpful, and some nonstandard treatments were rated highly (increased physical or social activity, relaxation and stress management, reading about people with similar problems). Vitamins and special diets were more often rated as helpful than were antidepressants and antipsychotics. Conclusion: If mental disorders are to be recognised early in the community and appropriate intervention sought, the level of mental health literacy needs to be raised.

This systematic review aims to summarise reported barriers and facilitators of help-seeking in young people using both qualitative research from surveys, focus groups, and interviews and quantitative data from published surveys. It extends previous reviews through its systematic research methodology and by the inclusion of published studies describing what young people themselves perceive are the barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for common mental health problems. Twenty two published studies of perceived barriers or facilitators in adolescents or young adults were identified through searches of PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database. A thematic analysis was undertaken on the results reported in the qualitative literature and quantitative literature. Fifteen qualitative and seven quantitative studies were identified. Young people perceived stigma and embarrassment, problems recognising symptoms (poor mental health literacy), and a preference for self-reliance as the most important barriers to help-seeking. Facilitators were comparatively under-researched. However, there was evidence that young people perceived positive past experiences, and social support and encouragement from others as aids to the help-seeking process. Strategies for improving help-seeking by adolescents and young adults should focus on improving mental health literacy, reducing stigma, and taking into account the desire of young people for self-reliance.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107750653", "source": "openalex"}

Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing. This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Methods WEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale. It was validated on a student and representative population sample. Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses. Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients. Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding. Results WEMWBS showed good content validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis. A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale. WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health. Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample. It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys. Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83). Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales. Conclusion WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health. As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level. Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123552131", "source": "openalex"}

That report of two years ago urged Americans to view mental health as paramount to personal well-being, family relationships, and successful contributions to society. It documented the disabling nature of mental illnesses, showcased the strong science base behind effective treatments, and recommended that people seek help for mental health problems or disorders. The first mental health report also acknowledged that all Americans do not share equally in the hope for recovery from mental illnesses. This is especially true of members of racial and ethnic minority groups. That awareness galvanized me to ask for a supplemental report on the nature and extent of disparities in mental health care for racial and ethnic minorities and on promising directions for the elimination of these disparities. This Supplement documents that the science base on racial and ethnic minority mental health is inadequate; the best available research, however, indicates that these groups have less access to and avail-ability of care, and tend to receive poorer quality mental health services. These disparities leave minority communities with a greater disability burden from unmet mental health needs. A hallmark of this Supplement is its emphasis on the role that cultural factors play in mental health. The cultures from which people hail affect all aspects of mental health and illness, including the types of stresses they confront, whether they seek help, what types of help they seek, what symptoms and concerns they bring to clinical attention, and what types of coping styles and social supports they possess.

Global attention has largely been focused on the infected patients and the frontline responders, with some marginalised populations in society having been overlooked. Here, we write to express our concerns with regards to the effect of the epidemic on people with mental health disorders. Ignorance of the differential impact of the epidemic on these patients will not only hinder any aims to prevent further spread of COVID-19, but will also augment already existing health inequalities. In China, 173 million people are living with mental health disorders,1Xiang Y-T Yu X Sartorius N Ungvari GS Chiu HF Mental health in China: challenges and progress.The Lancet. 2012; 380: 1715-1716Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and neglect and stigma regarding these conditions still prevail in society.2Li J Zhang M Zhao L Li W Mu J Zhang Z Evaluation of attitudes and knowledge toward mental disorders in a sample of the Chinese population using a web-based approach.BMC Psychiatry. 2018; 18: 367Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar When epidemics arise, people with mental health disorders are generally more susceptible to infections for several reasons. First, mental health disorders can increase the risk of infections, including pneumonia.3Seminog OO Goldacre MJ Risk of pneumonia and pneumococcal disease in people with severe mental illness: English record linkage studies.Thorax. 2013; 68: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar One report released on Feb 9, 2020, discussing a cluster of 50 cases of COVID-19 among inpatients in one psychiatric hospital in Wuhan, China, has raised concerns over the role of mental disorders in coronavirus transmission.4China NewsweekCollective infections of coronavirus among 50 patients and 30 health workers in one psychiatric hospital in Wuhan. Shanghai Obs. 2020.https://www.jfdaily.com/news/detail?id=208584Date accessed: February 17, 2020Google Scholar Possible explanations include cognitive impairment, little awareness of risk, and diminished efforts regarding personal protection in patients, as well as confined conditions in psychiatric wards. Second, once infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2—which results in COVID-19—people with mental disorders can be exposed to more barriers in accessing timely health services, because of discrimination associated with mental ill-health in health-care settings. Additionally, mental health disorder comorbidities to COVID-19 will make the treatment more challenging and potentially less effective.5Sartorius N Comorbidity of mental and physical diseases: a main challenge for medicine of the 21st century.Shanghai Arch Psychiatry. 2013; 25: 68-69PubMed Google Scholar Third, the COVID-19 epidemic has caused a parallel epidemic of fear, anxiety, and depression. People with mental health conditions could be more substantially influenced by the emotional responses brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic, resulting in relapses or worsening of an already existing mental health condition because of high susceptibility to stress compared with the general population. Finally, many people with mental health disorders attend regular outpatient visits for evaluations and prescriptions. However, nationwide regulations on travel and quarantine have resulted in these regular visits becoming more difficult and impractical to attend. Few voices of this large but vulnerable population of people with mental health disorders have been heard during this epidemic. Epidemics never affect all populations equally and inequalities can always drive the spread of infections. As mental health and public health professionals, we call for adequate and necessary attention to people with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic. We declare no competing interests.

In this paper, we first appraise the conceptual foundations of preventive psychiatry, encompassing the public health, Gordon's, US Institute of Medicine, World Health Organization, and good mental health frameworks, and neurodevelopmentally-sensitive clinical staging models. We then review the evidence supporting primary prevention of psychotic, bipolar and common mental disorders and promotion of good mental health as potential transformative strategies to reduce the incidence of these disorders in young people. Within indicated approaches, the clinical high-risk for psychosis paradigm has received the most empirical validation, while clinical high-risk states for bipolar and common mental disorders are increasingly becoming a focus of attention. Selective approaches have mostly targeted familial vulnerability and non-genetic risk exposures. Selective screening and psychological/psychoeducational interventions in vulnerable subgroups may improve anxiety/depressive symptoms, but their efficacy in reducing the incidence of psychotic/bipolar/common mental disorders is unproven. Selective physical exercise may reduce the incidence of anxiety disorders. Universal psychological/psychoeducational interventions may improve anxiety symptoms but not prevent depressive/anxiety disorders, while universal physical exercise may reduce the incidence of anxiety disorders. Universal public health approaches targeting school climate or social determinants (demographic, economic, neighbourhood, environmental, social/cultural) of mental disorders hold the greatest potential for reducing the risk profile of the population as a whole. The approach to promotion of good mental health is currently fragmented. We leverage the knowledge gained from the review to develop a blueprint for future research and practice of preventive psychiatry in young people: integrating universal and targeted frameworks; advancing multivariable, transdiagnostic, multi-endpoint epidemiological knowledge; synergically preventing common and infrequent mental disorders; preventing physical and mental health burden together; implementing stratified/personalized prognosis; establishing evidence-based preventive interventions; developing an ethical framework, improving prevention through education/training; consolidating the cost-effectiveness of preventive psychiatry; and decreasing inequalities. These goals can only be achieved through an urgent individual, societal, and global level response, which promotes a vigorous collaboration across scientific, health care, societal and governmental sectors for implementing preventive psychiatry, as much is at stake for young people with or at risk for emerging mental disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3134541358", "source": "openalex"}

However, this type of public knowledge about mental disorders (mental health literacy) has received much less attention. There is evidence from surveys in several countries for deficiencies in (a) the public's knowledge of how to prevent mental disorders, (b) recognition of when a disorder is developing, (c) knowledge of help-seeking options and treatments available, (d) knowledge of effective self-help strategies for milder problems, and (e) first aid skills to support others affected by mental health problems. Nevertheless, there is evidence that a range of interventions can improve mental health literacy, including whole-of-community campaigns, interventions in educational settings, Mental Health First Aid training, and information websites. There is also evidence for historical improvements in mental health literacy in some countries. Increasing the community's mental health literacy needs to be a focus for national policy and population monitoring so that the whole community is empowered to take action for better mental health.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067652354", "source": "openalex"}

Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, as well as randomized clinical trials, are included. Special attention is given to physical conditions, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease and sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, studies relating physical activity to depression and other mood states are reviewed. The studies include diverse ethnic populations, including men and women, as well as several age groups (e.g. adolescents, middle-aged and older adults). Recent findings Results of the studies continue to support a growing literature suggesting that exercise, physical activity and physical-activity interventions have beneficial effects across several physical and mental-health outcomes. Generally, participants engaging in regular physical activity display more desirable health outcomes across a variety of physical conditions. Similarly, participants in randomized clinical trials of physical-activity interventions show better health outcomes, including better general and health-related quality of life, better functional capacity and better mood states. Summary The studies have several implications for clinical practice and research. Most work suggests that exercise and physical activity are associated with better quality of life and health outcomes. Therefore, assessment and promotion of exercise and physical activity may be beneficial in achieving desired benefits across several populations. Several limitations were noted, particularly in research involving randomized clinical trials. These trials tend to involve limited sample sizes with short follow-up periods, thus limiting the clinical implications of the benefits associated with physical activity.

Twelve-month prevalences were 0.4% for BP-I, 0.3% for BP-II, 0.8% for subthreshold BP, and 1.5% for BPS. Severity of both manic and depressive symptoms as well as suicidal behavior increased monotonically from subthreshold BP to BP-I. By contrast, role impairment was similar across BP subtypes. Symptom severity was greater for depressive episodes than manic episodes, with approximately 74.0% of respondents with depression and 50.9% of respondents with mania reporting severe role impairment. Three-quarters of those with BPS met criteria for at least 1 other disorder, with anxiety disorders (particularly panic attacks) being the most common comorbid condition. Less than half of those with lifetime BPS received mental health treatment, particularly in low-income countries, where only 25.2% reported contact with the mental health system. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Despite cross-site variation in the prevalence rates of BPS, the severity, impact, and patterns of comorbidity were remarkably similar internationally. The uniform increases in clinical correlates, suicidal behavior, and comorbidity across each diagnostic category provide evidence for the validity of the concept of BPS. Treatment needs for BPS are often unmet, particularly in low-income countries.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984344128", "source": "openalex"}

Methods - The WMH surveys are representative community surveys in 28 countries throughout the world aimed at providing information to mental health policy makers about the prevalence, distribution, burden, and unmet need for treatment of common mental disorders. Results - The first 17 WMH surveys show that mental disorders are commonly occurring in all participating countries. The inter-quartile range (IQR: 25th-75th percentiles) of lifetime DSM-IV disorder prevalence estimates (combining anxiety, mood, externalizing, and substance use disorders) is 18.1–36.1%. The IQR of 12-month prevalence estimates is 9.8–19.1%. Prevalence estimates of 12-month Serious Mental Illness (SMI) are 4–6.8% in half the countries, 2.3–3.6% in one-fourth, and 0.8–1.9% in one-fourth. Many mental disorders begin in childhood-adolescence and have significant adverse effects on subsequent role transitions in the WMH data. Adult mental disorders are found to be associated with such high role impairment in the WMH data that available clinical interventions could have positive cost-effectiveness ratios.

This research indicates that from the end of World War II until the mid-1970s, a broadly conceived biopsychosocial model, informed by psychoanalysis, sociological thinking, and biological knowledge, was the organizing model for American psychiatry. However, the biopsychosocial model did not clearly demarcate the mentally well from the mentally ill, and this failure led to a crisis in the legitimacy of psychiatry by the 1970s. The publication of DSM-III in 1980 represented an answer to this crisis, as the essential focus of psychiatric knowledge shifted from the clinically-based biopsychosocial model to a research-based medical model.

A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies", "text": "Background Individuals often avoid or delay seeking professional help for mental health problems. Stigma may be a key deterrent to help-seeking but this has not been reviewed systematically. Our systematic review addressed the overarching question: What is the impact of mental health-related stigma on help-seeking for mental health problems? Subquestions were: ( a ) What is the size and direction of any association between stigma and help-seeking? ( b ) To what extent is stigma identified as a barrier to help-seeking? ( c ) What processes underlie the relationship between stigma and help-seeking? ( d ) Are there population groups for which stigma disproportionately deters help-seeking? Method Five electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2011 and references of reviews checked. A meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies, comprising three parallel narrative syntheses and subgroup analyses, was conducted. Results The review identified 144 studies with 90 189 participants meeting inclusion criteria. The median association between stigma and help-seeking was d = − 0.27, with internalized and treatment stigma being most often associated with reduced help-seeking. Stigma was the fourth highest ranked barrier to help-seeking, with disclosure concerns the most commonly reported stigma barrier. A detailed conceptual model was derived that describes the processes contributing to, and counteracting, the deterrent effect of stigma on help-seeking. Ethnic minorities, youth, men and those in military and health professions were disproportionately deterred by stigma. Conclusions Stigma has a small- to moderate-sized negative effect on help-seeking. Review findings can be used to help inform the design of interventions to increase help-seeking.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007909468", "source": "openalex"}

This article presents a critical review of 29 HBM-related investigations published during the period 1974-1984, tabulates the findings from 17 studies conducted prior to 1974, and provides a summary of the total 46 HBM studies (18 prospective, 28 retrospective). Twenty-four studies examined preventive-health be haviors (PHB), 19 explored sick-role behaviors (SRB), and three addressed clinic utilization. A \"significance ratio\" was constructed which divides the number of positive, statistically- significant findings for an HBM dimension by the total number of studies reporting significance levels for that dimension. Summary results provide substantial empirical support for the HBM, with findings from prospective studies at least as favorable as those obtained from retrospective research. \"Perceived barriers\" proved to be the most powerful of the HBM dimensions across the various study designs and behaviors. While both were important overall, \"perceived sus ceptibility\" was a stronger contributor to understanding PHB than SRB, while the reverse was true for \"perceived benefits.\" \"Perceived severity\" produced the lowest overall significance ratios; however, while only weakly associated with PHB, this dimension was strongly related to SRB.

Accumulating data suggests that this may indeed be the case and that diet and nutrition are not only critical for human physiology and body composition, but also have significant effects on mood and mental wellbeing. While the determining factors of mental health are complex, increasing evidence indicates a strong association between a poor diet and the exacerbation of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions. There are common beliefs about the health effects of certain foods that are not supported by solid evidence and the scientific evidence demonstrating the unequivocal link between nutrition and mental health is only beginning to emerge. Current epidemiological data on nutrition and mental health do not provide information about causality or underlying mechanisms. Future studies should focus on elucidating mechanism. Randomized controlled trials should be of high quality, adequately powered and geared towards the advancement of knowledge from population-based observations towards personalized nutrition. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, exploring the scientific evidence exemplifying the importance of a well-balanced diet for mental health.

Mental disorders represent a considerable disease burden, and have a significant impact on the lives of the OECD population, and account for considerable direct and indirect costs. This report argues that even in those OECD countries with a long history of deinstitutionalisation, there is still a long way to go to make community-based mental health care that achieves good outcomes for people with severe mental illness a reality. The disproportionate focus on severe mental illness has meant that mild-to-moderate mental illnesses, which makes up the largest burden of disease, have remained overwhelmingly neglected. This book addresses the high cost of mental illness, weaknesses and innovative developments in the organisation of care, changes and future directions for the mental health workforce, the need to develop better indicators for mental health care and quality, and tools for better governance of the mental health system. The high burden of mental ill health and the accompanying costs in terms of reduced quality of life, loss of productivity, and premature mortality, mean that making mental health count for all OECD countries is a priority.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2795845136", "source": "openalex"}

In a continuation of this effort, in this two-part work I integrate current interdisciplinary data from attachment studies on dyadic affective communications, neuroscience on the early developing right brain, psychophysiology on stress systems, and psychiatry on psychopathogenesis to provide a deeper understanding of the psychoneurobiological mechanisms that underlie infant mental health. In this article I detail the neurobiology of a secure attachment, an exemplar of adaptive infant mental health, and focus upon the primary caregiver's psychobiological regulation of the infant's maturing limbic system, the brain areas specialized for adapting to a rapidly changing environment. The infant's early developing right hemisphere has deep connections into the limbic and autonomic nervous systems and is dominant for the human stress response, and in this manner the attachment relationship facilitates the expansion of the child's coping capcities. This model suggests that adaptive infant mental health can be fundamentally defined as the earliest expression of flexible strategies for coping with the novelty and stress that is inherent in human interactions.

Thus, the vision of precision medicine as applied to psychiatry – ‘precision psychiatry’ – promises to be even more transformative than in other fields of medicine, which have already lessened the translational gap. Herein, we describe ‘precision psychiatry’ and how its several implications promise to transform the psychiatric landscape.

Methods The review used a standardized search strategy and strict inclusion and quality criteria in seven databases in 1994–2005. Papers were identified from 24 939 citations covering social determinants of health, 50 relevant papers were identified, 38 fulfilled inclusion criteria, and 11 were suitable for a meta-analysis. The Comprehensive Meta-analysis Programme was used for decision authority, decision latitude, psychological demands, and work social support, components of the job-strain and iso-strain models, and the combination of effort and reward that makes up the effort–reward imbalance model and job insecurity. Cochran’s Q statistic assessed the heterogeneity of the results, and the I2 statistic determined any inconsistency between studies. Results Job strain, low decision latitude, low social support, high psychological demands, effort–reward imbalance, and high job insecurity predicted common mental disorders despite the heterogeneity for psychological demands and social support among men. The strongest effects were found for job strain and effort–reward imbalance. Conclusions This meta-analysis provides robust consistent evidence that (combinations of) high demands and low decision latitude and (combinations of) high efforts and low rewards are prospective risk factors for common mental disorders and suggests that the psychosocial work environment is important for mental health.

These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for “digital phenotyping” and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self‐management of psychological well‐being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long‐term psychiatric conditions – including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders – as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real‐world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i‐PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base.

Method The World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys were used to examine the associations of mental disorders with college entry and attrition by comparing college students ( n = 1572) and non-students in the same age range (18–22 years; n = 4178), including non-students who recently left college without graduating ( n = 702) based on surveys in 21 countries (four low/lower-middle income, five upper-middle-income, one lower-middle or upper-middle at the times of two different surveys, and 11 high income). Lifetime and 12-month prevalence and age-of-onset of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavioral and substance disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results One-fifth (20.3%) of college students had 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders; 83.1% of these cases had pre-matriculation onsets. Disorders with pre-matriculation onsets were more important than those with post-matriculation onsets in predicting subsequent college attrition, with substance disorders and, among women, major depression the most important such disorders. Only 16.4% of students with 12-month disorders received any 12-month healthcare treatment for their mental disorders. Conclusions Mental disorders are common among college students, have onsets that mostly occur prior to college entry, in the case of pre-matriculation disorders are associated with college attrition, and are typically untreated.

While three of four suicide victims had contact with primary care providers within the year of suicide, approximately one-third of the suicide victims had contact with mental health services. About one in five suicide victims had contact with mental health services within a month before their suicide. On average, 45% of suicide victims had contact with primary care providers within 1 month of suicide. Older adults had higher rates of contact with primary care providers within 1 month of suicide than younger adults. CONCLUSIONS: While it is not known to what degree contact with mental health care and primary care providers can prevent suicide, the majority of individuals who die by suicide do make contact with primary care providers, particularly older adults. Given that this pattern is consistent with overall health-service-seeking, alternate approaches to suicide-prevention efforts may be needed for those less likely to be seen in primary care or mental health specialty care, specifically young men.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037299548", "source": "openalex"}

Multilevel interventions that incorporate policy, environmental, and individual components should be evaluated with measurements suited to their settings, goals, and purpose. In this commentary, the authors propose a model (termed the RE-AIM model) for evaluating public health interventions that assesses 5 dimensions: reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. These dimensions occur at multiple levels (e.g., individual, clinic or organization, community) and interact to determine the public health or population-based impact of a program or policy. The authors discuss issues in evaluating each of these dimensions and combining them to determine overall public health impact. Failure to adequately evaluate programs on all 5 dimensions can lead to a waste of resources, discontinuities between stages of research, and failure to improve public health to the limits of our capacity. The authors summarize strengths and limitations of the RE-AIM model and recommend areas for future research and application.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120079020", "source": "openalex"}

We examine how structural aspects of neighborhood context, specifically, socioeconomic stratification and racial/ethnic segregation, affect adolescent emotional well-being by shaping subjective perceptions of their neighborhoods. Using a community-based sample of 877 adolescents in Los Angeles County, we find that youth in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods perceive greater ambient hazards such as crime, violence, drug use, and graffiti than those in high SES neighborhoods. The perception of the neighborhood as dangerous, in turn, influences the mental health of adolescents: the more threatening the neighborhood, the more common the symptoms of depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. Social stability and, to a lesser extent, social cohesion, also emerge as contributors to adolescent disorder. This investigation demonstrates that research into the mental health of young people should consider the socioeconomic and demographic environments in which they live.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049389431", "source": "openalex"}

The emergent conceptual framework consists of: (a) 13 characteristics of the recovery journey; (b) five recovery processes comprising: connectedness; hope and optimism about the future; identity; meaning in life; and empowerment (giving the acronym CHIME); and (c) recovery stage descriptions which mapped onto the transtheoretical model of change. Studies that focused on recovery for individuals of Black and minority ethnic (BME) origin showed a greater emphasis on spirituality and stigma and also identified two additional themes: culturally specific facilitating factors and collectivist notions of recovery. Conclusions The conceptual framework is a theoretically defensible and robust synthesis of people's experiences of recovery in mental illness.

This theory posits a multifaceted causal structure in which self-efficacy beliefs operate together with goals, outcome expectations, and perceived environmental impediments and facilitators in the regulation of human motivation, behavior, and well-being. Belief in one's efficacy to exercise control is a common pathway through which psychosocial influences affect health functioning. This core belief affects each of the basic processes of personal change--whether people even consider changing their health habits, whether they mobilize the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they do so, their ability to recover from setbacks and relapses, and how well they maintain the habit changes they have achieved. Human health is a social matter, not just an individual one. A comprehensive approach to health promotion also requires changing the practices of social systems that have widespread effects on human health.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2111591671", "source": "openalex"}

Uncertain drug adherence, suboptimal tolerability, non-response at therapeutic doses, or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are typical situations when measurement of medication concentrations is helpful. Patient populations that may predominantly benefit from TDM in psychiatry are children, pregnant women, elderly patients, individuals with intelligence disabilities, forensic patients, patients with known or suspected genetically determined pharmacokinetic abnormalities or individuals with pharmacokinetically relevant comorbidities. However, the potential benefits of TDM for optimization of pharmacotherapy can only be obtained if the method is adequately integrated into the clinical treatment process. To promote an appropriate use of TDM, the TDM expert group of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP) issued guidelines for TDM in psychiatry in 2004. Since then, knowledge has advanced significantly, and new psychopharmacologic agents have been introduced that are also candidates for TDM. Therefore the TDM consensus guidelines were updated and extended to 128 neuropsychiatric drugs. 4 levels of recommendation for using TDM were defined ranging from \"strongly recommended\" to \"potentially useful\". Evidence-based \"therapeutic reference ranges\" and \"dose related reference ranges\" were elaborated after an extensive literature search and a structured internal review process. A \"laboratory alert level\" was introduced, i. e., a plasma level at or above which the laboratory should immediately inform the treating physician. Supportive information such as cytochrome P450 substrate- and inhibitor properties of medications, normal ranges of ratios of concentrations of drug metabolite to parent drug and recommendations for the interpretative services are given. Recommendations when to combine TDM with pharmacogenetic tests are also provided. Following the guidelines will help to improve the outcomes of psychopharmacotherapy of many patients especially in case of pharmacokinetic problems. Thereby, one should never forget that TDM is an interdisciplinary task that sometimes requires the respectful discussion of apparently discrepant data so that, ultimately, the patient can profit from such a joint effort.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125138227", "source": "openalex"}

In response, international and national health bodies are producing guidelines to address health behaviors in the prevention and treatment of mental illness. However, the current evidence for the causal role of lifestyle factors in the onset and prognosis of mental disorders is unclear. We performed a systematic meta‐review of the top‐tier evidence examining how physical activity, sleep, dietary patterns and tobacco smoking impact on the risk and treatment outcomes across a range of mental disorders. Results from 29 meta‐analyses of prospective/cohort studies, 12 Mendelian randomization studies, two meta‐reviews, and two meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials were synthesized to generate overviews of the evidence for targeting each of the specific lifestyle factors in the prevention and treatment of depression, anxiety and stress‐related disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Standout findings include: a) convergent evidence indicating the use of physical activity in primary prevention and clinical treatment across a spectrum of mental disorders; b) emerging evidence implicating tobacco smoking as a causal factor in onset of both common and severe mental illness; c) the need to clearly establish causal relations between dietary patterns and risk of mental illness, and how diet should be best addressed within mental health care; and d) poor sleep as a risk factor for mental illness, although with further research required to understand the complex, bidirectional relations and the benefits of non‐pharmacological sleep‐focused interventions.

It proposes that analysts include a “reference-case” analysis in all CEA’s designed to inform resource allocation and puts forth the most expicit set of guidelines (together with their rationale) ever outlined of the conduct of CEAs. Important theoretical and practical issues encountered in measuring costs and effectiveness, valuing outcomes, discounting, and dealing with uncertainty are examined in separate chapters. These discussions are complemented by additional chapters on framing and reporting of CEAs that aim to clarify the purpose of the analysis and the effective communication of its findings.

The absence of mental illness, however, is a minimal outcome from a psychological perspective on lifespan development. This article therefore focuses on mental illness as well as on three core components of positive mental health: feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life (emotional well-being), positive individual functioning in terms of self-realization (psychological well-being), and positive societal functioning in terms of being of social value (social well-being). The two continua model holds that mental illness and mental health are related but distinct dimensions. This model was studied on the basis of a cross-sectional representative internet survey of Dutch adults (N = 1,340; 18-87 years). Mental illness was measured with the Brief Symptom Inventory and mental health with the Mental Health Continuum Short Form. It was found that older adults, except for the oldest-old, scored lower on psychopathological symptoms and were less likely to be mentally ill than younger adults. Although there were fewer age differences for mental health, older adults experienced more emotional, similar social and slightly lower psychological well-being. In sum, today's older adults have fewer mental illness problems, but they are not in a better positive mental health than today's younger adults. These findings support the validity of the two continua model in adult development.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117617786", "source": "openalex"}

The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation.To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

Prevalence, impact of medications and disparities in health care", "text": "The lifespan of people with severe mental illness (SMI) is shorter compared to the general population. This excess mortality is mainly due to physical illness. We report prevalence rates of different physical illnesses as well as important individual lifestyle choices, side effects of psychotropic treatment and disparities in health care access, utilization and provision that contribute to these poor physical health outcomes. We searched MEDLINE (1966 - August 2010) combining the MeSH terms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with the different MeSH terms of general physical disease categories to select pertinent reviews and additional relevant studies through cross-referencing to identify prevalence figures and factors contributing to the excess morbidity and mortality rates. Nutritional and metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, viral diseases, respiratory tract diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, sexual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, stomatognathic diseases, and possibly obesity-related cancers are, compared to the general population, more prevalent among people with SMI. It seems that lifestyle as well as treatment specific factors account for much of the increased risk for most of these physical diseases. Moreover, there is sufficient evidence that people with SMI are less likely to receive standard levels of care for most of these diseases. Lifestyle factors, relatively easy to measure, are barely considered for screening; baseline testing of numerous important physical parameters is insufficiently performed. Besides modifiable lifestyle factors and side effects of psychotropic medications, access to and quality of health care remains to be improved for individuals with SMI.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116251861", "source": "openalex"}

The gender roles hypothesis suggests that these differences narrow as the roles of women and men become more equal. <h3>Objectives</h3> To study time-space (cohort-country) variation in gender differences in lifetime<i>DSM-IV</i>mental disorders across cohorts in 15 countries in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative and to determine if this variation is significantly related to time-space variation in female gender role traditionality as measured by aggregate patterns of female education, employment, marital timing, and use of birth control. <h3>Design</h3> Face-to-face household surveys. <h3>Setting</h3> Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific. <h3>Participants</h3> Community-dwelling adults (N = 72 933). <h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3> The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 18<i>DSM-IV</i>anxiety, mood, externalizing, and substance disorders. Survival analyses estimated time-space variation in female to male odds ratios of these disorders across cohorts defined by the following age ranges: 18 to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years and older. Structural equation analysis examined predictive effects of variation in gender role traditionality on these odds ratios. <h3>Results</h3> In all cohorts and countries, women had more anxiety and mood disorders than men, and men had more externalizing and substance disorders than women. Although gender differences were generally consistent across cohorts, significant narrowing was found in recent cohorts for major depressive disorder and substance disorders. This narrowing was significantly related to temporal (major depressive disorder) and spatial (substance disorders) variation in gender role traditionality. <h3>Conclusions</h3> While gender differences in most lifetime mental disorders were fairly stable over the time-space units studied, substantial intercohort narrowing of differences in major depression was found to be related to changes in the traditionality of female gender roles. Additional research is needed to understand why this temporal narrowing was confined to major depression.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990663212", "source": "openalex"}

Unfortunately, people distressed by these illnesses often do not seek out services or choose to fully engage in them. One factor that impedes care seeking and undermines the service system is mental illness stigma. In this article, we review the complex elements of stigma in order to understand its impact on participating in care. We then summarize public policy considerations in seeking to tackle stigma in order to improve treatment engagement. Stigma is a complex construct that includes public, self, and structural components. It directly affects people with mental illness, as well as their support system, provider network, and community resources. The effects of stigma are moderated by knowledge of mental illness and cultural relevance. Understanding stigma is central to reducing its negative impact on care seeking and treatment engagement. Separate strategies have evolved for counteracting the effects of public, self, and structural stigma. Programs for mental health providers may be especially fruitful for promoting care engagement. Mental health literacy, cultural competence, and family engagement campaigns also mitigate stigma's adverse impact on care seeking. Policy change is essential to overcome the structural stigma that undermines government agendas meant to promote mental health care. Implications for expanding the research program on the connection between stigma and care seeking are discussed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109297286", "source": "openalex"}

Making use of research on this topic over the past decade, this paper summarizes the current state of our knowledge about how people engage in mental accounting activities. Three components of mental accounting receive the most attention. This first captures how outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how decisions are made and subsequently evaluated. The accounting system provides the inputs to be both ex ante and ex post cost–benefit analyses. A second component of mental accounting involves the assignment of activities to specific accounts. Both the sources and uses of funds are labeled in real as well as in mental accounting systems. Expenditures are grouped into categories (housing, food, etc.) and spending is sometimes constrained by implicit or explicit budgets. The third component of mental accounting concerns the frequency with which accounts are evaluated and 'choice bracketing'. Accounts can be balanced daily, weekly, yearly, and so on, and can be defined narrowly or broadly. Each of the components of mental accounting violates the economic principle of fungibility. As a result, mental accounting influences choice, that is, it matters. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135839350", "source": "openalex"}

A clinical staging model, widely used in clinical medicine, could improve the utility of diagnosis in psychiatry, especially in young people with emerging disorders. Clinical staging has immediate potential to improve the logic and timing of interventions in psychiatry, as it does in many complex and potentially serious medical disorders. Interventions could be evaluated in terms of their ability to prevent or delay progression from earlier to later stages of a disorder, and selected by consumers and clinicians on the basis of clear-cut risk–benefit criteria. This would ensure that, as treatments are offered earlier, they remain safe, acceptable and affordable, and potentially more effective. Biological variables and a range of candidate risk and protective factors could be studied within and across stages, and their role, specificity and centrality in risk, onset and progression of disorders clarified. In this way, a clinicopathological framework could be progressively constructed. Clinical staging, with restructuring across and within diagnostic boundaries and explicit operational criteria for extent and progression of disorder, should be actively explored in psychiatry as a heuristic strategy for developing and evaluating earlier, safer, and more effective clinical interventions, and for clarifying the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. Young people with emerging mental and substance use disorders could be the main beneficiaries.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125247047", "source": "openalex"}

The various solutions proposed would all involve a strengthening of psychiatry's identity as essentially ‘applied neuroscience’. Although not discounting the importance of the brain sciences and psychopharmacology, we argue that psychiatry needs to move beyond the dominance of the current, technological paradigm.

Interoceptive signaling has been considered a component process of reflexes, urges, feelings, drives, adaptive responses, and cognitive and emotional experiences, highlighting its contributions to the maintenance of homeostatic functioning, body regulation, and survival. Dysfunction of interoception is increasingly recognized as an important component of different mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders, addictive disorders, and somatic symptom disorders. However, a number of conceptual and methodological challenges have made it difficult for interoceptive constructs to be broadly applied in mental health research and treatment settings. In November 2016, the Laureate Institute for Brain Research organized the first Interoception Summit, a gathering of interoception experts from around the world, with the goal of accelerating progress in understanding the role of interoception in mental health. The discussions at the meeting were organized around four themes: interoceptive assessment, interoceptive integration, interoceptive psychopathology, and the generation of a roadmap that could serve as a guide for future endeavors.

METHODS Data SourcesThe NCS was a congressionally mandated study of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the United States. 15dministered between September 1990 and February 1992, the survey used a stratified, multistage probability sample of persons aged 15 to 54 years in the noninstitutionalized civilian population.The data were released for public use in 1998.The study design allowed for estimation of the national prevalence of mental illness as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R).", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076166404", "source": "openalex"}

The authors use three national data sets and examine ethnic disparities in unmet need (defined as having a need for mental health evaluation but not using any services in a 1-year period) to provide such estimates. METHOD: The authors conducted secondary data analyses in three nationally representative household surveys fielded in 1996–1998: the National Health Interview Survey, the National Survey of American Families, and the Community Tracking Survey. They determined rates of mental health service use by children and adolescents 3–17 years of age and differences by ethnicity and insurance status. Among the children defined as in need of mental health services, defined by an estimator of mental health problems (selected items from the Child Behavior Checklist), they examined the association of unmet need with ethnicity and insurance status. RESULTS: In a 12-month period, 2%–3% of children 3–5 years old and 6%–9% of children and adolescents 6–17 years old used mental health services. Of children and adolescents 6–17 years old who were defined as needing mental health services, nearly 80% did not receive mental health care. Controlling for other factors, the authors determined that the rate of unmet need was greater among Latino than white children and among uninsured than publicly insured children. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that most children who need a mental health evaluation do not receive services and that Latinos and the uninsured have especially high rates of unmet need relative to other children. Rates of use of mental health services are extremely low among preschool children. Research clarifying the reasons for high rates of unmet need in specific groups can help inform policy and clinical programs.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152802023", "source": "openalex"}

The predominance of American research into this disorder over the past 40 years has led to the impression that ADHD is largely an American disorder and is much less prevalent elsewhere. This impression was reinforced by the perception that ADHD may stem from social and cultural factors that are most common in American society. However, another school of thought suggested that ADHD is a behavioral disorder common to children of many different races and societies worldwide, but that is not recognized by the medical community, perhaps due to confusion regarding its diagnosis and/or misconceptions regarding its adverse impact on children, their families, and society as a whole. In this article we present the available data, with a view to determining the worldwide prevalence of ADHD. A total of 50 studies were identified from a MEDLINE search for the terms ADHD, ADD, HKD, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and prevalence combined, for the years 1982 to 2001. 20 were studies in US populations and 30 were in non-US populations. Analysis of these studies suggests that the prevalence of ADHD is at least as high in many non-US children as in US children, with the highest prevalence rates being seen when using DSM-IV diagnoses. Recognition that ADHD is not purely an American disorder and that the prevalence of this behavioral disorder in many countries is in the same range as that in the USA will have important implications for the psychiatric care of children.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2163322724", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Median and inter-quartile range (IQR; 25th–75th percentiles) of age-of-onset is much earlier for phobias (7–14, IQR 4–20) and impulse–control disorders (7–15; IQR 4–35) than other anxiety disorders (25–53, IQR 15–75), mood disorders (25–45, IQR 17–65), and substance disorders (18–29, IQR 16–43). Although less data exist for nonaffective psychosis, available evidence suggests that median age-of-onset is in the range late teens through early 20s. Roughly half of all lifetime mental disorders in most studies start by the mid-teens and three quarters by the mid-20s. Later onsets are mostly secondary conditions. Severe disorders are typically preceded by less severe disorders that are seldom brought to clinical attention. Summary First onset of mental disorders usually occur in childhood or adolescence, although treatment typically does not occur until a number of years later. Although interventions with early incipient disorders might help reduce severity-persistence of primary disorders and prevent secondary disorders, additional research is needed on appropriate treatments for early incipient cases and on long-term evaluation of the effects of early intervention on secondary prevention.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981722146", "source": "openalex"}

A major restatement of a theory the author developed in his 1971 book, Imagery and Verbal Processes, it covers phenomena from the earlier period that remain relevant today but emphasizes cognitive problems and paradigms that have since emerged more fully. The author proposes that performance in memory and other cognitive tasks is mediated not only by linguistic processes but also by a distinct nonverbal imagery model of thought as well. He discusses the philosophy of science associated with the dual coding approach, emphasizing the advantages of empiricism in the study of cognitive phenomena and showing that the fundamentals of the theory have stood up well to the empirical challenges over the years.

The research set out to consider why young people, and particularly young males, do not seek help when they are in psychological distress or suicidal; how professional services be made more accessible and attractive to young people; the factors that inhibit and facilitate help-seeking; and how community gatekeepers can support young people to access services to help with personal and emotional problems. A range of studies was undertaken in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data from a total of 2721 young people aged 14–24 years were gathered, as well as information from some of the community gatekeepers to young people’s mental health care.Help-seeking was measured in all the studies using the General Help Seeking Questionnaire (Wilson, Deane, Ciarrochi & Rickwood, 2005), which measures future help-seeking intentions and, through supplementary questions, can also assess prior help-seeking experience. Many of the studies also measured recent help-seeking behaviour using the Actual Help Seeking Questionnaire. The types of mental health problems examined varied across the studies and included depressive symptoms, personal-emotional problems, and suicidal thoughts.The help-seeking process was conceptualised using a framework developed during the research program. This framework maintains that help-seeking is a process of translating the very personal domain of psychological distress to the interpersonal domain of seeking help. Factors that were expected to facilitate or inhibit this translation process were investigated. These included factors that determine awareness of the personal domain of psychological distress and that affect the ability to articulate or express this personal domain to others, as well as willingness to disclose mental health issues to other people.The results are reported in terms of: patterns of help-seeking across adolescence and young adulthood; the relationship of help-seeking intentions to behaviour; barriers to seeking help—lack of emotional competence, the help-negation effect related to suicidal thoughts, negative attitudes and beliefs about help-seeking and fear of stigma; and facilitators of seeking help—emotional competence, positive past experience, mental health literacy, and supportive social influences. The paper considers the implications of the findings for the development of interventions to encourage young people to seek help for their mental health problems, and concludes by identifying gaps in the help-seeking research and literature and suggesting future directions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064569513", "source": "openalex"}

The increasing number of patients and suspected cases, and the increasing number of outbreak-affected provinces and countries have elicited public worry about becoming infected. The unpredictable future of this epidemic has been exacerbated by myths and misinformation, often driven by erroneous news reports and the public's misunderstanding of health messages, thus causing worry in the population. Further travel bans and some executive orders to quarantine travellers during the Spring Festival holiday might have generated public anxiety while trying to contain the outbreak.

With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed.This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI.Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions.From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition.We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2916945592", "source": "openalex"}

Such cG×E research has received widespread attention and acclaim, yet cG×E findings remain controversial. The authors examined whether the many positive cG×E findings reported in the psychiatric literature were robust or if, in aggregate, cG×E findings were consistent with the existence of publication bias, low statistical power, and a high false discovery rate.The authors conducted analyses on data extracted from all published studies (103 studies) from the first decade (2000-2009) of cG×E research in psychiatry.Ninety-six percent of novel cG×E studies were significant compared with 27% of replication attempts. These findings are consistent with the existence of publication bias among novel cG×E studies, making cG×E hypotheses appear more robust than they actually are. There also appears to be publication bias among replication attempts because positive replication attempts had smaller average sample sizes than negative ones. Power calculations using observed sample sizes suggest that cG×E studies are underpowered. Low power along with the likely low prior probability of a given cG×E hypothesis being true suggests that most or even all positive cG×E findings represent type I errors.In this new era of big data and small effects, a recalibration of views about groundbreaking findings is necessary. Well-powered direct replications deserve more attention than novel cG×E findings and indirect replications.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087414280", "source": "openalex"}

Method Data were from the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. Representative household samples were interviewed face to face in 24 countries. Reasons to initiate and continue treatment were examined in a subsample ( n = 636 78) and analyzed at different levels of clinical severity. Results Among those with a DSM-IV disorder in the past 12 months, low perceived need was the most common reason for not initiating treatment and more common among moderate and mild than severe cases. Women and younger people with disorders were more likely to recognize a need for treatment. A desire to handle the problem on one's own was the most common barrier among respondents with a disorder who perceived a need for treatment (63.8%). Attitudinal barriers were much more important than structural barriers to both initiating and continuing treatment. However, attitudinal barriers dominated for mild-moderate cases and structural barriers for severe cases. Perceived ineffectiveness of treatment was the most commonly reported reason for treatment drop-out (39.3%), followed by negative experiences with treatment providers (26.9% of respondents with severe disorders). Conclusions Low perceived need and attitudinal barriers are the major barriers to seeking and staying in treatment among individuals with common mental disorders worldwide.

A previous article focusing only on the initial screening is likely to have underestimated the mental health burden.To measure the mental health needs among soldiers returning from Iraq and the association of screening with mental health care utilization.Population-based, longitudinal descriptive study of the initial large cohort of 88 235 US soldiers returning from Iraq who completed both a Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) and a Post-Deployment Health Re-Assessment (PDHRA) with a median of 6 months between the 2 assessments.Screening positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, alcohol misuse, or other mental health problems; referral and use of mental health services.Soldiers reported more mental health concerns and were referred at significantly higher rates from the PDHRA than from the PDHA. Based on the combined screening, clinicians identified 20.3% of active and 42.4% of reserve component soldiers as requiring mental health treatment. Concerns about interpersonal conflict increased 4-fold. Soldiers frequently reported alcohol concerns, yet very few were referred to alcohol treatment. Most soldiers who used mental health services had not been referred, even though the majority accessed care within 30 days following the screening. Although soldiers were much more likely to report PTSD symptoms on the PDHRA than on the PDHA, 49% to 59% of those who had PTSD symptoms identified on the PDHA improved by the time they took the PDHRA. There was no direct relationship of referral or treatment with symptom improvement.Rescreening soldiers several months after their return from Iraq identified a large cohort missed on initial screening. The large clinical burden recently reported among veterans presenting to Veterans Affairs facilities seems to exist within months of returning home, highlighting the need to enhance military mental health care during this period. Increased relationship problems underscore shortcomings in services for family members. Reserve component soldiers who had returned to civilian status were referred at higher rates on the PDHRA, which could reflect their concerns about their ongoing health coverage. Lack of confidentiality may deter soldiers with alcohol problems from accessing treatment. In the context of an overburdened system of care, the effectiveness of population mental health screening was difficult to ascertain.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097229522", "source": "openalex"}

A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.ResultsOn May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years.ConclusionsOverall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1593442063", "source": "openalex"}

It is a composite term to describe a range of outcomes to health education and communication activities. From this perspective, health education is directed towards improving health literacy. This paper identifies the failings of past educational programs to address social and economic determinants of health, and traces the subsequent reduction in the role of health education in contemporary health promotion. These perceived failings may have led to significant underestimation of the potential role of health education in addressing the social determinants of health. A 'health outcome model' is presented. This model highlights health literacy as a key outcome from health education. Examination of the concept of health literacy identifies distinctions between functional health literacy, interactive health literacy and critical health literacy. Through this analysis, improving health literacy meant more than transmitting information, and developing skills to be able to read pamphlets and successfully make appointments. By improving people's access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, it is argued that improved health literacy is critical to empowerment. The implications for the content and method of contemporary health education and communication are then considered. Emphasis is given to more personal forms of communication, and community-based educational outreach, as well as the political content of health education, focussed on better equipping people to overcome structural barriers to health.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105099865", "source": "openalex"}

History shows that religious organizations were often the first to offer compassionate care to the mentally ill; however, for hundreds of years the religious establishment also persecuted the mentally ill. Nevertheless, the first form of psychiatric care in Western Europe and the US was known as 'moral treatment', in which religion played a significant role. The teachings of Freud and others during the early twentieth century concerning the neurotic influences of religion have had an enormous impact on the field, nullifying the quite favorable views toward religion held by nineteenth century psychiatrists. In this article, we review research that has found both negative and positive associations between religious involvement and mental health. We then examine the implications of this research for the clinical practice of psychiatry in the twentyfirst century.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150838544", "source": "openalex"}

To date, no empirical synthesis of research on these issues has been undertaken.To meta-analytically establish the extent of compromised mental health among refugees (including internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and stateless persons) using a worldwide study sample. Potential moderators of mental health outcomes were examined, including enduring contextual variables (eg, postdisplacement accommodation and economic opportunity) and refugee characteristics.Published studies (1959-2002) were obtained using broad searches of computerized databases (PsycINFO and PILOTS), manual searches of reference lists, and interviews with prominent authors.Studies were selected if they investigated a refugee group and at least 1 nonrefugee comparison group and reported 1 or more quantitative group comparison on measures of psychopathology. Fifty-six reports met inclusion criteria (4.4% of identified reports), yielding 59 independent comparisons and including 67,294 participants (22,221 refugees and 45,073 nonrefugees).Data on study and report characteristics, study participant characteristics, and statistical outcomes were extracted using a coding manual and subjected to blind recoding, which indicated high reliability. Methodological quality information was coded to assess potential sources of bias.Effect size estimates for the refugee-nonrefugee comparisons were averaged across psychopathology measures within studies and weighted by sample size. The weighted mean effect size was 0.41 (SD, 0.02; range, -1.36 to 2.91 [SE, 0.01]), indicating that refugees had moderately poorer outcomes. Postdisplacement conditions moderated mental health outcomes. Worse outcomes were observed for refugees living in institutional accommodation, experiencing restricted economic opportunity, displaced internally within their own country, repatriated to a country they had previously fled, or whose initiating conflict was unresolved. Refugees who were older, more educated, and female and who had higher predisplacement socioeconomic status and rural residence also had worse outcomes. Methodological differences between studies affected effect sizes.The sociopolitical context of the refugee experience is associated with refugee mental health. Humanitarian efforts that improve these conditions are likely to have positive impacts.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139358896", "source": "openalex"}

Measures of criterion validity showed high levels of sensitivity for moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment and lower levels for mild degrees of impairment. Content analyses revealed the MMSE was highly verbal, and not all items were equally sensitive to cognitive impairment. Items measuring language were judged to be relatively easy and lacked utility for identifying mild language deficits. Overall, MMSE scores were affected by age, education, and cultural background, but not gender.In general, the MMSE fulfilled its original goal of providing a brief screening test that quantitatively assesses the severity of cognitive impairment and documents cognitive changes occurring over time. The MMSE should not, by itself, be used as a diagnostic tool to identify dementia. Suggestions for the clinical use of the MMSE are made.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109140840", "source": "openalex"}

By Gerald Gurin, Joseph Veroff, and Sheila Feld. Price, $7.50. Pp. 444. Basic Books, Inc., 59 Fourth Ave., New York 3, 1960. This is the fourth in the series of ten monographs sponsored by the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health and designed to assess the nation's mental health resources and needs from a variety of perspectives. Its focus is the subjective dimension of mental health. Although not all of the monographs have been published so far, the findings and the recommendations of each have been already summed up and interpreted in the Commission's final report which, because of the publicity it has received, may be familiar to many readers. The present volume is based on an interview survey conducted in 1957 with nearly twenty-five hundred individuals selected to provide a probability sample of the country's adult population. It is a product of three social psychologists, all of whom are on the staff of the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, one of the few widely recognized and influential organizations of its kind in social sciences. Besides being impressive for sheer magnitude and the consistent clarity in the presentation and evaluation of the data, the study gives further testimony of the methodological sophistication and the technical know-how typical of the work produced by the Center. Without committing themselves to a definition of mental health, the investigators explore it through a number of measures of adjustment. The measures, however, all derive from the self-appraised, experiential realm of the respondent. In the area of general life adjustment, such measures are obtained from the information about the extent of worrying, evaluation of personal happiness, whether the respondent ever felt close to a nervous breakdown, and if he ever experienced a problem relevant for professional help. In the more specific areas of functioning, namely, marriage, parenthood, and work, adjustment is studied via consideration of such variables as satisfaction with the particular role, feelings of adequacy in performing it, degree of involvement, expectations about future, and the type of problems and their prevalence encountered in each role. It is worth pointing out that in taking a multiple-criterion approach to mental health, the investigators are implicitly in agreement with the current view (e.g., Jahoda, 1958; Smith, 1961) that the search for a conceptual formulation of mental health which could meet with a general consensus is futile because of the unavoidable valuative assumptions in all such formulations. The organization of the book is as follows : The first part deals mainly with the distribution and the interrelations of the indices of adjustment in different demographic groups, most often specified in terms of such variables as sex, education, and age.

This meta-analysis, or statistical overview, of the literature gives an estimate of the suicide risk of the common mental disorders. Method We searched the medical literature to find reports on the mortality of mental disorders. English language reports were located on MEDLINE (1966–1993) with the search terms mental disorders', ‘brain injury’, ‘eating disorders’, ‘epilepsy’, ‘suicide attempt’, ‘psychosurgery’, with ‘mortality’ and ‘follow-up studies’, and from the reference lists of these reports. We abstracted 249 reports with two years or more follow-up and less than 10% loss of subjects, and compared observed numbers of suicides with those expected. A standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated for each disorder. Results Of 44 disorders considered, 36 have a significantly raised SMR for suicide, five have a raised SMR which fails to reach significance, one SMR is not raised and for two entries the SMR could not be calculated. Conclusions If these results can be generalised then virtually all mental disorders have an increased risk of suicide excepting mental retardation and dementia. The suicide risk is highest for functional and lowest for organic disorders with substance misuse disorders lying between. However, within these broad groupings the suicide risk varies widely.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2083524390", "source": "openalex"}

METHOD: A total of 8,667 adult members of an HMO completed measures of childhood exposure to family dysfunction, which included items on physical and sexual abuse, witnessing of maternal battering, and emotional abuse in the childhood family environment. The adults’ current mental health was assessed by using the mental health scale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS: The prevalences of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and witnessing of maternal violence were 21.6%, 20.6%, and 14.0%, respectively, when the maltreatment types were considered separately. Among respondents reporting any of the maltreatment types, 34.6% reported more than one type of maltreatment. Lower mean mental health scores were associated with higher numbers of abuse categories (mean=78.5, 75.5, 72.8, and 69.9 for respondents with no, one, two, and three abuse types, respectively). Both an emotionally abusive family environment and the interaction of an emotionally abusive family environment with the various maltreatment types had a significant effect on mental health scores. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood physical and sexual abuse, as well as witnessing of maternal battering, were common among the adult members of an HMO in this study. Among those reporting any maltreatment, more than one-third had experienced more than one type of maltreatment. A dose-response relation was found between the number of types of maltreatment reported and mental health scores. In addition, an emotionally abusive family environment accentuated the decrements in mental health scores. Future research examining the effects of childhood maltreatment on adult mental health should include assessments of a wide range of abusive experiences, as well as the family atmosphere in which they occur.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155088814", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2032152873", "title": "Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference, and Consciousness", "text": "Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird's theory of consciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram's classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nobel laureate Richard Thaler and legal scholar and bestselling author Cass Sunstein explain in this important exploration of that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself. In Nudge, Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think, we can design environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful choice architecture can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of choice. Nudge offers a unique new take-from neither the left nor the right-on many hot-button issues, for individuals and governments alike.

Although its importance is increasingly recognised, there is no consensus about the definition of health literacy or about its conceptual dimensions, which limits the possibilities for measurement and comparison. The aim of the study is to review definitions and models on health literacy to develop an integrated definition and conceptual model capturing the most comprehensive evidence-based dimensions of health literacy. Methods A systematic literature review was performed to identify definitions and conceptual frameworks of health literacy. A content analysis of the definitions and conceptual frameworks was carried out to identify the central dimensions of health literacy and develop an integrated model. Results The review resulted in 17 definitions of health literacy and 12 conceptual models. Based on the content analysis, an integrative conceptual model was developed containing 12 dimensions referring to the knowledge, motivation and competencies of accessing, understanding, appraising and applying health-related information within the healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion setting, respectively. Conclusions Based upon this review, a model is proposed integrating medical and public health views of health literacy. The model can serve as a basis for developing health literacy enhancing interventions and provide a conceptual basis for the development and validation of measurement tools, capturing the different dimensions of health literacy within the healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion settings.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101761001", "source": "openalex"}

However, they are often confused with one another, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. This paper proposes definitions to distinguish them. Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. The energy expenditure can be measured in kilocalories. Physical activity in daily life can be categorized into occupational, sports, conditioning, household, or other activities. Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive and has as a final or an intermediate objective the improvement or maintenance of physical fitness. Physical fitness is a set of attributes that are either health- or skill-related. The degree to which people have these attributes can be measured with specific tests. These definitions are offered as an interpretational framework for comparing studies that relate physical activity, exercise, and physical fitness to health.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2227813149", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects were newly enrolled members of a health maintenance organization (HMO), and the criterion diagnoses were those found through use of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) in a stratified sample of respondents to an initial, mailed GHQ. To compare questionnaires, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis, comparing areas under curves through the method of Hanley and McNeil. The MHI-5 was as good as the MHI-18 and the GHQ-30, and better than the SSI-28, for detecting most significant DIS disorders, including major depression, affective disorders generally, and anxiety disorders. Areas under curve for the MHI-5 ranged from 0.739 (for anxiety disorders) to 0.892 (for major depression). Single items from the MHI also performed well. In this population, short screening questionnaires, and even single items, may detect the majority of people with DIS disorders while incurring acceptably low false-positive rates. Perhaps such extremely short questionnaires could more commonly reach use in actual practice than the longer versions have so far, permitting earlier assessment and more appropriate treatment of psychiatrically troubled patients in primary care settings.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043191085", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: To update a 2004 systematic review and determine whether low health literacy is related to poorer use of health care, outcomes, costs, and disparities in health outcomes among persons of all ages. Data Sources: English-language articles identified through MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane Library databases and hand-searching (search dates for articles on health literacy, 2003 to 22 February 2011; for articles on numeracy, 1966 to 22 February 2011). Study Selection: Two reviewers independently selected studies that compared outcomes by differences in directly measured health literacy or numeracy levels. Data Extraction: One reviewer abstracted article information into evidence tables; a second reviewer checked information for accuracy. Two reviewers independently rated study quality by using predefined criteria, and the investigative team jointly graded the overall strength of evidence. Data Synthesis: 96 relevant good- or fair-quality studies in 111 articles were identified: 98 articles on health literacy, 22 on numeracy, and 9 on both. Low health literacy was consistently associated with more hospitalizations; greater use of emergency care; lower receipt of mammography screening and influenza vaccine; poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications appropriately; poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages; and, among elderly persons, poorer overall health status and higher mortality rates. Poor health literacy partially explains racial disparities in some outcomes. Reviewers could not reach firm conclusions about the relationship between numeracy and health outcomes because of few studies or inconsistent results among studies. Limitations: Searches were limited to articles published in English. No Medical Subject Heading terms exist for identifying relevant studies. No evidence concerning oral health literacy (speaking and listening skills) and outcomes was found. Conclusion: Low health literacy is associated with poorer health outcomes and poorer use of health care services.

Participants completed an online survey that included standardized measures of mental health. Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated associations between stigma and mental health and tested whether indicators of resilience (family support, peer support, identity pride) moderated these associations.Respondents had a high prevalence of clinical depression (44.1%), anxiety (33.2%), and somatization (27.5%). Social stigma was positively associated with psychological distress. Peer support (from other transgender people) moderated this relationship. We found few differences by gender identity.Our findings support the minority stress model. Prevention needs to confront social structures, norms, and attitudes that produce minority stress for gender-variant people; enhance peer support; and improve access to mental health and social services that affirm transgender identity and promote resilience.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171513312", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders. Methods: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach. Findings: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247–308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8–9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34–44] and DALYs by 15% [9–21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26–30] and DALYs by 27% [24–31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6–46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7–20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0–12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6–10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05–1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8–35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8–17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable). Interpretation: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The reeler heterozygous mouse (+/rl) appears superficially normal but has been of interest as an animal model for psychosis since the discovery that reelin is 50% down-regulated in postmortem psychotic brain. Brain abnormalities in +/rl are similar to psychotic brain and include a reduction in glutamic acid de carboxylase 67 (GAD67), dendritic arbors and spine density in cortex and hippocampus, and abnormalities in synaptic function including long-term potentiation (LTP). In spite of these abnormalities, behavioral abnormalities in +/rl are subtle and controversial. Recent findings indicate that the reelin (RELN) and GAD67 promoters are hypermethylated in GABAergic neurons of psychotic postmortem brain and that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is up-regulated. Hypermethlyation of RELN and GAD67 promoters can be induced by treating mice with methionine, and these mice display brain and behavioral abnormalities similar to +/rl. Thus, an animal model that combines genetic heterozygocity with epigenesis holds promise for understanding the role of Reelin down-regulation in psychosis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2320983896", "source": "openalex"}

It is increasingly apparent that there are significant limitations to these criteria, which only address the contrast-enhancing component of the tumor. For example, chemoradiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastomas results in transient increase in tumor enhancement (pseudoprogression) in 20% to 30% of patients, which is difficult to differentiate from true tumor progression. Antiangiogenic agents produce high radiographic response rates, as defined by a rapid decrease in contrast enhancement on CT/MRI that occurs within days of initiation of treatment and that is partly a result of reduced vascular permeability to contrast agents rather than a true antitumor effect. In addition, a subset of patients treated with antiangiogenic agents develop tumor recurrence characterized by an increase in the nonenhancing component depicted on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. The recognition that contrast enhancement is nonspecific and may not always be a true surrogate of tumor response and the need to account for the nonenhancing component of the tumor mandate that new criteria be developed and validated to permit accurate assessment of the efficacy of novel therapies. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group is an international effort to develop new standardized response criteria for clinical trials in brain tumors. In this proposal, we present the recommendations for updated response criteria for high-grade gliomas.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162643152", "source": "openalex"}

We developed a neurologic examination and have correlated changes in neurologic status with the size and location of areas of infarction. The MCA was surgically occluded at different sites in six groups of normal rats. After 24 hr, rats were evaluated for the extent of neurologic deficits and graded as having severe, moderate, or no deficit using a new examination developed for this model. After rats were sacrificed the incidence of infarction was determined at histologic examination. In a subset of rats, the size of the area of infarction was measured as a percent of the area of a standard coronal section. Focal (1-2 mm) occlusion of the MCA at its origin, at the olfactory tract, or lateral to the inferior cerebral vein produced infarction in 13%, 67%, and 0% of rats, respectively (N = 38) and produced variable neurologic deficits. However, more extensive (3 or 6 mm) occlusion of the MCA beginning proximal to the olfactory tract--thus isolating lenticulostriate end-arteries from the proximal and distal supply--produced infarctions of uniform size, location, and with severe neurologic deficit (Grade 2) in 100% of rats (N = 17). Neurologic deficit correlated significantly with the size of the infarcted area (Grade 2, N = 17, 28 +/- 5% infarction; Grade 1, N = 5, 19 +/- 5%; Grade 0, N = 3, 10 +/- 2%; p less than 0.05). We have characterized precise anatomical sites of the MCA that when surgically occluded reliably produce uniform cerebral infarction in rats, and have developed a neurologic grading system that can be used to evaluate the effects of cerebral ischemia rapidly and accurately.

Images were generated at 0.5 T in a high-resolution, multisection mode. Diffusion coefficients measured on images of water and acetone phantoms were consistent with published values. Images obtained in the neurologic area from healthy subjects and patients were analyzed in terms of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) incorporating the effect of all IVIMs. Differences were found between various normal and pathologic tissues. The ADC of in vivo water differed from the diffusion coefficient of pure water.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4210575617", "title": "Neurological associations of COVID-19", "text": "SummaryBackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.Recent developmentsA growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin.Where next?Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210575617", "source": "openalex"}

For further explanation of the clarifications and changes in this revision, see the accompanying article (Kirshblum S., et al. J Spinal Cord Med. 2011:doi 10.1179/107902611X13186000420242 The spinal cord is the major conduit through which motor and sensory information travels between the brain and body. The spinal cord contains longitudinally oriented spinal tracts (white matter) surrounding central areas (gray matter) where most spinal neuronal cell bodies are located. The gray matter is organized into segments comprising sensory and motor neurons. Axons from spinal sensory neurons enter and axons from motor neurons leave the spinal cord via segmental nerves or roots. In the cervical spine, there are 8 nerve roots. Cervical roots of C1-C7 are named according to the vertebra above which they exit (i.e. C1 exits above the C1 vertebra, just below the skull and C6 nerve roots pass between the C5 and C6 vertebrae) whereas C8 exists between the C7 and T1 vertebra; as there is no C8 vertebra. The C1 nerve root does not have a sensory component that is tested on the International Standards Examination. The thoracic spine has 12 distinct nerve roots and the lumbar spine consists of 5 distinct nerve roots that are each named accordingly as they exit below the level of the respective vertebrae. The sacrum consists of 5 embryonic sections that have fused into one bony structure with 5 distinct nerve roots that exit via the sacral foramina. The spinal cord itself ends at approximately the L1-2 vertebral level. The distal most part of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The cauda equina is a cluster of paired (right and left) lumbosacral nerve roots that originate in the region of the conus medullaris and travel down through the thecal sac and exit via the intervertebral foramen below their respective vertebral levels. There may be 0, 1, or 2 coccygeal nerves but they do not have a role with the International Standards examination in accordance with the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI). Each root receives sensory information from skin areas called dermatomes. Similarly each root innervates a group of muscles called a myotome. While a dermatome usually represents a discrete and contiguous skin area, most roots innervate more than one muscle, and most muscles are innervated by more than one root. Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects conduction of sensory and motor signals across the site(s) of lesion(s), as well as the autonomic nervous system. By systematically examining the dermatomes and myotomes, as described within this booklet, one can determine the cord segments affected by the SCI. From the International Standards examination several measures of neurological damage are generated, e.g., Sensory and Motor Levels (on right and left sides), NLI, Sensory Scores (Pin Prick and Light Touch), Motor Scores (upper and lower limb), and ZPP. This booklet also describes the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale (AIS) to classify the severity (i.e. completeness) of injury. This booklet begins with basic definitions of common terms used herein. The section that follows describes the recommended International Standards examination, including both sensory and motor components. Subsequent sections cover sensory and motor scores, the AIS classification, and clinical syndromes associated with SCI. For ease of reference, a worksheet (Appendix 1) of the recommended examination is included, with a summary of steps used to classify the injury (Appendix 2).

A comprehensive chapter on behavioural neuroanatomy provides a background for brain-behaviour interactions in the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebullum. Chapters on temperolimbic epilepsy, major psychiatric syndromes, and dementia provide in-depth analyses of these neurobehavioral entities and their neurobiological coordinates. Changes for this second edition include the reflection throughout the book of the new and flourishing alliance of behavioral neurology, neuropsychology, and neuropsychiatry with cognitive science;major revision of all chapters; new authorship of those on language and memory; and the inclusion of entirely new chapters on psychiatric syndromes and the dementias. Both as a textbook and a reference work, the second edition of Principles of Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology represents an invaluable resource for behavioural neurologists, neuropsychologists, neuropsychiatrists, cognitive and basic neuroscientists, geriatricians, physiatrists, and their students and trainees.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W611533172", "source": "openalex"}

Each child had been evaluated at 30 months of age. The children underwent standardized cognitive and neurologic assessments at six years of age. Disability was defined as severe (indicating dependence on caregivers), moderate, or mild according to predetermined criteria.Of 308 surviving children, 241 (78 percent) were assessed at a median age of six years and four months; 160 classmates delivered at full term served as a comparison group. Although the use of test reference norms showed that cognitive impairment (defined as results more than 2 SD below the mean) was present in 21 percent of the children born extremely preterm (as compared with 1 percent in the standardized data), this value rose to 41 percent when the results were compared with those for their classmates. The rates of severe, moderate, and mild disability were 22 percent, 24 percent, and 34 percent, respectively; disabling cerebral palsy was present in 30 children (12 percent). Among children with severe disability at 30 months of age, 86 percent still had moderate-to-severe disability at 6 years of age. In contrast, other disabilities at the age of 30 months were poorly predictive of developmental problems at 6 years of age.Among extremely preterm children, cognitive and neurologic impairment is common at school age. A comparison with their classroom peers indicates a level of impairment that is greater than is recognized with the use of standardized norms.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016693709", "source": "openalex"}

To explore this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated in which the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), under the regulatory control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene promoter, was overexpressed in the CNS. A number of transgenic founder mice and their offspring exhibited a neurologic syndrome the severity of which correlated with the levels of cerebral IL-6 expression. Transgenic mice with high levels of IL-6 expression developed severe neurologic disease characterized by runting, tremor, ataxia, and seizure.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study provides such information but does not routinely aggregate results that are of interest to clinicians specialising in neurological conditions. In this systematic analysis, we quantified the global disease burden due to neurological disorders in 2015 and its relationship with country development level.We estimated global and country-specific prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) for various neurological disorders that in the GBD classification have been previously spread across multiple disease groupings. The more inclusive grouping of neurological disorders included stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, tetanus, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, brain and nervous system cancers, and a residual category of other neurological disorders. We also analysed results based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility, to identify patterns associated with development and how countries fare against expected outcomes relative to their level of development.Neurological disorders ranked as the leading cause group of DALYs in 2015 (250·7 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 229·1 to 274·7] million, comprising 10·2% of global DALYs) and the second-leading cause group of deaths (9·4 [9·1 to 9·7] million], comprising 16·8% of global deaths). The most prevalent neurological disorders were tension-type headache (1505·9 [UI 1337·3 to 1681·6 million cases]), migraine (958·8 [872·1 to 1055·6] million), medication overuse headache (58·5 [50·8 to 67·4 million]), and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (46·0 [40·2 to 52·7 million]). Between 1990 and 2015, the number of deaths from neurological disorders increased by 36·7%, and the number of DALYs by 7·4%. These increases occurred despite decreases in age-standardised rates of death and DALYs of 26·1% and 29·7%, respectively; stroke and communicable neurological disorders were responsible for most of these decreases. Communicable neurological disorders were the largest cause of DALYs in countries with low SDI. Stroke rates were highest at middle levels of SDI and lowest at the highest SDI. Most of the changes in DALY rates of neurological disorders with development were driven by changes in YLLs.Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, the burden of neurological disorders has increased substantially over the past 25 years because of expanding population numbers and ageing, despite substantial decreases in mortality rates from stroke and communicable neurological disorders. The number of patients who will need care by clinicians with expertise in neurological conditions will continue to grow in coming decades.

The diagnosis is difficult because clinical markers are often lacking, and symptoms usually precede the diagnosis of cancer or mimic other complications. The frequency of antineuronal antibodies in patients with PLE has not been investigated. We examined the neurological symptoms and the causal tumours in 50 patients with PLE to determine the utility of paraneoplastic antibodies and other tests. The diagnosis of PLE required neuropathological examination or the presence of the four following criteria: (i) a compatible clinical picture; (ii) an interval of <4 years between the development of neurological symptoms and tumour diagnosis; (iii) exclusion of other neuro-oncological complications; and (iv) at least one of the following: CSF with inflammatory changes but negative cytology; MRI demonstrating temporal lobe abnormalities; EEG showing epileptic activity in the temporal lobes. Of 1047 patients with neurological symptoms, whose sera or CSF were examined for paraneoplastic antibodies, 79 had the presumptive diagnosis of limbic encephalitis, dementia, cognitive dysfunction, or confusion. Fifty of these patients fulfilled our criteria for PLE. Pathological confirmation was obtained in 12 patients. The commonly associated neoplasms were of the lung (50%), testis (20%) and breast (8%). Neurological symptoms preceded the cancer diagnosis in 60% of patients (by a median of 3.5 months). Twenty-five of 44 (57%) patients with MRI studies had signal abnormalities in the limbic system. Thirty (60%) patients had antineuronal antibodies (18 anti-Hu, 10 anti-Ta, 2 anti-Ma), and 20 were antibody-negative or had uncharacterized antibodies (n = 4). The combination of symptoms, MRI findings and paraneoplastic antibodies established the diagnosis of PLE in 78% of the patients. Patients with anti-Hu antibodies usually had small-cell lung cancer (94%), multifocal neurological symptoms (78%) and a poor neurological outcome. Patients with anti-Ta (also called anti-Ma2) antibodies were young men with testicular tumours (100%), frequent hypothalamic involvement (70%) and a poor neurological outcome. In the group of patients without anti-Hu or anti-Ta antibodies, the tumour distribution was diverse, with cancer of the lung the most common (36%); 57% had positive MRI. Fifteen of 34 (44%) patients with a median follow-up of 8 months showed neurological improvement. Treatment of the tumour appeared to have more effect on the neurological outcome than the use of immune modulation.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified.In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil.In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94% or more (95% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93% sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85% sensitivity (95% CI, 76 to 94) and 73% specificity (95% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95% sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain.

Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment ofpatients up to age 25years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2905654445", "source": "openalex"}

Then, we discuss the desired device characteristics of the synaptic devices (e.g., multilevel states, weight update nonlinearity/asymmetry, variation/noise), and survey a few representative material systems and device prototypes reported in the literature that show the analog conductance tuning. These candidates include phase change memory, resistive memory, ferroelectric memory, floating-gate transistors, etc. Next, we introduce the crossbar array architecture to accelerate the weighted sum and weight update operations that are commonly used in the neuro-inspired machine learning algorithms, and review the recent progresses of array-level experimental demonstrations for pattern recognition tasks. In addition, we discuss the peripheral neuron circuit design issues and present a device-circuit-algorithm codesign methodology to evaluate the impact of nonideal device effects on the system-level performance (e.g., learning accuracy).

The present study investigated whether reperfusing the ischemic territory 30 to 60 minutes after the arterial occlusion would have a beneficial effect on either the clinical or the histological outcome of the lesion. Methods One hundred four adult rats (including appropriate controls) were used; 97 had a middle cerebral artery occluded by inserting a nylon monofilament via the right external carotid artery. The arterial occlusion was transient in two groups and permanent in another; survival times were comparable for all groups. Control animals were subjected to a sham operation during which the artery was occluded for less than 1 minute. The outcome was evaluated by measuring the extent of the neurological deficit and the severity of the histological injury. Results Mean neurological score and mean number of necrotic neurons in the cortex were more favorable after transient (30- to 60-minute) compared with permanent arterial occlusion ( P &lt;.005). Moreover, the correlation between mean neurological score and mean number of necrotic neurons was highly significant: r =.951; P &lt;.001. Conclusions The histological effects of an intracranial arterial occlusion in the adult rat can be predicted on day 1 by the neurological score described in this report.

We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism.FindingsAmong 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33·62% (95% CI 33·17–34·07), with 12·84% (12·36–13·33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46·42% (44·78–48·09) and for a first diagnosis was 25·79% (23·50–28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0·56% (0·50–0·63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97–2·23) for ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08–0·14) for parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59–0·75) for dementia, 17·39% (17·04–17·74) for anxiety disorder, and 1·40% (1·30–1·51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2·66% (2·24–3·16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17–7·76) for ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15–0·45) for parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31–2·30) for dementia, 19·15% (17·90–20·48) for anxiety disorder, and 2·77% (2·31–3·33) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40–1·47, for any diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68–1·89, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14–1·17, for any diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27–1·36, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 1·58, 1·50–1·67, for any diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45–3·35, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events.InterpretationOur study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.FundingNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3148333766", "source": "openalex"}

Rule generation from artificial neural networks is gaining in popularity in recent times due to its capability of providing some insight to the user about the symbolic knowledge embedded within the network. Fuzzy sets are an aid in providing this information in a more human comprehensible or natural form, and can handle uncertainties at various levels. The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules. Finally, real-life application to medical diagnosis is provided.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159111290", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2651525809", "title": "Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Clinical Trials", "text": "Development of novel therapies for CNS tumors requires reliable assessment of response and progression. This requirement has been particularly challenging in neuro-oncology for which contrast enhancement serves as an imperfect surrogate for tumor volume and is influenced by agents that affect vascular permeability, such as antiangiogenic therapies. In addition, most tumors have a nonenhancing component that can be difficult to accurately quantify. To improve the response assessment in neuro-oncology and to standardize the criteria that are used for different CNS tumors, the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group was established. This multidisciplinary international working group consists of neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, neuropsychologists, and experts in clinical outcomes assessments, working in collaboration with government and industry to enhance the interpretation of clinical trials. The RANO working group was originally created to update response criteria for high- and low-grade gliomas and to address such issues as pseudoresponse and nonenhancing tumor progression from antiangiogenic therapies, and pseudoprogression from radiochemotherapy. RANO has expanded to include working groups that are focused on other tumors, including brain metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, spine tumors, pediatric brain tumors, and meningiomas, as well as other clinical trial end points, such as clinical outcomes assessments, seizures, corticosteroid use, and positron emission tomography imaging. In an effort to standardize the measurement of neurologic function for clinical assessment, the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology scale was drafted. Born out of a workshop conducted by the Jumpstarting Brain Tumor Drug Development Coalition and the US Food and Drug Administration, a standardized brain tumor imaging protocol now exists to reduce variability and improve reliability. Efforts by RANO have been widely accepted and are increasingly being used in neuro-oncology trials, although additional refinements will be needed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2651525809", "source": "openalex"}

Responding to this, a weekly virtual coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) neurology multi-disciplinary meeting was established at the National Hospital, Queen Square, in early March 2020 in order to discuss and begin to understand neurological presentations in patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disorders. Detailed clinical and paraclinical data were collected from cases where the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed through RNA PCR, or where the diagnosis was probable/possible according to World Health Organization criteria. Of 43 patients, 29 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and definite, eight probable and six possible. Five major categories emerged: (i) encephalopathies (n = 10) with delirium/psychosis and no distinct MRI or CSF abnormalities, and with 9/10 making a full or partial recovery with supportive care only; (ii) inflammatory CNS syndromes (n = 12) including encephalitis (n = 2, para- or post-infectious), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 9), with haemorrhage in five, necrosis in one, and myelitis in two, and isolated myelitis (n = 1). Of these, 10 were treated with corticosteroids, and three of these patients also received intravenous immunoglobulin; one made a full recovery, 10 of 12 made a partial recovery, and one patient died; (iii) ischaemic strokes (n = 8) associated with a pro-thrombotic state (four with pulmonary thromboembolism), one of whom died; (iv) peripheral neurological disorders (n = 8), seven with Guillain-Barré syndrome, one with brachial plexopathy, six of eight making a partial and ongoing recovery; and (v) five patients with miscellaneous central disorders who did not fit these categories. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological syndromes affecting the whole neuraxis, including the cerebral vasculature and, in some cases, responding to immunotherapies. The high incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, particularly with haemorrhagic change, is striking. This complication was not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease. Early recognition, investigation and management of COVID-19-related neurological disease is challenging. Further clinical, neuroradiological, biomarker and neuropathological studies are essential to determine the underlying pathobiological mechanisms that will guide treatment. Longitudinal follow-up studies will be necessary to ascertain the long-term neurological and neuropsychological consequences of this pandemic.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3040794648", "source": "openalex"}

Three samples were utilized during short form development: general population (Internet-based, n = 2,113); clinical panel (Internet-based, n = 553); and clinical outpatient (clinic-based, n = 581). All short forms are expressed as T scores with a mean of 50 and SD of 10.Internal consistency (Cronbach α) of the 13 short forms ranged from 0.85 to 0.97. Correlations between short form and full-length item bank scores ranged from 0.88 to 0.99 (0.82-0.96 after removing common items from banks). Online respondents were asked whether they had any of 19 different chronic health conditions, and whether or not those reported conditions interfered with ability to function normally. All short forms, across physical, mental, and social health, were able to separate people who reported no health condition from those who reported 1-2 or 3 or more. In addition, scores on all 13 domains were worse for people who acknowledged being limited by the health conditions they reported, compared to those who reported conditions but were not limited by them.These 13 brief measures of self-reported QOL are reliable and show preliminary evidence of concurrent validity inasmuch as they differentiate people based upon number of reported health conditions and whether those reported conditions impede normal function.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1985265957", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2411848313", "title": "Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimizing Motor Performance", "text": "This second edition of Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimizing Motor Performance provides a practical, task-oriented approach to rehabilitation for clients with neurological conditions, emphasizing active participation by clients and providing details of exercises and training to challenge them and help them regain the strength and endurance needed for independent living. In the new edition, authors Janet Carr and Roberta Shepherd have included updated scientific evidence as well as input from colleagues whose research and clinical expertise are also in this area of practice. Neurological Rehabilitation is also innovative in discussing the need to expand rehabilitation to increase opportunities for practice by including semi-supervised groups and circuit training in addition to traditional one-to-one interventions. The book is divided into three parts. Chapters 1–3 provide a foundation for understanding the role of neuro-rehabilitation in recovery. Chapter 1 reviews plasticity in the brain and the role of practice and challenge in brain reorganization; chapter 2 builds on this by discussing task-specific practice, the principles of motor learning, and clinical applications of these principles in neuro-rehabilitation. Chapter 3 provides an overview of measurement tools commonly used in neuro-rehabilitation. Part 2 devotes one chapter to each of the following specific actions required for independent living: standing up and sitting down, walking, reaching and manipulation, and balancing. Each chapter describes the action and the biomechanical factors, the motor dysfunction that occurs following neurological injury, and practical methods for training, focusing on repetitive task-oriented training, functional strength training of task-related muscles, and maximizing skills with practice and variety. The information on training is applicable to patient care, but because it focuses on clients who are able to perform the action, there is less guidance for working with those who are unable to do so, or who need to work on other tasks such as getting out of bed. Part 3 covers lesions to the motor and sensory–perceptual systems and includes detailed chapters on stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Each chapter discusses the pathology of the lesion or condition, resulting clinical features, training, and specific assessments. The recommended management consistently includes specific exercises and task-specific and aerobic training. Throughout, Carr and Shepherd also provide information on supplementary methods for rehabilitation, including mental practice, orthosis, electrostimulation, and computerized aids, and discuss the evidence-based benefits of including these methods in management strategies. Photos of exercises, clients, and clinicians working with clients complement the text and are helpful for applying the information clinically. Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimizing Motor Performance is an excellent book for a practical, task-oriented approach to neuro-rehabilitation, and I would recommend it as one of the key resources for working with clients with neurological conditions. However, additional resources may also be useful, since this book focuses on the task-oriented approach and offers little information or evidence on other approaches. Because of its rehabilitation focus, Neurological Rehabilitation will be most beneficial to physical therapy students, new graduates and experienced clinicians who work in neuro-rehabilitation, but other health care professionals and physical therapists in other settings may also find it helpful for the detailed information it provides on neurological injury and recovery. Overall, Neurological Rehabilitation balances evidence with clinical application, provides a foundation of knowledge for neuro-rehabilitation as well as methods for promoting motor learning and plasticity, and encourages readers to think about changing the delivery of therapy to enhance learning and recovery.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2411848313", "source": "openalex"}

Fatigue contributes substantially to decrements in quality of life and disability in these illnesses. Despite the clear impact of fatigue as a disabling symptom, our understanding of fatigue pathophysiology is limited and current treatment options rarely lead to meaningful improvements in fatigue. Progress continues to be hampered by issues related to terminology and assessment. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy and a novel assessment approach to addressing distinct aspects of fatigue and fatigability in clinical and research settings. This taxonomy is based on our current knowledge of the pathophysiology and phenomenology of fatigue and fatigability. Application of our approach indicates that the assessment and reporting of fatigue can be clarified and improved by utilizing this taxonomy and creating measures to address distinct aspects of fatigue and fatigability. We review the strengths and weaknesses of several common measures of fatigue and suggest, based on our model, that many research questions may be better addressed by using multiple measures. We also provide examples of how to apply and validate the taxonomy and suggest directions for future research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011810065", "source": "openalex"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,899 consecutive cerebral digital subtraction angiograms obtained with nonionic contrast material were prospectively evaluated. Neurologic complications were categorized as transient (<24 hours), reversible (24 hours to 7 days), and permanent (>7 days). The neurologic complication rate was correlated with patient age, type of indication for catheter angiography, medical history, fluoroscopic time, number and size of catheters, type and number of vessels injected, operator experience, and the quartile in which the study was performed. The correlations were statistically analyzed with Fisher exact tests and a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: There were 39 (1.3%) neurologic complications in 2,899 procedures; 20 were transient (0.7%), five (0.2%) were reversible, and 14 (0.5%) were permanent. Neurologic complications were significantly more common in patients 55 years of age or older (25 of 1,361; 1.8%) (P = .035), in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (20 of 862; 2.3%) (P = .004), and when fluoroscopic times were 10 minutes or longer (24 of 1,238; 1.9%) (P = .022). The neurologic complication rate was higher in procedures performed by fellows alone (24 of 1,878; 1.3%) compared with that when staff alone performed the procedures (three of 598; 0.5%), but the difference was not significant (P = .172). Neurologic complications were lower in the fourth quartile of the study (six of 171; 0.9%) compared with the first quartile (16 of 776; 2.1%), which was likely due to fewer patients being examined for carotid stenosis or ischemic stroke and fewer patients with CVD (P = .085). CONCLUSION: Age-related vascular disease accounted for the failure to lower the neurologic complication rate of cerebral angiography despite technical advances. © RSNA, 2003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2169436924", "source": "openalex"}

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. <h3>Observations</h3> This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3029172496", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we used GBD 2010 data to investigate time, year, region and age specific trends in burden due to mental, neurological and substance use disorders. Method For each disorder, prevalence data were assembled from systematic literature reviews. DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was used to model prevalence by country, region, age, sex and year. Prevalence data were combined with disability weights derived from survey data to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years lost to premature mortality (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying deaths occurring as a result of a given disorder by the reference standard life expectancy at the age death occurred. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Results In 2010, mental, neurological and substance use disorders accounted for 10.4% of global DALYs, 2.3% of global YLLs and, 28.5% of global YLDs, making them the leading cause of YLDs. Mental disorders accounted for the largest proportion of DALYs (56.7%), followed by neurological disorders (28.6%) and substance use disorders (14.7%). DALYs peaked in early adulthood for mental and substance use disorders but were more consistent across age for neurological disorders. Females accounted for more DALYs in all mental and neurological disorders, except for mental disorders occurring in childhood, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy where males accounted for more DALYs. Overall DALYs were highest in Eastern Europe/Central Asia and lowest in East Asia/the Pacific. Conclusion Mental, neurological and substance use disorders contribute to a significant proportion of disease burden.

Both nuclei receive projections from the striatum with axons containing substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R), and immunoreactivities for these substances show complementary patterns in the striatum and SNr. In this study we revealed a similar complementarity in the mouse EPN, combined it with region-specific neuronal distributions, and defined subregions of the EPN. First, the EPN was divided into two areas, one showing low SP and high CB1R (lSP/hCB1R) immunoreactivities and the other showing opposite immunoreactivities (hSP/lCB1R). The former received inputs from the dorsolateral striatum that is innervated by sensorimotor cortices, whereas the latter received inputs from the medial striatum innervated by limbic/association cortices. Then, the lSP/hCB1R area was further divided into the dorsolateral subregion in the rostral EPN and the core subregion in the caudal EPN, the latter characterized by the concentration of parvalbumin-positive neurons targeting the VA-VL thalamic nucleus. The hSP/lCB1R area was divided into the ventromedial subregion in the rostral EPN and the shell subregion in the caudal EPN, the former characterized by the concentration of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons targeting the lateral habenula (LHb). Somatostatin-positive neurons targeting the LHb were located diffusely in three subregions other than the core. These findings illuminate structural organization inside the basal ganglia, suggesting mechanisms for sorting diverse information through parallel loops with differing synaptic modulation by CB1R. <b>Significance statement</b> The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in rodents corresponds to the internal segment of the globus pallidus in primates and is one of the major output nuclei of the basal ganglia. Because studies on the EPN are limited, we investigated the morphological features of the mouse EPN, focusing on the complementary immunoreactivities for substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R). The EPN was first divided into two parts, one showing low SP and high CB1R immunoreactivities and the other showing opposite immunoreactivities. Each part was further divided into two subregions based on the distributions of different neuronal types. The present findings clarify the structural organization inside the EPN, suggesting mechanisms for processing diverse information with differing synaptic modulation by CB1R.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099917041", "source": "openalex"}

Significant differences were established between tension headache and migraine in respect of incidence and severity of symptoms and their time of onset in relation to the headache. In migraine, vestibulocochlear disturbances can occur as an aura, accompanying the headache or during headache-free periods, the highest incidence occurring during the headache. In Series I, 59 per cent reported vestibular and/or cochlear symptoms and these were of disabling severity in 5 per cent. Significantly, 50 per cent had a history of motion sickness and 81 per cent experienced phonophobia during the headache, the probable mechanism of which is discussed. Persisting vestibulocochlear derangements were found in 77.5 per cent of Series II, largely vestibular and of both central and peripheral origin.

Repeated injection of LPS (250 microg/kg, 3 or 7 times) resulted in an accumulation of Abeta1-42 in the hippocampus and cerebralcortex of mice brains through increased beta- and gamma-secretase activities accompanied with the increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), 99-residue carboxy-terminal fragment of APP (C99) and generation of Abeta1-42 as well as activation of astrocytes in vivo. 3 weeks of pretreatment of sulindac sulfide (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg, orally), an anti-inflammatory agent, suppressed the LPS-induced amyloidogenesis, memory dysfunction as well as neuronal cell death in vivo. Sulindac sulfide (12.5-50 microM) also suppressed LPS (1 microg/ml)-induced amyloidogenesis in cultured neurons and astrocytes in vitro.This study suggests that neuro-inflammatory reaction could contribute to AD pathology, and anti-inflammatory agent could be useful for the prevention of AD.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099157718", "source": "openalex"}

The experimental record indicates that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located in Broca's area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca's aphasia, does have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinatorial capacities necessary for language processing – for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion – are not supported by the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics. The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross-linguistic considerations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimaging and from structured observations on speech production of Broca's aphasics. Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human combinatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transformational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca's area.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153590473", "source": "openalex"}

Further, available measures are generally expensive, normed on homogenous nondiverse populations, not easily administered, do not cover the lifespan (or have easily linked pediatric and adult counterparts for the purposes of longitudinal comparison), and not based on the current thinking in the neuroscience community. There is also a paucity of measurement tools to gauge normal children in the motor and sensation domain areas, and many of these measures rely heavily on proxy reporting. Investigators have expressed the need for brief assessment tools that could address these issues and be used as a form of \"common currency\" across diverse study designs and populations. This ability to assess functionality along a common metric and \"crosswalk\" across measures is essential to the process of being able to pool data, which is often necessary when a large and diverse sample is needed.

Methods This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-positive (SARS-CoV-2+) and 50 laboratory-negative (SARS-CoV-2-) individuals) presenting to our Neuro-Covid-19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid-19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia, and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient-reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments. Results Mean age was 43.2 ± 11.3 years, 70% were female, and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%). The main neurologic manifestations were: \"brain fog\" (81%), headache (68%), numbness/tingling (60%), dysgeusia (59%), anosmia (55%), and myalgias (55%), with only anosmia being more frequent in SARS-CoV-2+ than SARS-CoV-2- patients (37/50 [74%] vs. 18/50 [36%]; p < 0.001). Moreover, 85% also experienced fatigue. There was no correlation between time from disease onset and subjective impression of recovery.

This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164553222", "source": "openalex"}

Many studies that have investigated neurological complications after RA are dated, and do not reflect the increasing indications and applications of RA nor the advances in training and techniques. In this brief narrative review we collate the contemporary investigations of neurological complications after the most common RA techniques.We reviewed all 32 studies published between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2005 where the primary intent was to investigate neurological complications of RA.The sample size of the studies that investigated neurological complications after central and peripheral (PNB) nerve blockade ranged from 4185 to 1,260,000 and 20 to 10,309 blocks, respectively. The rate of neuropathy after spinal and epidural anesthesia was 3.78:10,000 (95% CI: 1.06-13.50:10,000) and 2.19:10,000 (95% CI: 0.88-5.44:10,000), respectively.

Of an initial unselected group of 318 patients, 124 (39%) were neurologically symptomatic, and one-third already had their neurological complaints at the time of presentation. An additional 210 AIDS patients with neurological symptoms have been reported in the literature. Thus, a total of 366 neurologically symptomatic patients with AIDS or lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Central nervous system (CNS) complications, encountered in 315 patients, included the following viral syndromes: subacute encephalitis (54), atypical aseptic meningitis (21), herpes simplex encephalitis (nine), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (six), viral myelitis (three), and varicella-zoster encephalitis (one). Non-viral infections were caused by Toxoplasma gondii (103), Cryptococcus neoformans (41), Candida albicans (six), Mycobacteria (six), Treponema pallidum (two), coccidioidomycosis (one), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (one), Aspergillus fumigatus (one), and Escherichia coli (one). Neoplasms included primary CNS lymphoma (15), systemic lymphoma with CNS involvement (12), and metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma (three). Cerebrovascular complications were seen in four patients with hemorrhage and five with infarction. Five patients in the UCSF series had multiple intracranial pathologies, including two cases of simultaneous Toxoplasma gondii infections and primary CNS lymphoma, two cases of coexistent Toxoplasma gondii and viral infections, and one case of combined Toxoplasma gondii and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cranial or peripheral nerve complications, seen in 51 patients, included cranial nerve syndromes secondary to chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (five), lymphoma (five), and Bell's palsy (five). Peripheral nerve syndromes included chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (12), distal symmetrical neuropathy (13), herpes zoster radiculitis (six), persistent myalgias (two), myopathy (two), and polymyositis (one). In light of the protean behavior of AIDS and the problems related to the clinical, radiological, and serological diagnosis of the unusual and varied associated nervous system diseases, patients with AIDS and neurological complaints require a rigorous and detailed evaluation.

However, the diagnosis of SS with neurologic involvement is sometimes difficult, and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations have been described rarely. We conducted the current study to describe the clinical and laboratory features of SS patients with neurologic manifestations and to report their clinical outcome. We retrospectively studied 82 patients (65 women and 17 men) with neurologic manifestations associated with primary SS, as defined by the 2002 American-European criteria. The mean age at neurologic onset was 53 years. Neurologic involvement frequently preceded the diagnosis of SS (81% of patients). Fifty-six patients had CNS disorders, which were mostly focal or multifocal. Twenty-nine patients had spinal cord involvement (acute myelopathy [n = 12], chronic myelopathy [n = 16], or motor neuron disease [n = 1]). Thirty-three patients had brain involvement and 13 patients had optic neuropathy. The disease mimicked relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 10 patients and primary progressive MS in 13 patients. We also recorded diffuse CNS symptoms: some of the patients presented seizures (n = 7), cognitive dysfunction (n = 9), and encephalopathy (n = 2). Fifty-one patients had peripheral nervous system involvement (PNS). Symmetric axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with a predominance of sensory symptoms or pure sensory neuropathy occurred most frequently (n = 28), followed by cranial nerve involvement affecting trigeminal, facial, or cochlear nerves (n = 16). Multiple mononeuropathy (n = 7), myositis (n = 2), and polyradiculoneuropathy (n = 1) were also observed. Thirty percent of patients (all with CNS involvement) had oligoclonal bands. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in 61% of the patients tested. Fifty-eight patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Of these, 70% presented white matter lesions and 40% met the radiologic criteria for MS. Thirty-nine patients had a spinal cord MRI. Abnormalities were observed only in patients with spinal cord involvement. Among the 29 patients with myelopathy, 75% had T2-weighted hyperintensities. Patients with PNS manifestations had frequent extraglandular complications of SS. Anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies were detected in 21% of patients at the diagnosis of SS and in 43% of patients during the follow-up (mean follow-up, 10 yr). Biologic abnormalities were more frequently observed in patients with PNS involvement than in those with CNS involvement (p < 0.01). Fifty-two percent of patients had severe disability, and were more likely to have CNS involvement than PNS involvement (p < 0.001). Treatment by cyclophosphamide allowed a partial recovery or stabilization in patients with myelopathy (92%) or multiple mononeuropathy (100%). The current study underlines the diversity of neurologic complications of SS. The frequency of neurologic manifestations revealing SS and of negative biologic features, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why SS is frequently misdiagnosed. Screening for SS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, or cranial nerve involvement. The outcome is frequently severe, especially in patients with CNS involvement. Our study also underlines the efficacy of cyclophosphamide in myelopathy and multiple neuropathy occurring during SS.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2083149517", "source": "openalex"}

A closely related experience is autoscopy (AS), which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body-part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information-as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space-is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousness.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099202374", "source": "openalex"}

Severe complications are believed to be extremely rare, but the incidence is probably underestimated.A retrospective study of severe neurologic complications after central neuraxial blockades in Sweden 1990-1999 was performed. Information was obtained from a postal survey and administrative files in the health care system. During the study period approximately 1,260,000 spinal blockades and 450,000 epidural blockades were administered, including 200,000 epidural blockades for pain relief in labor.: The 127 complications found included spinal hematoma (33), cauda equina syndrome (32), meningitis (29), epidural abscess (13), and miscellaneous (20). Permanent neurologic damage was observed in 85 patients. Incidence of complications after spinal blockade was within 1:20-30,000 in all patient groups. Incidence after obstetric epidural blockade was 1:25,000; in the remaining patients it was 1:3600 (P < 0.0001). Spinal hematoma after obstetric epidural blockade carried the incidence 1:200,000, significantly lower than the incidence 1:3,600 females subject to knee arthroplasty (P < 0.0001).: More complications than expected were found, probably as a result of the comprehensive study design. Half of the complications were retrieved exclusively from administrative files. Complications occur significantly more often after epidural blockade than after spinal blockade, and the complications are different. Obstetric patients carry significantly lower incidence of complications. Osteoporosis is proposed as a previously neglected risk factor. Close surveillance after central neuraxial blockade is mandatory for safe practice.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144449821", "source": "openalex"}

Reliable estimates of the prevalence of permanent sequelae and mortality associated with congenital CMV are needed to guide development of education and prevention programmes and to gauge the financial costs associated with this disease. To calculate such estimates, this review used data solely from studies in which children with congenital CMV were identified through universal screening. Based on 15 studies with a total of 117 986 infants screened, the overall CMV birth prevalence estimate was 0.7%. The percentage of infected children with CMV‐specific symptoms at birth was 12.7%. The percentage of symptomatic children with permanent sequelae was 40–58%. The percentage of children without symptoms at birth who developed permanent sequelae was estimated to be 13.5%. The true burden of congenital CMV infection is unclear because data on important outcomes, such as visual impairment, are lacking and follow‐up of infected children has been too short to fully identify late‐onset sequelae. Therefore, the estimates of permanent sequelae associated with congenital CMV presented here are likely underestimates. Future studies should extend follow‐up of CMV‐infected children identified through universal screening and include the evaluation of visual impairment.

At the onset of this research we had to confront squarely (and solve!) a critical question: If anatomy is destiny, can we influence it? Our efforts over the last five years have been focused on answering this question and we will present a few of our clinical results from over 2,000 hours of robot-aided therapy with 76 stroke patients. To determine if exercise therapy influences plasticity and recovery of the brain following a stroke, we needed the appropriate \"microscope\" that would allow us to concomitantly control the amount of therapy delivered to a patient, while objectively measuring patient's performance. Back-driveable robots are the key enabling technology. Our results to date using common clinical scales suggest that robot-aided sensorimotor training does have a genuinely positive effect on reduction of impairment and the reorganization of the adult brain. Yet while clinical scales can help us to examine the impact in the neuro-recovery process, their coarse nature requires extensive and time-consuming trials, and on top of that they fail to show us details important for optimizing therapy. Alternative, robot-based scales offer the potential benefit of new finer measurements-and deeper insight into the process of recovery from neurological injury. We also plan to use present technology to establish the practicality and economic feasibility of clinician-supervised, robot-administered therapy, including classroom therapy. We feel quite optimistic that the march of progress will accelerate substantially in the near future and allow us to transfer this technology from the research realm to the everyday treatment of stroke survivors.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1496737310", "source": "openalex"}

Standardized clinical data were collected on patients with suspected WNV infection. Confirmed WNV-seropositive patients were reassessed at 8 months.Main Outcome MeasuresClinical, neurologic, and laboratory features at initial presentation, and long-term neurologic outcome.ResultsSixteen (37%) of 39 suspected cases had antibodies against WNV; 5 had meningitis, 8 had encephalitis, and 3 had poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis. Movement disorders, including tremor (15 [94%]), myoclonus (5 [31%]), and parkinsonism (11 [69%]), were common among WNV-seropositive patients. One patient died. At 8-month follow-up, fatigue, headache, and myalgias were persistent symptoms; gait and movement disorders persisted in 6 patients. Patients with WNV meningitis or encephalitis had favorable outcomes, although patients with acute flaccid paralysis did not recover limb strength.ConclusionsMovement disorders, including tremor, myoclonus, and parkinsonism, may be present during acute illness with WNV infection.

Usually, CNS pathologies are caused by known neurotropic viruses such as measles virus, herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus, among others. However, nowadays respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for CNS pathologies. Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the influenza virus (IV), the coronavirus (CoV), and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under five years old and also the elderly. Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms. The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or febrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies, and encephalitis. All these viruses have been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests that all these pathogens, once in the lungs, can spread throughout the body and eventually reach the CNS. The current knowledge about the mechanisms and routes used by these neuroinvasive viruses remains scarce.

The authors present their clinical experience with 17 dural AVM's in adults, including 10 cases with an aggressive neurological course (strictly defined as hemorrhage or progressive focal neurological deficit other than ophthalmoplegia). Two of these 10 patients died prior to surgical intervention and a third was severely disabled by intracerebral hemorrhage. Six patients underwent surgical resection of their dural AVM, with preparatory embolization in two cases. One patient received embolization and radiation therapy without surgery. Six of the seven cases without an aggressive neurological course were treated conservatively, and the seventh patient underwent embolization of a cavernous sinus dural AVM because of worsening ophthalmoplegia. In order to clarify features associated with aggressive behavior, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed on 360 additional dural AVM's reported in the literature with sufficiently detailed clinical and angiographic information. The location and angiographic features of 100 aggressive cases were compared to those of 277 benign cases. No location of dural AVM's was immune from aggressive neurological behavior; however, an aggressive neurological course was least often associated with cases involving the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and cavernous sinus and most often associated with cases at the tentorial incisura. Contralateral contribution to arterial supply and rate of shunting (high vs. low flow) did not correlate with aggressive neurological behavior as defined. Leptomeningeal venous drainage, variceal or aneurysmal venous dilations, and galenic drainage correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with aggressive neurological presentation. The latter three angiographic features often coexisted in the same dural AVM. It is concluded that these features significantly increase the natural risk of dural AVM's, and warrant a more vigilant therapeutic strategy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110124299", "source": "openalex"}

The mesolimbic cortex is cytoarchitectonically, angioarchitectonically, and neurochemically distinct and, along with the striatum, forms the entire target area of dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons. This raises the possibility that autism is related to neuromediator imbalance in those structures.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2805331168", "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders", "text": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2805331168", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS One thousand consecutive cerebral angiographic procedures were evaluated prospectively. Examinations were performed using transfemoral catheterization and film-screen methods. For purposes of this trial, a neurologic complication was defined as any new focal neurologic deficit or change in mental status occurring during the angiogram or within the following 24 hours. Patients were evaluated during and at the completion of angiography. Follow-up evaluations were performed on the day of and the day after angiography. RESULTS There were a total of 10 neurologic complications within 24 hours of angiography, 5 of which were persistent. Onset of 5 of the deficits occurred during angiography, the other 5 (3 persistent) were delayed. All complications occurred in patients being evaluated for stroke/transient ischemic attack or (in one case) asymptomatic bruit. A higher average age, longer average procedure time, and greater volume of radiographic contrast was noted in these patients than in the study population. CONCLUSION Cerebral angiography was associated with a 1% overall incidence of neurologic deficit and a 0.5% incidence of persistent deficit. All complications occurred in patients presenting with a history of stroke/transient ischemic accident or carotid bruit, which may reflect the difficulty of performing angiography in this population at risk for atherosclerotic changes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2319220716", "source": "openalex"}

Several proinflammatory cytokines are released early after the onset of brain ischemia, but it is unknown whether inflammation predisposes to neurological deterioration. We assessed the implication of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in early neurological worsening in ischemic stroke. Methods —Two hundred thirty-one patients consecutively admitted with first-ever ischemic cerebral infarction within the first 24 hours from onset were included. Neurological worsening was defined when the Canadian Stroke Scale (CSS) score fell at least 1 point during the first 48 hours after admission. IL-6 and TNF-α were determined in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n=81) obtained on admission. Results —Eighty-three patients (35.9%) deteriorated within the first 48 hours. IL-6 in plasma (&gt;21.5 pg/mL; OR 37.7, CI 11.9 to 118.8) or in CSF (&gt;6.3 pg/mL; OR 13.1, CI 2.2 to 77.3) were independent factors for early clinical worsening, with multiple logistic regression. The association was statistically significant in all ischemic stroke subtypes as well as in subjects with cortical or subcortical infarctions. IL-6 in plasma was highly correlated with body temperature, glucose, fibrinogen, and infarct volume. CSF and plasma concentrations of TNF-α were also higher in patients who deteriorated, but the differences observed did not remain significant on multivariate analysis. Conclusions —In addition to participating in the acute-phase response that follows focal cerebral ischemia, IL-6 levels on admission are associated with early clinical deterioration. The association between IL-6 and early neurological worsening prevails without regard to the initial size, topography, or mechanism of the ischemic infarction.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132401640", "source": "openalex"}

A systematic review of the literature was performed. Medline was searched and articles retrieved using predefined criteria. Data from randomized controlled trials with adequate neuro-developmental follow up (to at least one year) were entered into a meta-analysis to determine the effects of postnatal treatment of preterm infants with glucocorticoids. Cerebral palsy rates, and neuro-developmental impairment (developmental score more than 2SD below the mean, or cerebral palsy or blindness) were analyzed. The studies were divided into 2 groups according to the extent of contamination of the results by treatment of controls with steroids after the initial study period, those with less than 30% contamination, and those with more than 30% contamination or size of contamination not reported. Postnatal steroid therapy is associated with an increase in cerebral palsy and neuro-developmental impairment. The studies with less contamination show a greater effect of the steroids, consistent with a real direct toxic effect of steroids on the developing central nervous system. The typical relative risk for the development of cerebral palsy derived from studies with less than 30% contamination is 2.86 (95% CI 1.95, 4.19).

Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the fixed effects of age, sex, and diagnosis on log-transformed NfL levels, with cohort of origin modeled as a random intercept. Main Outcome and Measure: The cNfL levels adjusted for age and sex across diagnoses. Results: Data were collected for 10 059 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [18.8] years; 54.1% female). Thirty-five diagnoses were identified, including inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (n = 2795), dementias and predementia stages (n = 4284), parkinsonian disorders (n = 984), and HC (n = 1332). The cNfL was elevated compared with HC in a majority of neurological conditions studied. Highest levels were observed in cognitively impaired HIV-positive individuals (iHIV), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Huntington disease. In 33.3% of diagnoses, including HC, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease (AD), and Parkinson disease (PD), cNfL was higher in men than women. The cNfL increased with age in HC and a majority of neurological conditions, although the association was strongest in HC. The cNfL overlapped in most clinically similar diagnoses except for FTD and iHIV, which segregated from other dementias, and PD, which segregated from atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Conclusions and Relevance: These data support the use of cNfL as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage and indicate that age-specific and sex-specific (and in some cases disease-specific) reference values may be needed. The cNfL has potential to assist the differentiation of FTD from AD and PD from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2950228559", "source": "openalex"}

Compared with controls, patients showed increased low-frequency θ rhythmicity, in conjunction with a widespread and marked increase of coherence among high- and low-frequency oscillations. These data indicate the presence of a thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which we propose is responsible for all the above mentioned conditions. This coherent θ activity, the result of a resonant interaction between thalamus and cortex, is due to the generation of low-threshold calcium spike bursts by thalamic cells. The presence of these bursts is directly related to thalamic cell hyperpolarization, brought about by either excess inhibition or disfacilitation. The emergence of positive clinical symptoms is viewed as resulting from ectopic γ-band activation, which we refer to as the “edge effect.” This effect is observable as increased coherence between low- and high-frequency oscillations, probably resulting from inhibitory asymmetry between high- and low-frequency thalamocortical modules at the cortical level.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124698022", "source": "openalex"}

Nevertheless, survival for patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive glioma, although individually variable, has improved from an average of 10 months to 14 months after diagnosis in the last 5 years due to improvements in the standard of care. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment of these lesions for decades, and the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved greatly. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent with simple oral administration and a favorable toxicity profile, is used in conjunction with and after radiotherapy. Newer surgical techniques, such as fluorescence-guided resection and neuroendoscopic approaches, have become important in the management of malignant gliomas. Furthermore, new discoveries are being made in basic and translational research, which are likely to improve this situation further in the next 10 years. These include agents that block 1 or more of the disordered tumor proliferation signaling pathways, and that overcome resistance to already existing treatments. Targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic therapy with antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (bevacizumab) are finding their way into clinical practice. Large-scale research efforts are ongoing to provide a comprehensive understanding of all the genetic alterations and gene expression changes underlying glioma formation. These have already refined the classification of glioblastoma into 4 distinct molecular entities that may lead to different treatment regimens. The role of cancer stem-like cells is another area of active investigation. There is definite hope that by 2020, new cocktails of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in gliomas and reduce their mortality and morbidity, a positive development for patients, their families, and medical professionals alike.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115862526", "source": "openalex"}

Finally, reference to the neuro–psychiatric disorders of autism, psychopathy and acquired sociopathy will be made. In these conditions, the appropriate processing of emotional expressions is impaired. In autism, it is argued that the basic response to emotional expressions remains intact but that there is impaired ability to represent the referent of the individual displaying the emotion. In psychopathy, the response to fearful and sad expressions is attenuated and this interferes with socialization resulting in an individual who fails to learn to avoid actions that result in harm to others. In acquired sociopathy, the response to angry expressions in particular is attenuated resulting in reduced regulation of social behaviour.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109240438", "source": "openalex"}

The brain is the key organ of social connections and processes, however, and the same objective social relationship can be experienced as caring and protective or as exploitive and isolating. We review evidence that the perception of social isolation (i.e., loneliness) impacts brain and behavior and is a risk factor for broad-based morbidity and mortality. However, the causal role of loneliness on neural mechanisms and mortality is difficult to test conclusively in humans. Mechanistic animal studies provide a lens through which to evaluate the neurological effects of a member of a social species living chronically on the social perimeter. Experimental studies show that social isolation produces significant changes in brain structures and processes in adult social animals. These effects are not uniform across the brain or across species but instead are most evident in brain regions that reflect differences in the functional demands of solitary versus social living for a particular species. The human and animal literatures have developed independently, however, and significant gaps also exist.

We utilized multiplex Xmap technology to measure markers of neurodegenerative disease and metalloproteinases (MMPs) in parallel in CSF and plasma samples. Compared to the placebo-treated group, at 52 weeks, resveratrol markedly reduced CSF MMP9 and increased macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), interleukin (IL)-4, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2.

One-hundred twenty-three children with arterial ischemic stroke and 38 with sinovenous thrombosis were followed for a mean of 2.1 years (range, 0.8 to 6.6 years).

Most studies of moderate pesticide exposure have found increased prevalence of neurologic symptoms and changes in neurobehavioral performance, reflecting cognitive and psychomotor dysfunction. There is less evidence that moderate exposure is related to deficits in sensory or motor function or peripheral nerve conduction, but fewer studies have considered these outcomes. It is possible that the most sensitive manifestation of pesticide neurotoxicity is a general malaise lacking in specificity and related to mild cognitive dysfunction, similar to that described for Gulf War syndrome. Most studies have focused on organophosphate insecticides, but some found neurotoxic effects from other pesticides, including fungicides, fumigants, and organochlorine and carbamate insecticides. Pesticide exposure may also be associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease; several classes of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, have been implicated. Studies of other neurodegenerative diseases are limited and inconclusive. Future studies will need to improve assessment of pesticide exposure in individuals and consider the role of genetic susceptibility. More studies of pesticides other than organophosphates are needed.

Recently, clinical trials of several neurodegenerative diseases have increasingly targeted the evaluation of the effectiveness of various antioxidants. The results so far are encouraging but variable and thus confusing. Rationale for the possible clinical effectiveness of antioxidants in several degenerative conditions has arisen out of the many years of basic science generally showing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage are important factors in the processes involved. Aging is one of the most significant risk factors for degenerative neurological disorders. Basic science efforts in our laboratory have centered on exploring the role of ROS and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative processes. The present review brings together some of the basic concepts we have learned by following this approach for the last 20 years and specifically the results we have obtained by following up on our serendipitous findings that a nitrone‐based free radical trap, α‐phenyl‐ tert ‐butylnitrone (PBN), has neuroprotective activity in several experimental neurodegenerative models. The mechanistic basis of the neuroprotective activity of PBN does not appear to rely on its general free radical trapping or antioxidant activity per se , but its activity in mediating the suppression of genes induced by pro‐inflammatory cytokines and other mediators associated with enhanced neuroinflammatory processes. Neuroinflammatory processes, induced in part by pro‐inflammatory cytokines, yield enhanced ROS and reactive nitric oxide species (RNS) as well as other unknown components that have neurotoxic properties. Neurotoxic amounts of RNS are formed by the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The demonstration of enhanced 3‐nitro‐tyrosine formation in affected regions of the Alzheimer's brain, in comparison to age‐matched controls, reinforces the importance of neuroinflammatory processes. iNOS induction involves activation by phosphorylation of the MAP kinase p38 and can be induced in cultured astrocytes by IL‐1β or H2O2. The action of PBN and N‐acetyl cysteine to suppress the activation of p38 was demonstrated in cultured astrocytes. The demonstration of activated p38 in neurons surrounding amyloid plaques in affected regions of the Alzheimer's brain attest to enhanced signal transduction processes in this neurodegenerative condition. The major themes of ROS and RNS formation associated with neuroinflammation processes and the suppression of these processes by antioxidants and PBN continue to yield promising leads for new therapies. Outcomes of clinical trials on antioxidants will become less confusing as more knowledge is amassed on the basic processes involved.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070046033", "source": "openalex"}

Eight patients had complete motor and sensory loss (Frankel Grade A); six had complete motor loss but some sensation preserved (Frankel Grade B); and 16 had incomplete loss of motor function (10 patients Frankel Grade C and six patients Frankel Grade D). The average interval from onset of initial symptom to maximum neurological deficit was 13 hours, and the average interval from onset of symptom to surgery was 23 hours. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in all patients; 26 of these improved; four remained unchanged, and no patients worsened (mean follow up 11 months). Complete recovery (Frankel Grade E) was observed in 43% of the patients and functional recovery (Frankel Grades D or E) was observed in 87%. One postoperative death occurred from a pulmonary embolus (surgical mortality 3%). Preoperative neurological status correlated with outcome; 83% of Frankel Grade D patients recovered completely compared to 25% of Frankel Grade A patients. The rapidity of surgical intervention also correlated with outcome; greater neurological recovery occurred as the interval from symptom onset to surgery decreased. Patients taken to surgery within 12 hours had better neurological outcomes than patients with identical preoperative Frankel grades whose surgery was delayed beyond 12 hours.

Velocity, cadence, step length, stride length, and ratio of stride length to lower extremity length were recorded for 37 subjects with hemiparesis and 24 subjects with multiple sclerosis. Temporal-distance values were well below normal values, even in functionally independent subjects. Overall, the subjects with hemiparesis had lower values than the subjects with multiple sclerosis. Of the nine characteristics examined, only diagnosis, etiologic factor (for hemiparesis), type of ambulation aid, and functional category were related significantly to TD values. Our findings suggest that TD gait performance goals for patients with neurological impairment should be based on values from impaired rather than healthy subjects and that these goals should be adjusted for the individual patient's diagnosis, etiologic factor, type of ambulation aid, and functional category.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2292073634", "source": "openalex"}

Infectious prion particles are composed largely, if not entirely, of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein, which is encoded by a chromosomal gene. A posttranslational process, as yet unidentified, converts the cellular prion protein into an abnormal isoform. Scrapie incubation times, neuropathology, and prion synthesis in transgenic mice are controlled by the prion protein gene. Point mutations in the prion protein genes of animals and humans are genetically linked to development of neuro-degeneration. Transgenic mice expressing mutant prion proteins spontaneously develop neurologic dysfunction and spongiform neuropathology.

These surface antigens include leukocyte common antigen, immunoglobulin Fc receptors, MHC class I and class II glycoproteins, β2‐integrins, and the vitronectin receptor. Ligands for these receptors are also found. They include immunoglobulins, complement proteins of the classical pathway, T lymphocytes of the cytotoxic/suppressor and helper/inducer classes, and vitronectin. T lymphocytes marginate along capillary venules, with some penetrating into the tissue matrix. Immunoglobulins and complement proteins are synthesized locally in brain, although they may also come from the bloodstream if the blood‐brain barrier is compromised. The membrane attack complex, which is formed from C5b‐9, the terminal components of complement, has been identified in AD and multiple sclerosis brain tissue. In addition, proteins designed to defend against bystander lysis caused by the membrane attack complex, including protectin, C8 binding protein, clusterin, and vitronectin, are associated with damaged neuronal processes in AD.

However, the full spectrum of neurological syndromes associated with GAD-ab is not well established. In addition, these patients usually present type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) that could justify the presence of high GAD-ab levels. To clarify these issues, we reviewed the clinical and immunological features of patients in whom high GAD-ab levels were detected in a reference centre for DM1 and for the detection of antineuronal antibodies in suspected paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). High GAD-ab levels were defined as values > or =2000 U/ml by radioimmunoassay. Intrathecal synthesis (IS) of GAD-ab was calculated in paired serum/CSF samples. Values higher than the IgG index were considered indicators for positive GAD-ab-specific IS. High GAD-ab levels were identified in 61 patients, 22 (36%) had SPS, 17 (28%) cerebellar ataxia, 11 (18%) other neurological disorders (epilepsy -- four, PNS -- four; idiopathic limbic encephalitis -- two; myasthenia gravis -- one), and 11 (18%) isolated DM1. Patients with SPS and cerebellar ataxia had the same frequency of female gender (86% vs 94%), DM1 (59% vs 53%), CSF oligoclonal bands (35% vs 69%). Three of the four PNS patients, with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, a predominant gait cerebellar ataxia, and limbic encephalitis, had neuroendocrine carcinomas. GAD expression was confirmed in the two tumours in which the study was done. The fourth patient presented with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration antedating a lung adenocarcinoma. The frequency of increased IS of GAD-ab was 85% in SPS, 100% in cerebellar ataxia, and 86% in other neurological disorders. In conclusion, our study emphasizes that high GAD-ab levels associate with other neurological disorders besides SPS. Cerebellar ataxia, the second most common syndrome associated with high GAD-ab levels, shares with SPS the same demographic, clinical and immunological features. The demonstration of an increased IS of GAD-ab is important to confirm that the GAD autoimmunity is related to the neurological syndrome particularly when there is a concomitant DM1 that could justify the presence of high GAD-ab levels. Lastly, in patients who develop neurological syndromes that suggest a PNS, the finding of GAD-ab does not rule out this possibility and appropriate studies should be done to confirm an underlying cancer.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078990452", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment can be lengthy, expensive, and often difficult for families and caregivers. Physical examination is potentially useful in this clinical scenario, and the information obtained may help physicians and families make accurate decisions about treatment and/or withdrawal of care.To determine the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting poor outcome in post-cardiac arrest coma.We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles (1966-2003) using the terms coma, cardiac arrest, prognosis, physical examination, sensitivity and specificity, and observer variation. Other sources came from bibliographies of retrieved articles and physical examination textbooks. Studies were included if they assessed the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in prognosis of post-cardiac arrest coma in adults. Eleven studies, involving 1914 patients, met our inclusion criteria.Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Summary likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated from random effects models. Five clinical signs were found to strongly predict death or poor neurological outcome: absent corneal reflexes at 24 hours (LR, 12.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-68.7), absent pupillary response at 24 hours (LR, 10.2; 95% CI, 1.8-48.6), absent withdrawal response to pain at 24 hours (LR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.2-9.8), no motor response at 24 hours (LR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.6-13.0), and no motor response at 72 hours (LR, 9.2; 95% CI, 2.1-49.4). The proportion of individuals' dying or having a poor neurological outcome was calculated by pooling the outcome data from the 11 studies (n = 1914) and used as an estimate of the pretest probability of poor outcome. The random effects estimate of poor outcome was 77% (95% CI, 72%-80%). The highest LR increases the pretest probability of 77% to a posttest probability of 97% (95% CI, 87%-100%). No clinical findings were found to have LRs that strongly predicted good neurological outcome.Simple physical examination maneuvers strongly predict death or poor outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The most useful signs occur at 24 hours after cardiac arrest, and earlier prognosis should not be made by clinical examination alone.

Only carefully designed prospective studies can provide information regarding prevalence, incidence, and natural history of the full spectrum of neurologic complications of HIV infection. A degree of tropism for monocyte/macrophages and possibly for cells within the CNS seems certain. One of the most frequent complications is AIDS-related dementia, which reflects central nervous system invasion by HIV. Despite the evidence linking unchecked viral replication within the brain and progressive dementia, the basic pathogenetic mechanisms remain obscure. Further characterization of the cellular targets of HIV within the brain, and the mechanisms which ultimately lead to the dementia, is critical. The demonstration that HIV enters the central nervous system during the earliest stages of infection has major implications for antiviral agents which must penetrate brain parenchyma to clear the virus effectively. Other neurologic complications occur frequently, including myelopathies, peripheral neuropathies, opportunistic CNS infections, and CNS neoplasms. Many of these disorders are novel and incompletely characterized and their etiology is uncertain. While treatment is available for several of these conditions, it is generally not curative, and is often poorly tolerated because of adverse effects. Research directions will focus on better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, on earlier and more precise detection of these diverse conditions, and on improved therapeutic agents. For the future, efforts toward the development of a safe, effective vaccine are of critical importance. There are, however, already up to 2 million individuals in the United States who are already infected with HIV and who are thus at risk for developing 1 or several of these neurologic complications. Vaccination, even if it were available now, is not likely to benefit these individuals. While it is hoped that only a fraction of this infected population will develop neurologic symptoms, the prospects of an epidemic of AIDS-related dementia are ominous, particularly as antiviral therapy alone is unlikely to either eradicate the virus or restore brain function. In Africa and worldwide the numbers at risk for HIV-related diseases are enormous, and the risk factors for transmission of HIV less well defined.

PNS are rare, affecting less than 1/10,000 patients with cancer. Only the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is relatively frequent, occurring in about 1% of patients with small cell lung cancer. PNS can affect any part of the central and peripheral nervous system, the neuromuscular junction, and muscle. They can be isolated or occur in association. In most patients, the neurological disorder develops before the cancer becomes clinically overt and the patient is referred to the neurologist who has the charge of identifying a neurological disorder as paraneoplastic. PNS are usually severely disabling. The most common PNS are Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), subacute cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis (LE), opsoclonus-myoclonus (OM), retinopathies (cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) and melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR), Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS), chronic gastrointestinal pseudoobstruction (CGP), sensory neuronopathy (SSN), encephalomyelitis (EM) and dermatomyositis. PNS are caused by autoimmune processes triggered by the cancer and directed against antigens common to both the cancer and the nervous system, designated as onconeural antigens. Due to their high specificity (> 90%), the best way to diagnose a neurological disorder as paraneoplastic is to identify one of the well-characterized anti-onconeural protein antibodies in the patient's serum. In addition, as these antibodies are associated with a restricted range of cancers, they can guide the search for the underlying tumor at a stage when it is frequently not clinically overt. This is a critical point as, to date, the best way to stabilize PNS is to treat the cancer as soon as possible. Unfortunately, about one-third of patients do not have detectable antibodies and 5% to 10% have an atypical antibody that is not well-characterized.

Literature searches of the Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE databases included January 1, 1992, through April 2020 identified pertinent articles for review. Because of the lack of high-quality data from randomized clinical trials or large observational studies, recommendations were formulated based on consensus of contributors and medical societies that represented relevant disciplines, including critical care, neurology, and neurosurgery. <h3>Evidence Synthesis</h3> Based on review of the literature and consensus from a large multidisciplinary, international panel, minimum clinical criteria needed to determine BD/DNC in various circumstances were developed. <h3>Recommendations</h3> Prior to evaluating a patient for BD/DNC, the patient should have an established neurologic diagnosis that can lead to the complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, and conditions that may confound the clinical examination and diseases that may mimic BD/DNC should be excluded. Determination of BD/DNC can be done with a clinical examination that demonstrates coma, brainstem areflexia, and apnea.

Here we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 154,068 individuals with COVID-19, 5,638,795 contemporary controls and 5,859,621 historical controls; we use inverse probability weighting to balance the cohorts, and estimate risks and burdens of incident neurologic disorders at 12 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that in the postacute phase of COVID-19, there was increased risk of an array of incident neurologic sequelae including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cognition and memory disorders, peripheral nervous system disorders, episodic disorders (for example, migraine and seizures), extrapyramidal and movement disorders, mental health disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, sensory disorders, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and encephalitis or encephalopathy. We estimated that the hazard ratio of any neurologic sequela was 1.42 (95% confidence intervals 1.38, 1.47) and burden 70.69 (95% confidence intervals 63.54, 78.01) per 1,000 persons at 12 months. The risks and burdens were elevated even in people who did not require hospitalization during acute COVID-19. Limitations include a cohort comprising mostly White males.

It appears that no such estimates have been reported at the state level for the US. <h3>Objective</h3> To present burden estimates of major neurological disorders in the US states by age and sex from 1990 to 2017. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This is a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of major neurological disorders were derived from the GBD 2017 study of the 48 contiguous US states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Fourteen major neurological disorders were analyzed: stroke, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injuries, brain and other nervous system cancers, meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus. <h3>Exposures</h3> Any of the 14 listed neurological diseases. <h3>Main Outcome and Measure</h3> Absolute numbers in detail by age and sex and age-standardized rates (with 95% uncertainty intervals) were calculated. <h3>Results</h3> The 3 most burdensome neurological disorders in the US in terms of absolute number of DALYs were stroke (3.58 [95% uncertainty interval [UI], 3.25-3.92] million DALYs), Alzheimer disease and other dementias (2.55 [95% UI, 2.43-2.68] million DALYs), and migraine (2.40 [95% UI, 1.53-3.44] million DALYs). The burden of almost all neurological disorders (in terms of absolute number of incident, prevalent, and fatal cases, as well as DALYs) increased from 1990 to 2017, largely because of the aging of the population. Exceptions for this trend included traumatic brain injury incidence (−29.1% [95% UI, −32.4% to −25.8%]); spinal cord injury prevalence (−38.5% [95% UI, −43.1% to −34.0%]); meningitis prevalence (−44.8% [95% UI, −47.3% to −42.3%]), deaths (−64.4% [95% UI, −67.7% to −50.3%]), and DALYs (−66.9% [95% UI, −70.1% to −55.9%]); and encephalitis DALYs (−25.8% [95% UI, −30.7% to −5.8%]). The different metrics of age-standardized rates varied between the US states from a 1.2-fold difference for tension-type headache to 7.5-fold for tetanus; southeastern states and Arkansas had a relatively higher burden for stroke, while northern states had a relatively higher burden of multiple sclerosis and eastern states had higher rates of Parkinson disease, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine and tension-type headache, and meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> There is a large and increasing burden of noncommunicable neurological disorders in the US, with up to a 5-fold variation in the burden of and trends in particular neurological disorders across the US states. The information reported in this article can be used by health care professionals and policy makers at the national and state levels to advance their health care planning and resource allocation to prevent and reduce the burden of neurological disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3095385778", "source": "openalex"}

This is largely due to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), arguably the most tightly regulated interface in the human body, which routinely excludes most therapeutics. Advances in the engineering of nanomaterials and their application in biomedicine (i.e., nanomedicine) are enabling new strategies that have the potential to help improve our understanding and treatment of neurological diseases. Herein, the various mechanisms by which therapeutics can be delivered to the brain are examined and key challenges facing translation of this research from benchtop to bedside are highlighted. Following a contextual overview of the BBB anatomy and physiology in both healthy and diseased states, relevant therapeutic strategies for bypassing and crossing the BBB are discussed. The focus here is especially on nanomaterial‐based drug delivery systems and the potential of these to overcome the biological challenges imposed by the BBB. Finally, disease‐targeting strategies and clearance mechanisms are explored.

New insight is provided on the pathobiology of traumatically induced cell body injury and diffuse axonal damage. The consequences of axonal damage in terms of subsequent deafferentation and any potential retrograde cell death and atrophy are addressed. The regional and global metabolic sequelae are also considered. This detailed presentation of the neuropathological consequences of traumatic brain injury is used to set the stage for better appreciating the neurological recovery occurring after traumatic injury. Although the pathological and clinical effects of focal and diffuse damage are usually intermingled, the different clinical manifestations of recovery patterns associated with focal versus diffuse injuries are presented. The recognizable patterns of recovery, involving unconsciousness, posttraumatic confusion/amnesia, and postconfusional restoration, that typically occur across the full spectrum of diffuse injury are described, recognizing that the patient's long-term recovery may involve more idiosyncratic combinations of dysfunction. The review highlights the relationship of focal lesions to localizing syndromes that may be embedded in the evolving natural history of diffuse pathology. It is noted that injuries with primarily focal pathology do not necessarily follow a comparable pattern of recovery with distinct phases. Potential linkages of these recovery patterns to the known neuropathological sequelae of injury and various reparative mechanisms are considered and it is proposed that potential biological markers and newer imaging technologies will better define these linkages.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009105636", "source": "openalex"}

Limited data exist regarding the frequency of such complications occurring in the first days after the ictus and the relationship of these complications to outcome. Our objective was to identify the types, severity, and frequency of medical and neurological complications following acute ischemic stroke and to determine their role in mortality and functional outcome. Methods —Rates of serious (life-threatening) and nonserious medical and neurological complications and mortality were derived from the placebo limb of the Randomized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Acute Stroke (RANTTAS) database (n=279). Complications were correlated with clinical outcome using logistic regression techniques. Results —Of all patients, 95% had at least one complication. The most common serious medical complication was pneumonia (5%), and the most common serious neurological complication was new cerebral infarction or extension of the admission infarction (5%). The 3-month mortality was 14%; 51% of these deaths were attributed primarily to medical complications. Outcome was significantly worse in patients with serious medical complications, after adjustment for baseline imbalances, as measured by the Barthel Index (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 15.1) and by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 30.9). After death was discounted, serious medical complications were associated with severe disability at 3 months as determined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 14.8).

Unpacking how this burden varies regionally and nationally is important to inform public health policy and prevention strategies. The population in the EU is older than that of the WHO European region (western, central, and eastern Europe) and even older than the global population, suggesting that it might be particularly vulnerable to an increasing burden of age-related neurological disorders. We aimed to compare the burden of neurological disorders in the EU between 1990 and 2017 with those of the WHO European region and worldwide.The burden of neurological disorders was calculated for the year 2017 as incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost, and years lived with disability for the countries in the EU and the WHO European region, totally and, separately. Diseases analysed were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, epilepsy, headache (migraine and tension-type headache), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain cancer, motor neuron diseases, neuroinfectious diseases, and stroke. Data are presented as totals and by sex, age, year, location and socio-demographic context, and shown as counts and rates.In 2017, the total number of DALYs attributable to neurological disorders was 21·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 18·5-23·9) in the EU and 41·1 million (36·7-45·9) in the WHO European region, and the total number of deaths was 1·1 million (1·09-1·14) in the EU and 1·97 million (1·95-2·01) in the WHO European region. In the EU, neurological disorders ranked third after cardiovascular diseases and cancers representing 13·3% (10·3-17·1) of total DALYs and 19·5% (18·0-21·3) of total deaths. Stroke, dementias, and headache were the three commonest causes of DALYs in the EU. Stroke was also the leading cause of DALYs in the WHO European region. During the study period we found a substantial increase in the all-age burden of neurodegenerative diseases, despite a substantial decrease in the rates of stroke and infections. The burden of neurological disorders in Europe was higher in men than in women, peaked in individuals aged 80-84 years, and varied substantially with WHO European region and country. All-age DALYs, deaths, and prevalence of neurological disorders increased in all-age measures, but decreased when using age-standardised measures in all but three countries (Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). The decrease was mostly attributed to the reduction of premature mortality despite an overall increase in the number of DALYs.Neurological disorders are the third most common cause of disability and premature death in the EU and their prevalence and burden will likely increase with the progressive ageing of the European population. Greater attention to neurological diseases must be paid by health authorities for prevention and care. The data presented here suggest different priorities for health service development and resource allocation in different countries.European Academy of Neurology.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3091396307", "source": "openalex"}

In addition to being associated with a non-specific acute febrile illness, a number of neurological manifestations, mainly microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been associated with infection. These with other rarer neurological conditions suggest that Zika virus, similar to other flaviviruses, is neuropathogenic. The surge of Zika virus-related microcephaly cases in Brazil has received much attention and the role of the virus in this and in other neurological manifestations is growing. Zika virus has been shown to be transmitted perinatally and the virus can be detected in amniotic fluid, placenta and foetus brain tissue. A significant increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome incidence has also been reported during this, as well as in previous outbreaks. More recently, meningoencephalitis and myelitis have also been reported following Zika virus infection. In summary, while preliminary studies have suggested a clear relationship between Zika virus infection and certain neurological conditions, only longitudinal studies in this epidemic, as well as experimental studies either in animal models or in vitro, will help to better understand the role of the virus and the pathogenesis of these disorders.

The impetus for using various diets to treat – or at least ameliorate symptoms of – these disorders stems from both a lack of effectiveness of pharmacological therapies, and also the intrinsic appeal of implementing a more \"natural\" treatment. The enormous spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the aforementioned diseases would suggest a degree of complexity that cannot be impacted universally by any single dietary treatment. Yet, it is conceivable that alterations in certain dietary constituents could affect the course and impact the outcome of these brain disorders. Further, it is possible that a final common neurometabolic pathway might be influenced by a variety of dietary interventions. The most notable example of a dietary treatment with proven efficacy against a neurological condition is the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) used in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. While the mechanisms through which the KD works remain unclear, there is now compelling evidence that its efficacy is likely related to the normalization of aberrant energy metabolism. The concept that many neurological conditions are linked pathophysiologically to energy dysregulation could well provide a common research and experimental therapeutics platform, from which the course of several neurological diseases could be favorably influenced by dietary means.

Methods We examined neurologic manifestations in 509 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed Covid‐19 within a hospital network in Chicago, Illinois. We compared the severity of Covid‐19 and outcomes in patients with and without neurologic manifestations. We also identified independent predictors of any neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy, and functional outcome using binary logistic regression. Results Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 (42.2%), at hospitalization in 319 (62.7%), and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%).

However, the frequency of these syndromal 'dominant optic atrophy plus' variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.44–6.49; P = 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.08–4.82; P = 0.0271). Histochemical and molecular characterization of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed the presence of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the majority of patients harbouring OPA1 mutations, even in those with isolated optic nerve involvement. However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology. Individuals with dominant optic atrophy plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes, and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant visual impairment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138704587", "source": "openalex"}

DL differs from conventional machine learning methods by virtue of its ability to learn the optimal representation from the raw data through consecutive nonlinear transformations, achieving increasingly higher levels of abstraction and complexity. Given its ability to detect abstract and complex patterns, DL has been applied in neuroimaging studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders, which are characterised by subtle and diffuse alterations. Here we introduce the underlying concepts of DL and review studies that have used this approach to classify brain-based disorders. The results of these studies indicate that DL could be a powerful tool in the current search for biomarkers of psychiatric and neurologic disease. We conclude our review by discussing the main promises and challenges of using DL to elucidate brain-based disorders, as well as possible directions for future research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2569531558", "source": "openalex"}

A substantial body of evidence has implicated excitotoxicity as a mechanism of cell death in both acute and chronic neurologic diseases. A major recent advance has been the successful cloning and expression of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The cellular mechanisms responsible for cell death after activation of these receptors are still being clarified. In acute neurologic diseases such as stroke and head trauma, excitotoxicity may be related to excessive glutamate release. In chronic neurodegenerative diseases, however, a slow excitotoxic process is more likely to occur as a consequence of either a receptor abnormality or an impairment of energy metabolism.

The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhancement layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzzification outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k -means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership functions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefficients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some popular benchmarks for regression and classification, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neuro-fuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2887576641", "source": "openalex"}

CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis.

Cell replacement therapy and gene transfer to the diseased or injured brain have provided the basis for the development of potentially powerful new therapeutic strategies for a broad spectrum of human neurological diseases. However, the paucity of suitable cell types for cell replacement therapy in patients suffering from neurological disorders has hampered the development of this promising therapeutic approach. In recent years, neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells, and extensive efforts by investigators to develop stem cell‐based brain transplantation therapies have been carried out. We review here notable experimental and preclinical studies previously published involving stem cell‐based cell and gene therapies for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, MS, stroke, spinal cord injury, brain tumor, and lysosomal storage diseases and discuss the future prospects for stem cell therapy of neurological disorders in the clinical setting. There are still many obstacles to be overcome before clinical application of cell therapy in neurological disease patients is adopted: 1) it is still uncertain what kind of stem cells would be an ideal source for cellular grafts, and 2) the mechanism by which transplantation of stem cells leads to an enhanced functional recovery and structural reorganization must to be better understood. Steady and solid progress in stem cell research in both basic and preclinical settings should support the hope for development of stem cell‐based cell therapies for neurological diseases. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2073523882", "source": "openalex"}

The levels of [Cl − ] i are also highly labile, being readily altered transiently or persistently by enhanced episodes of activity in relation to synaptic plasticity or a variety of pathological conditions, including seizures and brain insults. Among the plethora of channels, transporters, and other devices involved in controlling [Cl − ] i , two have emerged as playing a particularly important role: the chloride importer NKCC1 and the chloride exporter KCC2. Here, the authors stress the importance of determining how [Cl − ] i is dynamically regulated and how this affects brain operation in health and disease. In a clinical perspective, agents that control [Cl − ] i and reinstate inhibitory actions of GABA open novel therapeutic perspectives in many neurological disorders, including infantile epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, and other developmental disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134218486", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, a renewed emphasis has been placed on managing severe head injury by elevating cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is defined as the mean arterial pressure minus the intracranial pressure (ICP). Some authors have suggested that CPP is more important in influencing outcome than is intracranial hypertension, a hypothesis that this study was designed to investigate. Methods. The authors examined the relative contribution of these two parameters to outcome in a series of 427 patients prospectively studied in an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of the N-methyl- d -aspartate antagonist Selfotel. Mortality rates rose from 9.6% in 292 patients who had no clinically defined episodes of neurological deterioration to 56.4% in 117 patients who suffered one or more of these episodes; 18 patients were lost to follow up. Correspondingly, favorable outcome, defined as good or moderate on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months, fell from 67.8% in patients without neurological deterioration to 29.1% in those with neurological deterioration. In patients who had clinical evidence of neurological deterioration, the relative influence of ICP and CPP on outcome was assessed. The most powerful predictor of neurological worsening was the presence of intracranial hypertension (ICP ≥ 20 mm Hg) either initially or during neurological deterioration. There was no correlation with the CPP as long as the CPP was greater than 60 mm Hg. Conclusions. Treatment protocols for the management of severe head injury should emphasize the immediate reduction of raised ICP to less than 20 mm Hg if possible. A CPP greater than 60 mm Hg appears to have little influence on the outcome of patients with severe head injury.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124888829", "source": "openalex"}

Neural cells suffer functional or sensory loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from several other environmental or genetic factors, oxidative stress (OS) leading to free radical attack on neural cells contributes calamitous role to neuro-degeneration. Though, oxygen is imperative for life, imbalanced metabolism and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation end into a range of disorders such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, aging and many other neural disorders.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently the most effective gut microbiota intervention and an accepted treatment for recurrent Clostridioioides difficile infections. To evaluate indications of FMT for patients with neurological disorders, we summarized the available literature on FMT. In addition, we provide suggestions for future directions. Methods In July 2019, five main databases were searched for studies and case descriptions on FMT in neurological disorders in humans or animal models. In addition, the ClinicalTrials.gov website was consulted for registered planned and ongoing trials. Results Of 541 identified studies, 34 were included in the analysis. Clinical trials with FMT have been performed in patients with autism spectrum disorder and showed beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. For multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, several animal studies suggested a positive effect of FMT, supported by some case reports in humans. For epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy some studies suggested a beneficial effect of FMT, but evidence was restricted to case reports and limited numbers of animal studies. For stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Guillain-Barré syndrome only studies with animal models were identified. These studies suggested a potential beneficial effect of healthy donor FMT. In contrast, one study with an animal model for stroke showed an increased mortality after FMT. For Guillain-Barré only one study was identified. Whether the positive findings from animal studies can be confirmed in the treatment of human diseases awaits to be seen. Several trials with FMT as treatment of the above mentioned neurological disorders are planned or ongoing, as well as for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Conclusions Preliminary literature suggests that FMT may be a promising treatment option for several neurological disorders. However, available evidence is still scanty and some contrasting results were observed. Limited studies in humans have been performed or are ongoing, while for some disorders only animal experiments have been conducted.

Pathologic studies implicate inflammatory demyelination as a principal cause of axonal transection and subsequent axonal degeneration. Axonal degeneration caused by chronic demyelination in the absence of active inflammation may also contribute to progressive disability in the later stages of the disease. Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggest that axonal loss begins at the onset of the disease, and studies using magnetic resonance imaging have documented brain atrophy in the earliest stages of multiple sclerosis. Brain atrophy increases during the relapsing-remitting disease stage without concurrent disability progression. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms maintain neurologic function, despite progressive brain tissue loss during the early stages of the disease. Beyond a threshold, however, further axonal loss leads to continuously progressive neurologic disability. We hypothesize that the rate and extent of axonal loss during relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis determines when a patient enters the secondary progressive stage of the disease. This view of disease pathogenesis has several important implications. First, surrogate markers of axonal loss are needed to monitor the disease process for patient care and for clinical trials. We propose brain parenchymal fraction, a precise measure of whole-brain atrophy, as an attractive candidate for this purpose. Second, disease-modifying therapy should be used early in multiple sclerosis patients, before extensive axonal loss has occurred. Third, neuroprotective drugs should be tested in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs in multiple sclerosis patients. Finally, studies of the time course of axonal loss, and its mechanisms are critical for effective therapeutic intervention.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2325735106", "source": "openalex"}

Methods— Patients (n=413) were randomized to placebo or clazosentan beginning within 56 hours and continued up to 14 days after initiation of treatment. The primary end point was moderate or severe angiographic vasospasm based on centrally read, blinded evaluation of digital subtraction angiography at baseline and 7 to 11 days postsubarachnoid hemorrhage. A morbidity/mortality end point, including all-cause mortality, new cerebral infarct from any cause, delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm, or use of rescue therapy, was evaluated by local assessment. Clinical outcome was assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 12 weeks. Results— Moderate or severe vasospasm was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion from 66% in the placebo group to 23% in the 15 mg/h clazosentan group (risk reduction, 65%; 95% CI, 47% to 78%; P &lt;0.0001). No significant effects were seen on secondary end points. Post hoc analysis using a centrally assessed morbidity/mortality end point that included death and rescue therapy but only cerebral infarcts and delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm on central review showed a trend toward improvement with clazosentan (37%, 28%, and 29% in the 1, 5, and 15 mg/h groups versus 39% in the placebo group, nonsignificant). Clazosentan was associated with increased rates of pulmonary complications, hypotension, and anemia. Conclusions— Clazosentan significantly decreased moderate and severe vasospasm in a dose-dependent manner and showed a trend for reduction in vasospasm-related morbidity/mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage when centrally assessed. Overall, the adverse effects were manageable and not considered serious.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150982420", "source": "openalex"}

Detection and management of neurosarcoidosis remains problematic. Our interest in immunosuppressive agents for chronic sarcoidosis has given us experience with various agents for the treatment of sarcoidosis, including cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. <h3>Methods:</h3> We analyzed all patients with sarcoidosis seen in our clinic during a 10-year period. Evaluation for neurological disease included routine physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and neural tissue biopsy were performed where clinically indicated. Patients were treated with corticosteroids, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide. <h3>Results:</h3> Neurological disease was identified in 71 of 554 patients with sarcoidosis. Seventh (facial) cranial nerve paralysis was the most common manifestation identified in 39 patients. This included 24 patients with facial nerve palsy as the only manifestation of neurological sarcoidosis in whom complete recovery was seen in all but 1 patient. Forty-eight patients with disease other than facial nerve palsy received corticosteroids or other therapies. Corticosteroids benefited only 14 patients (29%). Methotrexate successfully treated 17 (61%) of 28 patients and cyclophosphamide controlled disease in 9 (90%) of 10 assessable patients. Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide were each associated with a higher response rate than corticosteroids alone (X<sup>2</sup>, 14.6;<i>P</i>&lt;.001). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Neurological symptoms can be significant manifestations of sarcoidosis. Facial nerve paralysis is a common, but usually self-limited form of disease. Other manifestations are usually chronic and agents other than corticosteroids appear to have increased efficacy with lower morbidity.

To understand the impact of preoperative events and to characterize the evaluation of neurological injury, we performed serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain in a cohort of neonates undergoing open-heart surgery.Twenty-four term neonates with CHD were studied prospectively with brain MRI: before surgery, within 2 weeks of surgery, and several months after surgery. Preoperative MRI examinations showed periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in 4 patients (16%) and infarct in 2 subjects (8%). MR spectroscopy was performed in 19 subjects preoperatively and revealed elevated brain lactate in 53%. An early postoperative MRI (n=21) identified new PVL in 48%, new infarct in 19%, and new parenchymal hemorrhage in 33%. New lesions or worsening of preoperative lesions occurred in 67% of subjects. No patient- or procedure-related factors for the development of early postoperative lesions were identified. A late postoperative MRI (n=17) demonstrated resolution of early lesions in 8 and mild cerebral atrophy in 2.Mild ischemic lesions, primarily in the form of PVL, occur in a number of neonates with CHD before surgery and >50% of patients postoperatively. Resolution of these lesions is common 4 to 6 months after surgery. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine the significance of perioperative ischemic lesions on functional outcome.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1902838673", "source": "openalex"}

In certain instances, over-stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors has been implicated Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is an endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist synthesized from L-tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway and thereby has the potential of mediating N-methyl-D-aspartate neuronal damage and dysfunction. Conversely, the related metabolite, kynurenic acid, is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and could modulate the neurotoxic effects of QUIN as well as disrupt excitatory amino acid neurotransmission In the present study, markedly increased concentrations of QUIN were found in both lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain tissue of patients with inflammatory diseases (bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections, meningitis, autoimmune diseases and septicaemia) independent of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The concentrations of kynurenic acid were also increased, but generally to a lesser degree than the increases in QUIN. In contrast, no increases in CSF QUIN were found in chronic neurodegenerative disorders, depression or myoclonic seizure disorders, while CSF kynurenic acid concentrations were significantly lower in Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In inflammatory disease patients, proportional increases in CSF L-kynurenine and reduced L-tryptophan accompanied the increases in CSF QUIN and kynurenic acid. These responses are consistent with induction of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, the first enzyme of the kynurenine pathway which converts L-tryptophan to kynurenic acid and QUIN Indeed, increases in both indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity and QUIN concentrations were observed in the cerebral cortex of macaques infected with retrovirus, particularly those with local inflammatory lesions. Correlations between CSF QUIN, kynurenic acid and L-kynurenine with markers of immune stimulation (neopterin, white blood cell counts and lgG levels) indicate a relationship between accelerated kynurenine pathway metabolism and the degree of intracerebral immune stimulation. We conclude that inflammatory diseases are associated with accumulation of QUIN, kynurenic acid and L-kynurenine within the central nervous system, but that the available data do not support a role for QUIN in the aetiology of Huntington's disease or Alzheimer's disease In conjunction with our previous reports that CSF QUIN concentrations are correlated to objective measures of neuropsychological deficits in HIV-1-infected patients, we hypothesize that QUIN and kynurenic acid are mediators of neuronal dysfunction and nerve cell death in inflammatory diseases. Therefore, strategies to attenuate the neurological effects of kynurenine pathway metabolites or attenuate the rate of their synthesis offer new approaches to therapy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010145371", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3171124897", "title": "Molecular mechanisms of cell death in neurological diseases", "text": "Tightly orchestrated programmed cell death (PCD) signalling events occur during normal neuronal development in a spatially and temporally restricted manner to establish the neural architecture and shaping the CNS. Abnormalities in PCD signalling cascades, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cell death associated with autophagy as well as in unprogrammed necrosis can be observed in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. These cell deaths can be activated in response to various forms of cellular stress (exerted by intracellular or extracellular stimuli) and inflammatory processes. Aberrant activation of PCD pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Conversely, inactivation of PCD is thought to contribute to the development of brain cancers and to impact their response to therapy. For many neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers current treatment strategies have only modest effect, engendering the need for investigations into the origins of these diseases. With many diseases of the brain displaying aberrations in PCD pathways, it appears that agents that can either inhibit or induce PCD may be critical components of future therapeutic strategies. The development of such therapies will have to be guided by preclinical studies in animal models that faithfully mimic the human disease. In this review, we briefly describe PCD and unprogrammed cell death processes and the roles they play in contributing to neurodegenerative diseases or tumorigenesis in the brain. We also discuss the interplay between distinct cell death signalling cascades and disease pathogenesis and describe pharmacological agents targeting key players in the cell death signalling pathways that have progressed through to clinical trials.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3171124897", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence to support diagnostic decisions on coma and other DoC is limited but accumulating. This guideline provides the state-of-the-art evidence regarding the diagnosis of DoC, summarizing data from bedside examination techniques, functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Sixteen members of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Scientific Panel on Coma and Chronic Disorders of Consciousness, representing 10 European countries, reviewed the scientific evidence for the evaluation of coma and other DoC using standard bibliographic measures. Recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The guideline was endorsed by the EAN. Results: Besides a comprehensive neurological examination, the following suggestions are made: probe for voluntary eye movements using a mirror; repeat clinical assessments in the subacute and chronic setting, using the Coma Recovery Scale – Revised; use the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness score instead of the Glasgow Coma Scale in the acute setting; obtain clinical standard EEG; search for sleep patterns on EEG, particularly rapid eye movement sleep and slow-wave sleep; and, whenever feasible, consider positron emission tomography, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), active fMRI or EEG paradigms and quantitative analysis of high-density EEG to complement behavioral assessment in patients without command following at the bedside. Conclusions: Standardized clinical evaluation, EEG-based techniques and functional neuroimaging should be integrated for multimodal evaluation of patients with DoC.

The study was performed by the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID) from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Neuro-COVID Registry (ENERGY) from March to October 2020. Three cohorts were included: (1) the GCS-NeuroCOVID all COVID-19 cohort (n = 3055), which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without neurological manifestations; (2) the GCS-NeuroCOVID COVID-19 neurological cohort (n = 475), which comprised consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had confirmed neurological manifestations; and (3) the ENERGY cohort (n = 214), which included patients with COVID-19 who received formal neurological consultation. <h3>Exposures</h3> Clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Neurological phenotypes were classified as self-reported symptoms or neurological signs and/or syndromes assessed by clinical evaluation. Composite incidence was reported for groups with at least 1 neurological manifestation. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 3055 patients in the all COVID-19 cohort, 1742 (57%) were men, and the mean age was 59.9 years (95% CI, 59.3-60.6 years). Of the 475 patients in the COVID-19 neurological cohort, 262 (55%) were men, and the mean age was 62.6 years (95% CI, 61.1-64.1 years). Of the 214 patients in the ENERGY cohort, 133 (62%) were men, and the mean age was 67 years (95% CI, 52-78 years). A total of 3083 of 3743 patients (82%) across cohorts had any neurological manifestation (self-reported neurological symptoms and/or clinically captured neurological sign and/or syndrome). The most common self-reported symptoms included headache (1385 of 3732 patients [37%]) and anosmia or ageusia (977 of 3700 patients [26%]). The most prevalent neurological signs and/or syndromes were acute encephalopathy (1845 of 3740 patients [49%]), coma (649 of 3737 patients [17%]), and stroke (222 of 3737 patients [6%]), while meningitis and/or encephalitis were rare (19 of 3741 patients [0.5%]). Presence of clinically captured neurologic signs and/or syndromes was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.99; 95% CI, 4.33-8.28) after adjusting for study site, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Presence of preexisting neurological disorders (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.80-2.75) was associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes with COVID-19. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this multicohort study, neurological manifestations were prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and were associated with higher in-hospital mortality.

In this systematic review we find favorable evidence for the use of NAC in several psychiatric and neurological disorders, particularly autism, Alzheimer's disease, cocaine and cannabis addiction, bipolar disorder, depression, trichotillomania, nail biting, skin picking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, drug-induced neuropathy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Disorders such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mild traumatic brain injury have preliminary evidence and require larger confirmatory studies while current evidence does not support the use of NAC in gambling, methamphetamine and nicotine addictions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Overall, NAC treatment appears to be safe and tolerable. Further well designed, larger controlled trials are needed for specific psychiatric and neurological disorders where the evidence is favorable.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W240506283", "source": "openalex"}

We conducted this study to test whether more advanced imaging selection, recently developed devices, and earlier intervention improve outcomes.We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who were receiving 0.9 mg of alteplase per kilogram of body weight less than 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke either to undergo endovascular thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR (Flow Restoration) stent retriever or to continue receiving alteplase alone. All the patients had occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery and evidence of salvageable brain tissue and ischemic core of less than 70 ml on computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging. The coprimary outcomes were reperfusion at 24 hours and early neurologic improvement (≥8-point reduction on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or a score of 0 or 1 at day 3). Secondary outcomes included the functional score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days.The trial was stopped early because of efficacy after 70 patients had undergone randomization (35 patients in each group). The percentage of ischemic territory that had undergone reperfusion at 24 hours was greater in the endovascular-therapy group than in the alteplase-only group (median, 100% vs. 37%; P<0.001). Endovascular therapy, initiated at a median of 210 minutes after the onset of stroke, increased early neurologic improvement at 3 days (80% vs. 37%, P=0.002) and improved the functional outcome at 90 days, with more patients achieving functional independence (score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin scale, 71% vs. 40%; P=0.01). There were no significant differences in rates of death or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.In patients with ischemic stroke with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT perfusion imaging, early thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR stent retriever, as compared with alteplase alone, improved reperfusion, early neurologic recovery, and functional outcome.

Here, a systems biology approach with the combination of computational analysis and animal experiment is used to investigate this complex issue, ZHENG, in the context of the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) system. By using the methods of literature mining, network analysis and topological comparison, it is found that hormones are predominant in the Cold ZHENG network, immune factors are predominant in the Hot ZHENG network, and these two networks are connected by neuro-transmitters. In addition, genes related to Hot ZHENG-related diseases are mainly present in the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway, whereas genes related to both the Cold-related and Hot-related diseases are linked to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. These computational findings were subsequently verified by experiments on a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis, which indicate that the Cold ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Cold ZHENG network, and the Hot ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Hot ZHENG network. These investigations demonstrate that the thousand-year-old concept of ZHENG may have a molecular basis with NEI as background.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030958001", "source": "openalex"}

Seven of the 12 sites also enrolled persons in a reference sample. Reference sample participants had no evidence of underlying eye disease but were scheduled for either screening eye examinations or correction of refractive error. All eligible persons had to be 21 years or older, English speaking, and cognitively able to give informed consent and participate in a health status interview.To provide the data needed to create the NEI VFQ-25, all subjects completed an interview that included the 51-item NEI VFQ. Estimates of internal consistency indicate that the subscales of the NEI VFQ-25 are reliable. The validity of the NEI VFQ-25 is supported by high correlations between the short- and long-form versions of the measure, observed between-group differences in scores for persons with different eye diseases of varying severity, and the moderate-to-high correlations between the NEI VFQ-25 subscales that have the most to do with central vision and measured visual acuity.The reliability and validity of the NEI VFQ-25 are comparable to those of the 51-item NEI VFQ field test version of the survey. This shorter version will be more feasible in settings such as clinical trials where interview length is a critical consideration. In addition, preliminary analyses indicate that the psychometric properties of the NEI VFQ-25 are robust for the eye conditions studied; this suggests that the measure will provide reproducible and valid data when used across multiple conditions of varying severity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096060458", "source": "openalex"}

Kittens were visually deprived by suturing the lids of the right eye for various periods of time at different ages. Recordings were subsequently made from the striate cortex, and responses from the two eyes compared. As previously reported, monocular eye closure during the first few months of life causes a sharp decline in the number of cells that can be influenced by the previously closed eye.2. Susceptibility to the effects of eye closure begins suddenly near the start of the fourth week, remains high until some time between the sixth and eighth weeks, and then declines, disappearing finally around the end of the third month. Monocular closure for over a year in an adult cat produces no detectable effects.3. During the period of high susceptibility in the fourth and fifth weeks eye closure for as little as 3-4 days leads to a sharp decline in the number of cells that can be driven from both eyes, as well as an over-all decline in the relative influence of the previously closed eye. A 6-day closure is enough to give a reduction in the number of cells that can be driven by the closed eye to a fraction of the normal. The physiological picture is similar to that following a 3-month monocular deprivation from birth, in which the proportion of cells the eye can influence drops from 85 to about 7%.4. Cells of the lateral geniculate receiving input from a deprived eye are noticeably smaller and paler to Nissl stain following 3 or 6 days' deprivation during the fourth week.5. Following 3 months of monocular deprivation, opening the eye for up to 5 yr produces only a very limited recovery in the cortical physiology, and no obvious recovery of the geniculate atrophy, even though behaviourally there is some return of vision in the deprived eye. Closing the normal eye, though necessary for behavioural recovery, has no detectable effect on the cortical physiology. The amount of possible recovery in the striate cortex is probably no greater if the period of eye closure is limited to weeks, but after a 5-week closure there is a definite enhancement of the recovery, even though it is far from complete.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104220712", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.MethodsWe did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047.FindingsOur search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 to −7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD −10·6%, 95% CI −12·5 to −7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.InterpretationThe findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.FundingWorld Health Organization.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3032742287", "source": "openalex"}

If one of these is disturbed, compensatory changes may occur along the other dimensions. Experiments are reported which suggest that people move towards an equilibrium distance, and adopt a particular level of eye-contact. As predicted, there was less eyecontact and glances were shorter, the closer two subjects were placed together (where one member of each pair was a confederate who gazed continuously at the other).

Two experiments were carried out to demonstrate special sensitivity to direct eye contact from birth. The first experiment tested the ability of 2- to 5-day-old newborns to discriminate between direct and averted gaze. In the second experiment, we measured 4-month-old infants' brain electric activity to assess neural processing of faces when accompanied by direct (as opposed to averted) eye gaze. The results show that, from birth, human infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze. The exceptionally early sensitivity to mutual gaze demonstrated in these studies is arguably the major foundation for the later development of social skills.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987594719", "source": "openalex"}

Each of the 7 sites also enrolled persons in a reference sample. Reference sample participants had no evidence of underlying eye disease but were scheduled for either screening eye examinations or correction of refractive error. All eligible persons had to be aged 21 years or older, English speaking, and cognitively able to give informed consent and participate in a health status interview. <h3>Measurements and Main Results</h3> To provide the data needed to assess the reliability and validity of the 51-item NEI-VFQ, all subjects completed an interview that consisted of the 51-item NEI-VFQ, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and at least 1 measure of vision-targeted functional status. Estimates of internal consistency and test-retest reproducibility indicate that the 51-item NEI-VFQ is reliable. Tests of association with other scales and clinical variables support the construct validity of the survey. <h3>Conclusions</h3> In this cross-sectional study, the 51-item NEI-VFQ seems to be reliable and valid and should be a useful tool for group-level comparisons of vision-targeted, health-related quality of life in clinical research. Additionally, the psychometric properties of the NEI-VFQ were not influenced by the type or severity of the underlying eye disease, suggesting that the measure will provide reproducible and valid data when used across multiple eye conditions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2161217162", "source": "openalex"}

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2962736495", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 4631 participants who were tested at the study site, 95% completed Humphrey automated perimetry and 97% had photographic or clinical disc gradings; 93% of those referred completed the ophthalmologic examination. In this adult population, the prevalence of OAG by self-reported race was 7.0% (302/4314) in black, 3.3% (6/184) in mixed-race, and 0.8% (1/133) in white or other participants. In black and mixed-race participants, the prevalence reached 12% at age 60 years and older and was higher in men (8.3%) than in women (5.7%), with an age-adjusted male-female ratio of 1.4. In addition, over 3% of the participants were classified as having suspect OAG.To our knowledge, the Barbados Eye Study is the largest glaucoma study ever conducted in a black population and identified more people with OAG than did any previous population study. The prevalence of OAG was high, especially at older ages and in men. Among participants 50 years old or older, one in 11 had OAG, and prevalence increased to one in six at age 70 years or older. The results highlight the public health importance of OAG in the Afro-Caribbean region and have implications for other populations.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123977931", "source": "openalex"}

This collection of data has allowed an analysis of risk factors, incidence, prevalence, and impact of eye injuries in terms of visual outcome. However, most of the estimates are based on information from More Developed Countries (MDCs). The severity of eye injuries can be assessed through proxy indicators such as: (i) potentially blinding bilateral injuries; (ii) open-globe injuries; (iii) endophthalmitis; (iv) enucleation or (v) defined visual impairment. Major risk factors for ocular injuries include age, gender, socioeconomic status and lifestyle. The site where the injury occurs is also related to a risk situation. Available information indicates a very significant impact of eye injuries in terms of medical care, needs for vocational rehabilitation and great socioeconomic costs. The global pattern of eye injuries and their consequences emerging from the present review, undertaken for planning purposes in the WHO Programme for the Prevention of Blindness, suggests that: – some 55 million eye injuries restricting activities more than one day occur each year; – 750,000 cases will require hospitalization each year, including some 200,000 open-globe injuries; – there are approximately 1.6 million blind from injuries, an additional 2.3 million people with bilateral low vision from this cause, and almost 19 million with unilateral blindness or low vision. Further epidemiological studies are needed to permit more accurate planning of prevention and management measures; a standardized international template for reporting on eye injuries might be useful to this effect, along the lines of the reporting occurring through the US Eye Injury Registry.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084710939", "source": "openalex"}

Results A series of panels, labeled A–E, in order of increasing severity, reproducing the staining patterns encountered in dry eye, are used as a guide to grade the degree of staining seen in the patient. The amount of staining seen in each panel, represented by punctate dots, increases by 0.5 of the log of the number of dots between panels B to E. The use of the vital dyes fluorescein, lissamine green, and rose Bengal is described; fluorescein and lissamine green, used in conjunction with appropriate absorption filters, are recommended for use in clinical trials. The placement of staining in relation to the sequence of other diagnostic tests is discussed.

We tackle this problem by introducing GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2:5M frames. Using GazeCapture, we train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device. Our model achieves a prediction error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets respectively. With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm.

Physiological and anatomical correlates of electrically evoked eye movements", "text": "We studied single neurons in the frontal eye fields of awake macaque monkeys and compared their activity with the saccadic eye movements elicited by microstimulation at the sites of these neurons. Saccades could be elicited from electrical stimulation in the cortical gray matter of the frontal eye fields with currents as small as 10 microA. Low thresholds for eliciting saccades were found at the sites of cells with presaccadic activity. Presaccadic neurons classified as visuomovement or movement were most associated with low (less than 50 microA) thresholds. High thresholds (greater than 100 microA) or no elicited saccades were associated with other classes of frontal eye field neurons, including neurons responding only after saccades and presaccadic neurons, classified as purely visual. Throughout the frontal eye fields, the optimal saccade for eliciting presaccadic neural activity at a given recording site predicted both the direction and amplitude of the saccades that were evoked by microstimulation at that site. In contrast, the movement fields of postsaccadic cells were usually different from the saccades evoked by stimulation at the sites of such cells. We defined the low-threshold frontal eye fields as cortex yielding saccades with stimulation currents less than or equal to 50 microA. It lies along the posterior portion of the arcuate sulcus and is largely contained in the anterior bank of that sulcus. It is smaller than Brodmann's area 8 but corresponds with the union of Walker's cytoarchitectonic areas 8A and 45. Saccade amplitude was topographically organized across the frontal eye fields. Amplitudes of elicited saccades ranged from less than 1 degree to greater than 30 degrees. Smaller saccades were evoked from the ventrolateral portion, and larger saccades were evoked from the dorsomedial portion. Within the arcuate sulcus, evoked saccades were usually larger near the lip and smaller near the fundus. Saccade direction had no global organization across the frontal eye fields; however, saccade direction changed in systematic progressions with small advances of the microelectrode, and all contralateral saccadic directions were often represented in a single electrode penetration down the bank of the arcuate sulcus. Furthermore, the direction of change in these progressions periodically reversed, allowing particular saccade directions to be multiply represented in nearby regions of cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158601670", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3130938027", "title": "The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health: vision beyond 2020", "text": "Eye health and vision have widespread and profound implications for many aspects of life, health, sustainable development, and the economy. Yet nowadays, many people, families, and populations continue to suffer the consequences of poor access to high-quality, affordable eye care, leading to vision impairment and blindness. In 2020, an estimated 596 million people had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. Another 510 million people had uncorrected near vision impairment, simply because of not having reading spectacles. A large proportion of those affected (90%), live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, encouragingly, more than 90% of people with vision impairment have a preventable or treatable cause with existing highly cost-effective interventions. Eye conditions affect all stages of life, with young children and older people being particularly affected. Crucially, women, rural populations, and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have vision impairment, and this pervasive inequality needs to be addressed. By 2050, population ageing, growth, and urbanisation might lead to an estimated 895 million people with distance vision impairment, of whom 61 million will be blind. Action to prioritise eye health is needed now. This Commission defines eye health as maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health and wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life. Eye health is essential to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poor eye health and impaired vision have a negative effect on quality of life and restrict equitable access to and achievement in education and the workplace. Vision loss has substantial financial implications for affected individuals, families, and communities. Although high-quality data for global economic estimates are scarce, particularly for LMICs, conservative assessments based on the latest prevalence figures for 2020 suggest that annual global productivity loss from vision impairment is approximately US$410·7 billion purchasing power parity. Vision impairment reduces mobility, affects mental wellbeing, exacerbates risk of dementia, increases likelihood of falls and road traffic crashes, increases the need for social care, and ultimately leads to higher mortality rates. By contrast, vision facilitates many daily life activities, enables better educational outcomes, and increases work productivity, reducing inequality. An increasing amount of evidence shows the potential for vision to advance the SDGs, by contributing towards poverty reduction, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and decent work. Eye health is a global public priority, transforming lives in both poor and wealthy communities. Therefore, eye health needs to be reframed as a development as well as a health issue and given greater prominence within the global development and health agendas. Vision loss has many causes that require promotional, preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative interventions. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are responsible for most global vision impairment. Research has identified treatments to reduce or eliminate blindness from all these conditions; the priority is to deliver treatments where they are most needed. Proven eye care interventions, such as cataract surgery and spectacle provision, are among the most cost-effective in all of health care. Greater financial investment is needed so that millions of people living with unnecessary vision impairment and blindness can benefit from these interventions. Lessons from the past three decades give hope that this challenge can be met. Between 1990 and 2020, the age-standardised global prevalence of blindness fell by 28·5%. Since the 1990s, prevalence of major infectious causes of blindness—onchocerciasis and trachoma—have declined substantially. Hope remains that by 2030, the transmission of onchocerciasis will be interrupted, and trachoma will be eliminated as a public health problem in every country worldwide. However, the ageing population has led to a higher crude prevalence of age-related causes of blindness, and thus an increased total number of people with blindness in some regions. Key messagesEye health is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; vision needs to be reframed as a development issueThere is extensive evidence showing that improving eye health contributes directly and indirectly to achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, including reducing poverty and improving work productivity, general and mental health, and education and equity. Improving eye health is a practical and cost-effective way of unlocking human potential. Eye health needs to be reframed as an enabling, cross-cutting issue within the sustainable development framework.Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services; urgent action is necessary to meet the rapidly growing eye health needIn 2020, 1·1 billion people had distance vision impairment or uncorrected presbyopia. By 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 1·8 billion. Most affected people live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with avoidable causes of vision impairment. During the life course, most people will experience vision impairment, even if just the need for reading glasses. Because of unmet needs and an ageing global population, eye health is a major public health and sustainable development concern which warrants urgent political action.Eye health is an essential component of universal health coverage; it must be included in planning, resourcing, and delivery of health careUniversal health coverage is not universal without affordable, high quality, equitable eye care. In line with the WHO World report on vision, we urge countries to consider eye care as an essential service within universal health coverage. To deliver comprehensive services including promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, eye care needs to be included in national strategic health plans and development policies, health financing structures, and health workforce planning. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed to systematically improve population eye health, also within healthy ageing initiatives, schools, and the workplace. Integration of eye health services with multiple relevant components of health service delivery and at all levels of the health system is of central importance.High quality eye health services are not universally delivered; concerted action is needed to improve quality and outcomes, providing effective, efficient, safe, timely, equitable, and people-centred careUse of effective service coverage indicators for cataract and refractive error highlight the delivery gap between population eye health needs and the delivery of good outcomes. We urge eye health providers to take a holistic view to emphasise quality and design service delivery based on individual and population needs: a people-centred approach. Services need to be characterised by inclusiveness and equity in design and delivery, proactively addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. To encourage improved quality in cataract surgery, we support redefining a good vision outcome threshold as 6/12 or better.Highly cost-effective vision-restoring interventions offer enormous potential to improve the economic outlook of individuals and nations; a major scale up of financial investment in eye health is requiredFor 2020, we estimate that vision impairment resulted in $410·7 billion lost economic productivity; the full cost is most likely higher. Treatments for cataract and refractive error would meet more than 90% of unmet needs and are highly cost-effective. The case for countries to invest in improving population eye health is compelling and more financial resources are urgently required.Financial barriers to accessing eye care leave many people behind; eye health needs to be included in national health financing to pool the riskHealth-care costs prevent many people from accessing essential eye health services. Eye care needs to be integrated into general health system financing to remove cost barriers. To improve access for the whole population and mitigate eye care expenditure, mechanisms that pool risk are highly desirable.Technology and treatment developments offer new tools to improve eye health; thoughtful application is needed to maximise the potential to improve coverage, accessibility, quality, efficiency, and affordabilityTechnological developments such as telemedicine, mHealth, and artificial intelligence offer the potential to revolutionise eye health care in the next decade by delivering affordable, high-quality services to remote areas. However, caution is needed to ensure all populations benefit from these developments.The eye health workforce is unable to meet population needs in many countries; major expansion in service capacity is required through increased numbers, sharing tasks, strengthened training, enabling work environments, and effective leadershipMany areas have major shortages of personnel working in eye health. The available workforce needs to be distributed according to population need. Quality of training for the workforce needs to be updated, with renewed emphasis on competency. Enabling working environments need to be created, including appropriate support, supervision, and equipment. Long-standing issues of low productivity need to be systematically resolved. Mentoring and other programmes to cultivate an emerging generation of eye health leaders are needed.Reliable survey and service data are key to progress in eye health; robust indicator data are needed to shape change and drive actionTo monitor progress in delivering improved eye health within universal health coverage, a balanced set of robust indicators are needed, which we outlined in this Commission. Service data should be available and used by implementers and policy makers to drive change. We highlight the scarcity of epidemiological data in several regions, which should be addressed as a priority.Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverageImplementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community.

A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community. Despite this progress, business as usual will not keep pace with the demographic trends of an ageing global population or address the inequities that persist in each country. New threats to eye health are emerging, including the worldwide increase in diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic eye diseases of ageing such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. With the projected increase in such conditions and their associated vision loss over the coming decades, urgent action is needed to develop innovative treatments and deliver services at a greater scale than previously achieved. Good eye health at the community and national level has been marginalised as a luxury available to only wealthy or urban areas. Eye health needs to be urgently brought into the mainstream of national health and development policy, planning, financing, and action. The challenge is to develop and deliver comprehensive eye health services (promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation) that address the full range of eye conditions within the context of universal health coverage. Accessing services should not bring the risk of falling into poverty and services should be of high quality, as envisaged by the WHO framework for health-care quality: effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. To this framework we add the need for services to be environmentally sustainable. Universal health coverage is not universal without eye care. Multiple obstacles need to be overcome to achieve universal coverage for eye health. Important issues include complex barriers to availability and access to quality services, cost, major shortages and maldistribution of well-trained personnel, and lack of suitable, well maintained equipment and consumables. These issues are particularly widespread in LMICs, but also occur in underserved communities in high-income countries. Strong partnerships need to be formed with natural allies working in areas affected by eye health, such as non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, healthy ageing, children's services, education, disability, and rehabilitation. The eye health sector has traditionally focused on treatment and rehabilitation, and underused health promotion and prevention strategies to lessen the impact of eye disease and reduce inequality. Solving these problems will depend on solutions established from high quality evidence that can guide more effective implementation at scale. Evidence-based approaches will need to address existing deficiencies in the supply and demand. Strategic investments in discovery research, harnessing new findings from diverse fields, and implementation research to guide effective scale up are needed globally. Encouragingly, developments in telemedicine, mobile health, artificial intelligence, and distance learning could potentially enable eye care professionals to deliver higher quality care that is more plentiful, equitable, and cost-effective. This Commission did a Grand Challenges in Global Eye Health prioritisation exercise to highlight key areas for concerted research and action. This exercise has identified a broad set of challenges spanning the fields of epidemiology, health systems, diagnostics, therapeutics, and implementation. The most compelling of these issues, picked from among 3400 suggestions proposed by 336 people from 118 countries, can help to frame the future research agenda for global eye health. In this Commission, we harness lessons learned from over two decades, present the growing evidence for the life-transforming impact of eye care, and provide a thorough understanding of rapid developments in the field. This report was created through a broad consultation involving experts within and outside the eye care sector to help inform governments and other stakeholders about the path forward for eye health beyond 2020, to further the SDGs (including universal health coverage), and work towards a world without avoidable vision loss. The next few years are a crucial time for the global eye health community and its partners in health care, government, and other sectors to consider the successes and challenges encountered in the past two decades, and at the same time to chart a way forward for the upcoming decades. Moving forward requires building on the strong foundation laid by WHO and partners in VISION 2020 with renewed impetus to ultimately deliver high quality universal eye health care for all.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3130938027", "source": "openalex"}

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118017998", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2024921065", "title": "The Pathology of Dry Eye", "text": "Background Most dry-eye symptoms result from an abnormal, nonlubricative ocular surface that increases shear forces under the eyelids and diminishes the ability of the ocular surface to respond to environmental challenges. This ocular-surface dysfunction may result from immunocompromise due to systemic autoimmune disease or may occur locally from a decrease in systemic androgen support to the lacrimal gland as seen in aging, most frequently in the menopausal female. Hypothesis Components of the ocular surface (cornea, conjunctiva, accessory lacrimal glands, and meibomian glands), the main lacrimal gland, and interconnecting innervation act as a functional unit. When one portion is compromised, normal lacrimal support of the ocular surface is impaired. Resulting immune-based inflammation can lead to lacrimal gland and neural dysfunction. This progression yields the OS symptoms associated with dry eye. Therapy Restoration of lacrimal function involves resolution of lymphocytic activation and inflammation. This has been demonstrated in the MRL/lpr mouse using systemic androgens or cyclosporine and in the dry-eye dog using topical cyclosporine. The efficacy of cyclosporine may be due to its immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory (phosphatase inhibitory capability) functions on the ocular surface, resulting in a normalization of nerve traffic. Conclusion Although the etiologies of dry eye are varied, common to all ocular-surface disease is an underlying cytokine/receptor-mediated inflammatory process. By treating this process, it may be possible to normalize the ocular surface/lacrimal neural reflex and facilitate ocular surface healing.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2024921065", "source": "openalex"}

A DLS was trained for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 76 370 images), possible glaucoma (125 189 images), and AMD (72 610 images), and performance of DLS was evaluated for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 112 648 images), possible glaucoma (71 896 images), and AMD (35 948 images). Training of the DLS was completed in May 2016, and validation of the DLS was completed in May 2017 for detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) using a primary validation data set in the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and 10 multiethnic cohorts with diabetes. <h3>Exposures</h3> Use of a deep learning system. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity of the DLS with professional graders (retinal specialists, general ophthalmologists, trained graders, or optometrists) as the reference standard. <h3>Results</h3> In the primary validation dataset (n = 14 880 patients; 71 896 images; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [2.2] years; 54.6% men), the prevalence of referable diabetic retinopathy was 3.0%; vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, 0.6%; possible glaucoma, 0.1%; and AMD, 2.5%. The AUC of the DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0.936 (95% CI, 0.925-0.943), sensitivity was 90.5% (95% CI, 87.3%-93.0%), and specificity was 91.6% (95% CI, 91.0%-92.2%). For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, AUC was 0.958 (95% CI, 0.956-0.961), sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 94.1%-100.0%), and specificity was 91.1% (95% CI, 90.7%-91.4%). For possible glaucoma, AUC was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.929-0.954), sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.9%), and specificity was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.8%-87.5%). For AMD, AUC was 0.931 (95% CI, 0.928-0.935), sensitivity was 93.2% (95% CI, 91.1%-99.8%), and specificity was 88.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-89.0%). For referable diabetic retinopathy in the 10 additional datasets, AUC range was 0.889 to 0.983 (n = 40 752 images). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this evaluation of retinal images from multiethnic cohorts of patients with diabetes, the DLS had high sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases. Further research is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the DLS in health care settings and the utility of the DLS to improve vision outcomes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2772246530", "source": "openalex"}

In between, a reaching plan is formed. This plan could be in the coordinates of the arm, specifying the direction and amplitude of the movement, or it could be in the coordinates of the eye because visual information is initially gathered in this reference frame. In a reach-planning area of the posterior parietal cortex, neural activity was found to be more consistent with an eye-centered than an arm-centered coding of reach targets. Coding of arm movements in an eye-centered reference frame is advantageous because obstacles that affect planning as well as errors in reaching are registered in this reference frame. Also, eye movements are planned in eye coordinates, and the use of similar coordinates for reaching may facilitate hand-eye coordination.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080119716", "source": "openalex"}

The population was derived from the Health Care Financing Administration Medicare database. After completing a standardized questionnaire pertaining to dry eye symptoms, 2,420 subjects underwent Schirmer and rose bengal tests and anatomic assessment of the meibomian glands.In this population, 14.6% (363/2,482) were symptomatic, defined as reporting one or more dry eye symptoms often or all the time; 2.2% (53/2,448) were symptomatic and had a low Schirmer test result (< or = 5 mm), and 2% (48/2,432) were symptomatic and had a high rose bengal test score (> or = 5). Furthermore, 3.5% (84/2,425) were symptomatic and had either a low Schirmer score or a high rose bengal score, and 0.7% (17/2,420) were symptomatic and had both a low Schirmer score and a high rose bengal score. No association of symptoms or signs was seen with age, sex, or race. Although anatomic features of meibomianitis were associated with the presence of symptoms (P = .01), 76% (67/88) of the individuals with these anatomic features were asymptomatic; 10.5% (260/2,480) reported that they currently use artificial tears or lubricants.Symptoms and signs of dry eye are common among the elderly but were not associated with age, race, or sex in this population-based sample of elderly Americans. Extrapolating to the United States population aged 65 to 84 years, the study yields an estimate of 4.3 million who experience symptoms of ocular irritation often or all the time.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017282855", "source": "openalex"}

Single neurons discharging before saccades", "text": "We studied the activity of single neurons in the frontal eye fields of awake macaque monkeys trained to perform several oculomotor tasks. Fifty-four percent of neurons discharged before visually guided saccades. Three different types of presaccadic activity were observed: visual, movement, and anticipatory. Visual activity occurred in response to visual stimuli whether or not the monkey made saccades. Movement activity preceded purposive saccades, even those made without visual targets. Anticipatory activity preceded even the cue to make a saccade if the monkey could reliably predict what saccade he had to make. These three different activities were found in different presaccadic cells in different proportions. Forty percent of presaccadic cells had visual activity (visual cells) but no movement activity. For about half of the visual cells the response was enhanced if the monkey made saccades to the receptive-field stimulus, but there was no discharge before similar saccades made without visual targets. Twenty percent of presaccadic neurons discharged as briskly before purposive saccades made without a visual target as they did before visually guided saccades, and had weak or absent visual responses. These cells were defined as movement cells. Movement cells discharged much less or not at all before saccades made spontaneously without a task requirement or an overt visual target. The remaining presaccadic neurons (40%) had both visual and movement activity (visuomovement cells). They discharged most briskly before visually guided eye movements, but also discharged before purposive eye movements made in darkness and responded to visual stimuli in the absence of saccades. There was a continuum of visuomovement cells, from cells in which visual activity predominated to cells in which movement activity predominated. This continuum suggests that although visual cells are quite distinct from movement cells, the division of cell types into three classes may be only a heuristic means of describing the processing flow from visual input to eye-movement output. Twenty percent of visuomovement and movement cells, but fewer than 2% of visual cells, had anticipatory activity. Only one cell had anticipatory activity as its sole response. When the saccade was delayed relative to the target onset, visual cells responded to the target appearance, movement cells discharged before the saccade, and visuomovement cells discharged in different ways during the delay, usually with some discharge following the target and an increase in rate immediately before the saccade. Presaccadic neurons of all types were actively suppressed following a saccade into their response fields.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1957364793", "source": "openalex"}

It takes only about 100+64N arithmetic operations to compute the hand/eye relationship after the robot finishes the movement, and incurs only additional 64 arithmetic operations for each additional station. The robot makes a series of automatically planned movements with a camera rigidly mounted at the gripper. At the end of each move, it takes a total of 90 ms to grab an image, extract image feature coordinates, and perform camera extrinsic calibration. After the robot finishes all the movements, it takes only a few milliseconds to do the calibration. A series of generic geometric properties or lemmas are presented, leading to the derivation of the final algorithms, which are aimed at simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy while giving ample geometric and algebraic insights. Critical factors influencing the accuracy are analyzed, and procedures for improving accuracy are introduced.

Traditional delivery methods rely on the random, passive diffusion of molecules, which do not allow for the rapid delivery of a concentrated cargo to a defined region at the posterior pole of the eye. The use of particles promises targeted delivery but faces the challenge that most tissues including the vitreous have a tight macromolecular matrix that acts as a barrier and prevents its penetration. Here, we demonstrate novel intravitreal delivery microvehicles-slippery micropropellers-that can be actively propelled through the vitreous humor to reach the retina. The propulsion is achieved by helical magnetic micropropellers that have a liquid layer coating to minimize adhesion to the surrounding biopolymeric network. The submicrometer diameter of the propellers enables the penetration of the biopolymeric network and the propulsion through the porcine vitreous body of the eye over centimeter distances. Clinical optical coherence tomography is used to monitor the movement of the propellers and confirm their arrival on the retina near the optic disc. Overcoming the adhesion forces and actively navigating a swarm of micropropellers in the dense vitreous humor promise practical applications in ophthalmology.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2898681393", "source": "openalex"}

Our results support a model of progressive tissue specification in which neural induction then Otx2-driven neural patterning primes the anterior neural plate for eye field formation. Next, the EFTFs form a self-regulating feedback network that specifies the vertebrate eye field.

The SC receives convergent inputs from cerebral cortical areas and the basal ganglia. To make a saccade to an object purposefully, appropriate signals must be selected out of the cortical inputs, in which the basal ganglia play a crucial role. This is done by the sustained inhibitory input from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the SC. This inhibition can be removed by another inhibition from the caudate nucleus (CD) to the SNr, which results in a disinhibition of the SC. The basal ganglia have another mechanism, involving the external segment of the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, with which the SNr-SC inhibition can further be enhanced. The sensorimotor signals carried by the basal ganglia neurons are strongly modulated depending on the behavioral context, which reflects working memory, expectation, and attention. Expectation of reward is a critical determinant in that the saccade that has been rewarded is facilitated subsequently. The interaction between cortical and dopaminergic inputs to CD neurons may underlie the behavioral adaptation toward purposeful saccades.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105294045", "source": "openalex"}

Following surgery monkeys tended to neglect the contralateral peripheral visual field and made fewer saccades to peripheral targets. Recovery was virtually completed in 2-4 wk. 3. Superior colliculus ablation reduced fixation accuracy, saccade frequency, and saccade velocity. These deficits showed little recovery with time. 4. Paired frontal eye-field and superior colliculus lesions produced dramatic deficits in visually triggered eye movements. Animals could no longer fixate their eyes on visual targets with any degree of accuracy. The range of eye movements was greatly reduced, as was the frequency and velocity of saccades.

In this way, eye-movement recordings can provide an objective source of interface-evaluation data that can inform the design of improved interfaces. Eye movements also can be captured and used as control signals to enable people to interact with interfaces directly without the need for mouse or keyboard input, which can be a major advantage for certain populations of users, such as disabled individuals. We begin this article with an overview of eye-tracking technology and progress toward a detailed discussion of the use of eye tracking in HCI and usability research.

Emphasis is placed on the events that underlie and direct neural retina formation and lens induction. Understanding these events represents a longstanding problem in developmental biology. Early interest can be attributed to the curiosity generated by the relatively frequent occurrence of disorders such as cyclopia and anophthalmia, in which dramatic changes in eye development are readily observed. However, it was the advent of experimental embryology at the turn of the century that transformed curiosity into active investigation. Pioneered by investigators such as Spemann and Adelmann, these embryological manipulations have left a profound legacy. Questions about early eye development first addressed using tissue manipulations remain topical as we try to understand the molecular basis of this process.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112718652", "source": "openalex"}

Eleven subjects participated in three to five functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions in which they viewed moving eyes, moving mouths, or movements of check patterns that occurred in the same spatial location as the eyes or mouth. In each task, the stimuli were superimposed on a radial background pattern that continually moved inward to control for the effect of movement per se. Activation evoked by the radial background was assessed in a separate control task. Moving eyes and mouths activated a bilateral region centered in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). The moving check patterns did not appreciably activate the STS or surrounding regions. The activation by moving eyes and mouths was distinct from that elicited by the moving radial background, which primarily activated the posterior-temporal-occipital fossa and the lateral occipital sulcus-a region corresponding to area MT/V5. Area MT/V5 was also strongly activated by moving eyes and to a lesser extent by other moving stimuli. These results suggest that a superior temporal region centered in the STS is preferentially involved in the perception of gaze direction and mouth movements. This region of the STS may be functionally related to nearby superior temporal regions thought to be involved in lip-reading and in the perception of hand and body movement.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2098982334", "source": "openalex"}

Many algorithms have been proposed for this so-called hand-eye calibration, but they do not treat the relative position and orientation in a unified way. In this paper, we introduce the use of dual quaternions, which are the algebraic counterpart of screws. Then we show how a line transformation can be written with the dual-quaternion product. We algebraically prove that if we consider the camera and motor transformations as screws, then only the line coefficients of the screw axes are relevant regarding the hand-eye calibration. The dual-quaternion parameterization facilitates a new simultaneous solution for the hand-eye rotation and translation using the singular value decomposition. Real-world performance is assessed directly in the application of hand-eye information for stereo reconstruction, as well as in the positioning of cameras.

Its putative pathogenetic mechanisms include hyperosmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland. Dry eye is clinically subdivided into two subtypes: one with decreased tear secretion (aqueous-deficient DED), and one with increased tear evaporation (hyperevaporative DED).This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective PubMed search and on the authors' own clinical and scientific experience.The diagnostic evaluation of dry eye disease should include a detailed patient history, thorough split-lamp examination, and additional tests as indicated. Few randomized controlled therapeutic trials for dry eye have been published to date. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye.

Such fluctuations are indicated in electron microscope photographs. By examining the superposition of phases of waves scattered from each point in the medium, we provide a mathematical demonstration of the Bragg reflection principle which we have recently used in the interpretation of experimental investigations: namely, that the scattering of light is produced only by those fluctuations whose fourier components have a wavelength equal to or larger than one half the wavelength of light in the medium. This consideration is applied first to the scattering of light from collagen fibers in the normal cornea. We demonstrate physically and quantitatively that a limited correlation in the position of near neighbor collagen fibers leads to corneal transparency. Next, the theory is extended to predict the turbidity of swollen, pathologic corneas, wherein the normal distribution of collagen fibers is disturbed by the presence of numerous lakes-regions where collagen is absent. A quantitative expression for the turbidity of the swollen cornea is given in terms of the size and density of such lakes. Finally, the theory is applied to the case of the cataractous lens. We assume that the cataracts are produced by aggregation of the normal lens proteins into an albuminoid fraction and provide a formula for the lens turbidity in terms of the molecular weight and index of refraction of the individual albuminoid macromolecules. We provide a crude estimate of the mean albuminoid molecular weight required for lens opacity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979489445", "source": "openalex"}

Only one parameter, the quantum efficiency of the primary photo process, locates position on this scale. The characteristic equation for the performance of an ideal device has the form BC2α2=constantwhere B is the luminance of the scene, and C and α are respectively the threshold contrast and angular size of a test object in the scene. This ideal type of performance is shown to be satisfied by a simple experimental television pickup arrangement. By means of the arrangement, two parameters, storage time of the eye and threshold signal-to-noise ratio are determined to be 0.2 seconds and five respectively. Published data on the performance of the eye are compared with ideal performance. In the ranges of B(10−6 to 102 footlamberts), C(2 to 100 percent) and α(2′ to 100′), the performance of the eye may be matched by an ideal device having a quantum efficiency of 5 percent at low lights and 0.5 percent at high lights. This is of considerable technical importance in simplifying the analysis of problems involving comparisons of the performance of the eye and man-made devices. To the extent that independent measurements of the quantum efficiency of the eye confirm the values (0.5 percent to 5.0 percent), the performance of the eye is limited by fluctuations in the primary photo process. To the same extent, other mechanisms for describing the eye that do not take these fluctuations into account are ruled out. It is argued that the phenomenon of dark adaptation can be ascribed only in small part to the primary photo-process and must be mainly controlled by a variable gain mechanism located between the primary photo-process and the nerve fibers carrying pulses to the brain.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2065262077", "source": "openalex"}

We show that the wave-front sensor provides repeatable and accurate measurements of the eye's wave aberration. The modulation transfer function of the eye computed from the wave-front sensor is in fair, though not complete, agreement with that obtained under similar conditions on the same observers by use of the double-pass and the interferometric techniques. Irregular aberrations, i.e., those beyond defocus, astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration, do not have a large effect on retinal image quality in normal eyes when the pupil is small (3 mm). However, they play a substantial role when the pupil is large (7.3-mm), reducing visual performance and the resolution of images of the living retina. Although the pattern of aberrations varies from subject to subject, aberrations, including irregular ones, are correlated in left and right eyes of the same subject, indicating that they are not random defects.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151084406", "source": "openalex"}

Thus argues Vivian Sobchack as she challenges basic assumptions of current film theory that reduce film to an object of vision and the spectator to a victim of a deterministic cinematic apparatus. Maintaining that these premises ignore the material and cultural-historical situations of both the spectator and the film, the author proposes that the cinematic experience depends on two viewers viewing: the spectator and the film, each existing as both subject and object of vision. Drawing on existential and semiotic phenomenology, and particularly on the work of Merleau-Ponty, Sobchack shows how the film experience provides empirical insight into the reversible, dialectical and signifying nature of that embodied vision we each live daily as both mine and another's. In this attempt to account for cinematic intelligibility and signification, the author explores the possibility of human choice and expressive freedom within the bounds of history and culture.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070793686", "source": "openalex"}

It is argued that in the light of evidence showing automatic “capture” of attention by peripheral stimuli, these experiments do not distinguish between attentional effects due to peripheral stimuli and those due to eye movements. In the present study, spatial attention was manipulated by varying the probability that peripheral probe stimuli would appear in different positions, while saccades were directed by a central arrow, enabling the effects of attention and eye movements to be separated. The results showed that the time to react to a peripheral stimulus could be shortened both by advance knowledge of its likely position and, separately, by preparing to make a saccade to that position. When the saccade was directed away from the most likely position of the probe, the targets for attention and eye movements were on opposite sides of the display. In this condition, the effects of preparing to make a saccade proved to be stronger than the effects of attentional allocation until well after the saccade had finished, suggesting that making a saccade necessarily involves the allocation of attention to the target position. The effects of probe stimuli on saccade latencies were also examined: probe stimuli that appeared before the saccade shortened saccade latencies if they appeared at the saccade target, and lengthened saccade latencies if they appeared on the opposite side of fixation. These facilitatory and inhibitory effects were shown to occur at different stages of saccade preparation and suggest that attention plays an important role in the generation of voluntary eye movements. The results of this study indicate that while it is possible to make attention movements without making corresponding eye movements, it is not possible to make an eye movement (in the absence of peripheral stimulation) without making a corresponding shift in the focus of attention.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2062470152", "source": "openalex"}

Eye platelet rich plasma (E-PRP) provides higher concentration of essential growth factors and cell adhesion molecules by concentrating platelets in a small volume of plasma as compared with autologous serum, the latter being used widely in ophthalmology for epithelial wound healing of the cornea for the last two decades. These growth factors and cell adhesion molecules have a major role in wound healing and enhance the physiological process at the site of the injury/surgery via eye drops or clot. E-PRP has been used more recently, and has achieved successful outcomes in peer-review articles in the treatment of dormant ulcers (epithelial defects of the cornea that fail to heal), moderate to severe dry eye syndrome, ocular surface syndrome post Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), and for surface reconstruction after corneal perforation associated with amniotic membrane transplantation. Preparation of E-PRP in the two available formulations, eyedrops and clot, is inexpensive and easy although it requires following strict sterility conditions using sterile and disposable materials and operating inside a laminar flow hood. No serious adverse effects have been described with the use of these products, and it is generally well tolerated. In summary, Platelet enriched plasma in the form obtained in ophthalmology, E-PRP, is a reliable and effective therapeutic tool to enhance epithelial wound healing in ocular surface disease.

We used a head-mounted eye-movement video camera, which provided a continuous view of the scene ahead, with a dot indicating foveal direction with an accuracy of about 1 deg. A second video camera recorded the subject's activities from across the room. The videos were linked and analysed frame by frame. Foveal direction was always close to the object being manipulated, and very few fixations were irrelevant to the task. The first object-related fixation typically led the first indication of manipulation by 0.56 s, and vision moved to the next object about 0.61 s before manipulation of the previous object was complete. Each object-related act that did not involve a waiting period lasted an average of 3.3 s and involved about 7 fixations. Roughly a third of all fixations on objects could be definitely identified with one of four monitoring functions: locating objects used later in the process, directing the hand or object in the hand to a new location, guiding the approach of one object to another (eg kettle and lid), and checking the state of some variable (eg water level). We conclude that although the actions of tea-making are ‘automated’ and proceed with little conscious involvement, the eyes closely monitor every step of the process. This type of unconscious attention must be a common phenomenon in everyday life.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016711711", "source": "openalex"}

There was no specific entry criterion for enrollment in addition to a previous dry eye diagnosis in this clinic-based sample. Patients represented varying types and severity of dry eye disease and were previously diagnosed by clinic attending doctors in this university clinic setting. The study examination included a symptom interview that assessed dryness, grittiness, soreness, redness, and ocular fatigue. The interview was followed by a clinical dry eye examination conducted in the following sequence: meibomian gland assessment, tear meniscus height, tear breakup time test, fluorescein staining, the phenol red thread test, Schirmer test, and rose bengal staining. Partial Spearman correlation coefficients, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, chi 2 test, and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the relationship between dry eye tests and symptoms.Symptoms were generally not associated with clinical signs in patients with dry eye disease. There were no significant correlations between signs and symptoms after adjustment for age and artificial tear use. The rank of each clinical test result did not statistically differ when stratified by the presence of patient symptoms in Wilcoxon rank sum analyses. Likewise, the frequency of patient symptoms did not differ statistically when stratified by a positive clinical test result in chi 2 analyses. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no clinical test significantly predicted frequently reported symptoms after adjustment for age and artificial tear use.These results suggest a poor relation between dry eye tests and symptoms, which represents a quandary in dry eye clinical research and practice.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054186928", "source": "openalex"}

We analyzed the distribution of the eye's aberrations in the population and found that most Zernike modes are relatively uncorrelated with each other across the population. A principal components analysis was applied to our wave-aberration measurements with the resulting principal components providing only a slightly more compact description of the population data than Zernike modes.

We then devise 90 different features based on these characteristics and select a subset of them using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection. We validate the method using an eight participant study in an office environment using an example set of five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking handwritten notes, watching a video, and browsing the Web. We also include periods with no specific activity (the NULL class). Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and person-independent (leave-one-person-out) training, we obtain an average precision of 76.1 percent and recall of 70.5 percent over all classes and participants.

Data have emerged based on the important contribution of recent techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging, which provide complementary results to those of the classical lesion and electrical stimulation studies.The location of the human frontal eye field and its role in pursuit eye movement control were recently detailed. Cumulative evidence for the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in unwanted reflexive saccade inhibition, short-term spatial memory and prediction suggests that this area controls decisional processes governing ocular motor behaviour. The organization of spatial memory in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (short-term), the parahippocampal cortex (medium-term) and the hippocampal formation (long-term) is also reviewed with the results of recent transcranial magnetic stimulation studies. The relatively complicated anatomy of the posterior parietal cortex in humans is briefly described followed by some additional results concerning the location of the parietal eye field - within the posterior half of the intraparietal sulcus - and its role in visuo-spatial integration and attention. The other areas involved in spatial attention are also examined in the light of several recent contributing reports. Lastly, there are also new functional magnetic resonance imaging findings concerning the posterior cingulate cortex, which appears to be mainly involved in the control of externally guided eye movements and attentional mechanisms.Many new findings on the organization of saccades and pursuit eye movements at the cortical level have recently been reported.

The problem of determining this relationship is referred to as hand-eye calibration, which is important in at least two types of tasks: (i) map sensor centered measurements into the robot workspace and (ii) allow the robot to precisely move the sensor. In the past some solutions were proposed in the particular case of a camera. With almost no exception, all existing solutions attempt to solve the homogeneous matrix equation AX=XB. First we show that there are two possible formulations of the hand-eye calibration problem. One formulation is the classical one that we just mentioned. A second formulation takes the form of the following homogeneous matrix equation: MY=M'YB. The advantage of the latter is that the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters need not be made explicit. Indeed, this formulation directly uses the 3 by 4 perspective matrices (M and M') associated with two positions of the camera. Moreover, this formulation together with the classical one cover a wider range of camera-based sensors to be calibrated with respect to the robot hand. Second, we develop a common mathematical framework to solve for the hand-eye calibration problem using either of the two formulations. We present two methods, (i) a rotation then translation and (ii) a non-linear solver for rotation and translation. Third, we perform a stability analysis both for our two methods and for the classical linear method of Tsai and Lenz (1989). In the light of this comparison, the non-linear optimization method, that solves for rotation and translation simultaneously, seems to be the most robust one with respect to noise and to measurement errors.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094801294", "source": "openalex"}

An unstable tear film also affects the visual function, possibly due to the increase of higher order aberrations. Based on the change in the understanding of the types, symptoms, and signs of dry eye disease, the Asia Dry Eye Society agreed to the following definition of dry eye: “Dry eye is a multifactorial disease characterized by unstable tear film causing a variety of symptoms and/or visual impairment, potentially accompanied by ocular surface damage.” The definition stresses instability of the tear film as well as the importance of visual impairment, highlighting an essential role for TFBUT assessment.

In fact, the Americans fixated more on focal objects than did the Chinese, and the Americans tended to look at the focal object more quickly.

The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.Deep learning-trained algorithm.The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%.In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2557738935", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1859517329", "title": "Evidence for a supplementary eye field", "text": "Electrical microstimulation and unit recording were performed in dorsomedial frontal cortex of four alert monkeys to identify an oculomotor area whose existence had been postulated rostral to the supplementary motor area. Contraversive saccades were evoked from 129 sites by stimulation. Threshold currents were lower than 20 microA in half the tests. Response latencies were usually longer than 50 ms (minimum: 30 ms). Eye movements were occasionally accompanied by blinks, ear, or neck movements. The cortical area yielding these movements was at the superior edge of the frontal lobe just rostral to the region from which limb movements could be elicited. Depending on the site of stimulation, saccades varied between two extremes: from having rather uniform direction and size, to converging toward a goal defined in space. The transition between these extremes was gradual with no evidence that these two types were fundamentally different. From surface to depth of cortex, direction and amplitude of evoked saccades were similar or changed progressively. No clear systematization was found depending on location along rostrocaudal or mediolateral axes of the cortex. The dorsomedial oculomotor area mapped was approximately 7 mm long and 6 mm wide. Combined eye and head movements were elicited from one of ten sites stimulated when the head was unrestrained. In the other nine cases, saccades were not accompanied by head rotation, even when higher currents or longer stimulus trains were applied. Presaccadic unit activity was recorded from 62 cells. Each of these cells had a preferred direction that corresponded to the direction of the movement evoked by local microstimulation. Presaccadic activity occurred with self-initiated as well as visually triggered saccades. It often led self-initiated saccades by more than 300 ms. Recordings made with the head free showed that the firing could not be interpreted as due to attempted head movements. Many dorsomedial cortical neurons responded to photic stimuli, either phasically or tonically. Sustained responses (activation or inhibition) were observed during target fixation. Twenty-one presaccadic units showed tonic changes of activity with fixation. Justification is given for considering the cortical area studied as a supplementary eye field. It shares many common properties with the arcuate frontal eye field. Differences noted in this study include: longer latency of response to electrical stimulation, possibility to evoke saccades converging apparently toward a goal, and long-lead unit activity with spontaneous saccades.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1859517329", "source": "openalex"}

Pattern formation in this tissue is initiated at the posterior edge and moves anteriorly as a wave; the front of this wave is called the morphogenetic furrow (MF). Dpp is required for proliferation and initiation of pattern formation at the posterior edge of the eye disc. It has also been suggested that Dpp is the principal mediator of Hedgehog function in driving progression of the MF across the disc. In this paper, ectopic Dpp expression is shown to be sufficient to induce a duplicated eye disc with normal shape, MF progression, neuronal cluster formation and direction of axon outgrowth. Induction of ectopic eye development occurs preferentially along the anterior margin of the eye disc. Ectopic Dpp clones situated away from the margins induce neither proliferation nor patterning. The Dpp signalling pathway is shown to be under tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control within different spatial domains in the developing eye disc. In addition, Dpp positively controls its own expression and suppresses wingless transcription. In contrast to the wing disc, Dpp does not appear to be the principal mediator of Hedgehog function in the eye.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1939431494", "source": "openalex"}

Diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy has previously been assessed in meta-analyses including studies performed in experimental and clinical settings. Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of melanoma compared with naked eye examination by performing a meta-analysis exclusively on studies performed in a clinical setting. Methods We searched for publications from 1987 to January 2008 and found nine eligible studies. The selected studies compare diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy with naked eye examination using a valid reference test on consecutive patients with a defined clinical presentation, performed in a clinical setting. Hierarchical summary receiver operator curve analysis was used to estimate the relative diagnostic accuracy for clinical examination with, and without, the use of dermoscopy. Results We found the relative diagnostic odds ratio for melanoma, for dermoscopy compared with naked eye examination, to be 15·6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2·9–83·7, P = 0·016]; removal of two outlier studies changed this to 9·0 (95% CI 1·5–54·6, P = 0·03).

In this study, the repeatability of a battery of clinical diagnostic tests for dry eye was assessed on mild to moderate dry eye patients.A dry eye examination was performed on 75 patients on two occasions by a single examiner. The battery of dry eye tests included symptom assessment, contact lens and medical history, slit-lamp biomicroscopic evaluation of the eyelids, evaluation of Meibomian glands, assessment of tear film quality, tear meniscus height, assessment of blink quality, fluorescein tear breakup time (TBUT), fluorescein and rose bengal staining of the cornea and conjunctiva, phenol red thread test, and Schirmer test.The repeatability of subjective report of dryness (kappaW = 0.62) and grittiness (kappaW = 0.73) was moderate to high. In contrast, the repeatability of Meibomian gland disease classification (kappaW = 0.20), presence or absence of inferior corneal fluorescein staining (kappa = 0.25), and inferior conjunctival rose bengal staining (kappa = 0.21) was poor. When a summed staining score of corneal and conjunctival regions was evaluated, weighted kappa reliability was fair. The repeatability of tear breakup time was substantial [95% limits of agreement -5.71 to 5.83 seconds; intraclass coefficient coefficient (ICC) 0.65], and improved when the two timed readings were averaged. Repeatability of the Schirmer test is more variable as wetting scores increase. When the average Schirmer scores </= 10 mm were evaluated, moderate repeatability was demonstrated, indicating that the test performs better with more advanced disease.Although patient-reported symptoms are moderately repeatable from visit to visit, many of the procedures clinically used to diagnose and monitor dry eye syndromes are largely unrepeatable.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078501398", "source": "openalex"}

The 520 control subjects were from the same geographic areas as case subjects, had other ocular diseases, and were frequency-matched to cases according to age and sex. <h3>Main Outcome Measures.</h3> —The relative risk for AMD was estimated according to dietary indicators of antioxidant status, controlling for smoking and other risk factors, by using multiple logistic-regression analyses. <h3>Results.</h3> —A higher dietary intake of carotenoids was associated with a lower risk for AMD. Adjusting for other risk factors for AMD, we found that those in the highest quintile of carotenoid intake had a 43% lower risk for AMD compared with those in the lowest quintile (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.92;<i>P</i>for trend=.02). Among the specific carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, which are primarily obtained from dark green, leafy vegetables, were most strongly associated with a reduced risk for AMD (<i>P</i>for trend=.001). Several food items rich in carotenoids were inversely associated with AMD. In particular, a higher frequency of intake of spinach or collard greens was associated with a substantially lower risk for AMD (<i>P</i>for trend&lt;.001). The intake of preformed vitamin A (retinol) was not appreciably related to AMD. Neither vitamin E nor total vitamin C consumption was associated with a statistically significant reduced risk for AMD, although a possibly lower risk for AMD was suggested among those with higher intake of vitamin C, particularly from foods. <h3>Conclusion.</h3> —Increasing the consumption of foods rich in certain carotenoids, in particular dark green, leafy vegetables, may decrease the risk of developing advanced or exudative AMD, the most visually disabling form of macular degeneration among older people.

Purpose: To examine the age and sex‐specific prevalence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and its relationship with some ophthalmological variables. Methods: We carried out a population‐based study using a random sample taken from the national population census for citizens of Reykjavik, aged ≥ 50 years. A total of 1045 individuals participated in all parts of the study. Pseudoexfoliation was established by slit‐lamp examination with a maximally dilated pupil carried out by two experienced ophthalmologists, who were masked to one another’s results except in cases of disagreement where they had to reach a consensus. Results: In all, 108 (10.7%) persons were found to have PEX in at least one eye. Prevalence increased from 2.5% in those aged 50–59 years to 40.6% in those aged ≥ 80 years. Women were more frequently affected than men (12.3% versus 8.7%). This difference remained statistically significant after controlling for the effect of age (p &lt; 0.001). Eyes with PEX were found to have higher intraocular pressure (IOP) than eyes without PEX (p &lt; 0.05). However, PEX was not found to be related to central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, nuclear lens opacifications or optic disc morphology in a multivariate model. Conclusions: Pseudoexfoliation is an age‐related phenomenon commonly found in Iceland. It is more commonly found in women than in men and is associated with elevated IOP.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155953092", "source": "openalex"}

We have examined the ontogeny of eye and nasal defects in Sey/Sey embryos and have related the defects seen to the pattern of Pax-6 mRNA expression in the mouse during normal eye and nasal development. There are two principal components of the early eye, the neural ectoderm of the optic vesicle, which forms the retina, and the overlying surface ectoderm, which forms the lens and cornea. By studying these interacting tissues in normal and Sey/Sey embryos, we have identified processes for which Pax-6 is important and can thus suggest possible roles for the Pax-6 gene. Pax-6 is essential for the formation of lens placodes from surface ectoderm. In normal development, early Pax-6 mRNA expression in a broad domain of surface ectoderm is downregulated, but expression is specifically maintained in the developing lens placode. Moreover, other Pax-6expressing tissues are frequently those that have can transdifferentiate into lens. Thus, phenotype and expression together suggest a role for Pax-6 in lens determination. At least some functions of Pax-6 can be separated from the influence of other tissues. Early Sey/Sey optic vesicles are abnormally broad and fail to constrict proximally. These defects occur prior to the time of lens placode formation and probably reflect a requirement for Pax-6 in neural ectoderm. In surface ectoderm domains, where Pax6 expression is known to be independent of the presence of an optic vesicle, Pax-6 function is required for the maintenance of its own transcription. The mutual dependency of lens and optic vesicle development can also be studied using the Small eye mutation. Using region-specific markers we find that, in the morphologically abnormal Sey/Sey optic vesicles, aspects of normal proximo-distal specification nevertheless persist, despite the complete absence of lens. Like the lens, the nasal cavities develop from ectodermal placodes that normally express Pax-6 mRNA, fail to form in Sey/Sey mice and show Pax-6-dependent Pax-6 mRNA regulation. Analysis of patterns of programmed cell death and absence of nasal region expression from an Msx-1 transgene in Sey/Sey embryos suggest a requirement for Pax-6 in the transition from presumptive nasal ectoderm to placode, and that Msx-1, or genes regulating it, are possible targets for Pax-6.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171508208", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients.Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts.A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted.We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3010267648", "source": "openalex"}

In their introduction to this edition, Riesman and Becker provide a biographical background to Hughes' writing, describing his pervading influence on the field of sociology and on younger sociologists through his teaching, fieldwork, work in professional associations, and personality. The essays are grouped into four sections: the relationship of social institutions to changes in their surroundings and to the personalities and careers of persons; problems of multi-ethnic societies; the development of occupations, the monopoly license of professions, the determination of public policy about a line of work, and the relations between work and social role; and social observation and analysis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981590134", "source": "openalex"}

Turning the gaze of the ethnographic camera back onto itself, bringing the perspective of a third eye to bear on the invention of the primitive other, Rony reveals the collaboration of anthropology and popular culture in Western constructions of race, gender, nation, and empire. Her work demonstrates the significance of these constructions - and, more generally, of ethnographic cinema - for understanding issues of identity. In films as seemingly dissimilar as Nanook of the North, King Kong, and research footage of West Africans from an 1895 Paris ethnographic exposition, Rony exposes a shared fascination with - and anxiety over - race. She shows how photographic realism contributed to popular and scientific notions of evolution, race, and civilisation, and how, in turn, anthropology understood and critiqued its own use of photographic technology. Looking beyond negative Western images of the Other, Rony considers performance strategies that disrupt these images - for example, the use of open resistance, recontextualisation, and parody in the films of Katherine Dunham and Zora Neale Hurston, or the performances of Josephine Baker. She also draws on the work of contemporary artists such as Lorna Simpson and Victor Masayesva Jr., and writers such as Frantz Fanon and James Baldwin, who unveil the language of racialisation in ethnographic cinema. Elegantly written and richly illustrated, innovative in theory and original in method, The Third Eye is a remarkable interdisciplinary contribution to critical thought in film studies, anthropology, cultural studies, art history, postcolonial studies, and women's studies.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1491330651", "source": "openalex"}

In other circumstances, if information on only one eye per individual is used in the analysis there is a potential \"waste\" of information leading to less precise estimates of effect and less power. In addition, bias may be introduced into a study if there is non-random selection of the eye for inclusion in the analysis. The use of an overall summary of ocular findings for an individual may result in \"wastage\" of information in a similar fashion to the use of only one eye per individual. On the other hand, an analysis of individual eyes with no allowance made for between eye correlation may result in falsely narrow confidence intervals around estimates of effect. Between eyes correlation may be assessed empirically using the kappa statistic or similar means. If between eye correlation is substantial, statistical techniques exist which can utilise all available data while allowing for the correlation. In some circumstances a powerful design may be to use the fellow eye as a \"control\". Two conclusions may be drawn from this review of analytical approaches to the analysis of clinical data in the BJO. Firstly, the analytical approaches employed in many studies fail to use all the data available. In other words the analysis is less than \"optimal\". Secondly, in a proportion of studies, inappropriate statistical methods are used which may lead the investigator to draw inappropriate conclusions. In other words, the analysis is invalid. Ophthalmic data, by their very nature, present particular statistical challenges.

A unified focus, aberration correction, and vision correction model, along with a user calibration process, accounts for any optical defects between the light source and retina. We use this optical correction ability not only to fix minor aberrations but to enable truly compact, eyeglasses-like displays with wide fields of view (80°) that would be inaccessible through conventional means.

Digital eye strain (DES), also known as computer vision syndrome, encompasses a range of ocular and visual symptoms, and estimates suggest its prevalence may be 50% or more among computer users. Symptoms fall into two main categories: those linked to accommodative or binocular vision stress, and external symptoms linked to dry eye. Although symptoms are typically transient, they may be frequent and persistent, and have an economic impact when vocational computer users are affected. DES may be identified and measured using one of several available questionnaires, or objective evaluations of parameters such as critical flicker-fusion frequency, blink rate and completeness, accommodative function and pupil characteristics may be used to provide indices of visual fatigue. Correlations between objective and subjective measures are not always apparent. A range of management approaches exist for DES including correction of refractive error and/or presbyopia, management of dry eye, incorporating regular screen breaks and consideration of vergence and accommodative problems. Recently, several authors have explored the putative role of blue light-filtering spectacle lenses on treating DES, with mixed results. Given the high prevalence of DES and near-universal use of digital devices, it is essential that eye care practitioners are able to provide advice and management options based on quality research evidence.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2800705505", "source": "openalex"}

A standard protocol was used to structure each focus group discussion. Sessions were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded in preparation for a content analysis. <h3>Settings</h3> Five university-based ophthalmology practices and 1 nonprofit eye care foundation. <h3>Participants</h3> Eligible participants had to have 1 of the following eye conditions: age-related cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, primary open angle glaucoma, cytomegalovirus retinitis, or low vision from any cause. All eligible persons were older than 21 years, spoke English, and had sufficient cognitive function to provide informed consent. <h3>Results</h3> Among the 246 participants, 2623 problems with vision-related functioning were mentioned. The mean number of problems per person ranged from 13.5 for those with diabetic retinopathy to 7.9 for persons with glaucoma. For the sample overall, reading problems were mentioned most frequently, followed by driving, general problems with seeing clearly, and mental health complaints caused by vision. Although the proportion of persons who reported each problem varied by condition, at least some persons with each eye disease reported each problem. The 3 most common descriptors associated with each problem were difficulty or ease of performance (13%), psychological distress associated with performance of the activity (11%), and complete inability to participate in a visual activity (11%). <h3>Conclusion</h3> An item-generation strategy for a new questionnaire using a standardized focus group method identified content areas and aspects of visual disability that are not included in currently available vision-specific instruments that assess the impact of common eye diseases on visual functioning in everyday life. Although participants mentioned problems that were unique to their disease, across conditions the problems mentioned were similar. These findings provide empirical evidence of content validity for a vision-targeted, health-related quality-of-life survey designed for use across conditions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978198864", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2136662125", "title": "The eye and the heart", "text": "The vasculature of the eye and the heart share several common characteristics. The easily accessible vessels of the eye are therefore—to some extent—a window to the heart. There is interplay between cardiovascular functions and risk factors and the occurrence and progression of many eye diseases. In particular, arteriovenous nipping, narrowing of retinal arteries, and the dilatation of retinal veins are important signs of increased cardiovascular risk. The pressure in the dilated veins is often markedly increased due to a dysregulation of venous outflow from the eye. Besides such morphological criteria, functional alterations might be even more relevant and may play an important role in future diagnostics. Via neurovascular coupling, flickering light dilates capillaries and small arterioles, thus inducing endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation of larger retinal vessels. Risk factors for arteriosclerosis, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes, or systemic hypertension, are also risk factors for eye diseases such as retinal arterial or retinal vein occlusions, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and increases in intraocular pressure (IOP). Functional alterations of blood flow are particularly relevant to the eye. The primary vascular dysregulation syndrome (PVD), which often includes systemic hypotension, is associated with disturbed autoregulation of ocular blood flow (OBF). Fluctuation of IOP on a high level or blood pressure on a low level leads to instable OBF and oxygen supply and therefore to oxidative stress, which is particularly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous neuropathy. Vascular dysregulation also leads to a barrier dysfunction and thereby to small retinal haemorrhages.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2136662125", "source": "openalex"}

According to cross-recurrence analysis, a listener's eye movements most closely matched a speaker's eye movements at a delay of 2 sec. Indeed, the more closely a listener's eye movements were coupled with a speaker's, the better the listener did on a comprehension test. In a second experiment, low-level visual cues were used to manipulate the listeners' eye movements, and these, in turn, influenced their latencies to comprehension questions.

This Review aimed to identify all publicly available ophthalmological imaging datasets, detail their accessibility, describe which diseases and populations are represented, and report on the completeness of the associated metadata. With the use of MEDLINE, Google's search engine, and Google Dataset Search, we identified 94 open access datasets containing 507 724 images and 125 videos from 122 364 patients. Most datasets originated from Asia, North America, and Europe. Disease populations were unevenly represented, with glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration disproportionately overrepresented in comparison with other eye diseases. The reporting of basic demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and ethnicity was poor, even at the aggregate level. This Review provides greater visibility for ophthalmological datasets that are publicly available as powerful resources for research. Our paper also exposes an increasing divide in the representation of different population and disease groups in health data repositories. The improved reporting of metadata would enable researchers to access the most appropriate datasets for their needs and maximise the potential of such resources.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3089653673", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional survey of eye disease with retrospective collection of falls data. SETTING: Two postcode areas in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: All people 49 years of age and older were invited to participate, 3654 (82.4%) of 4433 eligible residents took part, and 3299 answered questions about falls. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects had a detailed eye examination and answered questions about health and vision status, use of medication, and number of falls in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: Tests of visual function that had a statistically significant association with two or more falls after adjustment for confounders were visual acuity (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.9 for visual acuity worse than 20/30), contrast sensitivity (PR 1.2 for a 1‐unit decrease at 6 cycles per degree), and suprathreshold visual field screening (PR 1.5 for 5 or more points missing). However, only visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were significantly associated with two or more falls per 1 standard deviation decrease. The presence of posterior subcapsular cataract (PR 2.1) and use of nonmiotic glaucoma medication (PR 2.0) had a statistically significant association with two or more falls; presence of age‐related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and cortical or nuclear cataract did not. CONCLUSION: Visual impairment is strongly associated with two or more falls in older adults. In addition to poor visual acuity, visual factors such as reduced visual field, impaired contrast sensitivity, and the presence of cataract may explain this association.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006646315", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: This study describes the various ophthalmological conditions detected in the Swedish visual screening program for children. Methods: The study was longitudinal and retrospective. All children (3126) born in 1982 in three Swedish municipalities have been followed from birth to ten years of age. Visual acuity was examined at the ages of 4, 5.5, 7 and 10 years. Before the age of 4, a gross examination of the eyes was performed. Results: The prevalence of ametropia in the population was 7.7%, the prevalence of strabismus 3.1%, and the prevalence of organic lesions 0.6%. Seven children (0.2%) were visually handicapped (visual acuity ≤0.3 in the better eye). Refractive errors and microtropias were mainly detected at the age of 4, when the first visual acuity test was performed, while manifest strabismus was in many cases detected before this age. With this screening and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, the prevalence of deep amblyopia (visual acuity ≤0.3) has been reduced from 2% to 0.2%. With treatment, 47% of the amblyopic children achieved a visual acuity better than 0.7. Conclusion: Visual screening is effective in detecting visual and ocular disorders. Most conditions are discovered before the age of 6. Compared to an unscreened population, the prevalence of amblyopia is greatly reduced.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038945437", "source": "openalex"}

A majority of the cells showed significant effects of eye position, for each of the 3 types of response. The direction tuning of the light-sensitive, memory and saccade responses did not change with eye position but the magnitude of the response did. Since previous work showed a similar effect for the light-sensitive response of area 7a neurons (Andersen and Mountcastle, 1983; Andersen et al., 1985b), the present results indicate that this modulating effect of eye position may be a general one, as it is found in 3 types of responses in 2 cortical areas. Gain fields were mapped by measuring the effect of eye position on the magnitude of the response at 9 different eye positions for each neuron. The gain fields were usually planar or largely planar for all 3 types of response in both areas, indicating that the magnitude of the response usually varies linearly with both horizontal and vertical eye position. A similar observation was made previously for the gain fields of the light-sensitive response of area 7a neurons (Andersen et al., 1985b). Although gain fields sloped in all directions for the population of cells, the gain field slopes of the light-sensitive, memory and saccade responses for individual cells were usually similar. It is proposed that these eye position effects play an important role in making coordinate transformations for visually guided movement.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1898788858", "source": "openalex"}

Consequently, studies of the agreement between two instruments or clinical tests have proliferated in the ophthalmic literature. It is important that researchers apply the appropriate statistical tests in agreement studies. Correlation coefficients are hazardous and should be avoided. The ‘limits of agreement’ method originally proposed by Altman and Bland in 1983 is the statistical procedure of choice.

At each wavelength, data were obtained for a number of illuminance levels. All observations were taken at equal accommodation, and corrected for chromatic aberration. If the wavelength-dependent effects of diffraction on the modulation transfer are taken into account, no difference is found between the photopic contrast-sensitivity functions for red, green, or blue. For mean retinal illuminances B0 smaller than 300 td, threshold modulation M at a given frequency is found to increase in proportion to B0-12 (de Vries–Rose law). For B0 greater than 300 td M remains a constant fraction of it (Weber–Fechner law). After separation of the optical modulation transfer of the eye media from the measured psychophysical data, the remaining function can be considered as composed of a neural and a light-diffusion transfer function.

Osmolarity testing, Schirmer test without anesthesia, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal staining, meibomian dysfunction assessment, and conjunctival staining were performed bilaterally. A symptom questionnaire, the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), was also administered to each patient. Distributions of clinical signs and symptoms against a continuous composite severity index were evaluated.Osmolarity was found to have the highest correlation coefficient to disease severity (r(2) = 0.55), followed by conjunctival staining (r(2) = 0.47), corneal staining (r(2) = 0.43), OSDI (r(2) = 0.41), meibomian score (r(2) = 0.37), TBUT (r(2) = 0.30), and Schirmer result (r(2) = 0.17). A comparison of standard threshold-based classification with the composite severity index revealed significant overlap between the disease severities of prospectively defined normal and dry eye groups. Fully 63% of the subjects were found to be poorly classified by combinations of clinical thresholds.Tear film osmolarity was found to be the single best marker of disease severity across normal, mild/moderate, and severe categories. Other tests were found to be informative in the more severe forms of disease; thus, clinical judgment remains an important element in the clinical assessment of dry eye severity.

The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117731089", "source": "openalex"}

These factors and conditions are able to progressively increase water evaporation and faster thinning of the PTF, which causes dryness and dry spot formation on the cornea, possibly followed by corneal and conjunctiva epithelial alterations and eye complaints.

The idea involved is made clear by the diagram fig. 1. The subject applies his eye to the eye-ring E and fixes his eye on the aperture in the diaphragm D. He then sees a photometric field divided into two parts. The lower half is illuminated by light diffused from the opal O, which itself receives light from the lamp S. The rays from this half of the field form a diverging beam which completely fills the pupil of the subject’s eye. The upper half of the field is illuminated by the method of Maxwellian view. An image of the small aperture P is focussed by the lens L on to the middle point of the eye-ring E. This image is only about 1.5 mm. in diameter and all the light is collected by the subject’s eye, provided the pupil of the latter is concentric with the eye-ring and has a diameter exceeding 1.5 mm. A variable graduated neutral wedge W is inserted at the aperture P and this enables the two halves of the photometric field to be adjusted to equality of brightness by the subject.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975862239", "source": "openalex"}

Its deduced amino acid sequence shares greatest homology with cephalopod opsins. The predicted secondary structure of melanopsin indicates the presence of a long cytoplasmic tail with multiple putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that this opsin’s function may be finely regulated. Melanopsin mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic sites thought to contain deep brain photoreceptors and in the iris, a structure known to be directly photosensitive in amphibians. Melanopsin message is also localized in retinal cells residing in the outermost lamina of the inner nuclear layer where horizontal cells are typically found.

In the present study, we investigated effects of word predictability on eye movements (EM) and fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) during natural sentence reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and EM (via video-based eye tracking) were recorded simultaneously while subjects read heterogeneous German sentences, moving their eyes freely over the text. FRPs were time-locked to first-pass reading fixations and analyzed according to the cloze probability of the currently fixated word. We replicated robust effects of word predictability on EMs and the N400 component in FRPs. The data were then used to model the relation among fixation duration, gaze duration, and N400 amplitude, and to trace the time course of EEG effects relative to effects in EM behavior. In an extended Methodological Discussion section, we review 4 technical and data-analytical problems that need to be addressed when FRPs are recorded in free-viewing situations (such as reading, visual search, or scene perception) and propose solutions.

Numerous studies have identified lutein and zeaxanthin to be essential components for eye health. Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoid pigments that impart yellow or orange color to various common foods such as cantaloupe, pasta, corn, carrots, orange/yellow peppers, fish, salmon and eggs. Their role in human health, in particular the health of the eye, is well established from epidemiological, clinical and interventional studies. They constitute the main pigments found in the yellow spot of the human retina which protect the macula from damage by blue light, improve visual acuity and scavenge harmful reactive oxygen species. They have also been linked with reduced risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. Research over the past decade has focused on the development of carotenoid-rich foods to boost their intake especially in the elderly population. The aim of this article is to review recent scientific evidences supporting the benefits of lutein and zexanthin in preventing the onset of two major age-related eye diseases with diets rich in these carotenoids. The review also lists major dietary sources of lutein and zeaxanthin and refers to newly developed foods, daily intake, bioavailability and physiological effects in relation to eye health.

Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory–motor functions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022504012", "source": "openalex"}

Positions of fixations were distributed according to the spatial arrangement of subfeatures in the diagrams. For a particular imagined diagrammatic picture, eye movements were closely correlated with the eye movements recorded while viewing the same picture.

At the same time, the Carnot cycle model developed by the author predicts that the central pressure of mature cyclones is independent of the magnitude of the exchange coefficients. The author presents numerical simulations that prove this last prediction false and suggest that the reason for this failure is the neglect of eye dynamics in the steady-state theory. On this basis, the existing theory is modified to account for eye dynamics, and the predictions of the revised theory are compared to the results of numerical simulations. Both the revised theory and the numerical modeling results, when compared to observations, suggest that the ratio of enthalpy to momentum exchange coefficients in real hurricanes lies in the range 0.75–1.5, contradicting published speculations about the behavior of this ratio at high surface wind speed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001336149", "source": "openalex"}

Strong evidence has implicated the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) in the pathogenesis of this disease.In a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 3 multicenter trial, we assigned patients with active thyroid eye disease in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous infusions of the IGF-IR inhibitor teprotumumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight for the first infusion and 20 mg per kilogram for subsequent infusions) or placebo once every 3 weeks for 21 weeks; the last trial visit for this analysis was at week 24. The primary outcome was a proptosis response (a reduction in proptosis of ≥2 mm) at week 24. Prespecified secondary outcomes at week 24 were an overall response (a reduction of ≥2 points in the Clinical Activity Score plus a reduction in proptosis of ≥2 mm), a Clinical Activity Score of 0 or 1 (indicating no or minimal inflammation), the mean change in proptosis across trial visits (from baseline through week 24), a diplopia response (a reduction in diplopia of ≥1 grade), and the mean change in overall score on the Graves' ophthalmopathy-specific quality-of-life (GO-QOL) questionnaire across trial visits (from baseline through week 24; a mean change of ≥6 points is considered clinically meaningful).A total of 41 patients were assigned to the teprotumumab group and 42 to the placebo group. At week 24, the percentage of patients with a proptosis response was higher with teprotumumab than with placebo (83% [34 patients] vs. 10% [4 patients], P<0.001), with a number needed to treat of 1.36. All secondary outcomes were significantly better with teprotumumab than with placebo, including overall response (78% of patients [32] vs. 7% [3]), Clinical Activity Score of 0 or 1 (59% [24] vs. 21% [9]), the mean change in proptosis (-2.82 mm vs. -0.54 mm), diplopia response (68% [19 of 28] vs. 29% [8 of 28]), and the mean change in GO-QOL overall score (13.79 points vs. 4.43 points) (P≤0.001 for all). Reductions in extraocular muscle, orbital fat volume, or both were observed in 6 patients in the teprotumumab group who underwent orbital imaging. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity; two serious events occurred in the teprotumumab group, of which one (an infusion reaction) led to treatment discontinuation.Among patients with active thyroid eye disease, teprotumumab resulted in better outcomes with respect to proptosis, Clinical Activity Score, diplopia, and quality of life than placebo; serious adverse events were uncommon.

This knowledge, in the final analysis, always depends upon the subjective report of the dreamer, but becomes relatively objective if such reports can be significantly related to some physiological phenomena which in turn can be measured by physical techniques. Such a relationship was reported by Aserinsky and Kleitman (1) who observed periods of rapid, conjugate eye movements during sleep and found a high incidence of dream recall in Ss awakened during these periods and a low incidence when awakened at other times. The occurrence of these characteristic eye movements and their relation to dreaming were confirmed in both normal Ss and schizophrenics (4), and they were shown to appear at regular intervals in relation to a cyclic change in the depth of sleep during the night as measured by the EEC (5). This paper represents the results of a rigorous testing of the relation between eye movements and dreaming.

Since only hand motion directly affects the external world, eye movements are the slave in this system. This eye-hand visuomotor system incorporates closed-loop visual feedback but here we focus on early feedforward mechanisms that allow primates to make spatially accurate reaches. First, we consider how the parietal cortex might store and update gaze-centered representations of reach targets during a sequence of gaze shifts and fixations. Recent evidence suggests that such representations might be compared with hand position signals within this early gaze-centered frame. However, the resulting motor error commands cannot be treated independently of their frame of origin or the frame of their destined motor command. Behavioral experiments show that the brain deals with the nonlinear aspects of such reference frame transformations, and incorporates internal models of the complex linkage geometry of the eye-head-shoulder system. These transformations are modeled as a series of vector displacement commands, rotated by eye and head orientation, and implemented between parietal and frontal cortex through efficient parallel neuronal architectures. Finally, we consider how this reach system might interact with the visually guided grasp system through both parallel and coordinated neural algorithms.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099650267", "source": "openalex"}

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity.Between 1997 and 1998, an International Consensus Group developed four long and four short forms of the IPAQ instruments (administered by telephone interview or self-administration, with two alternate reference periods, either the \"last 7 d\" or a \"usual week\" of recalled physical activity). During 2000, 14 centers from 12 countries collected reliability and/or validity data on at least two of the eight IPAQ instruments. Test-retest repeatability was assessed within the same week. Concurrent (inter-method) validity was assessed at the same administration, and criterion IPAQ validity was assessed against the CSA (now MTI) accelerometer. Spearman's correlation coefficients are reported, based on the total reported physical activity.Overall, the IPAQ questionnaires produced repeatable data (Spearman's rho clustered around 0.8), with comparable data from short and long forms. Criterion validity had a median rho of about 0.30, which was comparable to most other self-report validation studies. The \"usual week\" and \"last 7 d\" reference periods performed similarly, and the reliability of telephone administration was similar to the self-administered mode.The IPAQ instruments have acceptable measurement properties, at least as good as other established self-reports. Considering the diverse samples in this study, IPAQ has reasonable measurement properties for monitoring population levels of physical activity among 18- to 65-yr-old adults in diverse settings. The short IPAQ form \"last 7 d recall\" is recommended for national monitoring and the long form for research requiring more detailed assessment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171129594", "source": "openalex"}

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.

Methods: These results were obtained from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population in the United States. Data are described from 6329 participants who provided at least 1 d of accelerometer data and from 4867 participants who provided four or more days of accelerometer data. Results: Males are more physically active than females. Physical activity declines dramatically across age groups between childhood and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For example, 42% of children ages 6-11 yr obtain the recommended 60 min·d−1 of physical activity, whereas only 8% of adolescents achieve this goal. Among adults, adherence to the recommendation to obtain 30 min·d−1 of physical activity is less than 5%. Conclusions: Objective and subjective measures of physical activity give qualitatively similar results regarding gender and age patterns of activity. However, adherence to physical activity recommendations according to accelerometer-measured activity is substantially lower than according to self-report. Great care must be taken when interpreting self-reported physical activity in clinical practice, public health program design and evaluation, and epidemiological research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010163891", "source": "openalex"}

Compendium of physical activities: an update of activity codes and MET intensities. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 32, No. 9, Suppl., pp. S498–S516, 2000. We provide an updated version of the Compendium of Physical Activities, a coding scheme that classifies specific physical activity (PA) by rate of energy expenditure. It was developed to enhance the comparability of results across studies using self-reports of PA. The Compendium coding scheme links a five-digit code that describes physical activities by major headings (e.g., occupation, transportation, etc.) and specific activities within each major heading with its intensity, defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate (MET). Energy expenditure in MET-minutes, MET-hours, kcal, or kcal per kilogram body weight can be estimated for specific activities by type or MET intensity. Additions to the Compendium were obtained from studies describing daily PA patterns of adults and studies measuring the energy cost of specific physical activities in field settings.

Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations. Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold. Conclusion These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3108106255", "source": "openalex"}

The Position Stand is divided into three sections: Section 1 briefly reviews the structural and functional changes that characterize normal human aging, Section 2 considers the extent to which exercise and physical activity can influence the aging process, and Section 3 summarizes the benefits of both long-term exercise and physical activity and shorter-duration exercise programs on health and functional capacity. Although no amount of physical activity can stop the biological aging process, there is evidence that regular exercise can minimize the physiological effects of an otherwise sedentary lifestyle and increase active life expectancy by limiting the development and progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions. There is also emerging evidence for significant psychological and cognitive benefits accruing from regular exercise participation by older adults. Ideally, exercise prescription for older adults should include aerobic exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and flexibility exercises. The evidence reviewed in this Position Stand is generally consistent with prior American College of Sports Medicine statements on the types and amounts of physical activity recommended for older adults as well as the recently published 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. All older adults should engage in regular physical activity and avoid an inactive lifestyle.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084254617", "source": "openalex"}

The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation. Primary Recommendation: To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

We provide the second update of the Compendium, called the 2011 Compendium. Methods: The 2011 Compendium retains the previous coding scheme to identify the major category headings and specific PA by their rate of energy expenditure in MET. Modifications in the 2011 Compendium include cataloging measured MET values and their source references, when available; addition of new codes and specific activities; an update of the Compendium tracking guide that links information in the 1993, 2000, and 2011 compendia versions; and the creation of a Web site to facilitate easy access and downloading of Compendium documents. Measured MET values were obtained from a systematic search of databases using defined key words. Results: The 2011 Compendium contains 821 codes for specific activities. Two hundred seventeen new codes were added, 68% (561/821) of which have measured MET values. Approximately half (317/604) of the codes from the 2000 Compendium were modified to improve the definitions and/or to consolidate specific activities and to update estimated MET values where measured values did not exist. Updated MET values accounted for 73% of all code changes. Conclusions: The Compendium is used globally to quantify the energy cost of PA in adults for surveillance activities, research studies, and, in clinical settings, to write PA recommendations and to assess energy expenditure in individuals. The 2011 Compendium is an update of a system for quantifying the energy cost of adult human PA and is a living document that is moving in the direction of being 100% evidence based.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2074276081", "source": "openalex"}

Background Understanding the factors that influence physical activity can aid the design of more effective interventions. Previous reviews of correlates of youth physical activity have produced conflicting results. Methods A comprehensive review of correlates of physical activity was conducted, and semiquantitative results were summarized separately for children (ages 3–12) and adolescents (ages 13–18). The 108 studies evaluated 40 variables for children and 48 variables for adolescents. Results About 60% of all reported associations with physical activity were statistically significant. Variables that were consistently associated with children's physical activity were sex (male), parental overweight status, physical activity preferences, intention to be active, perceived barriers (inverse), previous physical activity, healthy diet, program/facility access, and time spent outdoors. Variables that were consistently associated with adolescents' physical activity were sex (male), ethnicity (white), age (inverse), perceived activity competence, intentions, depression (inverse), previous physical activity, community sports, sensation seeking, sedentary after school and on weekends (inverse), parent support, support from others, sibling physical activity, direct help from parents, and opportunities to exercise.

This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2169239645", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of parental feeding styles and young children's evening food intake in a multiethnic sample of families in Head Start.Participants were 715 Head Start children and their parents from Texas and Alabama representing three ethnic groups: African-American (43%), Hispanic (29%), and White (28%). The Caregivers Feeding Styles Questionnaire (Hughes) was used to characterize authoritative, authoritarian (referent), indulgent or uninvolved feeding styles. Food intake in several food groups was calculated from 3 days of dietary recalls for the child for evening food intakes from 3 PM until bedtime.Compared to children of authoritarian parents, intakes of fruits, juice and vegetables were lowest among children of indulgent or uninvolved parents (1.77 +/- 0.09 vs 1.45 +/- 0.09 and 1.42 +/- 0.11 cups) as were intakes of dairy foods (0.84 +/- 0.05 vs 0.67 +/- 0.05 and 0.63+0.06 cups), respectively.Findings suggest that permissive parent feeding styles like indulgent or uninvolved relate negatively to children's intake of nutrient-rich foods fruit, 100% fruit juice, vegetables and dairy foods from 3 PM until bedtime.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2040106495", "source": "openalex"}

In this overview of today's physical cosmology, P.J.E. Peebles shows how observation has combined with theoretical elements to establish the subject as a mature science, while he also discusses the most notable recent attempts to understand the origin and structure of the universe. A successor to Peebles's classic volume Physical Cosmology (Princeton, 1971), the book is a comprehensive overview addressed not only to students but also to scientists active in fields outside cosmology. The first chapter of the work presents the elements of physical cosmology, including the history of the discovery of the expanding universe. The second, on the cosmological tests that measure the geometry of spacetime, discusses general relativity theory as the basis for the tests, and then surveys the broad variety of ways the tests can be applied with the new generations of telescopes and detectors. The third chapter deals with the origin of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe, and reviews ideas about how the evolution of the universe might be traced back to very early epochs when structure originated. Each section of these chapters begins with an introduction that can be understood with no special knowledge beyond undergraduate physics, and then progresses to more specialized topics. P.J.E.

Literature searches were conducted using predefined keywords in 6 key databases. A total of 11,088 potential papers were identified. The abstracts and full-text articles of potentially relevant papers were screened to determine eligibility. Data was abstracted for 113 outcomes from the 86 eligible papers. The evidence was graded for each health outcome using established criteria based on the quantity and quality of studies and strength of effect. The volume, intensity, and type of physical activity were considered.Physical activity was associated with numerous health benefits. The dose-response relations observed in observational studies indicate that the more physical activity, the greater the health benefit. Results from experimental studies indicate that even modest amounts of physical activity can have health benefits in high-risk youngsters (e.g., obese). To achieve substantive health benefits, the physical activity should be of at least a moderate intensity. Vigorous intensity activities may provide even greater benefit. Aerobic-based activities had the greatest health benefit, other than for bone health, in which case high-impact weight bearing activities were required.The following recommendations were made: 1) Children and youth 5-17 years of age should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes per day and up to several hours of at least moderate intensity physical activity. Some of the health benefits can be achieved through an average of 30 minutes per day. [Level 2, Grade A]. 2) More vigorous intensity activities should be incorporated or added when possible, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone [Level 3, Grade B]. 3) Aerobic activities should make up the majority of the physical activity.

Common risk factors for vascular disease in people with diabetes, specifically type 2 diabetes, include hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, tobacco use, and obesity. Mechanisms for vascular disease in diabetes include the pathologic effects of advanced glycation end product accumulation, impaired vasodilatory response attributable to nitric oxide inhibition, smooth muscle cell dysfunction, overproduction of endothelial growth factors, chronic inflammation, hemodynamic dysregulation, impaired fibrinolytic ability, and enhanced platelet aggregation.

Age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates declined across physical fitness quintiles from 64.0 per 10 000 person-years in the least-fit men to 18.6 per 10 000 person-years in the most-fit men (slope, —4.5). Corresponding values for women were 39.5 per 10 000 person-years to 8.5 per 10 000 person-years (slope, —5.5). These trends remained after statistical adjustment for age, smoking habit, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose level, parental history of coronary heart disease, and follow-up interval. Lower mortality rates in higher fitness categories also were seen for cardiovascular disease and cancer of combined sites. Attributable risk estimates for all-cause mortality indicated that low physical fitness was an important risk factor in both men and women. Higher levels of physical fitness appear to delay all-cause mortality primarily due to lowered rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, PEDro, EMBASE and DocOnline were searched for controlled studies. Physical therapy was divided into 10 intervention categories, which were analysed separately. If statistical pooling (weighted summary effect sizes) was not possible due to lack of comparability between interventions, patient characteristics and measures of outcome, a bestresearch synthesis was performed. This best-research synthesis was based on methodological quality (PEDro score). Results: In total, 151 studies were included in this systematic review; 123 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 28 controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Methodological quality of all RCTs had a median of 5 points on the 10-point PEDro scale (range 2–8 points). Based on high-quality RCTs strong evidence was found in favour of task-oriented exercise training to restore balance and gait, and for strengthening the lower paretic limb. Summary effect sizes (SES) for functional outcomes ranged from 0.13 (95% CI 0.03–0.23) for effects of high intensity of exercise training to 0.92 (95% CI 0.54–1.29) for improving symmetry when moving from sitting to standing. Strong evidence was also found for therapies that were focused on functional training of the upper limb such as constraint-induced movement therapy (SES 0.46; 95% CI 0.07–0.91), treadmill training with or without body weight support, respectively 0.70 (95% CI 0.29–1.10) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.56–1.61), aerobics (SES 0.39; 95% CI 0.05–0.74), external auditory rhythms during gait (SES 0.91; 95% CI 0.40–1.42) and neuromuscular stimulation for glenohumeral subluxation (SES 1.41; 95% CI 0.76–2.06). No or insufficient evidence in terms of functional outcome was found for: traditional neurological treatment approaches; exercises for the upper limb; biofeedback; functional and neuromuscular electrical stimulation aimed at improving dexterity or gait performance; orthotics and assistive devices; and physical therapy interventions for reducing hemiplegic shoulder pain and hand oedema. Conclusions: This review showed small to large effect sizes for task-oriented exercise training, in particular when applied intensively and early after stroke onset.

In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order ${\\mathit{N}}_{\\mathrm{atoms}}^{3}$ operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ``metric'' and a special ``preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order ${\\mathit{N}}_{\\mathrm{atoms}}^{2}$ scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach ${\\mathit{N}}_{\\mathrm{atoms}}$. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. \\textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2083222334", "source": "openalex"}

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis", "text": "Background Physical therapy (PT) is one of the key disciplines in interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an update of the evidence for stroke rehabilitation interventions in the domain of PT. Methods and Findings Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding PT in stroke rehabilitation were retrieved through a systematic search. Outcomes were classified according to the ICF. RCTs with a low risk of bias were quantitatively analyzed. Differences between phases poststroke were explored in subgroup analyses. A best evidence synthesis was performed for neurological treatment approaches. The search yielded 467 RCTs (N = 25373; median PEDro score 6 [IQR 5–7]), identifying 53 interventions. No adverse events were reported. Strong evidence was found for significant positive effects of 13 interventions related to gait, 11 interventions related to arm-hand activities, 1 intervention for ADL, and 3 interventions for physical fitness. Summary Effect Sizes (SESs) ranged from 0.17 (95%CI 0.03–0.70; I2 = 0%) for therapeutic positioning of the paretic arm to 2.47 (95%CI 0.84–4.11; I2 = 77%) for training of sitting balance. There is strong evidence that a higher dose of practice is better, with SESs ranging from 0.21 (95%CI 0.02–0.39; I2 = 6%) for motor function of the paretic arm to 0.61 (95%CI 0.41–0.82; I2 = 41%) for muscle strength of the paretic leg. Subgroup analyses yielded significant differences with respect to timing poststroke for 10 interventions. Neurological treatment approaches to training of body functions and activities showed equal or unfavorable effects when compared to other training interventions. Main limitations of the present review are not using individual patient data for meta-analyses and absence of correction for multiple testing. Conclusions There is strong evidence for PT interventions favoring intensive high repetitive task-oriented and task-specific training in all phases poststroke.

Recently, emphasis has been placed not only on changes beyond expected measurement error, but also on the identification of changes that make a real difference in the lives of patients and families. This article will highlight a case example of how to determine and interpret “clinically significant change” from both of these perspectives. The authors also examine how to use item maps within an item response theory model to enhance the interpretation of change at a content level. Recommendations are provided for physical therapists who are interpreting changes in the context of clinical practice, case reports, and intervention research. These recommendations include a greater application of indexes that help interpret the meaning of clinically significant change to multiple clinical, research, consumer, and payer communities.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126715252", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose To review and update the evidence relating to the personal, social, and environmental factors associated with physical activity (PA) in adults. Methods Systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to identify papers published between 1998 and 2000 with PA (and including exercise and exercise adherence). Qualitative reports or case studies were not included. Results Thirty-eight new studies were located. Most confirmed the existence of factors already known to be correlates of PA. Changes in status were noted in relation to the influence of marital status, obesity, smoking, lack of time, past exercise behavior, and eight environmental variables. New studies were located which focused on previously understudied population groups such as minorities, middle and older aged adults, and the disabled. Conclusion The newly reported studies tend to take a broader \"ecological\" approach to understanding the correlates of PA and are more focused on environmental factors. There remains a need to better understand environmental influences and the factors that influence different types of PA. As most of the work in this field still relies on cross-sectional studies, longitudinal and intervention studies will be required if causal relationships are to be inferred.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995890858", "source": "openalex"}

Data Sources and Study Selection: Using keywords critical care and physical therapy and related synonyms, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were identified through electronic database searches and citation tracking. Clinical trials with outcomes of mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, physical function and quality of life, muscle strength, and ventilator-free days were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers abstracted data and assessed quality independently. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. From 3,126 screened abstracts, 10 randomized controlled trials and five reviews were found. The mean Physiotherapy Evidence Database score was 5.4. Overall there was a significant positive effect favoring physical therapy for the critically ill to improve the quality of life (g = 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.08, 0.71), physical function (g = 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.78), peripheral muscle strength (g = 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.02, 0.52), and respiratory muscle strength (g = 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.12, 0.89). Length of hospital (g = –0.34, 95% confidence interval –0.53, –0.15) and ICU stay (g = –0.34, 95% confidence interval –0.51, –0.18) significantly decreased and ventilator-free days increased (g = 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.16, 0.59) following physical therapy in the ICU. There was no effect on mortality. Conclusion: Physical therapy in the ICU appears to confer significant benefit in improving quality of life, physical function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, increasing ventilator-free days, and decreasing hospital and ICU stay. However, further controlled trials of better quality and larger sample sizes are required to verify the strength of these tentative associations.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051978755", "source": "openalex"}

Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138087132", "source": "openalex"}

We investigated whether patient compliance was related to characteristics of the patient or the patient's illness, to the patient's attitude, or to the physical therapist's behavior.Of a random sample of 300 physical therapists in private practice in the Netherlands, 222 therapists responded to a questionnaire survey. Eighty-four respondents also made audio recordings. Materials of the study were 1,931 registration forms, 1,837 audio-recorded sessions of physical therapy sessions, and 1,681 patient questionnaires.The results show that the three main factors related to noncompliance were (1) the barriers patients perceive and encounter, (2) the lack of positive feedback, and (3) the degree of helplessness. The first factor, the barriers patients perceive and encounter, shows the strongest relation with noncompliance. The results also show that noncompliance is more strongly related to the characteristics of the illness than to the illness, a bad prognosis is negatively related to compliance, and much hindrance of the complaint is positively related to compliance. There was no difference between men and women with regard to patient compliance, but less educated patients were slightly more compliant than more highly educated patients.These correlational findings can be used to formulate hypotheses of cause and effect in future clinical research. Future research should take into account the type and efficacy of therapeutic exercise for different diseases. For physical therapy practice, it seems important that physical therapists carefully explore which problems patients encounter in their efforts to comply and that they seek solutions to those problems in mutual cooperation with their patients.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151216902", "source": "openalex"}

This study systematically reviewed the literature to determine the extent of agreement between subjectively (self-report e.g. questionnaire, diary) and objectively (directly measured; e.g. accelerometry, doubly labeled water) assessed physical activity in adults.Eight electronic databases were searched to identify observational and experimental studies of adult populations. Searching identified 4,463 potential articles. Initial screening found that 293 examined the relationship between self-reported and directly measured physical activity and met the eligibility criteria. Data abstraction was completed for 187 articles, which described comparable data and/or comparisons, while 76 articles lacked comparable data or comparisons, and a further 30 did not meet the review's eligibility requirements. A risk of bias assessment was conducted for all articles from which data was abstracted.Correlations between self-report and direct measures were generally low-to-moderate and ranged from -0.71 to 0.96. No clear pattern emerged for the mean differences between self-report and direct measures of physical activity. Trends differed by measure of physical activity employed, level of physical activity measured, and the gender of participants. Results of the risk of bias assessment indicated that 38% of the studies had lower quality scores.The findings suggest that the measurement method may have a significant impact on the observed levels of physical activity. Self-report measures of physical activity were both higher and lower than directly measured levels of physical activity, which poses a problem for both reliance on self-report measures and for attempts to correct for self-report - direct measure differences. This review reveals the need for valid, accurate and reliable measures of physical activity in evaluating current and changing physical activity levels, physical activity interventions, and the relationships between physical activity and health outcomes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118409616", "source": "openalex"}

Most international guidelines recommend a goal of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Many agencies have translated these recommendations to indicate that this volume of activity is the minimum required for health benefits. However, recent evidence has challenged this threshold-centered messaging as it may not be evidence-based and may create an unnecessary barrier to those who might benefit greatly from simply becoming more active. This systematic review evaluates recent systematic reviews that have examined the relationship between physical activity and health status. Recent findings Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses (based largely on epidemiological studies consisting of large cohorts) have demonstrated a dose–response relationship between physical activity and premature mortality and the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic medical conditions. The relationships between physical activity and health outcomes are generally curvilinear such that marked health benefits are observed with relatively minor volumes of physical activity. Summary These findings challenge current threshold-based messaging related to physical activity and health. They emphasize that clinically relevant health benefits can be accrued by simply becoming more physically active. https://links.lww.com/HCO/A42.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2734579447", "source": "openalex"}

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z &amp;lt; 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02−0.01 (random)+0.14−0.42 (systematic) h7010−2 M⊙ yr−1 Mpc−3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010–1011 M⊙), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* &amp;gt; 1010 M⊙. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005−0.002 (random)+0.029−0.090 (systematic)h−170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7−1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-Å break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2166365370", "source": "openalex"}

Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported. Methods The keywords \"IPAQ\", \"validation\", and \"validity\" were searched in PubMed and Scopus. Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included. Results Twenty-three validation studies were included in this review. There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar. Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures). Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard. Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion. In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent. Conclusions The correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard. Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent.

Their physical depth-dose distribution in tissue is characterized by a small entrance dose and a distinct maximum (Bragg peak) near the end of range with a sharp fall-off at the distal edge. Taking full advantage of the well-defined range and the small lateral beam spread, modern scanning beam systems allow delivery of the dose with millimeter precision. In addition, projectiles heavier than protons such as carbon ions exhibit an enhanced biological effectiveness in the Bragg peak region caused by the dense ionization of individual particle tracks resulting in reduced cellular repair. This makes them particularly attractive for the treatment of radio-resistant tumors localized near organs at risk. While tumor therapy with protons is a well-established treatment modality with more than 60 000 patients treated worldwide, the application of heavy ions is so far restricted to a few facilities only. Nevertheless, results of clinical phase I-II trials provide evidence that carbon-ion radiotherapy might be beneficial in several tumor entities. This article reviews the progress in heavy-ion therapy, including physical and technical developments, radiobiological studies and models, as well as radiooncological studies.

Videotapes made during selected therapist-patient treatment sessions were used as a stimulus for the expert therapist interviews. Data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed through the development of 12 case reports and 4 composite case studies, one for each specialty area.A theoretical model of expert practice in physical therapy was developed that included 4 dimensions: (1) a dynamic, multidimensional knowledge base that is patient-centered and evolves through therapist reflection, (2) a clinical reasoning process that is embedded in a collaborative, problem-solving venture with the patient, (3) a central focus on movement assessment linked to patient function, and (4) consistent virtues seen in caring and commitment to patients.These findings build on previous research in physical therapy on expertise. The dimensions of expert practice in physical therapy have implications for physical therapy practice, education, and continued research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114978696", "source": "openalex"}

We randomly assigned 351 patients to surgery and postoperative physical therapy or to a standardized physical-therapy regimen (with the option to cross over to surgery at the discretion of the patient and surgeon). The patients were evaluated at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was the difference between the groups with respect to the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical-function score (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms) 6 months after randomization.In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean improvement in the WOMAC score after 6 months was 20.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.9 to 23.9) in the surgical group and 18.5 (95% CI, 15.6 to 21.5) in the physical-therapy group (mean difference, 2.4 points; 95% CI, -1.8 to 6.5). At 6 months, 51 active participants in the study who were assigned to physical therapy alone (30%) had undergone surgery, and 9 patients assigned to surgery (6%) had not undergone surgery. The results at 12 months were similar to those at 6 months. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups.In the intention-to-treat analysis, we did not find significant differences between the study groups in functional improvement 6 months after randomization; however, 30% of the patients who were assigned to physical therapy alone underwent surgery within 6 months.

Men who improved from unfit to fit between the first and subsequent examinations had an age-adjusted death rate of 67.7/10,000 man-years. This is a reduction in mortality risk of 44% (95% confidence interval, 25% to 59%) relative to men who remained unfit at both examinations. Improvement in fitness was associated with lower death rates after adjusting for age, health status, and other risk factors of premature mortality. For each minute increase in maximal treadmill time between examinations, there was a corresponding 7.9% (P = .001) decrease in risk of mortality. Similar results were seen when the group was stratified by health status, and for cardiovascular disease mortality.Men who maintained or improved adequate physical fitness were less likely to die from all causes and from cardiovascular disease during follow-up than persistently unfit men.

Beneficial interventions may decrease the disability associated with osteoarthritis and the need for more invasive treatments. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee, applied by experienced physical therapists with formal training in manual therapy. Design: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient physical therapy department of a large military medical center. Patients: 83 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were randomly assigned to receive treatment (n = 42; 15 men and 27 women [mean age, 60 ± 11 years]) or placebo (n = 41; 19 men and 22 women [mean age, 62 ± 10 years]). Intervention: The treatment group received manual therapy, applied to the knee as well as to the lumbar spine, hip, and ankle as required, and performed a standardized knee exercise program in the clinic and at home. The placebo group had subtherapeutic ultrasound to the knee at an intensity of 0.1 W/cm2 with a 10% pulsed mode. Both groups were treated at the clinic twice weekly for 4 weeks. Measurements: Distance walked in 6 minutes and sum of the function, pain, and stiffness subscores of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). A tester who was blinded to group assignment made group comparisons at the initial visit (before initiation of treatment), 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 year. Results: Clinically and statistically significant improvements in 6-minute walk distance and WOMAC score at 4 weeks and 8 weeks were seen in the treatment group but not the placebo group. By 8 weeks, average 6-minute walk distances had improved by 13.1% and WOMAC scores had improved by 55.8% over baseline values in the treatment group (P < 0.05). After controlling for potential confounding variables, the average distance walked in 6 minutes at 8 weeks among patients in the treatment group was 170 m (95% CI, 71 to 270 m) more than that in the placebo group and the average WOMAC scores were 599 mm higher (95% CI, 197 to 1002 mm). At 1 year, patients in the treatment group had clinically and statistically significant gains over baseline WOMAC scores and walking distance; 20% of patients in the placebo group and 5% of patients in the treatment group had undergone knee arthroplasty.

Data were pooled using random-effects calculations, and meta-regression was performed.ResultsOur searches identified 2246 citations; 26 studies with a total of 2767 participants met inclusion criteria (8 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 18 observational studies). The participants' mean (SD) age was 49 (9) years and 85% were women. The mean intervention duration was 18 weeks. In the RCTs, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2491 steps per day more than control participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day, P &lt; .001). Among the observational studies, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2183 steps per day over baseline (95% CI, 1571-2796 steps per day, P &lt; .0001). Overall, pedometer users increased their physical activity by 26.9% over baseline. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a step goal such as 10 000 steps per day (P = .001). When data from all studies were combined, pedometer users significantly decreased their body mass index by 0.38 (95% CI, 0.05-0.72; P = .03). This decrease was associated with older age (P = .001) and having a step goal (P = .04). Intervention participants significantly decreased their systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.7-5.9 mm Hg, P &lt; .001). This decrease was associated with greater baseline systolic blood pressure (P = .009) and change in steps per day (P = .08).ConclusionsThe results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure.

Recommendations and precautions vary depending on individual characteristics and health status. In this Position Statement, we provide a clinically oriented review and evidence-based recommendations regarding physical activity and exercise in people with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and prediabetes. Physical activity includes all movement that increases energy use, whereas exercise is planned, structured physical activity. Exercise improves blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, contributes to weight loss, and improves well-being (1,2). Regular exercise may prevent or delay type 2 diabetes development (3). Regular exercise also has considerable health benefits for people with type 1 diabetes (e.g., improved cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, insulin sensitivity, etc.) (4). The challenges related to blood glucose management vary with diabetes type, activity type, and presence of diabetes-related complications (5,6). Physical activity and exercise recommendations, therefore, should be tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual. Physical activity recommendations and precautions may vary by diabetes type. The primary types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes (5%–10% of cases) results from cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cells, producing insulin deficiency (7). Although it can occur at any age, β-cell destruction rates vary, typically occurring more rapidly in youth than in adults. Type 2 diabetes (90%–95% of cases) results from a progressive loss of insulin secretion, usually also with insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs during pregnancy, with screening typically occurring at 24–28 weeks of gestation in pregnant women not previously known to have diabetes.

Accordingly, research on exercise motivation from the perspective of self-determination theory (SDT) has grown considerably in recent years. Previous reviews have been mostly narrative and theoretical. Aiming at a more comprehensive review of empirical data, this article examines the empirical literature on the relations between key SDT-based constructs and exercise and physical activity behavioral outcomes. This systematic review includes 66 empirical studies published up to June 2011, including experimental, cross-sectional, and prospective studies that have measured exercise causality orientations, autonomy/need support and need satisfaction, exercise motives (or goal contents), and exercise self-regulations and motivation. We also studied SDT-based interventions aimed at increasing exercise behavior. In all studies, actual or self-reported exercise/physical activity, including attendance, was analyzed as the dependent variable. Findings are summarized based on quantitative analysis of the evidence. The results show consistent support for a positive relation between more autonomous forms of motivation and exercise, with a trend towards identified regulation predicting initial/short-term adoption more strongly than intrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation being more predictive of long-term exercise adherence. The literature is also consistent in that competence satisfaction and more intrinsic motives positively predict exercise participation across a range of samples and settings. Mixed evidence was found concerning the role of other types of motives (e.g., health/fitness and body-related), and also the specific nature and consequences of introjected regulation. The majority of studies have employed descriptive (i.e., non-experimental) designs but similar results are found across cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental designs. Overall, the literature provides good evidence for the value of SDT in understanding exercise behavior, demonstrating the importance of autonomous (identified and intrinsic) regulations in fostering physical activity. Nevertheless, there remain some inconsistencies and mixed evidence with regard to the relations between specific SDT constructs and exercise. Particular limitations concerning the different associations explored in the literature are discussed in the context of refining the application of SDT to exercise and physical activity promotion, and integrating these with avenues for future research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120612383", "source": "openalex"}

The premise of this perspective is that physical therapy for people with PD relies on clinicians having: (1) up-to-date knowledge of the pathogenesis of movement disorders, (2) the ability to recognize common movement disorders in people with PD, (3) the ability to implement a basic management plan according to a person's stage of disability, and (4) problem-solving skills that enable treatment plans to be tailored to individual needs. This article will present a model of physical therapy management for people with idiopathic PD based on contemporary knowledge of the pathogenesis of movement disorders in basal ganglia disease as well as a review of the evidence for physical therapy interventions. The model advocates a task-specific approach to training, with emphasis on treating people with PD-related movement disorders such as hypokinesia and postural instability within the context of functional tasks of everyday living such as walking, turning over in bed, and manipulating objects. The effects of medication, cognitive impairment, the environment, and coexisting medical conditions are also taken into consideration. An argument is put forward that clinicians need to identify core elements of physical therapy training that apply to all people with PD as well as elements specific to the needs of each individual.

However, there is a very high cost attributed to mental disorders and illness and in the last 15 years there has been increasing research into the role of exercise a) in the treatment of mental health, and b) in improving mental well-being in the general population. There are now several hundred studies and over 30 narrative or meta-analytic reviews of research in this field. These have summarised the potential for exercise as a therapy for clinical or subclinical depression or anxiety, and the use of physical activity as a means of upgrading life quality through enhanced self-esteem, improved mood states, reduced state and trait anxiety, resilience to stress, or improved sleep. The purpose of this paper is to a) provide an updated view of this literature within the context of public health promotion and b) investigate evidence for physical activity and dietary interactions affecting mental well-being.Narrative review and summary.Sufficient evidence now exists for the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of clinical depression. Additionally, exercise has a moderate reducing effect on state and trait anxiety and can improve physical self-perceptions and in some cases global self-esteem. Also there is now good evidence that aerobic and resistance exercise enhances mood states, and weaker evidence that exercise can improve cognitive function (primarily assessed by reaction time) in older adults. Conversely, there is little evidence to suggest that exercise addiction is identifiable in no more than a very small percentage of exercisers. Together, this body of research suggests that moderate regular exercise should be considered as a viable means of treating depression and anxiety and improving mental well-being in the general public.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125840381", "source": "openalex"}

An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system.

He maintains at the outset that the importance of a physical law is not how clever we are to have found it out, but...how clever nature is to pay attention to it, and tends his discussions toward a final exposition of the elegance and simplicity of all scientific laws. Rather than an essay on the most significant achievements in modern science, The Character of Physical Law is a statement of what is most remarkable in nature. Feynman's enlightened approach, his wit, and his enthusiasm make this a memorable exposition of the scientist's craft.The Law of Gravitation is the author's principal example. Relating the details of its discovery and stressing its mathematical character, he uses it to demonstrate the essential interaction of mathematics and physics. He views mathematics as the key to any system of scientific laws, suggesting that if it were possible to fill out the structure of scientific theory completely, the result would be an integrated set of mathematical axioms. The principles of conservation, symmetry, and time-irreversibility are then considered in relation to developments in classical and modern physics, and in his final lecture Feynman develops his own analysis of the process and future of scientific discovery.Like any set of oral reflections, The Character of Physical Law has special value as a demonstration of the mind in action. The reader is particularly lucky in Richard Feynman.

These Guidelines, published every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The ACS Guidelines include recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or interferes with healthy behaviors. Community efforts are essential to create a social environment that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity. Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. This recommendation for community action recognizes that a supportive social environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. The ACS Guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association forthe prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services' 2005 Dietary Guidelinesfor Americans.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031306701", "source": "openalex"}

DesignInterventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults were systematically reviewed.Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 BC techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically-derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression. Main Outcome MeasuresValid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating. ResultsThe 122 evaluations (N = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.36) (I 2 = 69%).The technique, \"self-monitoring\", explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13%).Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 versus 0.26).

The walls that form and partition dividing cells are modified chemically and structurally from the walls expanding to provide a cell with its functional form. In grasses, the chemical structure of the wall differs from that of all other flowering plant species that have been examined. Nevertheless, both types of wall must conform to the same physical laws. Cell expansion occurs via strictly regulated reorientation of each of the wall's components that first permits the wall to stretch in specific directions and then lock into final shape. This review integrates information on the chemical structure of individual polymers with data obtained from new techniques used to probe the arrangement of the polymers within the walls of individual cells. We provide structural models of two distinct types of walls in flowering plants consistent with the physical properties of the wall and its components.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159080918", "source": "openalex"}

The authors review developments in the extraction of information of physical importance from such measurements. They discuss methods for (1) separating the signal of physical interest from contamination (\"noise reduction\"), (2) constructing an appropriate state space or phase space for the data in which the full structure of the strange attractor associated with the chaotic observations is unfolded, (3) evaluating invariant properties of the dynamics such as dimensions, Lyapunov exponents, and topological characteristics, and (4) model making, local and global, for prediction and other goals. They briefly touch on the effects of linearly filtering data before analyzing it as a chaotic time series. Controlling chaotic physical systems and using them to synchronize and possibly communicate between source and receiver is considered. Finally, chaos in space-time systems, that is, the dynamics of fields, is briefly considered. While much is now known about the analysis of observed temporal chaos, spatio-temporal chaotic systems pose new challenges. The emphasis throughout the review is on the tools one now has for the realistic study of measured data in laboratory and field settings. It is the goal of this review to bring these tools into general use among physicists who study classical and semiclassical systems. Much of the progress in studying chaotic systems has rested on computational tools with some underlying rigorous mathematics. Heuristic and intuitive analysis tools guided by this mathematics and realizable on existing computers constitute the core of this review.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2044257293", "source": "openalex"}

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020999234", "source": "openalex"}

The current epidemic of obesity is caused largely by an environment that promotes excessive food intake and discourages physical activity. This chapter reviews what is known about environmental influences on physical activity and eating behaviors. Recent trends in food supply, eating out, physical activity, and inactivity are reviewed, as are the effects of advertising, promotion, and pricing on eating and physical activity. Public health interventions, opportunities, and potential strategies to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting an environment that supports healthy eating and physical activity are discussed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103460148", "source": "openalex"}

A total of 1413 alumni died during 12 to 16 years of follow-up (1962 to 1978). Exercise reported as walking, stair climbing, and sports play related inversely to total mortality, primarily to death due to cardiovascular or respiratory causes. Death rates declined steadily as energy expended on such activity increased from less than 500 to 3500 kcal per week, beyond which rates increased slightly. Rates were one quarter to one third lower among alumni expending 2000 or more kcal during exercise per week than among less active men. With or without consideration of hypertension, cigarette smoking, extremes or gains in body weight, or early parental death, alumni mortality rates were significantly lower among the physically active. Relative risks of death for individuals were highest among cigarette smokers and men with hypertension, and attributable risks in the community were highest among smokers and sedentary men.

Thirty-three children wore both accelerometers and a COSMED portable metabolic system during 15 min of rest and then performed up to nine different activities for 7 min each, on two separate days in the laboratory. Oxygen consumption was measured on a breath-by-breath basis, and accelerometer data were collected in 15-s epochs. Using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, cutpoints that maximised both sensitivity and specificity were determined for sedentary, moderate and vigorous activities. For both accelerometers, discrimination of sedentary behaviour was almost perfect, with the area under the ROC curve at or exceeding 0.98. For both the ActiGraph and Actical, the discrimination of moderate (0.85 and 0.86, respectively) and vigorous activity (0.83 and 0.86, respectively) was acceptable, but not as precise as for sedentary behaviour.

Understanding factors that influence patients’ adherence to HBPTs could help practitioners support better adherence. Research to date has focussed largely on clinic-based physiotherapy. The objective of this review, therefore, was to identify specific factors, which influence adherence to home-based, self-managed physical therapies.Method: A systematic review was conducted, in which eight online databases were searched using combinations of key terms relating to physical therapies, adherence and predictors. Matching records were screened against eligibility criteria and 30 quantitative articles were quality assessed and included in the final review. Relevant data were extracted and a narrative synthesis approach was taken to aggregating findings across studies.Results: There was relatively strong evidence that the following factors predicted adherence to HBPTs: intention to engage in the HBPT, self-motivation, self-efficacy, previous adherence to exercise-related behaviours and social support.Conclusions: This review has identified a range of factors that appear to be related to patients’ adherence to their self-managed physical rehabilitation therapies. Awareness of these factors may inform design of interventions to improve adherence.Implications for RehabilitationNon-adherence to physical rehabilitation therapies is often high – particularly in self-managed, home-based programmes, despite good adherence being important in achieving positive outcomes.The findings of this systematic review indicate that greater self-efficacy, self-motivation, social support, intentions and previous adherence to physical therapies predict higher adherence to HBPTs.Assessment of these domains before providing individuals with their HBPT regimes may allow identification of ‘risk factors’ for poor adherence. These can then potentially be addressed or managed prior to, or alongside, the therapy.Interventions to support patients’ self-managed physical rehabilitation should include elements designed to enhance patients’ self-efficacy, self-motivation and social support given the evidence that these factors are good predictors of adherence.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2341079968", "source": "openalex"}

Given that that emerging physical systems are using DNNs in safety-critical situations, adversarial examples could mislead these systems and cause dangerous situations. Therefore, understanding adversarial examples in the physical world is an important step towards developing resilient learning algorithms. We propose a general attack algorithm, Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2), to generate robust visual adversarial perturbations under different physical conditions. Using the real-world case of road sign classification, we show that adversarial examples generated using RP2 achieve high targeted misclassification rates against standard-architecture road sign classifiers in the physical world under various environmental conditions, including viewpoints. Due to the current lack of a standardized testing method, we propose a two-stage evaluation methodology for robust physical adversarial examples consisting of lab and field tests. Using this methodology, we evaluate the efficacy of physical adversarial manipulations on real objects. With a perturbation in the form of only black and white stickers, we attack a real stop sign, causing targeted misclassification in 100% of the images obtained in lab settings, and in 84.8% of the captured video frames obtained on a moving vehicle (field test) for the target classifier.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2798302089", "source": "openalex"}

The results were supplemented with clinical expertise and patient values and translated into practice recommendations, developed according to international standards for guideline development. A systematic literature search yielded 6 systematic reviews and 23 randomized controlled trials of moderate methodological quality with sufficient data. Six specific core areas for physical therapy were identified: transfers, posture, reaching and grasping, balance, gait, and physical capacity. We extracted four specific treatment recommendations that were based on evidence from more than two controlled trials: cueing strategies to improve gait; cognitive movement strategies to improve transfers; exercises to improve balance; and training of joint mobility and muscle power to improve physical capacity. These practice recommendations provide a basis for current physical therapy in Parkinson's disease in everyday clinical practice, as well as for future research in this field. © 2006 Movement Disorder Society", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981628434", "source": "openalex"}

One month reliability was found to be high for all questionnaires except those pertaining only to the last week or month. Longer term test-retest reliability tended to be lower. Validity was studied in relation to treadmill exercise performance, vital capacity, body fatness, the average of 14 4-wk physical activity histories and the average of 14 2-d accelerometer readings. No questionnaire measure was correlated with the accelerometer reading, and correlations with vital capacity were generally low. Only the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire household chores measure was correlated with habitual performance of household chores. Most questionnaires, even very simple ones, were related to performance of heavy intensity physical activity and treadmill performance; these same questionnaires tended to be related to percent body fat. Fewer questionnaires related to performance of light or moderate activity. Occupational activity was unrelated to any of the validation measures. It is concluded that there are multiple, nonoverlapping dimensions of physical activity, reflected in multiple nonoverlapping validation realms. More important than the length or attention to detail of a questionnaire seems to be the logic of its questions. Important areas of physical activity that should be addressed in future questionnaires include sleep, light, moderate and heavy intensity leisure activities, household chores, and occupational activity. Recent versus habitual activity should also be considered.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036268657", "source": "openalex"}

Remarkably, it was discovered that the viscosity of mixtures was dependent mainly on the mole fraction of added molecular solvents and only to a lesser extent upon their identity, allowing viscosity changes during the course of a reaction to be entirely predictable. While the addition of such molecular solvents decreases the viscosity and density, chloride impurities, arising from the preparation of the ionic liquids, increase viscosity dramatically. The commonly used methods of preparation were validated with respect to chloride impurity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103207805", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN: Secondary data analyses using distribution‐ and anchor‐based methods to determine meaningful change. SETTING: Secondary analysis of data from an observational study and clinical trials of community‐dwelling older people and subacute stroke survivors. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults with mobility disabilities in a strength training trial (n=100), subacute stroke survivors in an intervention trial (n=100), and a prospective cohort of community‐dwelling older people (n=492). MEASUREMENTS: Gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 6‐minute‐walk distance (6MWD), and self‐reported mobility. RESULTS: Most small meaningful change estimates ranged from 0.04 to 0.06 m/s for gait speed, 0.27 to 0.55 points for SPPB, and 19 to 22 m for 6MWD. Most substantial change estimates ranged from 0.08 to 0.14 m/s for gait speed, 0.99 to 1.34 points for SPPB, and 47 to 49 m for 6MWD. Based on responsiveness indices, per‐group sample sizes for clinical trials ranged from 13 to 42 for substantial change and 71 to 161 for small meaningful change. CONCLUSION: Best initial estimates of small meaningful change are near 0.05 m/s for gait speed, 0.5 points for SPPB, and 20 m for 6MWD and of substantial change are near 0.10 m/s for gait speed, 1.0 point for SPPB, and 50 m for 6MWD. For clinical use, substantial change in these measures and small change in gait speed and 6MWD, but not SPPB, are detectable. For research use, these measures yield feasible sample sizes for detecting meaningful change.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1482694899", "source": "openalex"}

Three MET-hours is equivalent to walking at average pace of 2 to 2.9 mph for 1 hour. The benefit of physical activity was particularly apparent among women with hormone-responsive tumors. The RR of breast cancer death for women with hormone-responsive tumors who engaged in 9 or more MET-hours per week of activity compared with women with hormone-responsive tumors who engaged in less than 9 MET-hours per week was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34-0.74). Compared with women who engaged in less than 3 MET-hours per week of activity, the absolute unadjusted mortality risk reduction was 6% at 10 years for women who engaged in 9 or more MET-hours per week.ConclusionsPhysical activity after a breast cancer diagnosis may reduce the risk of death from this disease. The greatest benefit occurred in women who performed the equivalent of walking 3 to 5 hours per week at an average pace, with little evidence of a correlation between increased benefit and greater energy expenditure. Women with breast cancer who follow US physical activity recommendations may improve their survival.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101077754", "source": "openalex"}

In 2018, WHO launched More Active People for a Healthier World, a new global action on physical activity, including new targets of a 15% relative reduction of global prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 2030 among adolescents and adults. We describe current prevalence and trends of insufficient physical activity among school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years by country, region, and globally.MethodsWe did a pooled analysis of cross-sectional survey data that were collected through random sampling with a sample size of at least 100 individuals, were representative of a national or defined subnational population, and reported prevalence of of insufficient physical activity by sex in adolescents. Prevalence had to be reported for at least three of the years of age within the 10–19-year age range. We estimated the prevalence of insufficient physical activity in school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years (combined and by sex) for individual countries, for four World Bank income groups, nine regions, and globally for the years 2001–16. To derive a standard definition of insufficient physical activity and to adjust for urban-only survey coverage, we used regression models. We estimated time trends using multilevel mixed-effects modelling.FindingsWe used data from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas including 1·6 million students aged 11–17 years. Globally, in 2016, 81·0% (95% uncertainty interval 77·8–87·7) of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active (77·6% [76·1–80·4] of boys and 84·7% [83·0–88·2] of girls). Although prevalence of insufficient physical activity significantly decreased between 2001 and 2016 for boys (from 80·1% [78·3–81·6] in 2001), there was no significant change for girls (from 85·1% [83·1–88·0] in 2001). There was no clear pattern according to country income group: insufficient activity prevalence in 2016 was 84·9% (82·6–88·2) in low-income countries, 79·3% (77·2–87·5) in lower–middle-income countries, 83·9% (79·5–89·2) in upper–middle-income countries, and 79·4% (74·0–86·2) in high-income countries. The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific for both boys (89·0%, 62·8–92·2) and girls (95·6%, 73·7–97·9). The regions with the lowest prevalence were high-income western countries for boys (72·1%, 71·1–73·6), and south Asia for girls (77·5%, 72·8–89·3). In 2016, 27 countries had a prevalence of insufficient activity of 90% or more for girls, whereas this was the case for two countries for boys.InterpretationThe majority of adolescents do not meet current physical activity guidelines. Urgent scaling up of implementation of known effective policies and programmes is needed to increase activity in adolescents. Investment and leadership at all levels to intervene on the multiple causes and inequities that might perpetuate the low participation in physical activity and sex differences, as well as engagement of youth themselves, will be vital to strengthen the opportunities for physical activity in all communities. Such action will improve the health of this and future young generations and support achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.FundingWHO.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2989617484", "source": "openalex"}

An extreme (weather or climate) event is generally defined as the occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends ('tails') of the range of observed values of the variable. Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the result of an accumulation of weather or climate events that are, individually, not extreme themselves (though their accumulation is extreme). As well, weather or climate events, even if not extreme in a statistical sense, can still lead to extreme conditions or impacts, either by crossing a critical threshold in a social, ecological, or physical system, or by occurring simultaneously with other events. A weather system such as a tropical cyclone can have an extreme impact, depending on where and when it approaches landfall, even if the specific cyclone is not extreme relative to other tropical cyclones. Conversely, not all extremes necessarily lead to serious impacts. [3.1]", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2277497547", "source": "openalex"}

Physiotherapists used this instrument to assess 111 patients with cerebral palsy, 25 with head injury and 34 non‐disabled preschool children on two occasions, the second after an interval of four to six months. Parents and therapists independently rated the children's function within two weeks of each assessment, and a sample of paired assessments was videotaped for ‘blind’ evaluation by therapists. Correlations between scores for change on this measure and the judgments of change by parents, therapists and ‘blind’ evaluators supported the hypothesis that the instrument would be responsive to both negative and positive changes.

Parents et rééducateurs apprécièrent indépendamment l'activité des enfants dans les deux semaines suivant chaque évaluation, et un échantillon d'évaluations appariées fut enregistré en vidéo pour étude ‘en aveugle’ par les rééducateurs. Les corrélations obervées entre les notes de changement à cette mesure, les appréciations de changement par les parents et les rééducateurs, les évaluations en aveugle, favorisent l'hypothèse de la sensibilité de l'instrument de mesure aux modifications négatives et positives.

It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2887258823", "source": "openalex"}

Return to sport decisions are made every day by clinicians, athletes and coaches, ideally in a collaborative way. The purpose of this consensus statement was to present and synthesise current evidence to make recommendations for return to sport decision-making, clinical practice and future research directions related to returning athletes to sport. A half day meeting was held in Bern, Switzerland, after the First World Congress in Sports Physical Therapy. 17 expert clinicians participated. 4 main sections were initially agreed upon, then participants elected to join 1 of the 4 groups-each group focused on 1 section of the consensus statement. Participants in each group discussed and summarised the key issues for their section before the 17-member group met again for discussion to reach consensus on the content of the 4 sections. Return to sport is not a decision taken in isolation at the end of the recovery and rehabilitation process. Instead, return to sport should be viewed as a continuum, paralleled with recovery and rehabilitation. Biopsychosocial models may help the clinician make sense of individual factors that may influence the athlete's return to sport, and the Strategic Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance framework may help decision-makers synthesise information to make an optimal return to sport decision. Research evidence to support return to sport decisions in clinical practice is scarce.

Is physical activity or physical fitness more important in defining health benefits? Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 33, No. 6, Suppl., 2001, pp. S379–S399. Purpose: We addressed three questions: 1) Is there a dose-response relation between physical activity and health? 2) Is there a dose-response relation between cardiorespiratory fitness and health? 3) If both activity and fitness have a dose-response relation to health, is it possible to determine which exposure is more important? Methods: We identified articles by PubMed search (restricted from 1/1/90 to 8/25/00) using keywords related to physical activity, physical fitness, and health. An author scanned titles and abstracts of 9831 identified articles. We included for thorough review articles that included three or more categories of activity or fitness and a health outcome and excluded articles on clinical trials, review papers, comments, letters, case reports, and nonhuman studies. We used an evidence-based approach to evaluate the quality of the published data. Results: We summarized results from 67 articles meeting final selection criteria. There is good consensus across studies with most showing an inverse dose-response gradient across both activity and fitness categories for morbidity from coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or cancer; and for CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality. Conclusions: All studies reviewed were prospective observational investigations; thus, conclusions are based on Evidence Category C. 1) There is a consistent gradient across activity groups indicating greater longevity and reduced risk of CHD, CVD, stroke, and colon cancer in more active individuals. 2) Studies are compelling in the consistency and steepness of the gradient across fitness groups. Most show a curvilinear gradient, with a steep slope at low levels of fitness and an asymptote in the upper part of the fitness distribution. 3) It is not possible to conclude whether activity or fitness is more important for health. Future studies should define more precisely the shape of the dose-response gradient across activity or fitness groups, evaluate the role of musculoskeletal fitness, and investigate additional health outcomes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976031759", "source": "openalex"}

We prospectively compared physical signs with hemodynamic measurements in 50 patients with known chronic heart failure (ejection fraction, .18 +/- .06). Rales, edema, and elevated mean jugular venous pressure were absent in 18 of 43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg, for which the combination of these signs had 58% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Proportional pulse pressure correlated well with cardiac index (r = .82), and when less than 25% pulse pressure had 91% sensitivity and 83% specificity for a cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/m2. In chronic heart failure, reliance on physical signs for elevated ventricular filling pressure might result in inadequate therapy. Conversely, the adequacy of cardiac output is assessed reliably by pulse pressure. Our results facilitate decisions regarding treatment in chronic heart failure.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2021402962", "source": "openalex"}

A Systematic Review", "text": "Our objective was to compare the effects on mental and physical wellbeing, health related quality of life and long-term adherence to physical activity, of participation in physical activity in natural environments compared with physical activity indoors. We conducted a systematic review using the following data sources: Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, GreenFILE, SportDISCUS, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index--Science and BIOSIS from inception to June 2010. Internet searches of relevant Web sites, hand searches of relevant journals, and the reference lists of included papers and other review papers identified in the search were also searched for relevant information. Controlled trials (randomized and nonrandomized) were included. To be eligible trials had to compare the effects of outdoor exercise initiatives with those conducted indoors and report on at least one physical or mental wellbeing outcome in adults or children. Screening of articles for inclusion, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of identified studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Eleven trials (833 adults) were included. Most participants (6 trials; 523 adults) were young students. Study entry criteria and methods were sparsely reported. All interventions consisted of a single episode of walking or running indoors with the same activity at a similar level conducted outdoors on a separate occasion. A total of 13 different outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on mental wellbeing, and 4 outcome measures were used to assess attitude to exercise. Most trials (n = 9) showed some improvement in mental wellbeing on one or other of the outcome measures. Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments was associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy. However, the results suggested that feelings of calmness may be decreased following outdoor exercise. Participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction with outdoor activity and declared a greater intent to repeat the activity at a later date. None of the identified studies measured the effects of physical activity on physical wellbeing or the effect of natural environments on exercise adherence. The hypothesis that there are added beneficial effects to be gained from performing physical activity outdoors in natural environments is very appealing and has generated considerable interest. This review has shown some promising effects on self-reported mental wellbeing immediately following exercise in nature which are not seen following the same exercise indoors. However, the interpretation and extrapolation of these findings is hampered by the poor methodological quality of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures employed. The review demonstrates the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations and reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area. Large, well designed, longer term trials in populations who might benefit most from the potential advantages of outdoor exercise are needed to fully elucidate the effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The influence of these effects on the sustainability of physical activity initiatives also awaits investigation.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964853204", "source": "openalex"}

Intriguingly, recent research in humans points to the involvement of the insula in the processing of both physical temperature and interpersonal warmth (trust) information. Accordingly, we hypothesized that experiences of physical warmth (or coldness) would increase feelings of interpersonal warmth (or coldness), without the person's awareness of this influence. In study 1, participants who briefly held a cup of hot (versus iced) coffee judged a target person as having a \"warmer\" personality (generous, caring); in study 2, participants holding a hot (versus cold) therapeutic pad were more likely to choose a gift for a friend instead of for themselves.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2025905047", "source": "openalex"}

Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the patient, the diagnostic and treatment options available, and the patient’s values, expectations, and preferences.

The semiconductor-electrolyte junction is treated as a simple Schottky barrier, and the photocurrent is described using this model. The approach is appropriate since large-band-gap semiconductors have an intrinsic oxygen overpotential which removes the electrode reaction kinetics as the rate-limiting step. The model is successful in describing the wavelength and potential dependence of the photocurrent in WO3 and allows a determination of the band gap, optical absorption depth, minority-carrier diffusion length, flat-band potential, and the nature of the fundamental optical transition (direct or indirect). It is shown for WO3 that minority-carrier diffusion plays a limited role in determining the photoresponse of the semiconductor-electrolyte junction. There are indications that the diffusion length in this low carrier mobility material is determined by diffusion-controlled bulk recombination processes rather than the more common trap-limited recombination. It is also shown that the fundamental optical transition is indirect and that the band-gap energy depends relatively strongly on applied potential and electrolyte. This effect seems to be the result of field-induced crystallographic distortions in antiferroelectric WO3.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2045473418", "source": "openalex"}

The main goal of this systematic review is to summarize and update the existing literature on correlates of young people's physical activity, insufficient physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Methods: A systematic review was conducted and included studies published between January 1999 and January 2005. Results: The 60 reviewed studies showed that for children (age range 4-12), gender (male), self-efficacy, parental physical activity (for boys), and parent support were positively associated with physical activity. For adolescents (age range 13-18), positive associations with physical activity were found for gender (male), parental education, attitude, self-efficacy, goal orientation/motivation, physical education/school sports, family influences, and friend support. For adolescents, a positive association was found between gender (male) and sedentary behavior, whereas an inverse association was found between gender and insufficient physical activity. Ethnicity (Caucasian), socioeconomic status, and parent education were found to be inversely associated with adolescents' sedentary behaviors. For children, the evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about correlates of insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior. Conclusion: To gain more insight in the correlates of change in physical activity levels, more prospective studies are needed. Moreover, further research is needed examining the correlates of insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviors, to develop effective interventions that may help children and adolescents diminish the time they spend on inactive behaviors.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157829553", "source": "openalex"}

An understanding of the physical principles that govern the molecular organization of membranes is essential for an understanding of their physiological roles since structure and function are much more interdependent in membranes than in, say, simple chemical reactions in solution.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4381660448", "title": "Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans", "text": "FigureQ: What messages are the same, and what is new, within the recently released Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans? What resources are available related to the Guidelines? A In 2008, the first federal set of guidelines related to physical activity was released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1). This inaugural edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAGA) has become a foundation for recommendations related to physical activity programs for youth and adults in America (2). Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Midcourse Report: Strategies to Increase Physical Activity Among Youth was released 5 years later in 2013, building on the 2008 PAGA and exploring ways to encourage youth to reach the recommended 60 minutes per day of physical activity (2,3). Then in 2015, Step It Up! The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable Communities was released with the intent to increase walking opportunities in the United States (2,4).FigureThe need to update the 2008 PAGA was realized as additional research accumulated in the area of physical activity and health along with documentation of poor adherence to the recommendations found in the 2008 PAGA (2). In the United States, participation in aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities is low and, as shown in Figure 1, participation levels for both males and females decrease over adulthood (5). Aerobic activities have higher participation compared with muscular strengthening but still far from an ideal of 100% of individuals meeting both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity recommendations (see Figure 2) (5). Similarly, for youth, about 20% meet aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines (6).Figure 1: Participation by males and females in aerobic and muscular-strengthening activities that meet guidelines (5).Figure 2: Participation by adults in both aerobic and muscular-strengthening activities that meet guidelines (5).A call for nominations for an advisory committee was initiated in 2015 (7); members were selected in 2016 and began work on analyzing the wealth of research on physical activity and health (2). This was a major undertaking, as reflected by nearly 1,300 references found throughout the report (8). The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report is a lengthy document, nearly 700 pages, focused on studies published since the 2008 PAGA (8). The Scientific Report provides evidence-based recommendations that were submitted to the secretary of Health and Human Services. Public comments were received along with feedback from several federal agencies. The new edition of the PAGA was developed with input from these sources and was released in November 2018 (2,6). HEALTH AND FITNESS BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY The message of the 2018 PAGA is summarized nicely in the first sentence in the document: “Being physically active is one of the most important actions that people of all ages can take to improve their health” (6). The role of physical activity in preventing disease described in the 2008 PAGA is strengthened by subsequent research, with supporting evidence for lowering risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and colon and breast cancer (2). Based on new research, additional benefits of physical activity are included in the 2018 PAGA: improved bone health and weight status for those 3 to 5 years of age; improved cognitive function for those 6 to 13 years of age; reduced cancer risk (in addition to colon and breast cancers, the new edition includes bladder, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, lung, and stomach cancers); benefits for brain health (i.e., potential benefits are improved cognitive function, reduced anxiety and depression risk, improved sleep, and improved quality of life); reduced risk of excessive weight gain, gestational diabetes, and postpartum depression for pregnant women; reduced risk of fall-related injuries for older adults; and reduced risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality, improved physical function, and improved quality of life for those with various chronic medical conditions (6). Expanding on the disease prevention focus of the 2008 PAGA, the 2018 PAGA infuses a focus on both disease prevention and health promotion throughout the document (6). For example, when considering timing of benefits, immediate and long-term benefits are noted. A single session of physical activity can bring positive changes (e.g., reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce symptoms of anxiety, and improve some aspects of cognition). Ongoing regular physical activity can expand on these improvements along with reduction in risk of many chronic diseases and enhanced physical function (6). Health and fitness professionals have an excellent opportunity to reach out to those not yet meeting activity recommendations and now have even more research-backed evidence for the myriad of benefits regular physical activity can afford — in both the short- and long-term. Selected highlights, along with resources for use by the public, are included in the remainder of this article. Readers are encouraged to review the entire 117-page 2018 PAGA document for more background and details (6). RECOMMENDATIONS CONFIRMED, EXPANDED, AND ADDED The original recommendations for youth (ages 6 to 17 years) and adults have been substantiated and thus remain unchanged (2,6): Youth should include at least 60 minutes of age-appropriate moderate-to-vigorous activity every day including mostly aerobic activity (moderate or vigorous intensity, at least 3 days per week should include vigorous) as well as muscle strengthening on at least 3 days per week and bone strengthening on at least 3 days per week. Adults should include moderate-intensity aerobic activity for 150 to 300 minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity activity 75 to 150 minutes per week, or an equivalent combination along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week. New to this edition is guidance for those as young as 3 years old; the 2008 PAGA recommendations started at age 6 years (1). Preschool-age children (3 to 5 years of age) should be physically active throughout the day, and adult caregivers should encourage a variety of play (e.g., throwing games; bike/tricycle riding; activities with hopping, skipping, jumping, and tumbling). The duration of activity is not yet defined, and thus no formal recommendation is presented; however, 3 hours per day of activity is given as a reasonable target (all types and intensities count) (6). Although the overall physical activity recommendations for adults remain the same, insights on how activity can be accumulated have been updated. To count toward meeting aerobic activity recommendations in the 2008 PAGA, physical activity bouts needed to be at least 10 minutes in duration. Within the new PAGA, 10-minute bouts are supported for improvement of a number of health outcomes, but new evidence also suggests that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of any duration contributes to health benefits (6). Guidelines for older adults are similar to those for adults related to aerobic and muscular-strengthening activities, including 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate intensity, 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity, or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week (6). Guidelines also include additional aspects reflecting the varied health and fitness levels in older adults as a group including doing multicomponent physical activity as part of weekly physical activity (i.e., balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities), determining effort level relative to personal fitness level, understanding the impact of chronic conditions on safety of physical activity, and being as physically active as possible if unable to reach recommended levels because of chronic conditions (6). In 2008, limited research was available on the relationship between sedentary behavior and health. Since then, researchers have noted the prevalence of sedentary behavior for children and adults to be high; approximately 7.7 hours per day during waking hours are spent being sedentary (6). A strong relationship has been found between sedentary time and risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in adults (6). However, at this time, specific targets related to healthy amounts of sedentary time or how many times sedentary time should be interrupted by activity are not defined (6). Difficulty in determining targets on these aspects is related to the relationship between risks due to sedentary behavior and the amount of physical activity being performed (see Figure 3) (6). The colors on the figure represent all-cause mortality risk; red reflects higher risk, green represents lower risk, and orange and yellow represent transitional decreases in risk. For those who are most sedentary, all-cause mortality risk decreases with even small amounts of moderate-to-vigorous activity (note color change from red in the top left corner toward orange as physical activity increases). As shown in the figure, the risk is low even if sedentary level is high for those who have the most activity (i.e., this level seems to be 60 to 75 min/d of moderate or 30 to 40 min/d of vigorous activity) (note color shifts to green in the top right corner). Given the data showing high prevalence of sitting and low physical activity levels in the United States, the value of moderate-to-vigorous activity along with reducing sitting time is clear (6). The lower corner of the figure (shown in green) reflects low sedentary time and higher levels of activity — a winning combination.Figure 3: Relationship among moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sitting time, and risk of all-cause mortality in adults (6).Most of the PAGA is focused on physical activity guidelines, but the final chapter is focused on strategies to encourage the population to be more active (6). Knowing what to do is a first step, but engaging in regular physical activity is the goal. Individuals are encouraged to develop their own plans and set personal goals, with their unique motivators in mind. Evidence-based strategies for individuals or small groups include receiving guidance from professionals or peers (e.g., health professionals, trained peers), support from others (e.g., buddy systems, exercise groups), and technology (e.g., virtual coaching, wearable activity monitors, smartphone apps, telephone and Internet delivery systems) (6). Communities can encourage people to be physically active; strategies include point-of-decision prompts (e.g., signs suggesting to take the stairs rather than the elevator, wayfinding signs pointing to walkable destinations), school policies and practices (e.g., physical education, classroom physical activity breaks, pre- and postschool activity opportunities), access to indoor and outdoor recreation facilities or outlets (e.g., worksite fitness rooms, parks or trails), community-wide campaigns (e.g., wide-spread physical activity messaging with community activities), and community design (e.g., active transportation options) (6). Although not discussed in this article, the reader is directed to two other information-packed chapters in the PAGA. The chapter entitled “Additional Considerations for Some Adults” includes helpful guidelines for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period as well as people with chronic health conditions or disabilities, including special considerations for adults with osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, adult cancer survivors, and select other physical disabilities (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke) (6). There also is an entire chapter devoted to promoting safety, including understanding risks, selecting appropriate activities for health and fitness level, gradual progression, and consulting with a health care professional or physical activity specialists for those with chronic conditions or symptoms that may require assistance with determining appropriate activities (6). RESOURCES TO TRANSLATE THE GUIDELINES INTO MESSAGES FOR THE PUBLIC The target audience for the PAGA is health professionals and policy makers (6). As a resource, the PAGA helps in the design and implementation of physical activity programs and in the development of policies and promotion initiatives (6). With this in mind, the Move Your Way campaign is a resource that can be used to translate the guidelines into messages for the general public (9). One example of a graphic from the campaign is found in Figure 4. A handout for older adults is found in Figure 5. Health and fitness professionals can access many resources that can be used with clients and patients at https://health.gov/paguidelines/moveyourway/; this Web site includes fact sheets, posters, videos, interactive tools, and Web badges and widgets. The Web page for consumers is https://health.gov/moveyourway/. At this page, individuals can get started by using an interactive tool to build a personalized activity plan https://health.gov/MoveYourWay/Activity-Planner/.Figure 4: Sample of a Move Your Way graphic for adults (6).Figure 5: Sample of a Move Your Way handout for older adults (9).CONCLUSIONS In the 10 years since the first PAGA was released, the scientific evidence on the benefits of physical activity throughout the lifespan has grown. Based on a thorough review of the latest research, the 2018 PAGA is an information-backed resource that provides guidelines for physical activity for Americans starting at age 3 years. With a focus on disease prevention and health promotion, the PAGA is a valuable resource for those within the health and fitness profession when developing individual physical activity programs as well as more broadly in providing opportunities for physical activity within families and communities. As stated in the PAGA (6), “Everyone has a role to play to increase physical activity levels of Americans.” What will your role be?", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4381660448", "source": "openalex"}

Methods We searched Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. In addition, the records in PROSPERO and Epistemonikos and PEDro were consulted. Systematic reviews of different conditions, populations, and contexts—where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy—were included. The outcomes were clinical effectiveness depending on specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence, and safety. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings are reported qualitatively in the tables and figures. Results Fifty-three systematic reviews were included, of which 17 were assessed as having low risk of bias. Fifteen reviews were on cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, 14 on musculoskeletal conditions, and 13 on neurorehabilitation. The other 11 reviews addressed other types of conditions and rehabilitation. Thirteen reviews evaluated with low risk of bias showed results in favor of telerehabilitation versus in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation, while 17 reported no differences between the groups. Thirty-five reviews with unclear or high risk of bias showed mixed results. Conclusions Despite the contradictory results, telerehabilitation in physical therapy could be comparable with in-person rehabilitation or better than no rehabilitation for conditions such as osteoarthritis, low-back pain, hip and knee replacement, and multiple sclerosis and also in the context of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. It is imperative to conduct better quality clinical trials and systematic reviews. Impact Providing the best available evidence on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation to professionals, mainly physical therapists, will impact the decision-making process and therefore yield better clinical outcomes for patients, both in these times of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future. The identification of research gaps will also contribute to the generation of relevant and novel research questions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127675992", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence suggests that stroke survivors experience physical deconditioning and lead sedentary lifestyles. Therefore, this updated scientific statement serves as an overall guide for practitioners to gain a better understanding of the benefits of physical activity and recommendations for prescribing exercise for stroke survivors across all stages of recovery. Methods— Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council’s Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association’s Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiology studies, morbidity and mortality reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence and indicate gaps in current knowledge. Results— Physical inactivity after stroke is highly prevalent. The assessed body of evidence clearly supports the use of exercise training (both aerobic and strength training) for stroke survivors. Exercise training improves functional capacity, the ability to perform activities of daily living, and quality of life, and it reduces the risk for subsequent cardiovascular events. Physical activity goals and exercise prescription for stroke survivors need to be customized for the individual to maximize long-term adherence. Conclusions— The recommendation from this writing group is that physical activity and exercise prescription should be incorporated into the management of stroke survivors. The promotion of physical activity in stroke survivors should emphasize low- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, reduction of sedentary behavior, and risk management for secondary prevention of stroke.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109003100", "source": "openalex"}

Objective To compare the effectiveness of 2 physical therapy treatment approaches for impingement syndrome of the shoulder. Background Manual physical therapy combined with exercise is a commonly applied but currently unproven clinical treatment for impingement syndrome of the shoulder. Methods and Measures Thirty men and 22 women (age 43 years ± 9.1) diagnosed with shoulder impingement syndrome were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. The exercise group performed supervised flexibility and strengthening exercises. The manual therapy group performed the same program and received manual physical therapy treatment. Both groups received the selected intervention 6 times over a 3-week period. The testers, who were blinded to group assignment, measured strength, pain, and function before treatment and after 6 physical therapy visits. Strength was a composite score of isometric strength tests for internal rotation, external rotation, and abduction. Rain was a composite score of visual analog scale measures during resisted break tests, active abduction, and functional activities. Function was measured with a functional assessment questionnaire. The visual analog scale used to measure pain with functional activities and the functional assessment questionnaire were also measured 2 months after the initiation of treatment. Results Subjects in both groups experienced significant decreases in pain and increases in function, but there was significantly more improvement in the manual therapy group compared to the exercise group. For example, pain in the manual therapy group was reduced from a pretreatment mean (±SD) of 575.8 (±220.0) to a posttreatment mean of 174.4 (±183.1). In contrast, pain in the exercise group was reduced from a pretreatment mean of 557.1 (±237.2) to a posttreatment mean of 360.6 (±272.3). Strength in the manual therapy group improved significantly while strength in the exercise group did not. Conclusion Manual physical therapy applied by experienced physical therapists combined with supervised exercise in a brief clinical trial is better than exercise alone for increasing strength, decreasing pain, and improving function in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional survey. SETTING: Nationally representative cross‐sectional survey using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen thousand eight hundred eighteen adult NHANES III participants aged 18 and older. MEASUREMENTS: The presence of sarcopenia and the relationship between sarcopenia and functional impairment and disability were examined in 4,504 adults aged 60 and older. Skeletal muscle mass was estimated from bioimpedance analysis measurements and expressed as skeletal muscle mass index (SMI = skeletal muscle mass/body mass × 100). Subjects were considered to have a normal SMI if their SMI was greater than ‐one standard deviation above the sex‐specific mean for young adults (aged 18–39). Class I sarcopenia was considered present in subjects whose SMI was within ‐one to ‐two standard deviations of young adult values, and class II sarcopenia was present in subjects whose SMI was below ‐two standard deviations of young adult values. RESULTS: The prevalence of class I and class II sarcopenia increased from the third to sixth decades but remained relatively constant thereafter. The prevalence of class I (59% vs 45%) and class II (10% vs 7%) sarcopenia was greater in the older (≥ 60 years) women than in the older men ( P &lt; .001). The likelihood of functional impairment and disability was approximately two times greater in the older men and three times greater in the older women with class II sarcopenia than in the older men and women with a normal SMI, respectively. Some of the associations between class II sarcopenia and functional impairment remained significant after adjustment for age, race, body mass index, health behaviors, and comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced relative skeletal muscle mass in older Americans is a common occurrence that is significantly and independently associated with functional impairment and disability, particularly in older women. These observations provide strong support for the prevailing view that sarcopenia may be an important and potentially reversible cause of morbidity and mortality in older persons.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115150337", "source": "openalex"}

For polyhedral nanoparticles, the surface plasmon resonances are studied as a function of the number of faces and vertices. The modification of these surface plasmons by different surrounding media and the presence of a substrate or other nanoparticles is also discussed. We found that polyhedral nanoparticles composed with less faces show more surface plasmon resonances, and as the nanoparticle becomes more symmetric, the main surface plasmon resonance is blue-shifted. It is also found that the corners induce more surface plasmons in a wider energy range. In the presence of a substrate, multipolar plasmon resonances are induced, and as the nanoparticle approaches the substrate, such resonances are red-shifted. The interaction among nanoparticles also induces multipolar resonances, but they can be red or blue-shifted depending on the polarization of the external field.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081079273", "source": "openalex"}

Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &lt;100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is &lt;100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of &lt;70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is &lt;130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal &lt;100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2106343349", "source": "openalex"}

The short version of the IPAQ has been tested extensively and is now used in many international studies. The present study aimed to explore the validity characteristics of the long-version IPAQ. Subjects and methods Forty-six voluntary healthy male and female subjects (age, mean±standard deviation: 40.7±10.3 years) participated in the study. PA indicators derived from the long, self-administered IPAQ were compared with data from an activity monitor and a PA log book for concurrent validity, and with aerobic fitness, body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat for construct validity. Results Strong positive relationships were observed between the activity monitor data and the IPAQ data for total PA (ρ = 0.55, P &lt; 0.001) and vigorous PA (ρ = 0.71, P &lt; 0.001), but a weaker relationship for moderate PA (ρ = 0.21, P = 0.051). Calculated MET-h day −1 from the PA log book was significantly correlated with MET-h day −1 from the IPAQ (ρ = 0.67, P &lt; 0.001). A weak correlation was observed between IPAQ data for total PA and both aerobic fitness (ρ = 0.21, P = 0.051) and BMI (ρ = 0.25, P = 0.009). No significant correlation was observed between percentage body fat and IPAQ variables. Bland–Altman analysis suggested that the inability of activity monitors to detect certain types of activities might introduce a source of error in criterion validation studies.

Open-ended questionnaire responses were used to identify important contributors to the physical self-esteem of a college age population. Based on these data, four subdomain subscales designed to assess perceived bodily attractiveness, sports competence, physical strength, and physical conditioning were constructed along with a general physical self-worth subscale as the basis of the Physical Self-Perception Profile. The sensitivity, reliability, and stability of the subscales were supported for both genders across three independent samples. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicated the discriminant validity of the subdomain subscales, supporting the concept of multidimensionality within the physical domain. Zero-order correlation, partial correlation, and multiple regression analyses provided results consistent with a three-tier hierarchical structure among self-perception elements. In addition, initial predictive validity of the subdomain subscales was evidenced through their association with degree and type of involvement in physical activity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099829040", "source": "openalex"}

One-dimensional models are used to predict the substrate doping profile and the corresponding threshold voltage versus source voltage characteristic. A two-dimensional current transport model is used to predict the relative degree of short-channel effects for different device parameter combinations.

Brief and valid instruments are needed both for screening and outcome assessment. This study examined psychometric indices of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to detect cases of insomnia in a population-based sample and to evaluate treatment response in a clinical sample. Participants were 959 individuals selected from the community for an epidemiological study of insomnia (Community sample) and 183 individuals evaluated for insomnia treatment and 62 controls without insomnia (Clinical sample). They completed the ISI and several measures of sleep quality, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and quality of life; those in the Clinical sample also completed sleep diaries, polysomnography, and interviews to validate their insomnia/good sleep status and assess treatment response. In addition to standard psychometric indices of reliability and validity, item response theory analyses were computed to examine ISI item response patterns. Receiver operating curves were used to derive optimal cutoff scores for case identification and to quantify the minimally important changes in relation to global improvement ratings obtained by an independent assessor. ISI internal consistency was excellent for both samples (Cronbach α of 0.90 and 0.91). Item response analyses revealed adequate discriminatory capacity for 5 of the 7 items. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between total ISI score and measures of fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. A cutoff score of 10 was optimal (86.1% sensitivity and 87.7% specificity) for detecting insomnia cases in the community sample. In the clinical sample, a change score of −8.4 points (95% CI: −7.1, −9.4) was associated with moderate improvement as rated by an independent assessor after treatment. These findings provide further evidence that the ISI is a reliable and valid instrument to detect cases of insomnia in the population and is sensitive to treatment response in clinical patients.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W182910583", "source": "openalex"}

The guideline is based on a systematic review of relevant meta‐analyses published till June 2016. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co‐morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep‐related breathing disorders), in treatment‐resistant insomnia, for professional at‐risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high‐quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first‐line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high‐quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and some antidepressants are effective in the short‐term treatment of insomnia (≤4 weeks; weak recommendation, moderate‐quality evidence). Antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin and phytotherapeutics are not recommended for insomnia treatment (strong to weak recommendations, low‐ to very‐low‐quality evidence). Light therapy and exercise need to be further evaluated to judge their usefulness in the treatment of insomnia (weak recommendation, low‐quality evidence). Complementary and alternative treatments (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not recommended for insomnia treatment (weak recommendation, very‐low‐quality evidence).", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2753866150", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources.

Evidence from methodologically strong cohort studies indicates that undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, with or without symptoms, is independently associated with increased likelihood of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and diminished quality of life. Strategies to decrease the high prevalence and associated morbidity of obstructive sleep apnea are critically needed. The reduction or elimination of risk factors through public health initiatives with clinical support holds promise. Potentially modifiable risk factors considered in this review include overweight and obesity, alcohol, smoking, nasal congestion, and estrogen depletion in menopause. Data suggest that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with all these factors, but at present the only intervention strategy supported with adequate evidence is weight loss. A focus on weight control is especially important given the expanding epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States. Primary care providers will be central to clinical approaches for addressing the burden and the development of cost-effective case-finding strategies and feasible treatment for mild obstructive sleep apnea warrants high priority.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124052130", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1277966809", "title": "The Role of Actigraphy in the Study of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms", "text": "In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1277966809", "source": "openalex"}

The goals of the task force were (1) to clarify and simplify the current scoring rules, (2) to review evidence for new monitoring technologies relevant to the scoring rules, and (3) to strive for greater concordance between adult and pediatric rules. The task force reviewed the evidence cited by the AASM systematic review of the reliability and validity of scoring respiratory events published in 2007 and relevant studies that have appeared in the literature since that publication. Given the limitations of the published evidence, a consensus process was used to formulate the majority of the task force recommendations concerning revisions.The task force made recommendations concerning recommended and alternative sensors for the detection of apnea and hypopnea to be used during diagnostic and positive airway pressure (PAP) titration polysomnography. An alternative sensor is used if the recommended sensor fails or the signal is inaccurate. The PAP device flow signal is the recommended sensor for the detection of apnea, hypopnea, and respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) during PAP titration studies. Appropriate filter settings for recording (display) of the nasal pressure signal to facilitate visualization of inspiratory flattening are also specified. The respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals to be used as alternative sensors for apnea and hypopnea detection are specified. The task force reached consensus on use of the same sensors for adult and pediatric patients except for the following: (1) the end-tidal PCO(2) signal can be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection in children only, and (2) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) belts can be used to monitor respiratory effort (thoracoabdominal belts) and as an alternative sensor for detection of apnea and hypopnea (PVDFsum) only in adults.The task force recommends the following changes to the 2007 respiratory scoring rules. Apnea in adults is scored when there is a drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative apnea sensor, for ≥ 10 seconds. Hypopnea in adults is scored when the peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for ≥ 10 seconds in association with either ≥ 3% arterial oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Scoring a hypopnea as either obstructive or central is now listed as optional, and the recommended scoring rules are presented. In children an apnea is scored when peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor; and the event meets duration and respiratory effort criteria for an obstructive, mixed, or central apnea. A central apnea is scored in children when the event meets criteria for an apnea, there is an absence of inspiratory effort throughout the event, and at least one of the following is met: (1) the event is ≥ 20 seconds in duration, (2) the event is associated with an arousal or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation, (3) (infants under 1 year of age only) the event is associated with a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute for at least 5 seconds or less than 60 beats per minute for 15 seconds. A hypopnea is scored in children when the peak signal excursions drop is ≥ 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for ≥ the duration of 2 breaths in association with either ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal. In children and adults, surrogates of the arterial PCO(2) are the end-tidal PCO(2) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (diagnostic study) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (titration study). For adults, sleep hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 55 mm Hg for ≥ 10 minutes or there is an increase in the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) ≥ 10 mm Hg (in comparison to an awake supine value) to a value exceeding 50 mm Hg for ≥ 10 minutes. For pediatric patients hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 50 mm Hg for > 25% of total sleep time. In adults Cheyne-Stokes breathing is scored when both of the following are met: (1) there are episodes of ≥ 3 consecutive central apneas and/or central hypopneas separated by a crescendo and decrescendo change in breathing amplitude with a cycle length of at least 40 seconds (typically 45 to 90 seconds), and (2) there are five or more central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour associated with the crescendo/decrescendo breathing pattern recorded over a minimum of 2 hours of monitoring.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1545241942", "source": "openalex"}

Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into 3 categories: ≥ 6 h sleep (top 50% of the sample); 5-6 h (approximately the third quartile of the sample); and ≤ 5 h (approximately the bottom quartile of the sample). Hypertension was defined based either on blood pressure measures or treatment. We controlled for age, race, sex, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, depression, sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and sampling weight. Compared to the normal sleeping and >6 h sleep duration group, the highest risk of hypertension was in insomnia with <5 h sleep duration group (OR [95% CI] 5.1 [2.2, 11.8]), and the second highest in insomnia who slept 5-6 hours (OR 3.5 [1.6, 7.9] P < 0.01). The risk for hypertension was significantly higher, but of lesser magnitude, in poor sleepers with short sleep duration. Insomnia with short sleep duration is associated with increased risk of hypertension, to a degree comparable to that of other common sleep disorders, e.g., SDB.

A review paper published in 1999 summarized the evidence regarding the efficacy of psychological and behavioral treatments for persistent insomnia. The present review provides an update of the evidence published since the original paper. As with the original paper, this review was conducted by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine in order to update its practice parameters on psychological and behavioral therapies for insomnia.A systematic review was conducted on 37 treatment studies (N = 2246 subjects/patients) published between 1998 and 2004 inclusively and identified through Psyclnfo and Medline searches. Each study was systematically reviewed with a standard coding sheet and the following information was extracted: Study design, sample (number of participants, age, gender), diagnosis, type of treatments and controls, primary and secondary outcome measures, and main findings. Criteria for inclusion of a study were as follows: (a) the main sleep diagnosis was insomnia (primary or comorbid), (b) at least 1 treatment condition was psychological or behavioral in content, (c) the study design was a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized group design, a clinical case series or a single subject experimental design with a minimum of 10 subjects, and (d) the study included at least 1 of the following as dependent variables: sleep onset latency, number and/or duration of awakenings, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, or sleep quality.Psychological and behavioral therapies produced reliable changes in several sleep parameters of individuals with either primary insomnia or insomnia associated with medical and psychiatric disorders. Nine studies documented the benefits of insomnia treatment in older adults or for facilitating discontinuation of medication among chronic hypnotic users. Sleep improvements achieved with treatment were well sustained over time; however, with the exception of reduced psychological symptoms/ distress, there was limited evidence that improved sleep led to clinically meaningful changes in other indices of morbidity (e.g., daytime fatigue). Five treatments met criteria for empirically-supported psychological treatments for insomnia: Stimulus control therapy, relaxation, paradoxical intention, sleep restriction, and cognitive-behavior therapy.These updated findings provide additional evidence in support of the original review's conclusions as to the efficacy and generalizability of psychological and behavioral therapies for persistent insomnia. Nonetheless, further research is needed to develop therapies that would optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity, as would studies of treatment mechanisms, mediators, and moderators of outcomes. Effectiveness studies are also needed to validate those therapies when implemented in clinical settings (primary care), by non-sleep specialists. There is also a need to disseminate more effectively the available evidence in support of psychological and behavioral interventions to health-care practitioners working on the front line.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1684861691", "source": "openalex"}

It is based on a review of 48 clinical trials and two meta-analyses conducted by a task force appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to develop practice parameters on non-drug therapies for the clinical management of insomnia. The findings indicate that nonpharmacological therapies produce reliable and durable changes in several sleep parameters of chronic insomnia sufferers. The data indicate that between 70% and 80% of patients treated with nonpharmacological interventions benefit from treatment. For the typical patient with persistent primary insomnia, treatment is likely to reduce the main target symptoms of sleep onset latency and/or wake time after sleep onset below or near the 30-min criterion initially used to define insomnia severity. Sleep duration is also increased by a modest 30 minutes and sleep quality and patient's satisfaction with sleep patterns are significantly enhanced. Sleep improvements achieved with these behavioral interventions are sustained for at least 6 months after treatment completion. However, there is no clear evidence that improved sleep leads to meaningful changes in daytime well-being or performance. Three treatments meet the American Psychological Association (APA) criteria for empirically-supported psychological treatments for insomnia: Stimulus control, progressive muscle relaxation, and paradoxical intention; and three additional treatments meet APA criteria for probably efficacious treatments: Sleep restriction, biofeedback, and multifaceted cognitive-behavior therapy. Additional outcome research is needed to examine the effectiveness of treatment when it is implemented in clinical settings (primary care, family practice), by non-sleep specialists, and with insomnia patients presenting medical or psychiatric comorbidity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2473551374", "source": "openalex"}

Other measures include arousal index; percentage of sleep time below 90% oxygen saturation; history of snoring; and presence of hypertension, defined as resting blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication.Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and prevalence of hypertension increased significantly with increasing SDB measures, although some of this association was explained by body mass index (BMI). After adjusting for demographics and anthropometric variables (including BMI, neck circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio), as well as for alcohol intake and smoking, the odds ratio for hypertension, comparing the highest category of AHI (> or = 30 per hour) with the lowest category (< 1.5 per hour), was 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.83; P for trend = .005).

A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as \"good practice statements\", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation.Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA.

We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

Clinicians may be reluctant to address insomnia because of its many potential causes, unfamiliarity with behavioral treatments, and concerns about pharmacologic treatments.<h3>Objective</h3>To review the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of insomnia in adults.<h3>Evidence Review</h3>Systematic review to identify and summarize previously published quantitative reviews (meta-analyses) of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for insomnia.<h3>Findings</h3>Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. The prevalence of insomnia disorder is approximately 10% to 20%, with approximately 50% having a chronic course. Insomnia is a risk factor for impaired function, development of other medical and mental disorders, and increased health care costs. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors culminating in hyperarousal. The diagnosis of insomnia is established by a thorough history of sleep behaviors, medical and psychiatric problems, and medications, supplemented by a prospective record of sleep patterns (sleep diary). Quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) support the efficacy of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacologic interventions for insomnia. Brief behavioral interventions and Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy both show promise for use in primary care settings. Among pharmacologic interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although persistent concerns focus on their safety relative to modest efficacy. Behavioral treatments should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.<h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3>Clinicians should recognize insomnia because of its effects on function and health. A thorough clinical history is often sufficient to identify factors that contribute to insomnia. Behavioral treatments should be used when possible. Hypnotic medications are also efficacious but must be carefully monitored for adverse effects.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4231896431", "source": "openalex"}

Although a number of perspectives have some empirical support, no one approach emerges as preeminent. Importantly, the efficacy of any particular psychological intervention cannot be taken as confirmation of presumed, underlying mechanisms. An integrated psychobiological inhibition model of insomnia is developed that accounts for the research data. The model views insomnia as arising from inhibition of de-arousal processes associated with normal sleep. It is proposed that sleep homeostatic and circadian factors are compromised by impairment of the automaticity and plasticity associated with good sleep, and that cognitive/affective processes activate the clinical complaint of insomnia. Common pathways for the action of cognitive-behavioral interventions are identified, and a research agenda is set for further conceptual and clinical study.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148509680", "source": "openalex"}

The primary outcome was remission of MDD at study exit, which required both an HRSD17 score < or =7 and absence of the 2 core symptoms of MDD. Sleep was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI), daily sleep diaries, and actigraphy. EsCIT + CBTI resulted in a higher rate of remission of depression (61.5%) than EsCIT + CTRL (33.3%). EsCIT + CBTI was also associated with a greater remission from insomnia (50.0%) than EsCIT + CTRL (7.7%) and larger improvement in all diary and actigraphy measures of sleep, except for total sleep time.This pilot study provides evidence that augmenting an antidepressant medication with a brief, symptom focused, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is promising for individuals with MDD and comorbid insomnia in terms of alleviating both depression and insomnia.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1436801937", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with sleep apnea had high levels of nerve activity even when awake (P < 0.001). Blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity did not fall during any stage of sleep. Mean blood pressure was 92 +/- 4.5 mmHg when awake and reached peak levels of 116 +/- 5 and 127 +/- 7 mmHg during stage II sleep (n = 10) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (n = 5), respectively (P < 0.001).

It has not been determined, however, whether the syndrome is independently related to the risk of stroke or death from any cause after adjustment for other risk factors, including hypertension.In this observational cohort study, consecutive patients underwent polysomnography, and subsequent events (strokes and deaths) were verified. The diagnosis of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was based on an apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or higher (five or more events per hour); patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of less than 5 served as the comparison group. Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the independent effect of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on the composite outcome of stroke or death from any cause.Among 1022 enrolled patients, 697 (68 percent) had the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. At baseline, the mean apnea-hypopnea index in the patients with the syndrome was 35, as compared with a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 2 in the comparison group. In an unadjusted analysis, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was associated with stroke or death from any cause (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.86; P=0.004).

Objective: To test the Berlin Questionnaire as a means of identifying patients with sleep apnea. Design: Survey followed by portable, unattended sleep studies in a subset of patients. Setting: Five primary care sites in Cleveland, Ohio. Patients: 744 adults (of 1008 surveyed [74%]), of whom 100 underwent sleep studies. Measurements: Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). Results: Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI.

Outpatient treatment lasted 8 weeks with follow-ups conducted at 3, 12, and 24 months.SubjectsSeventy-eight adults (50 women, 28 men; mean age, 65 years) with chronic and primary insomnia.InterventionsCognitive-behavior therapy (stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and cognitive therapy) (n=18), pharmacotherapy (temazepam) (n=20), or both (n=20) compared with placebo (n=20).Main Outcome MeasuresTime awake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency as measured by sleep diaries and polysomnography; clinical ratings from subjects, significant others, and clinicians.ResultsThe 3 active treatments were more effective than placebo at posttreatment assessment; there was a trend for the combined approach to improve sleep more than either of its 2 single components (shorter time awake after sleep onset by sleep diary and polysomnography). For example, the percentage reductions of time awake after sleep onset was highest for the combined condition (63.5%), followed by cognitive-behavior therapy (55%), pharmacotherapy (46.5%), and placebo (16.9%). Subjects treated with behavior therapy sustained their clinical gains at follow-up, whereas those treated with drug therapy alone did not.

Cognitive functions particularly affected by sleep loss include psychomotor and cognitive speed, vigilant and executive attention, working memory, and higher cognitive abilities. Chronic sleep-restriction experiments—which model the kind of sleep loss experienced by many individuals with sleep fragmentation and premature sleep curtailment due to disorders and lifestyle—demonstrate that cognitive deficits accumulate to severe levels over time without full awareness by the affected individual. Functional neuroimaging has revealed that frequent and progressively longer cognitive lapses, which are a hallmark of sleep deprivation, involve distributed changes in brain regions including frontal and parietal control areas, secondary sensory processing areas, and thalamic areas. There are robust differences among individuals in the degree of their cognitive vulnerability to sleep loss that may involve differences in prefrontal and parietal cortices, and that may have a basis in genes regulating sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythms. Thus, cognitive deficits believed to be a function of the severity of clinical sleep disturbance may be a product of genetic alleles associated with differential cognitive vulnerability to sleep loss.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159662907", "source": "openalex"}

Insomnia was defined by a complaint of insomnia with duration of >or=1 year, whereas poor sleep was defined as a complaint of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or early final awakening. Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into three categories: >or=6 h of sleep (top 50% of the sample); 5-6 h (approximately third quartile of the sample); and <or=5 h (approximately the bottom quartile of the sample). Diabetes was defined either based on a fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dl or use of medication.

Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain. In the case of subjective-objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more 'sleep-like' EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset-related mesograde amnesia. As a result, the patient with insomnia maintains a level of information and/or memory processing that blurs the phenomenological distinction between sleep and wakefulness and influences retrospective judgments about sleep initiation and duration.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020554589", "source": "openalex"}

Data Sources: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed Clinical Queries from inception to 31 March 2015, supplemented with manual screening. Study Selection: Randomized, controlled trials assessing the efficacy of face-to-face, multimodal CBT-i compared with inactive comparators on overnight sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. Studies of insomnia comorbid with medical, sleep, or psychiatric disorders were excluded. Data Extraction: Study characteristics, quality, and data were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Main outcome measures were sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE%). Data Synthesis: Among 292 citations and 91 full-text articles reviewed, 20 studies (1162 participants [64% female; mean age, 56 years]) were included. Approaches to CBT-i incorporated at least 3 of the following: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. At the posttreatment time point, SOL improved by 19.03 (95% CI, 14.12 to 23.93) minutes, WASO improved by 26.00 (CI, 15.48 to 36.52) minutes, TST improved by 7.61 (CI, −0.51 to 15.74) minutes, and SE% improved by 9.91% (CI, 8.09% to 11.73%).

The following practice parameters update the previous practice parameters published in 2003 for the use of actigraphy in the study of sleep and circadian rhythms. Based upon a systematic grading of evidence, members of the Standards of Practice Committee, including those with expertise in the use of actigraphy, developed these practice parameters as a guide to the appropriate use of actigraphy, both as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of sleep disorders and as an outcome measure of treatment efficacy in clinical settings with appropriate patient populations. Actigraphy provides an acceptably accurate estimate of sleep patterns in normal, healthy adult populations and inpatients suspected of certain sleep disorders. More specifically, actigraphy is indicated to assist in the evaluation of patients with advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS), delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), and shift work disorder. Additionally, there is some evidence to support the use of actigraphy in the evaluation of patients suspected of jet lag disorder and non-24hr sleep/wake syndrome (including that associated with blindness). When polysomnography is not available, actigraphy is indicated to estimate total sleep time in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In patients with insomnia and hypersomnia, there is evidence to support the use of actigraphy in the characterization of circadian rhythms and sleep patterns/disturbances. In assessing response to therapy, actigraphy has proven useful as an outcome measure in patients with circadian rhythm disorders and insomnia. In older adults (including older nursing home residents), in whom traditional sleep monitoring can be difficult, actigraphy is indicated for characterizing sleep and circadian patterns and to document treatment responses. Similarly, in normal infants and children, as well as special pediatric populations, actigraphy has proven useful for delineating sleep patterns and documenting treatment responses. Recent research utilizing actigraphy in the assessment and management of sleep disorders has allowed the development of evidence-based recommendations for the use of actigraphy in the clinical setting.

The scale was distributed to the mothers of 1304 children (1157 controls, mean age 9.8y; 147 sleep disorder subjects, mean age 9.2y, composed of four clinical groups: Insomnia 39 subjects, Hypersomnia 12 subjects, Respiratory disturbances during sleep 25 subjects and Parasomnias 71 subjects). The internal consistency was high in controls (0.79) and remained at a satisfactory level in sleep disorder subjects (0.71); the test/retest reliability was adequate for the total (r = 0.71) and single item scores. The factor analysis (variance explained 44.21%) yielded six factors which represented the most common areas of sleep disorders in childhood and adolescence. Enuresis was the only item with a factor loading lower than 0.40 and with a low inter‐item correlation and was therefore eliminated, resulting in a final scale of 26 items. The re‐evaluation of the sample, using the factor scores, supported the validity and the discriminating capacity of the scales between controls and the four clinical groups. The correlation between factor scores corroborated the hypothesis that childhood sleep disturbances are not independent entities nor do they cluster into different groupings related to each other. The SDSC appears to be a useful tool in evaluating the sleep disturbances of school‐age children in clinical and non‐clinical populations.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964895339", "source": "openalex"}

This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001331727", "source": "openalex"}

It has been estimated that 90% of patients with depression complain about sleep quality. Since the first reports of short rapid eye movement (REM) latency in depressed patients and of the effect of sleep deprivation on depression in the 1970s, numerous sleep studies have provided extensive observations and theoretical hypotheses concerning the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this review is to summarize knowledge regarding the relationships between sleep and depression. Data Sources and Selection: MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches of the literature published in English or French between 1964 and 2005 that examined the relationships between sleep disturbance and depression were conducted. Search terms used were depression, depressive disorder, affective disorder, mood disorders, seasonal affective disorder, sleep, sleep disorders, insomnia, REM, polysomnography, sleep deprivation, electroencephalography, PET, SPECT, and fMRI. Data Synthesis: Two hundred five papers were identified and selected and then integrated into the following categories: sleep architecture, antidepressive therapies, age- and gender-associated differences, functional imaging results, and sleep-related hypotheses explaining the pathophysiology of depression. Conclusion: Numerous studies provide findings indicating the remarkable relationship between sleep alterations and depression. Although the existing hypotheses are not likely to explain all aspects of the sleep alterations in depression, each may be worth being maintained for refinements of pathophysiologic models of depression as new data accumulate. Further research taking into account the heterogeneity of depressive disorder and linking the different areas of research is needed to develop more comprehensive theoretical models and new therapies for depression.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134977136", "source": "openalex"}

Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2803304487", "source": "openalex"}

A systematic review was conducted on 9 studies (8 longitudinal, 1 retrospective) that assessed bidirectionality between a sleep disturbance, and anxiety or depression. Treatment studies were excluded, along with those solely based on clinical samples or cohorts at high risk of suffering from a sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Scopus databases, and reference lists of eligible studies. Publication dates ranged from the beginning of each database to December 2011. Syntheses of longitudinal studies suggested insomnia and sleep quality were bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and depression/anxiety, respectively. Childhood sleep problems significantly predicted higher levels of depression and a combined depression/anxiety variable, but not vice-versa. A one-way relationship was found where anxiety predicted excessive daytime sleepiness, but excessive daytime sleepiness was not associated with depression. Definitive conclusions regarding bidirectionality cannot be made for most sleep disturbances due to the small number and heterogeneity of cohort samples used across studies. Nevertheless, best available evidence suggests insomnia is bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression.

In the presence of an anatomically compromised, collapsible airway, the sleep-induced loss of compensatory tonic input to the upper airway dilator muscle motor neurons leads to collapse of the pharyngeal airway. In turn, the ability of the sleeping subject to compensate for this airway obstruction will determine the degree of cycling of these events. Several of the classic neurotransmitters and a growing list of neuromodulators have now been identified that contribute to neurochemical regulation of pharyngeal motor neuron activity and airway patency. Limited progress has been made in developing pharmacotherapies with acceptable specificity for the treatment of sleep-induced airway obstruction. We review three types of major long-term sequelae to severe OSA that have been assessed in humans through use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment and in animal models via long-term intermittent hypoxemia (IH): 1) cardiovascular. The evidence is strongest to support daytime systemic hypertension as a consequence of severe OSA, with less conclusive effects on pulmonary hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. The underlying mechanisms mediating hypertension include enhanced chemoreceptor sensitivity causing excessive daytime sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, combined with overproduction of superoxide ion and inflammatory effects on resistance vessels. 2) Insulin sensitivity and homeostasis of glucose regulation are negatively impacted by both intermittent hypoxemia and sleep disruption, but whether these influences of OSA are sufficient, independent of obesity, to contribute significantly to the “metabolic syndrome” remains unsettled. 3) Neurocognitive effects include daytime sleepiness and impaired memory and concentration. These effects reflect hypoxic-induced “neural injury.” We discuss future research into understanding the pathophysiology of sleep apnea as a basis for uncovering newer forms of treatment of both the ventilatory disorder and its multiple sequelae.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042592767", "source": "openalex"}

Eight men lived in an environment free of time cues for 33-36 d and were scheduled to a 28 hr rest-activity cycle so that sleep episodes (9.33 hr each) occurred at all phases of the endogenous circadian cycle and variations in wakefulness preceding sleep were minimized. The crest of the robust circadian rhythm of REM sleep, which was observed throughout the sleep episode, was positioned shortly after the minimum of the core body temperature rhythm. Furthermore, a sleep-dependent increase of REM sleep was present, which, interacting with the circadian modulation, resulted in highest values of REM sleep when the end of scheduled sleep episodes coincided with habitual wake-time. Slow-wave activity decreased and sleep spindle activity increased in the course of all sleep episodes. Slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep exhibited a low amplitude circadian modulation which did not parallel the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. Sleep spindle activity showed a marked endogenous circadian rhythm; its crest coincident with the beginning of the habitual sleep episode. Analyses of the (nonadditive) interaction of the circadian and sleep-dependent components of sleep propensity and sleep structure revealed that the phase relation between the sleep-wake cycle and the circadian pacemaker during entrainment promotes the consolidation of sleep and wakefulness and facilitates the transitions between these vigilance states.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1537142000", "source": "openalex"}

Although behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been shown to be effective for insomnia, no placebo-controlled trials have evaluated their separate and combined effects for sleep-onset insomnia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of behavioral and pharmacological therapy, singly and in combination, for chronic sleep-onset insomnia. <h3>Methods</h3> This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that involved 63 young and middle-aged adults with chronic sleep-onset insomnia. Interventions included cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, or combination therapy compared with placebo. The main outcome measures were sleep-onset latency as measured by sleep diaries; secondary measures included sleep diary measures of sleep efficiency and total sleep time, objective measures of sleep variables (Nightcap sleep monitor recorder), and measures of daytime functioning. <h3>Results</h3> In most measures, CBT was the most sleep effective intervention; it produced the greatest changes in sleep-onset latency and sleep efficiency, yielded the largest number of normal sleepers after treatment, and maintained therapeutic gains at long-term follow-up. The combined treatment provided no advantage over CBT alone, whereas pharmacotherapy produced only moderate improvements during drug administration and returned measures toward baseline after drug use discontinuation. <h3>Conclusions</h3> These findings suggest that young and middle-age patients with sleep-onset insomnia can derive significantly greater benefit from CBT than pharmacotherapy and that CBT should be considered a first-line intervention for chronic insomnia.

The present study examined the relationship of stress and coping skills, and the potential mediating role of presleep arousal, to sleep patterns in good sleepers and insomnia sufferers. Methods The sample was composed of 67 participants (38 women, 29 men; mean age, 39.6 years), 40 individuals with insomnia and 27 good sleepers. Subjects completed prospective, daily measures of stressful events, presleep arousal, and sleep for 21 consecutive days. In addition, they completed several retrospective and global measures of depression, anxiety, stressful life events, and coping skills. Results The results showed that poor and good sleepers reported equivalent numbers of minor stressful life events. However, insomniacs rated both the impact of daily minor stressors and the intensity of major negative life events higher than did good sleepers. In addition, insomniacs perceived their lives as more stressful, relied more on emotion-oriented coping strategies, and reported greater presleep arousal than good sleepers. Prospective daily data showed significant relationships between daytime stress and nighttime sleep, but presleep arousal and coping skills played an important mediating role. Conclusions The findings suggest that the appraisal of stressors and the perceived lack of control over stressful events, rather than the number of stressful events per se, enhance the vulnerability to insomnia. Arousal and coping skills play an important mediating role between stress and sleep.

The broad scope of this multispecialty and multinational project is readily apparent. The revision of the original Diagnostic Classification of Sleep and Arousal Disorders , published in 1979, involved surveying members of US and international professional sleep societies, and collating, evaluating, and responding to identified concerns. The result is a comprehensive and usable classification system. In contrast with the four clusters of disorders of the original nosology, primary sleep disorders are now organized into two major groups: dyssomnias and parasomnias.

Between January 2006 and September 2007, the PSQI-BR was applied to a group of consecutive patients who were submitted to overnight polysomnography with clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) or insomnia. As in the original article, a group of patients with depression and a control group were included. The depression group was composed of patients from the Mood Disorders Unit of the Psychiatry Department of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Brazil. The control group was composed of subjects with a history of normal sleep habits, without noticed snoring.A total of 83 patients and 21 controls completed the questionnaire and were submitted to overnight polysomnography. The seven-component scores of the PSQI-BR had an overall reliability coefficient (Cronbach's α) of 0.82, indicating a high degree of internal consistency. The groups included 43 patients with OSAS, 21 with insomnia, 19 with depression and 21 controls. The mean (±SD) PSQI-BR score was 8.1±4.0 for patients with OSAS, 12.8±3.7 for insomnia patients, 14.5±3.7 for those with depression and 2.5±2.0 for control subjects. The one-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in PSQI-BR scores across the four diagnostic groups (p<0.001). Post hoc tests between paired groups showed that scores for OSAS, depression and insomnia were significantly higher than for controls (p<0.05). PSQI-BR scores for insomnia did not differ from those obtained for depression (p>0.05), but both were higher than for OSAS (p<0.05).The results of the present study demonstrate that the PSQI-BR is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of sleep quality and equivalent to its original version when applied to individuals who speak the Brazilian Portuguese language.

An association between short habitual sleep time and increased body mass index (BMI) has been reported in large population samples. The potential role of metabolic hormones in this association is unknown. Methods and Findings Study participants were 1,024 volunteers from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, a population-based longitudinal study of sleep disorders. Participants underwent nocturnal polysomnography and reported on their sleep habits through questionnaires and sleep diaries. Following polysomnography, morning, fasted blood samples were evaluated for serum leptin and ghrelin (two key opposing hormones in appetite regulation), adiponectin, insulin, glucose, and lipid profile. Relationships among these measures, BMI, and sleep duration (habitual and immediately prior to blood sampling) were examined using multiple variable regressions with control for confounding factors. A U-shaped curvilinear association between sleep duration and BMI was observed. In persons sleeping less than 8 h (74.4% of the sample), increased BMI was proportional to decreased sleep. Short sleep was associated with low leptin (p for slope = 0.01), with a predicted 15.5% lower leptin for habitual sleep of 5 h versus 8 h, and high ghrelin (p for slope = 0.008), with a predicted 14.9% higher ghrelin for nocturnal (polysomnographic) sleep of 5 h versus 8 h, independent of BMI. Conclusion Participants with short sleep had reduced leptin and elevated ghrelin. These differences in leptin and ghrelin are likely to increase appetite, possibly explaining the increased BMI observed with short sleep duration. In Western societies, where chronic sleep restriction is common and food is widely available, changes in appetite regulatory hormones with sleep curtailment may contribute to obesity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130357926", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Fifty-seven women with insomnia caused or aggravated by breast cancer were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 27) or a waiting-list control condition (n = 30). The treatment consisted of eight weekly sessions administered in a group and combined the use of stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive therapy, sleep hygiene, and fatigue management. Follow-up evaluations were carried out 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment. Results Participants who received the insomnia treatment had significantly better subjective sleep indices (daily sleep diary, Insomnia Severity Index), a lower frequency of medicated nights, lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater global quality of life at post-treatment compared with participants of the control group after their waiting period.

Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to arousal and sleeplessness in animals and humans; however, there is a paucity of data regarding the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in insomniacs. We hypothesized that chronic insomnia is associated with increased plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol. Eleven young insomniacs (6 men and 5 women) and 13 healthy controls (9 men and 4 women) without sleep disturbances, matched for age and body mass index, were monitored in the sleep laboratory for 4 consecutive nights, whereas serial 24-h plasma measures of ACTH and cortisol were obtained during the fourth day. Insomniacs, compared with controls, slept poorly (significantly higher sleep latency and wake during baseline nights). The 24-h ACTH and cortisol secretions were significantly higher in insomniacs, compared with normal controls (4.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.3 pM, P = 0.04; and 218.0 +/- 11.0 vs. 190.4 +/- 8.3 nM, P = 0.07). Within the 24-h period, the greatest elevations were observed in the evening and first half of the night. Also, insomniacs with a high degree of objective sleep disturbance (% sleep time < 70), compared with those with a low degree of sleep disturbance, secreted a higher amount of cortisol. Pulsatile analysis revealed a significantly higher number of peaks per 24 h in insomniacs than in controls (P < 0.05), whereas cosinor analysis showed no differences in the temporal pattern of ACTH or cortisol secretion between insomniacs and controls. We conclude that insomnia is associated with an overall increase of ACTH and cortisol secretion, which, however, retains a normal circadian pattern. These findings are consistent with a disorder of central nervous system hyperarousal rather than one of sleep loss, which is usually associated with no change or decrease in cortisol secretion or a circadian disturbance. Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in insomnia suggests that insomniacs are at risk not only for mental disorders, i.e. chronic anxiety and depression, but also for significant medical morbidity associated with such activation. The therapeutic goal in insomnia should be to decrease the overall level of physiologic and emotional arousal, and not just to improve the nighttime sleep.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999790218", "source": "openalex"}

Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput.

For example, sleep logs showed that CBT-treated patients achieved an average 54% reduction in their WASO whereas RT-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively, achieved only 16% and 12% reductions in this measure. Recipients of CBT also showed a greater normalization of sleep and subjective symptoms than did the other groups with an average sleep time of more than 6 hours, middle WASO of 26.6 minutes, and sleep efficiency of 85.1%. In contrast, RT-treated patients continued to report a middle WASO of 43.3 minutes and sleep efficiency of 78.8%.ConclusionsOur results suggest that CBT represents a viable intervention for primary sleep-maintenance insomnia. This treatment leads to clinically significant sleep improvements within 6 weeks and these improvements appear to endure through 6 months of follow-up.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090423345", "source": "openalex"}

The extent to which self reports of sleep duration are similar to objective measures and whether individual characteristics influence the degree of similarity are not known. Methods: Eligible participants at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study were invited to participate in a 2003–2005 ancillary sleep study; 82% (n = 669) agreed. Sleep measurements collected in 2 waves included 3 days each of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and questions about usual sleep duration. We estimate the average difference and correlation between subjectively and objectively measured sleep by using errors-in-variables regression models. Results: Average measured sleep was 6 hours, whereas the average from subjective reports was 6.8 hours. Subjective reports increased on average by 34 minutes for each additional hour of measured sleep. Overall, the correlation between reported and measured sleep duration was 0.47. Our model suggests that persons sleeping 5 hours over-reported their sleep duration by 1.2 hours, and those sleeping 7 hours over-reported by 0.4 hours. The correlations and average differences between self-reports and measured sleep varied by health, sociodemographic, and sleep characteristics. Conclusion: In a population-based sample of middle-aged adults, subjective reports of habitual sleep are moderately correlated with actigraph-measured sleep, but are biased by systematic over-reporting.

Microsleeps, sleep attacks, and lapses in cognition increase with sleep loss as a function of state instability. Sleep deprivation studies repeatedly show a variable (negative) impact on mood, cognitive performance, and motor function due to an increasing sleep propensity and destabilization of the wake state. Specific neurocognitive domains including executive attention, working memory, and divergent higher cognitive functions are particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. In humans, functional metabolic and neurophysiological studies demonstrate that neural systems involved in executive function (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are more susceptible to sleep deprivation in some individuals than others. Recent chronic partial sleep deprivation experiments, which more closely replicate sleep loss in society, demonstrate that profound neurocognitive deficits accumulate over time in the face of subjective adaptation to the sensation of sleepiness. Sleep deprivation associated with disease-related sleep fragmentation (i.e., sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome) also results in neurocognitive performance decrements similar to those seen in sleep restriction studies. Performance deficits associated with sleep disorders are often viewed as a simple function of disease severity; however, recent experiments suggest that individual vulnerability to sleep loss may play a more critical role than previously thought.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4235765131", "source": "openalex"}

The questionnaire included the assessment of sleep habits, insomnia symptomatology according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐IV (DSM‐IV) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), associated and sleep/mental disorders and daytime consequences. The overall prevalence of insomnia symptoms occurring at least three nights per week was 37.6%. Difficulty initiating sleep were mentioned by 11.9% of the sample, difficulty maintaining sleep by 31.6%, early morning awakenings by 11.0% and non‐restorative sleep by 7.9% of the sample. Global dissatisfaction with sleep was found in 11.9% of the sample. Daytime consequences (fatigue, mood changes, cognitive difficulties or daytime sleepiness) were reported by 39.9% of participants with insomnia symptoms and 87.6% of those with sleep dissatisfaction. A deterioration of sleep in summer or winter was associated with more complaints of sleep dissatisfaction. Prevalence of any DSM‐IV insomnia diagnosis was 11.7%.

As a consequence, almost 40% of hypnotic medications are prescribed to people over age 60. Yet, hypnotics are often of little benefit in this population. As such, an effective non‐drug alternative could prove important in the management of age‐related sleep maintenance insomnia. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of bright light exposure in the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Design : Following baseline sleep and circadian rhythms assessment, subjects with sleep‐maintenance insomnia were treated with timed exposure to either bright white light or dim red light for 12 consecutive days. Sleep and circadian rhythms recordings were subsequently obtained and measures of sleep quality were compared to assess efficacy of the treatments. Setting : Baseline and post‐treatment sleep and circadian rhythms assessments took place in the Laboratory of Human Chronobiology, Department of Psychiatry, Cornell University Medical College. The treatment phase of the study was conducted in participants' homes. Participants : Sixteen men and women between the ages of 62 and 81 years were studied. All subjects were free of hypnotic medication, and all had experienced sleep disturbance for at least 1 year prior to entering the study. Results : Exposure to bright light resulted in substantial changes in sleep quality. Waking time within sleep was reduced by an hour, and sleep efficiency improved from 77.5% to 90%, without altering time spent in bed. Increased sleep time was in the form of Stage 2 sleep, REM sleep, and slow wave sleep. The effects were remarkably consistent across subjects. Conclusions : The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of timed exposure to bright light in the treatment of age‐related sleep maintenance insomnia.

For areas not covered by the practice parameters, the task force performed a literature review and made consensus recommendations using a modified nominal group technique.Questions regarding OSA should be incorporated into routine health evaluations. Suspicion of OSA should trigger a comprehensive sleep evaluation. The diagnostic strategy includes a sleep-oriented history and physical examination, objective testing, and education of the patient. The presence or absence and severity of OSA must be determined before initiating treatment in order to identify those patients at risk of developing the complications of sleep apnea, guide selection of appropriate treatment, and to provide a baseline to establish the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Once the diagnosis is established, the patient should be included in deciding an appropriate treatment strategy that may include positive airway pressure devices, oral appliances, behavioral treatments, surgery, and/or adjunctive treatments. OSA should be approached as a chronic disease requiring long-term, multidisciplinary management. For each treatment option, appropriate outcome measures and long-term follow-up are described.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W45054581", "source": "openalex"}

Ss were either chronic insomniacs (n = 74) or self-defined good sleepers (n = 71). They rated their level of agreement or disagreement (visual analog scale) with 28 statements tapping various beliefs, expectations, and attributions about several sleep-related themes. The results showed that insomniacs endorsed stronger beliefs about the negative consequences of insomnia, expressed more hopelessness about the fear of losing control of their sleep, and more helplessness about its unpredictability. These findings suggest that some beliefs and attitudes about sleep may be instrumental in perpetuating insomnia.

Usual sleep time was obtained by standardized questionnaire. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a serum glucose level of 126 mg/dL or more (> or =7.0 mmol/L) fasting or 200 mg/dL or more (> or =11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours following standard oral glucose challenge or medication use for DM. Impaired glucose tolerance was defined as a 2-hour postchallenge glucose level of 140 mg/dL or more (> or =7.8 mmol/L) and less than 200 mg/dL. The relation of sleep time to DM and IGT was examined using categorical logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, race, body habitus, and apnea-hypopnea index.The median sleep time was 7 hours per night, with 27.1% of subjects sleeping 6 hours or less per night. Compared with those sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night, subjects sleeping 5 hours or less and 6 hours per night had adjusted odds ratios for DM of 2.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.57-4.02) and 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.39), respectively.

Subjects sleeping 9 hours or more per night also had increased odds ratios for DM and IGT. These associations persisted when subjects with insomnia symptoms were excluded.A sleep duration of 6 hours or less or 9 hours or more is associated with increased prevalence of DM and IGT.

We included studies if they were prospective with follow-up &amp;gt;3 years and had an assessment of sleep disturbances at baseline and incidence of type 2 diabetes. We recorded several characteristics for each study. We extracted quantity and quality of sleep, how they were assessed, and incident cases defined with different validated methods. We extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CI and pooled them using random-effects models. We performed sensitivity analysis and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS We included 10 studies (13 independent cohort samples; 107,756 male and female participants, follow-up range 4.2–32 years, and 3,586 incident cases of type 2 diabetes). In pooled analyses, quantity and quality of sleep predicted the risk of development of type 2 diabetes. For short duration of sleep (≤5–6 h/night), the RR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.03–1.60, P = 0.024, heterogeneity P = 0.015); for long duration of sleep (&amp;gt;8–9 h/night), the RR was 1.48 (1.13–1.96, P = 0.005); for difficulty in initiating sleep, the RR was 1.57 (1.25–1.97, P &amp;lt; 0.0001); and for difficulty in maintaining sleep, the RR was 1.84 (1.39–2.43, P &amp;lt; 0.0001).

Participants reported the number of stressful events they encountered at baseline (Time 1), as well as the level of cognitive intrusion they experienced in response to each stressor. Stressful events (OR = 1.13; P < 0.01) and stress-induced cognitive intrusion (OR = 1.61; P < 0.01) were significant predictors of risk for insomnia one year hence (Time 2). Intrusion mediated the effects of stressful events on risk for insomnia (P < 0.05). Trait sleep reactivity significantly increased risk for insomnia (OR = 1.78; P < 0.01). Further, sleep reactivity moderated the effects of stress-induced intrusion (P < 0.05), such that the risk for insomnia as a function of intrusion was significantly higher in individuals with high sleep reactivity. Trait sleep reactivity also constituted a significant risk for depression (OR = 1.67; P < 0.01) two years later (Time 3). Insomnia at Time 2 significantly mediated this effect (P < 0.05). This study suggests that premorbid sleep reactivity is a significant risk factor for incident insomnia, and that it triggers insomnia by exacerbating the effects of stress-induced intrusion. Sleep reactivity is also a precipitant of depression, as mediated by insomnia. These findings support the stress-diathesis model of insomnia, while highlighting sleep reactivity as an important diathesis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2319798593", "source": "openalex"}

Random-digit dialing techniques were used to assess individuals regarding their current work schedules and a variety of sleep- and non—sleep-related outcomes. Detroit tricounty population. A total of 2,570 individuals aged 18 to 65 years from a representative community-based sample including 360 people working rotating shifts, 174 people working nights, and 2036 working days. Using standardized techniques, individuals were assessed for the presence of insomnia and excessive sleepiness, based on DSM-IV and ICSD criteria. Those individuals with either insomnia or excessive sleepiness and who were currently working rotating or night schedules were classified as having shift work sleep disorder. Occupational, behavioral, and health-related outcomes were also measurd. Individuals who met criteria for shift work sleep disorder had significantly higher rates of ulcers (odds ratio = 4.18, 95% confidence interval = 2.00–8.72), sleepiness-related accidents, absenteeism, depression, and missed family and social activities more frequently compared to those shift workers who did not meet criteria (P < .05). Importantly, in most cases, the morbidity associated with shift work sleep disorder was significantly greater than that experienced by day workers with identical symptoms. These findings suggest that individuals with shift work sleep disorder are at risk for significant behavioral and health-related morbidity associated with their sleep-wake symptomatology.

The results show that NREM power, for all frequencies below the beta range, has slower rise rates and reaches lower levels in the insomniac group, whereas beta power is significantly increased. In REM, insomniacs show lower levels in the delta and theta bands, whereas power in the faster frequency bands is significantly increased. Thus, the pathophysiology of insomnia is characterized not only by the generally acknowledged slow wave deficiency, but also by an excessive hyperarousal of the central nervous system throughout the night, affecting both REM and NREM sleep. This hyperarousal is interpreted in terms of the neuronal group theory of sleep which provides a possible explanation for the discrepancies observed between subjective impressions and objective measures of sleep. Also, it is suggested that the progressive hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical neurons as sleep deepens is slower in the patient population and that this may explain the observed slow wave deficiency. The homeostatic control of slow wave activity, on the other hand, would appear to be intact in the patient population.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2028428817", "source": "openalex"}

In the preliminary study described here, we evaluated the extent to which symptoms of stress and depression are associated with subjective sleep complaints and quantitative measures of sleep in individuals with chronic insomnia. Methods: Subjects were 14 healthy adults who met criteria for primary insomnia as specified in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Measures of stress, depression, and subjective sleep quality were collected before subjects participated in a two-night laboratory sleep series. We hypothesized that elevated symptoms of stress and depression would be associated with subjective sleep complaints and electroencephalographic evidence of hyperarousal during sleep. Hyperarousal during sleep was defined as decreases in delta power and elevations in alpha and beta power throughout non–rapid eye movement sleep, and symptoms of stress were defined as the tendency to experience stress-related intrusive thoughts and the interaction between intrusion tendency and the number of recent stressful events (subjective stress burden). Results: A stronger tendency to experience stress-related intrusive thoughts was associated with greater sleep complaints and a trend toward higher beta power, whereas increases in subjective stress burden were associated with decreases in delta power. In addition, elevations in subclinical symptoms of depression were associated with greater sleep complaints and elevations in alpha power. Conclusions: Observed relationships among symptoms of stress, depression, subjective sleep complaints, and electroencephalographic power may be relevant to the discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep in patients with insomnia and may be more broadly applicable to sleep complaints in association with stressful life events and major depression.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2065546220", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2000693195", "title": "Control of Sleep and Wakefulness", "text": "This review summarizes the brain mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness. Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2000693195", "source": "openalex"}

Findings in both cross-sectional and cohort studies of children suggested short sleep duration is strongly and consistently associated with concurrent and future obesity. Results from adult cross-sectional analyses were more mixed with 17 of 23 studies supporting an independent association between short sleep duration and increased weight. In contrast, all three longitudinal studies in adults found a positive association between short sleep duration and future weight. This relationship appeared to wane with age.Short sleep duration appears independently associated with weight gain, particularly in younger age groups.

This paper reviews recent research on the effects of chronic sleep restriction on neurobehavioral and physiological functioning and discusses implications for health and lifestyle. Restricting sleep below an individual's optimal time in bed (TIB) can cause a range of neurobehavioral deficits, including lapses of attention, slowed working memory, reduced cognitive throughput, depressed mood, and perseveration of thought. Neurobehavioral deficits accumulate across days of partial sleep loss to levels equivalent to those found after 1 to 3 nights of total sleep loss. Recent experiments reveal that following days of chronic restriction of sleep duration below 7 hours per night, significant daytime cognitive dysfunction accumulates to levels comparable to that found after severe acute total sleep deprivation. Additionally, individual variability in neurobehavioral responses to sleep restriction appears to be stable, suggesting a trait-like (possibly genetic) differential vulnerability or compensatory changes in the neurobiological systems involved in cognition. A causal role for reduced sleep duration in adverse health outcomes remains unclear, but laboratory studies of healthy adults subjected to sleep restriction have found adverse effects on endocrine functions, metabolic and inflammatory responses, suggesting that sleep restriction produces physiological consequences that may be unhealthy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W84689042", "source": "openalex"}

Overall patterns in the literature suggest that over-active neurobiological and psychological systems contribute to difficulty sleeping. Even so, mixed results regarding the specific mechanisms linking hyperarousal to sleep disturbance limit current etiological conceptualizations. Similar basal arousal profiles between individuals with high vs low risk for insomnia in the absence of stress exposure suggest that dysregulated stress “response” rather than general hyperarousal may be a more pertinent marker of risk. In this report, we discuss evidence for hyperarousal in insomnia and explore the role of sleep reactivity. A trait characteristic, sleep reactivity is the degree to which stress disrupts sleep, manifesting as difficulty falling and staying asleep. Premorbid sleep reactivity has been shown to identify individuals at risk for future insomnia disorder, such as highly reactive sleepers (whose sleep systems are sensitive to stress) who are at elevated disease risk. Research points to genetics, family history of insomnia, gender, and environmental stress as factors that influence sleep reactivity. Importantly, stress-related cognitive–emotional reactivity (e.g., rumination, worry) may exploit the vulnerability of a highly reactive sleep system. We propose that sleep reactivity and cognitive–emotional reactivity may share a bidirectional relationship, conferring an insalubrious environment for sleep in response to stress. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to identify its neurobiology, characterize its relationship with cognitive–emotional reactivity, and explore the potential clinical utility of sleep reactivity in treatment planning.

Current insomnia was associated with significantly greater functional impairment (according to both Brief Disability Questionnaire and Social Disability Schedule), more days of disability due to health problems, and greater general medical service utilization. While insomnia was associated with depressive disorder and chronic medical illness, adjustment for these factors only partially accounted for the association of insomnia with disability and with health care utilization. Of the patients with current insomnia, 28% received any psychotropic drug; 14% received benzodiazepines and 19% received antidepressants.Insomnia among primary care patients is associated with greater functional impairment, lost productivity, and excess health care utilization.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1273834102", "source": "openalex"}

As well as the subjective experience of sleep symptoms, there are well-documented changes in objective sleep architecture in depression. Mechanisms of sleep regulation and how they might be disturbed in depression are discussed. The sleep symptoms are often unresolved by treatment, and confer a greater risk of relapse and recurrence.

The effects of age on the severity of apnea are unknown. This study was based on a two-stage general random sample of men (aged 20 to 100 yr), consisting of a telephone survey (n = 4,364) and a sleep laboratory evaluation of a survey subsample (n = 741). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), based on both sleep laboratory and clinical criteria (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] ⩾ 10 and the presence of daytime symptoms) was found in 3.3% of the sample, with its maximum prevalence in the middle age group (45 to 64 yr). Also, based solely on laboratory criteria, the prevalence of OSA (obstructive AHI ⩾ 20) showed an age distribution similar to that of OSA diagnosed by laboratory and clinical criteria. The prevalence of any type of sleep apnea (central and obstructive) increased monotonically with age. However, central apnea appeared to account for this monotonic relationship with age. Severity of sleep apnea, as indicated by both number of events and minimum oxygen saturation, decreased with age when any sleep apnea criteria were used and when controlling for body mass index (BMI). The study shows that the prevalence of sleep apnea tends to increase with age but that the clinical significance (severity) of apnea decreases. On the basis of these findings, the sleep laboratory criteria used for diagnosis of sleep apnea should be adjusted for age.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148345618", "source": "openalex"}

Sixty‐six normal volunteers spent either 3 ( n = 18), 5 ( n = 16), 7 ( n = 16), or 9 h ( n = 16) daily time in bed (TIB) for 7 days (restriction/augmentation) followed by 3 days with 8 h daily TIB (recovery). In the 3‐h group, speed (mean and fastest 10% of responses) on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) declined, and PVT lapses (reaction times greater than 500 ms) increased steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction. In the 7‐ and 5‐h groups speed initially declined, then appeared to stabilize at a reduced level; lapses were increased only in the 5‐h group. In the 9‐h group, speed and lapses remained at baseline levels. During recovery, PVT speed in the 7‐ and 5‐h groups (and lapses in the 5‐h group) remained at the stable, but reduced levels seen during the last days of the experimental phase, with no evidence of recovery. Speed and lapses in the 3‐h group recovered rapidly following the first night of recovery sleep; however, recovery was incomplete with speed and lapses stabilizing at a level comparable with the 7‐ and 5‐h groups. Performance in the 9‐h group remained at baseline levels during the recovery phase. These results suggest that the brain adapts to chronic sleep restriction. In mild to moderate sleep restriction this adaptation is sufficient to stabilize performance, although at a reduced level. These adaptive changes are hypothesized to restrict brain operational capacity and to persist for several days after normal sleep duration is restored, delaying recovery.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094761105", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects fell into three groups according to presence of insomnia symptom (s) and/or sleep dissatisfaction. Results Insomnia symptoms occurred in 36.2% of subjects. Most of these (75.9%), however, reported no sleep dissatisfaction. In comparison, those also with sleep dissatisfaction had higher prevalence of sleep and mental disorders and longer duration of insomnia symptoms, and were more likely to take sleep-promoting medication, dread bedtime, and complain of light sleep, poor night-time sleep and daytime sleepiness.

Extracted results included quantitative sleep outcomes, as well as psychological outcomes and adverse effects when available. Evidence base quality was assessed using GRADE. Five studies met criteria for analysis. Low to moderate grade evidence suggests CBT-I has superior effectiveness to benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs in the long term, while very low grade evidence suggests benzodiazepines are more effective in the short term. Very low grade evidence supports use of CBT-I to improve psychological outcomes.

It is unclear how much of the morbidity can be accounted for by the associated psychiatric and substance abuse disorders and medical problems, and how much by the sleep problems per se. Sleep problems may also be an early sign of a psychiatric problem. This paper reports data from an epidemiologic community survey of over 10,000 adults living in three U.S. communities. A structured diagnostic assessment of psychiatric disorders as well as assessment of the presence of insomnia not due to medical conditions, medication, drug or alcohol abuse, and a 1-year follow-up were completed. Persons with insomnia in the past year without any psychiatric disorders ever (uncomplicated insomnia); with a psychiatric disorder in the past year (complicated insomnia); and with neither insomnia nor psychiatric disorders ever were compared on treatment utilization and the first onset of a psychiatric disorder in the subsequent year. Eight percent of those with uncomplicated as compared with 14.9% with complicated insomnia and 2.5% with neither had sought treatment from the general medical sector for emotional problems in the 6 months prior to the interview. The rates of treatment sought from the psychiatric specialty sector were 3.8%, 9.4%, and 1.2%, respectively. These differences were significant after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and were sustained when the persons were interviewed 1 year later. Uncomplicated insomnia was also associated with an increase in risk for first onset of major depression, panic disorder, and alcohol abuse over the following year. Insomnia, even in the absence of psychiatric disorders, is associated with increased use of general medical and mental health treatment for emotional problems and for the subsequent first onset in the following year of some psychiatric disorders. Early diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated insomnia may be useful.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077240469", "source": "openalex"}

METHOD: The subjects were 172 men and women receiving treatment for alcohol dependence. They completed a sleep questionnaire, measures of alcohol problem severity and depression severity, and polysomnography after at least 2 weeks of abstinence. RESULTS: On the basis of eight items from the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, 61% of the subjects were classified as having symptomatic insomnia during the 6 months before treatment entry. Compared to patients without insomnia, patients with insomnia were more likely to report frequent alcohol use for sleep (55% versus 28%), had significantly worse polysomnographic measures of sleep continuity, and had more severe alcohol dependence and depression. Among 74 alcoholics who were followed a mean of 5 months after treatment, 60% with baseline insomnia versus 30% without baseline insomnia relapsed to any use of alcohol, a significant difference. Insomnia remained a robust predictor of relapse after application of logistic regression analysis to control for other variables. A history of self-medicating insomnia with alcohol did not significantly predict subsequent relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of alcoholic patients entering treatment reported insomnia symptoms.

Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137303544", "source": "openalex"}

It is based on a sleep-regulating variable (S)--possibly, but not necessarily, associated with a neurochemical substance--which increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. Sleep onset is triggered when S approaches an upper threshold (H); awakening occurs when S reaches a lower threshold (L). The thresholds show a circadian rhythm controlled by a single circadian pacemaker. Time constants of the S process were derived from rates of change of electroencephalographic (EEG) power density during regular sleep and during recovery from sleep deprivation. The waveform of the circadian threshold fluctuations was derived from spontaneous wake-up times after partial sleep deprivation. The model allows computer simulations of the main phenomena of human sleep timing, such as 1) internal desynchronization in the absence of time cues, 2) sleep fragmentation during continuous bed rest, and 3) circadian phase dependence of sleep duration during isolation from time cues, recovery from sleep deprivation, and shift work.

SSS ratings, subscale scores for fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance from the POMS and VAS ratings of mental exhaustion and stress were evaluated across days of restricted sleep (p = 0.009 to p = 0.0001). PVT performance parameters, including the frequency and duration of lapses, were also significantly increased by restriction (p = 0.018 to p = 0.0001). Significant time-of-day effects were evident in SSS and PVT data, but time-of-day did not interact with the effects of sleep restriction across days. The temporal profiles of cumulative changes in neurobehavioral measures of alertness as a function of sleep restriction were generally consistent. Subjective changes tended to precede performance changes by 1 day, but overall changes in both classes of measure were greatest during the first 2 days (P1, P2) and last 2 days (P6, P7) of sleep restriction. Data from subsets of subjects also showed: 1) that significant decreases in the MSLT occurred during sleep restriction, 2) that the elevated sleepiness and performance deficits continued beyond day 7 of restriction, and 3) that recovery from these deficits appeared to require two full nights of sleep. The cumulative increase in performance lapses across days of sleep restriction correlated closely with MSLT results (r = -0.95) from an earlier comparable experiment by Carskadon and Dement (1). These findings suggest that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt had a dynamic and escalating analog in cumulative daytime sleepiness and that asymptotic or steady-state sleepiness was not achieved in response to sleep restriction.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1855097856", "source": "openalex"}

Studies were included if they were prospective, follow-up >3 years, had duration of sleep at baseline, and incident cases of CHD, stroke, or CVD. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a random-effect model. Overall, 15 studies (24 cohort samples) included 474 684 male and female participants (follow-up 6.9–25 years), and 16 067 events (4169 for CHD, 3478 for stroke, and 8420 for total CVD). Sleep duration was assessed by questionnaire and incident cases through certification and event registers. Short duration of sleep was associated with a greater risk of developing or dying of CHD (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22–1.80, P < 0.0001), stroke (1.15, 1.00–1.31, P = 0.047), but not total CVD (1.03, 0.93–1.15, P = 0.52) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.95, P = 0.30, and P = 0.46, respectively).

In this first epidemiologic study of insomnia defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria in a US sample of adolescents, we estimated lifetime prevalence of insomnia, examined chronicity and onset, and explored the role of pubertal development.Data come from a random sample of 1014 adolescents who were 13 to 16 years of age, selected from households in a 400000-member health maintenance organization encompassing metropolitan Detroit. Response rate was 71.2%. The main outcome measured was DSM-IV-defined insomnia.Lifetime prevalence of insomnia was 10.7%. A total of 88% of adolescents with a history of insomnia reported current insomnia. The median age of onset of insomnia was 11. Of those with insomnia, 52.8% had a comorbid psychiatric disorder. In exploratory analyses of insomnia and pubertal development, onset of menses was associated with a 2.75-fold increased risk for insomnia. There was no difference in risk for insomnia among girls before menses onset relative to boys, but a difference emerged after menses onset. In contrast, maturational development was not associated with insomnia in boys.Insomnia seems to be common and chronic among adolescents.

It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2236052756", "source": "openalex"}

These practice parameters were developed to guide the sleep clinician on appropriate clinical use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). These recommendations replace those published in 1992 in a position paper produced by the American Sleep Disorders Association. A Task Force of content experts was appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to perform a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and grade the evidence regarding the clinical use of the MSLT and the MWT. Practice parameters were developed based on this review and in most cases evidence based methods were used to support recommendations. When data were insufficient or inconclusive, the collective opinion of experts was used to support recommendations. These recommendations were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The MSLT is indicated as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected narcolepsy and may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia. The MSLT is not routinely indicated in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or in assessment of change following treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The MSLT is not routinely indicated for evaluation of sleepiness in medical and neurological disorders (other than narcolepsy), insomnia, or circadian rhythm disorders. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. For this reason, the sleep clinician should not rely solely on mean sleep latency as a single indicator of impairment or risk for accidents, but should also rely on clinical judgment. Assessment should involve integration of findings from the clinical history, compliance with treatment, and, in some cases, objective testing using the MWT. These practice parameters also include recommendations for the MSLT and MWT protocols, a discussion of the normative data available for both tests, and a description of issues that need further study.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W183461293", "source": "openalex"}

The current meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the size of the association generally as well as between more specific relationships.Data Sources: Electronic databases for years 1966-2011 were searched to identify candidate studies using PubMed search terms suicide and sleep or sleep initiation/maintenance disorders or dreams or nightmares or sleep disorders/psychology or sleep disorders/epidemiology as well as Ovid search terms suicide and sleep or insomnia or nightmares. The search was supplemented by cross-referencing from identified articles and reviews.Study Selection: Original studies reporting both sleep disturbance and suicide outcomes were identified with 39 of 98 studies (40%) comprising 147,753 subjects selected for inclusion.Data Extraction: Data were extracted by multiple independent observers and verified by a study author. The meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. The size of associations was calculated for all types of sleep disturbances and suicide outcomes combined and for more specific categories including nightmares, insomnia, and insomnia subtypes and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Moderator effects were evaluated.Results: Overall, sleep disturbance was significantly associated with an increased relative risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide ranging from 1.95 (95% CI, 1.41-2.69) to a relative risk of 2.95 (95% CI, 2.48-3.50) in unadjusted studies. Associations were smaller, but remained highly significant among adjusted studies. Depression did not moderate the association between sleep and suicide variables.Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports an association between sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Sleep disturbances in general, as well as insomnia and nightmares individually, appear to represent a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behavior. This proposition is further bolstered by the result that depression did not show risk moderation.J Clin Psychiatry 2012;73(9):e1160-e1167© Copyright 2012 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Submitted: December 7, 2011; accepted April 30, 2012 (doi:10.4088/JCP.11r07586).Corresponding author: Wilfred R.

Endpoints included sleep latency; total sleep time; number of awakenings; wake time after sleep onset; quality of sleep; and next-day ratings of ability to function, daytime alertness, and sense of physical well-being. At the first week and each month for the study duration, eszopiclone produced significant and sustained improvements in sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings, number of nights awakened per week, total sleep time, and quality of sleep compared with placebo (P ≤ 0.003). Monthly ratings of next-day function, alertness, and sense of physical well-being were also significantly better with the use of eszopiclone than with placebo (P ≤ 0.002). There was no evidence of tolerance, and the most common adverse events were unpleasant taste and headache.

Priority was given to large prospective cohort studies and to randomized controlled trials.We identified 154 original investigations and reviews of sleep-related breathing disorders. Data from these studies were examined for relevance and extracted by one of the authors.Approximately 1 in 5 adults has at least mild OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [ie, the number of apneic and hypopneic events per hour], 5-15), and 1 in 15 adults has at least moderate OSA (apnea-hypopnea index, 15-30). Repetitive apneic events disrupt the normal physiologic interactions between sleep and the cardiovascular system. Such sleep fragmentation, as well as abnormalities evident in patients with OSA (eg, increased sympathetic activation, vascular endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, inflammation, increased platelet aggregability, metabolic dysregulation), may be implicated in the initiation and progression of cardiac and vascular disease. Persuasive data implicate OSA in the development of hypertension, and OSA also may contribute to cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps also to cerebrovascular disease and stroke.Obstructive sleep apnea is common, readily diagnosed, and usually treatable. It frequently coexists undiagnosed in patients with cardiovascular disease, activates disease mechanisms known to elicit cardiac and vascular damage, and may be implicated in progression of cardiovascular disease and resistance to conventional therapeutic strategies. In the absence of definitive evidence from large-scale trials and a better understanding of potential cost-effectiveness, the likely benefits of diagnosis and treatment of OSA are presently best appraised on an individualized patient basis.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009948616", "source": "openalex"}

Problems with sleep are widely prevalent and include deficits in quantity and quality of sleep; sleep problems that impact the continuity of sleep are collectively referred to as sleep disruptions. Numerous factors contribute to sleep disruption, ranging from lifestyle and environmental factors to sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Sleep disruptions have substantial adverse short- and long-term health consequences. A literature search was conducted to provide a nonsystematic review of these health consequences (this review was designed to be nonsystematic to better focus on the topics of interest due to the myriad parameters affected by sleep). Sleep disruption is associated with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, metabolic effects, changes in circadian rhythms, and proinflammatory responses. In otherwise healthy adults, short-term consequences of sleep disruption include increased stress responsivity, somatic pain, reduced quality of life, emotional distress and mood disorders, and cognitive, memory, and performance deficits. For adolescents, psychosocial health, school performance, and risk-taking behaviors are impacted by sleep disruption. Behavioral problems and cognitive functioning are associated with sleep disruption in children. Long-term consequences of sleep disruption in otherwise healthy individuals include hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, weight-related issues, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and colorectal cancer. All-cause mortality is also increased in men with sleep disturbances. For those with underlying medical conditions, sleep disruption may diminish the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents and may worsen the severity of common gastrointestinal disorders. As a result of the potential consequences of sleep disruption, health care professionals should be cognizant of how managing underlying medical conditions may help to optimize sleep continuity and consider prescribing interventions that minimize sleep disruption.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2615609848", "source": "openalex"}

In this review, we highlight the treatment of sleep disturbance before, during and after depression, which probably plays an important role in improving outcomes and preventing the recurrence of depression. In clinical practice, pharmacological therapies, including hypnotics and antidepressants, and non‐pharmacological therapies are typically applied.

Fortunately, cognitive‐behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I) has been shown to be an effective treatment in this population. However, it is rarely implemented given its limited availability. To address this barrier, we examined the ability of an easily accessible online CBT‐I program to improve insomnia symptoms in cancer survivors. Methods : Twenty‐eight cancer survivors with insomnia were randomly assigned to either an Internet insomnia intervention ( n = 14) or to a waitlist control group ( n = 14). The online program, Sleep Healthy Using The Internet, delivers the primary components of CBT‐I (sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse prevention). Pre‐ and post‐assessment data were collected via online questionnaires and daily sleep diaries. Results : Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post‐assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity ( F 1,26 = 22.8; p &lt;0.001), sleep efficiency ( F 1,24 = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency ( F 1,24 = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep ( F 1,24 = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening ( F 1,24 = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue ( F 1,26 = 13.88; P = 0.001). Although other group × time interactions were not significant, overall adjusted effect sizes for all sleep variables as well as for fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life ranged from small to large. Conclusions : CBT‐I delivered through an interactive, individually tailored Internet intervention may be a viable treatment option for cancer survivors experiencing insomnia.

Based on all this information, the patients were then diagnosed according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Averaged over the 3 nights for each insomniac, the mean discrepancy between actigram and PSG was 49 minutes per night. In three-fourths of the cases, actigram and PSG agreed to within 1 hour on the total amount of sleep per night. Discrepancies, however, were not random: In patients with psychophysiologic insomnia and in insomnia associated with psychiatric disease, the actigram typically overestimated sleep when compared with the PSG. In patients with sleep-state misperception, the actigram was either quite accurate or it underestimated sleep when compared with the PSG. Comparing laboratory with home sleep, one-third of all insomniacs slept better in the laboratory and two-thirds slept better at home. In addition, night-by-night variability was higher at home than in the laboratory.

The average follow-up period for the cohort was 8.2 y during which 1,047 participants (587 men and 460 women) died. Compared to those without sleep-disordered breathing (AHI: <5 events/h), the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in those with mild (AHI: 5.0-14.9 events/h), moderate (AHI: 15.0-29.9 events/h), and severe (AHI: >or=30.0 events/h) sleep-disordered breathing were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-1.08), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.97-1.42), and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.14-1.86), respectively.

Comorbid outcomes yielded a small effect size (Hedges g = 0.39 [95% CI, 0.60-0.98]; P < .001); improvements were greater in psychiatric than in medical populations (Hedges g = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.09-0.30]; χ2 test for interaction = 12.30; P < .001).Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is efficacious for improving insomnia symptoms and sleep parameters for patients with comorbid insomnia. A small to medium positive effect was found across comorbid outcomes, with larger effects on psychiatric conditions compared with medical conditions. Large-scale studies with more rigorous designs to reduce detection and performance bias are needed to improve the quality of the evidence.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1574691271", "source": "openalex"}

The study of how sleep regulatory networks are conserved is needed to better understand sleep across evolution. We present a detailed description of a sleep state in adult zebrafish characterized by reversible periods of immobility, increased arousal threshold, and place preference. Rest deprivation using gentle electrical stimulation is followed by a sleep rebound, indicating homeostatic regulation. In contrast to mammals and similarly to birds, light suppresses sleep in zebrafish, with no evidence for a sleep rebound. We also identify a null mutation in the sole receptor for the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) in zebrafish. Fish lacking this receptor demonstrate short and fragmented sleep in the dark, in striking contrast to the excessive sleepiness and cataplexy of narcolepsy in mammals. Consistent with this observation, we find that the hypocretin receptor does not colocalize with known major wake-promoting monoaminergic and cholinergic cell groups in the zebrafish. Instead, it colocalizes with large populations of GABAergic neurons, including a subpopulation of Adra2a-positive GABAergic cells in the anterior hypothalamic area, neurons that could assume a sleep modulatory role. Our study validates the use of zebrafish for the study of sleep and indicates molecular diversity in sleep regulatory networks across vertebrates.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1996214950", "source": "openalex"}

Why is this so? To investigate whether changes in cortical information transmission play a role, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography and asked how the activation of one cortical area (the premotor area) is transmitted to the rest of the brain. During quiet wakefulness, an initial response (∼15 milliseconds) at the stimulation site was followed by a sequence of waves that moved to connected cortical areas several centimeters away. During non–rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response was stronger but was rapidly extinguished and did not propagate beyond the stimulation site. Thus, the fading of consciousness during certain stages of sleep may be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978476682", "source": "openalex"}

There are six items, of which the first three pertain to sleep onset, maintenance, and early morning wakening insomnia, respectively. The last three items refer to not feeling adequately rested, experiencing daytime impairment, and being dissatisfied with current sleep. This scale was validated in three samples, 320 students, 2645 community persons, and 225 patients. Cronbach alphas in the three samples were .79, .87, and .80, respectively. The 2-wk. test-retest reliability for students was .77. In the student and the patient samples, a two-factor solution was found, nocturnal symptoms and daytime symptoms, but in the community sample, a one-factor solution was found. The Bergen Insomnia Scale discriminated well between the patient sample and the other two. In all three, values of convergent and discriminative validity in relation to other self-report measures were good, as well as in relation to polysomnographic data for patients.

Arterial pressure was measured directly. A transient rise of arterial pressure up to 30 mm Hg was produced by the sudden intravenous injection of 0.25 to 2 µg of angiotensin. Linear plots were obtained in 10 of 13 subjects when the systolic pressures of successive pulses during the pressure rise were plotted against the pulse intervals which began the next beat. The relationship was disturbed by movement or arousal, and was better when pulse intervals falling in inspiration were discarded. The slope of the line (milliseconds of cardiac slowing per millimeter rise in systolic pressure) in the awake subject ranged from 2 to 15.5 msec/mm Hg, and from 4.5 to 28.9 during sleep. Reflex sensitivity was highest in dreaming sleep. In 7 of 10 subjects, baroreflex sensitivity increased significantly during sleep; in 6, the prevailing arterial pressure was inversely correlated with the baroreflex sensitivity. The pressure appeared to be the dependent variable. It is concluded that the baroreceptor reflex are can be rapidly reset, particularly during sleep.

There are numerous evidence that BDNF expression is decreased by experiencing psychological stress and that, accordingly, a lack of neurotrophic support causes major depression. Furthermore, disruption in sleep homeostatic processes results in higher stress vulnerability and is often associated with stress-related mental disorders. Recently, we reported, for the first time, a relationship between BDNF and insomnia and sleep deprivation (SD). Using a biphasic stress model as explanation approach, we discuss here the hypothesis that chronic stress might induce a deregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. In the long-term it leads to sleep disturbance and depression as well as decreased BDNF levels, whereas acute stress like SD can be used as therapeutic intervention in some insomniac or depressed patients as compensatory process to normalize BDNF levels. Indeed, partial SD (PSD) induced a fast increase in BDNF serum levels within hours after PSD which is similar to effects seen after ketamine infusion, another fast-acting antidepressant intervention, while traditional antidepressants are characterized by a major delay until treatment response as well as delayed BDNF level increase.Key messagesBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders.The interplay of stress and sleep impacts on BDNF level.Partial sleep deprivation (PSD) shows a fast action on BDNF level increase.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2253188864", "source": "openalex"}

(1) Tonic discharge co-varied with stages of the S-WC, being highest during waking, lower during slow wave sleep, and virtually absent during paradoxical sleep. (2) Discharge anticipated S-WC stages as well as phasic cortical activity, such as spindles, during slow wave sleep. (3) Discharge decreased within active waking during grooming and sweet water consumption. (4) Bursts of impulses accompanied spontaneous or sensory-evoked interruptions of sleep, grooming, consumption, or other such ongoing behavior. (5) These characteristic discharge properties were topographically homogeneous for recordings throughout the NE-LC. (6) Phasic robust activity was synchronized markedly among neurons in multiple unit populations. (7) Field potentials occurred spontaneously in the NE-LC and were synchronized with bursts of unit activity from the same electrodes. (8) Field potentials became dissociated from unit activity during paradoxical sleep, exhibiting their highest rates in the virtual absence of impulses. These results are generally consistent with previous proposals that the NE-LC system is involved in regulating cortical and behavioral arousal. On the basis of the present data and those described in the following report (Aston-Jones, G., and F. E. Bloom (1981) J.

The endogenous melatonin rhythm exhibits a close association with the endogenous circadian component of the sleep propensity rhythm. This has led to the idea that melatonin is an internal sleep ‘facilitator’ in humans, and therefore useful in the treatment of insomnia and the readjustment of circadian rhythms. There is evidence that administration of melatonin is able: (i) to induce sleep when the homeostatic drive to sleep is insufficient; (ii) to inhibit the drive for wakefulness emanating from the circadian pacemaker; and (iii) induce phase shifts in the circadian clock such that the circadian phase of increased sleep propensity occurs at a new, desired time. Therefore, exogenous melatonin can act as soporific agent, a chronohypnotic, and/or a chronobiotic. We describe the role of melatonin in the regulation of sleep, and the use of exogenous melatonin to treat sleep or circadian rhythm disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114144327", "source": "openalex"}

Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014766248", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Of 3166 articles from 1999–2010, 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II–IV. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The following recommendations are made. (1) All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. (2) Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. (3) Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (4) High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. (5) Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. (6) Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively.

Prolonged short sleep durations could lead to hypertension through extended exposure to raised 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate, elevated sympathetic nervous system activity, and increased salt retention. Such forces could lead to structural adaptations and the entrainment of the cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium. Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular disease, but we are not aware of any published prospective population studies that have shown a link between short sleep duration and the incidence of hypertension in subjects without apparent sleep disorders. We assessed whether short sleep duration would increase the risk for hypertension incidence by conducting longitudinal analyses of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( n =4810) using Cox proportional hazards models and controlling for covariates. Hypertension incidence ( n =647) was determined by physician diagnosis, hospital record, or cause of death over the 8- to 10-year follow-up period between 1982 and 1992. Sleep durations of ≤5 hours per night were associated with a significantly increased risk of hypertension (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.79) in subjects between the ages of 32 and 59 years, and controlling for the potential confounding variables only partially attenuated this relationship. The increased risk continued to be significant after controlling for obesity and diabetes, which was consistent with the hypothesis that these variables would act as partial mediators. Short sleep duration could, therefore, be a significant risk factor for hypertension.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157422098", "source": "openalex"}

Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity.

A large improvement in insomnia mediated these outcomes (range mediated, 45.5%-84.0%).Use of dCBT is effective in improving functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life in people reporting insomnia symptoms. A reduction in insomnia symptoms mediates these improvements. These results confirm that dCBT improves both daytime and nighttime aspects of insomnia, strengthening existing recommendations of CBT as the treatment of choice for insomnia.isrctn.org identifier: ISRCTN60530898.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2893462149", "source": "openalex"}

Depression is also over-represented among populations with a variety of sleep disorders. Although sleep disturbances are typical features of depression, such symptoms sometimes appear prior to an episode of depression. The bidirectional associations between sleep disturbance (especially insomnia) and depression increase the difficulty of differentiating cause-and-effect relationships between them. Longitudinal studies have consistently identified insomnia as a risk factor for the development of a new-onset or recurrent depression, and this association has been identified in young, middle-aged, and older adults. Studies have also observed that the combination of insomnia and depression influences the trajectory of depression, increasing episode severity and duration as well as relapse rates. Fortunately, recent studies have demonstrated that both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia may favorably reduce and possibly prevent depression. Together, these findings suggest that sleep-related symptoms that are present before, during, andlor after a depressive episode are potentially modifiable factors that may play an important role in achieving and maintaining depression remission.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120564644", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: A comprehensive search was done to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of tadalafil for LUTS/BPH with placebos. Meta-analytical techniques were applied to evaluate the differences in the study results. Results: Eight studies were identified and analyzed. Compared with placebo, tadalafil was associated with significant improvements in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (mean difference = -2.19, p &lt; 0.00001) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score (mean difference = +4.66, p &lt; 0.00001), despite the concomitant presence of erectile dysfunction. Significant differences were also observed in the IPSS irritative and obstructive subscores, IPSS quality of life index and BPH impact index. After pooling four doses (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg), tadalafil failed to produce a significant outcome in maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax) (mean difference = +0.26 ml/s, p = 0.14), but 5 mg of tadalafil significantly improved Qmax (mean difference = +0.63 ml/s, p = 0.04). No significant difference was detected in the incidence of serious adverse events (risk ratio = 1.00, p = 1.00) after tadalafil treatment. Conclusions: Tadalafil showed good efficacy and safety for improving LUTS and erectile dysfunction in men with BPH, and 5 mg of tadalafil significantly improved Qmax.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038693293", "source": "openalex"}

A standardized data-collection form was used to review all inpatient and outpatient charts of the 395 women identified. Variables examined included age, ethnicity, height, weight, vaginal parity, smoking history, medical history, and surgical history, including the preoperative evaluation, procedure performed, and details of all prior procedures. Analysis included calculation of age-specific and cumulative incidences and determination of the number of primary operations compared with repeat operations performed for prolapse or incontinence.The age-specific incidence increased with advancing age. The lifetime risk of undergoing a single operation for prolapse or incontinence by age 80 was 11.1%. Most patients were older, postmenopausal, parous, and overweight. Nearly half were current or former smokers and one-fifth had chronic lung disease. Reoperation was common (29.2% of cases), and the time intervals between repeat procedures decreased with each successive repair.Pelvic floor dysfunction is a major health issue for older women, as shown by the 11.1% lifetime risk of undergoing a single operation for pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, as well as the large proportion of reoperations. Our results warrant further epidemiologic research in order to determine the etiology, natural history, and long-term treatment outcomes of these conditions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2015635389", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1964043583", "title": "Urinary Creatinine Concentrations in the U.S. Population: Implications for Urinary Biologic Monitoring Measurements", "text": "Biologic monitoring (i.e., biomonitoring) is used to assess human exposures to environmental and workplace chemicals. Urinary biomonitoring data typically are adjusted to a constant creatinine concentration to correct for variable dilutions among spot samples. Traditionally, this approach has been used in population groups without much diversity. The inclusion of multiple demographic groups in studies using biomonitoring for exposure assessment has increased the variability in the urinary creatinine levels in these study populations. Our objectives were to document the normal range of urinary creatinine concentrations among various demographic groups, evaluate the impact that variations in creatinine concentrations can have on classifying exposure status of individuals in epidemiologic studies, and recommend an approach using multiple regression to adjust for variations in creatinine in multivariate analyses. We performed a weighted multivariate analysis of urinary creatinine concentrations in 22,245 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) and established reference ranges (10th–90th percentiles) for each demographic and age category. Significant predictors of urinary creatinine concentration included age group, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and fat-free mass. Time of day that urine samples were collected made a small but statistically significant difference in creatinine concentrations. For an individual, the creatinine-adjusted concentration of an analyte should be compared with a \"reference\" range derived from persons in a similar demographic group (e.g., children with children, adults with adults). For multiple regression analysis of population groups, we recommend that the analyte concentration (unadjusted for creatinine) should be included in the analysis with urinary creatinine added as a separate independent variable. This approach allows the urinary analyte concentration to be appropriately adjusted for urinary creatinine and the statistical significance of other variables in the model to be independent of effects of creatinine concentration.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964043583", "source": "openalex"}

To present a summary of the 2022 RCC guideline, which is based on a standardised methodology including systematic reviews (SRs) and provides transparent and reliable evidence for the management of RCC. For the 2022 update, a new literature search was carried out with a cutoff date of May 28, 2021, covering the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The data search focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective or controlled comparator-arm studies, SRs, and meta-analyses. Evidence synthesis was conducted using modified GRADE criteria as outlined for all the EAU guidelines. All chapters of the RCC guideline were updated on the basis of a structured literature assessment, and clinical practice recommendations were developed. The majority of the studies included were retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts and were based on single- or multi-institution data or national registries. The exception was systemic treatment of metastatic RCC, for which there are several large RCTs, resulting in recommendations that are based on higher levels of evidence. The 2022 RCC guidelines have been updated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the highest methodological standards. These guidelines provide the most reliable contemporary evidence base for the management of RCC in 2022. The European Association of Urology panel for guidelines on kidney cancer has thoroughly evaluated the research data available to establish up-to-date international standards for the care of patients with kidney cancer.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220685687", "source": "openalex"}

Methods A developmental version of the questionnaire was produced following systematic literature review and views of an expert committee and patients. Several studies were undertaken to evaluate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, including content, construct and convergent validity, reliability and sensitivity to change. Results The ICIQ was easily completed, with low levels of missing data (mean 1.6%). It was able to discriminate among different groups of individuals, indicating good construct validity. Convergent validity was acceptable, with most items demonstrating ‘moderate’ to ‘strong’ agreement with other questionnaires. Reliability was good, with ‘moderate’ to ‘very good’ stability in test‐retest analysis and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95. Items identified statistically significant reductions in symptoms from baseline following surgical and conservative treatment. Item reduction techniques were used to determine the final version and scoring scheme, which also demonstrated good psychometric properties. Conclusions The final ICIQ comprises three scored items and an unscored self‐diagnostic item. It allows the assessment of the prevalence, frequency, and perceived cause of urinary incontinence, and its impact on everyday life. The ICIQ is a brief and robust questionnaire that will be of use in outcomes and epidemiological research as well as routine clinical practice. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2060139124", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: The panel searched the MEDLINE data base for all articles through 1993 on surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence. Outcomes data were extracted from articles accepted after panel review. The data were then meta-analyzed to produce outcome estimates for alternative surgical procedures. Results: The data indicate that after 48 months retropubic suspensions and slings appear to be more efficacious than transvaginal suspensions, and also more efficacious than anterior repairs. The literature suggests higher complication rates when synthetic materials are used for slings. Conclusions: The panel found sufficient acceptable long-term outcomes data (longer than 48 months) to conclude that surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence is effective, offering a long-term cure in a significant percentage of women. The evidence supports surgery as initial therapy and as a secondary form of therapy after failure of other treatments for stress urinary incontinence. Retropubic suspensions and slings are the most efficacious procedures for long-term success (based on cure/dry rates). However, in the panel's opinion retropubic suspensions and sling procedures are associated with slightly higher complication rates, including longer convalescence and postoperative voiding dysfunction.

The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120088134", "source": "openalex"}

The Massachusetts Male Aging Study was a community based, random sample observational survey of noninstitutionalized men 40 to 70 years old conducted from 1987 to 1989 in cities and towns near Boston, Massachusetts. Blood samples, physiological measures, socio-demographic variables, psychological indexes, and information on health status, medications, smoking and lifestyle were collected by trained interviewers in the subject’s home. A self-administered sexual activity questionnaire was used to characterize erectile potency. The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate and complete impotence was 52%. The prevalence of complete impotence tripled from 5 to 15% between subject ages 40 and 70 years. Subject age was the variable most strongly associated with impotence. After adjustment for age, a higher probability of impotence was directly correlated with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, associated medications, and indexes of anger and depression, and inversely correlated with serum dehydroepiandrosterone, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and an index of dominant personality. Cigarette smoking was associated with a greater probability of complete impotence in men with heart disease and hypertension. We conclude that impotence is a major health concern in light of the high prevalence, is strongly associated with age, has multiple determinants, including some risk factors for vascular disease, and may be due partly to modifiable para-aging phenomena. © 1994 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byChen T, Li S and Eisenberg M

Materials and Methods: A cohort of 2,115 men 40 to 79 years old was randomly selected from an enumeration of the Olmsted County, Minnesota population (55% response rate). Participants completed a previously validated baseline questionnaire that assessed symptom severity, and voided into a portable urometer to measure peak urinary flow rates. A 25% random subsample underwent transrectal sonographic imaging of the prostate to determine prostate volume. Followup was performed through a retrospective review of community medical records to determine the occurrence of acute urinary retention in the subsequent 4 years. Results: During the 8,344 person-years of followup 57 men had a first episode of acute urinary retention (incidence 6.8/1,000 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2, 8.9). Among men with no to mild symptoms (American Urological Association symptom index score 7 or less) the incidence of acute urinary retention increased from 2.6/1,000 person-years among men 40 to 49 years old to 9.3/1,000 person-years among men 70 to 79 years old. By contrast, rates increased from 3.0/1,000 person-years for men 40 to 49 years old to 34.7/1,000 person-years among men 70 to 79 years old among men with moderate to severe symptoms (American Urological Association symptom index score greater than 7). Men with depressed peak urinary flow rate (less than 12 ml. per second) were at 4 times the risk of acute urinary retention compared with men with urinary flow rates greater than 12 ml. per second (95% CI 2.3, 6.6). Men with an enlarged prostate (greater than 30 ml.) experienced a 3-fold increase in risk (95% CI 1.0, 9.0, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Lower urinary tract symptoms, depressed peak urinary flow rates, enlarged prostates and older age are associated with an increased risk of acute urinary retention in community dwelling men. These findings may help to identify men at increased risk of acute urinary retention in whom closer evaluation may be warranted.

Evidence of effects in animals has generated concern over low-level chronic exposures in humans.<h3>Objective</h3>To examine associations between urinary BPA concentrations and adult health status.<h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3>Cross-sectional analysis of BPA concentrations and health status in the general adult population of the United States, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004. Participants were 1455 adults aged 18 through 74 years with measured urinary BPA and urine creatinine concentrations. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, and urinary creatinine concentration. The sample provided 80% power to detect unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.4 for diagnoses of 5% prevalence per 1-SD change in BPA concentration, or standardized regression coefficients of 0.075 for liver enzyme concentrations, at a significance level of P &lt; .05.<h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3>Chronic disease diagnoses plus blood markers of liver function, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and lipid changes.<h3>Results</h3>Higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with cardiovascular diagnoses in age-, sex-, and fully adjusted models (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.63; P = .001 with full adjustment). Higher BPA concentrations were also associated with diabetes (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.60; P &lt; .001) but not with other studied common diseases. In addition, higher BPA concentrations were associated with clinically abnormal concentrations of the liver enzymes γ-glutamyltransferase (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.46; P &lt; .001) and alkaline phosphatase (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-1.85; P = .002).<h3>Conclusion</h3>Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, may be associated with avoidable morbidity in the community-dwelling adult population.Published online September 16, 2008 (doi:10.1001/jama.300.11.1303).", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2108900261", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2123831918", "title": "Urinary Albumin Excretion Predicts Cardiovascular and Noncardiovascular Mortality in General Population", "text": "For the general population, the clinical relevance of an increased urinary albumin excretion rate is still debated. Therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (CV) disease and non-CV disease in the general population.In the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for CV disease and CV morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (UAC). The vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. During a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. We found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing UAC and mortality. A higher UAC increased the risk of both CV and non-CV death after adjustment for other well-recognized CV risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for CV mortality than for non-CV mortality (P=0.014). A 2-fold increase in UAC was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for CV mortality (95% CI 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.21) for non-CV mortality.Urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. The excess risk was more attributable to death from CV causes, independent of the effects of other CV risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123831918", "source": "openalex"}

Comorbidities, type of surgery, and type of anesthesia influence the development of postoperative urinary retention (POUR). The authors review the overall incidence and mechanisms of POUR associated with surgery, anesthesia and analgesia. Ultrasound has been shown to provide an accurate assessment of urinary bladder volume and a guide to the management of POUR. Recommendations for urinary catheterization in the perioperative setting vary widely, influenced by many factors, including surgical factors, type of anesthesia, comorbidities, local policies, and personal preferences.

Setting A tertiary referral Urogynaecology unit at King's College Hospital, London Design The questionnaire was designed following six different pilot studies; in this study it was tested for validity and reliability using standard psychometric techniques. The questionnaire was used in 293 consecutive women referred for investigation of urinary incontinence. Results The questionnaire was shown to be reliable both by test‐retest analysis and by measurement of its internal consistency. The construct of the questionnaire and the answers by respondents confirmed its face and content validity. Criterion validity was measured by correlation with scores obtained on a validated generic measure of quality of life, the Short Form 36. Women with detrusor instability had greater quality of life impairment than women with other urodynamic diagnoses. Conclusion The questionnaire was easy for the women to use and was a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of quality of life in women with urinary incontinence. It will be useful for the rapid appraisal and follow up of women with urinary incontinence in many different clinical settings, including the evaluation of new treatments of urinary incontinence in controlled clinical trials.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023110392", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2133306969", "title": "The Female Urinary Microbiome: a Comparison of Women with and without Urgency Urinary Incontinence", "text": "Bacterial DNA and live bacteria have been detected in human urine in the absence of clinical infection, challenging the prevailing dogma that urine is normally sterile. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a poorly understood urinary condition characterized by symptoms that overlap urinary infection, including urinary urgency and increased frequency with urinary incontinence. The recent discovery of the urinary microbiome warrants investigation into whether bacteria contribute to UUI. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to classify bacterial DNA and expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) techniques to isolate live bacteria in urine collected by using a transurethral catheter from women with UUI and, in comparison, a cohort without UUI. For these cohorts, we demonstrated that the UUI and non-UUI urinary microbiomes differ by group based on both sequence and culture evidences. Compared to the non-UUI microbiome, sequencing experiments revealed that the UUI microbiome was composed of increased Gardnerella and decreased Lactobacillus. Nine genera (Actinobaculum, Actinomyces, Aerococcus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Gardnerella, Oligella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were more frequently cultured from the UUI cohort. Although Lactobacillus was isolated from both cohorts, distinctions existed at the species level, with Lactobacillus gasseri detected more frequently in the UUI cohort and Lactobacillus crispatus most frequently detected in controls. Combined, these data suggest that potentially important differences exist in the urinary microbiomes of women with and without UUI, which have strong implications in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of UUI. Importance: New evidence indicates that the human urinary tract contains microbial communities; however, the role of these communities in urinary health remains to be elucidated. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a highly prevalent yet poorly understood urinary condition characterized by urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. Given the significant overlap of UUI symptoms with those of urinary tract infections, it is possible that UUI may have a microbial component. We compared the urinary microbiomes of women affected by UUI to those of a comparison group without UUI, using both high-throughput sequencing and extended culture techniques. We identified statistically significant differences in the frequency and abundance of bacteria present. These differences suggest a potential role for the urinary microbiome in female urinary health.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133306969", "source": "openalex"}

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children by age, gender, race, and circumcision status.MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles about pediatric urinary tract infection. Search terms included urinary tract infection, cystitis, pyelonephritis, prevalence and incidence. We included articles in our review if they contained data on the prevalence of UTI in children 0-19 years of age presenting with symptoms of UTI. Of the 51 articles with data on UTI prevalence, 18 met all inclusion criteria. Two evaluators independently reviewed, rated, and abstracted data from each article.Among infants presenting with fever, the overall prevalence (and 95% confidence interval) of UTI was 7.0% (CI: 5.5-8.4). The pooled prevalence rates of febrile UTIs in females aged 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, and >12 months was 7.5%, 5.7%, 8.3%, and 2.1% respectively. Among febrile male infants less than 3 months of age, 2.4% (CI: 1.4-3.5) of circumcised males and 20.1% (CI: 16.8-23.4) of uncircumcised males had a UTI. For the 4 studies that reported UTI prevalence by race, UTI rates were higher among white infants 8.0% (CI: 5.1-11.0) than among black infants 4.7% (CI: 2.1-7.3). Among older children (<19 years) with urinary symptoms, the pooled prevalence of UTI (both febrile and afebrile) was 7.8% (CI: 6.6-8.9).Prevalence rates of UTI varied by age, gender, race, and circumcision status. Uncircumcised male infants less than 3 months of age and females less than 12 months of age had the highest baseline prevalence of UTI. Prevalence estimates can help clinicians make informed decisions regarding diagnostic testing in children presenting with signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1970540449", "source": "openalex"}

Acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to ischemic injury remains a common and potentially devastating problem. A transcriptome-wide interrogation strategy was used to identify renal genes that are induced very early after renal ischemia, whose protein products might serve as novel biomarkers for ARF. Seven genes that are upregulated >10-fold were identified, one of which (Cyr61) has recently been reported to be induced after renal ischemia. Unexpectedly, the induction of the other six transcripts was novel to the ARF field. In this study, one of these previously unrecognized genes was further characterized, namely neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), because it is a small secreted polypeptide that is protease resistant and consequently might be readily detected in the urine. The marked upregulation of NGAL mRNA and protein levels in the early postischemic mouse kidney was confirmed. NGAL protein expression was detected predominantly in proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive proximal tubule cells, in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution that co-localized with markers of late endosomes. NGAL was easily detected in the urine in the very first urine output after ischemia in both mouse and rat models of ARF. The appearance of NGAL in the urine was related to the dose and duration of renal ischemia and preceded the appearance of other urinary markers such as N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and β2-microglobulin. The origin of NGAL from tubule cells was confirmed in cultured human proximal tubule cells subjected to in vitro ischemic injury, where NGAL mRNA was rapidly induced in the cells and NGAL protein was readily detectable in the culture medium within 1 h of mild ATP depletion. NGAL was also easily detectable in the urine of mice with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, again preceding the appearance of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and β2-microglobulin. The results indicate that NGAL may represent an early, sensitive, noninvasive urinary biomarker for ischemic and nephrotoxic renal injury.

Materials and Methods: The time from operation until urinary continence was achieved was determined by chart review and questionnaire in 581 patients who were continent before undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1983 and 1994. Using univariate and multivariate analyses of data gathered prospectively, we examined risk factors associated with incontinence in these patients. Results: The actuarial rate of urinary continence at 24 months was 91 percent for the entire patient populations and 95 percent for those treated after 1990. Many factors were associated with the risk of incontinence in univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (patient age and weight, degree of obstructive voiding symptoms, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, clinical stage, intraoperative blood loss, resection of neurovascular bundles, postoperative anastomotic stricture and technique of vesicourethral anastomosis). However, in a multivariate analysis the factors that were independently associated with increased chance of regaining continence were decreasing age, a modification in the technique of anastomosis (introduced in 1990), preservation of both neurovascular bundles and absence of an anastomotic stricture. With introduction of the new surgical technique in 1990 the median time to continence decreased from 5.6 to 1.5 months and the rate of continence at 24 months increased from 82 to 95 percent. Conclusions: While the risk of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy is related to the uncontrollable factor of patient age, it is also sensitive to the surgical technique used.

Its ability to contract over a large length interval and to relax determines the bladder function during filling and micturition. These processes are regulated by several external nervous and hormonal control systems, and the detrusor contains multiple receptors and signaling pathways. Functional changes of the detrusor can be found in several clinically important conditions, e.g., lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction. The aim of this review is to summarize and synthesize basic information and recent advances in the understanding of the properties of the detrusor smooth muscle, its contractile system, cellular signaling, membrane properties, and cellular receptors.

The prevalence of incontinence known to the health and social service agencies was 0.2% in women and 0.1% in men aged 15-64 and 2.5% in women and 1.3% in men aged 65 and over. The postal survey, to which 89% of the people whose correct address was known replied, showed a prevalence of urinary incontinence of 8.5% in women and 1.6% in men aged 15-64 and 11.6% in women and 6.9% in men aged 65 and over. Nulliparous women had a lower prevalence than those who had had one, two, or three babies, but within the parity range of one to three there were no differences in prevalence. The prevalence was appreciably increased in women who had had four or more babies. Incontinence was moderate or severe in a fifth of those who reported it in the postal survey, of whom less than a third were receiving health or social services for the condition. Incontinence is a common symptom, and many unrecognised cases appear to exist. There may be considerable scope for improving its management.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042053041", "source": "openalex"}

Among men who were potent before surgery, the proportion of men reporting impotence at 18 or more months after surgery varied according to whether the procedure was nerve sparing (65.6% of non–nerve-sparing, 58.6% of unilateral, and 56.0% of bilateral nerve–sparing). At 18 or more months after surgery, 41.9% reported that their sexual performance was a moderate-to-large problem. Both sexual and urinary function varied by age (39.0% of men aged &lt;60 years vs 15.3%-21.7% of older men were potent at ≥18 months [P&lt;.001]; 13.8% of men aged 75-79 years vs 0.7%-3.6% of younger men experienced the highest level of incontinence at ≥18 months [P = .03]), and sexual function also varied by race (38.4% of black men reported firm erections at ≥18 months vs 25.9% of Hispanic and 21.3% of white men; P = .001).ConclusionsOur study suggests that radical prostatectomy is associated with significant erectile dysfunction and some decline in urinary function.

Few prevalence studies used current ICS LUTS symptom definitions and to our knowledge no studies exist that estimate total worldwide prevalence of reported LUTS symptoms. One of the primary goals of this analysis was to estimate current and future worldwide prevalence of LUTS among adults. Our estimation model suggests that LUTS are highly prevalent worldwide, with an increasing burden predicted over time. OBJECTIVE • To estimate and predict worldwide and regional prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), overactive bladder (OAB), urinary incontinence (UI) and LUTS suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction (LUTS/BOO) in 2008, 2013 and 2018 based on current International Continence Society symptom definitions in adults aged ≥20 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS • Numbers and prevalence of individuals affected by each condition were calculated with an estimation model using gender‐ and age‐stratified prevalence data from the EPIC study along with gender‐ and age‐stratified worldwide and regional population estimates from the US Census Bureau International Data Base. RESULTS • An estimated 45.2%, 10.7%, 8.2% and 21.5% of the 2008 worldwide population (4.3 billion) was affected by at least one LUTS, OAB, UI and LUTS/BOO, respectively. By 2018, an estimated 2.3 billion individuals will be affected by at least one LUTS (18.4% increase), 546 million by OAB (20.1%), 423 million by UI (21.6%) and 1.1 billion by LUTS/BOO (18.5%). • The regional burden of these conditions is estimated to be greatest in Asia, with numbers of affected individuals expected to increase most in the developing regions of Africa (30.1–31.1% increase across conditions, 2008–2018), South America (20.5–24.7%) and Asia (19.7–24.4%). CONCLUSIONS • This model suggests that LUTS, OAB, UI and LUTS/BOO are highly prevalent conditions worldwide. Numbers of affected individuals are projected to increase with time, with the greatest increase in burden anticipated in developing regions. • There are important worldwide public‐health and clinical management implications to be considered over the next decade to effectively prevent and manage these conditions.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1575778540", "source": "openalex"}

Among them are the abundant and widely distributed disulfide-linked cationic antimicrobial peptides found in both the plant and animal kingdoms. Generally, these peptides exhibit a broad range of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. Plants produce many cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides including thionins, plant defensins, and the cysteine rich Ib-AMP 1–4 (1Zhang Y. Lewis K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 149: 59-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R. Cammue B.P. Osborn R.W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 3Tailor R.H.

In insects, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are produced in the fat body (functional homologue of the mammalian liver) and transcriptionally induced and released into the hemolymph in response to infection or injury. These include insect defensins, heliomicin, drosomycin, and thanatin (4Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol.

Vandenbulcke F. Noel T. Romestand B. Beauvillain J.C. Salzet M. Roch P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2759-2769PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, similar antimicrobial peptides include α- and β-defensins and protegrins (9Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Like the insect fat body, the vertebrate liver is also centrally involved in innate immune response to infection. The “acute phase” response to infection or inflammation is a pattern of increased hepatic synthesis of many secreted proteins involved in host defense and the selective suppression of synthesis of other secreted proteins. In contrast to the abundant fat body-derived antimicrobial peptides of insects, no vertebrate antimicrobial peptides originating in the liver have been described to date. In this work, we report the discovery of a novel hepatic antimicrobial peptide, hepcidin, whose processed form is found in urine. Cationic peptides were extracted from pooled urine of one to five healthy donors using methods that we described previously for the isolation of human β-defensin-1 (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, urine was filtered to remove cells and extracted with the weak cation exchange matrix CM Macroprep (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Cationic peptides were eluted with 5% acetic acid and further purified by RP-HPLC1 (Waters Model 626; Waters, Milford, MA) on a Vydac C18 column (218TP510) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile (ACN) gradient of 4% ACN increment/min for 5 min and washed with 20% ACN for 5 min, followed by a 0.5% ACN increment/min for the last 30 min (12Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HPLC peak fractions were analyzed by acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and peptide masses were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS (UCLA Mass Spectrometry Facility (Los Angeles, CA) or Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA)). Purified hepcidin was modified by reduction and carboxymethylation before amino acid sequencing. Lyophilized peptide was resuspended in reduction and alkylation buffer (0.5 m Tris buffer, pH 8, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 20 mm EDTA) to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reduction was accomplished by the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (DTT), and the solution was overlaid with N2 gas and then incubated at 52 °C for 2.5 h. Fresh DTT (500-molar excess) was added and incubated for an additional hour at 52 °C. The solution was cooled to room temperature for 10 min, and iodoacetamide freshly dissolved in reduction and alkylation buffer was added to a final concentration of 3-fold molar excess over DTT and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of DTT (1500-fold molar excess of the peptide). The peptide was then purified on a C18 RP-HPLC column equilibrated in 0.1% h-heptafluorobutyric acid (v/v). Peptides were eluted using linear ACN gradients at a flow rate of 3 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 230 and 280 nm as follows: 1% ACN increment/min for 20 min, followed by a 0.5% increment/min for the last 60 min. HPLC fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 5% acetic acid, and the peak fraction (32–35% ACN) was submitted for amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation at the UCLA Peptide Sequencing Facility. CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was dissolved either in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, alone or in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of trifluoroethylene:phosphate buffer. Peptide solutions were scanned in 0.1 mm light path demountable cells over a 270 nm to 185 nm wavelength range at 10 nm/min and a sample interval of 0.2 nm. An initial search of the protein data base showed no homology of hepcidin to any known protein. Therefore, the primary amino acid sequence was reverse translated and searched against the GenBankTM human EST data base using the BLAST (tblastn) nucleic acid search program (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60239) Google Scholar). A matching cDNA clone (American Type Culture Collection yb44e08.r1, clone 74054; GenBankTM accession number T48277) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The plasmid clone was transformed and amplified in Bluescript Escherichia coli(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Valencia, CA). The sequence of the 5′ end of the cDNA was determined using Marathon-Ready cDNA from a liver library (CLONTECH). The gene-specific primers for hepcidin are antisense (for 5′-RACE) 5′-CCCAAGACCTATGTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGTCTGGCTGTCCCACTGCTGG-3′ and sense (for 3′ RACE) 5′-CATGTTCCAGAGGCGAAGG-3′. PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR product was sequenced using an ABI Prism DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the UCLA Sequencing Facility. The Omiga program (Oxford Molecular Co.) was used to analyze and search for potential consensus sites within the gene. The hepcidin cDNA clone and the gene-specific primers above were used in the PCR reaction to generate a 173-base pair product from a segment of the coding region. The PCR product was used to probeCLONTECH organ blot membranes as described previously (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The organ blots contained poly(A) selected human mRNA from spleen, thymus, appendix, peripheral blood leukocyte, bone marrow, fetal liver, heart, brain, placenta, lung, adult liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, stomach, thyroid, spinal cord, lymph node, trachea, adrenal gland, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon. Frozen normal human liver blocks obtained from the UCLA Human Tissue Resource Center (Los Angeles, CA) were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 0.1 g of tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) RNA was separated from the total RNA preparation using a Qiagen Oligotex mRNA isolation kit. Purified poly(A) RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel (Bio-Rad) containing 3.3% formalin in 10 mm NaPO4, transferred onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and hybridized with a radioactive probe as described above. The 20- and 25-amino acid forms of hepcidin (Hepc20 and Hepc25), each of which was homogeneous by electrophoretic and mass spectrum analysis, were quantified by UV absorbance at 215 and 220 nm using the formula concentration (mg/ml) = (A 215 −A 225) × 0.144, and they were tested for antimicrobial activity against bacterial strains (E. coliML35p, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus) and yeast (Candida albicans) in a CFU assay as described previously (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Culture densities were measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm for bacterial strains and at 450 nm for yeast and then resuspended to a final concentration of 106 CFU/ml. AnA 620 reading of 0.2 corresponds to 107 CFU/ml for the staphylococcal and streptococcal strains and 5 × 107 CFU/ml for E. coli. AnA 450 reading of 1.0 is equivalent to 2.86 × 107 CFU/ml for C. albicans. The organisms were incubated with various concentrations of peptide at 37 °C with constant shaking for 1, 3, and 24 h. Surviving microbes were plated in triplicate on trypticase soy broth plates (Microdiagnostic Products Inc., Lombard, IL) using a spiral plating system (Spiral Biotech, Bethesda, MD). In some experiments, the assay medium was supplemented with 100 mm NaCl to mimic higher salt conditions characteristic of blood plasma. The two human clinical isolates of filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus andAspergillus niger used in this assay were a generous gift from Dr. Dexter Howard (UCLA Department of Microbiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Spores were harvested as described previously (15Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 69: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar). The glycerol stocks of spores from each strain were utilized in a spectrophotometric germination assay as follows: spores were diluted to a concentration of 1.25 × 104 /ml in culture medium (half-strength potato dextrose broth (BBL), 10 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml cefotaxime (Life Technologies, Inc.). Eighty μl of each spore suspension was placed in sterile flat-bottomed polystyrene 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY), and 20 μl of peptide or peptide diluent (water) was added to yield a final spore concentration of 104 /ml. The plate was incubated at 30 °C in a humidified chamber in the dark. Germination was microscopically monitored for the appearance of hyphae using a light microscope. After 48 h, the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using a SpectraMAX250 EIA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To test for activity in high salt conditions, the assay medium was supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. To determine whether the effect of hepcidin was fungicidal or fungistatic, spores were incubated in the presence of Hepc20 and Hepc25 at the highest concentrations necessary to inhibit germination as described above. After 48 h at 30 °C, the well contents were transferred to sterile microfuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant containing the peptides was removed, and the spore pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of fresh media and transferred into a new 96-well plate. The spores were incubated for an additional 48 h at 30 °C and then analyzed for germination as described above. If no hyphae were observed, then the effect of hepcidin was judged to be fungicidal. K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection leukemic cell line CCL-243) were cultured in RPMI 1640 withl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 48 h and then washed and resuspended to 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 media. A volume of 50 μl of cells was aliquoted into sterile flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY). Various concentrations of 10× peptide stocks were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 12–16 h. Viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Peptide synthesis reagents including Fmoc amino acids (AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA) and coupling solvents (PE Biosystems, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to synthesize Hepc20 peptide on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using double coupling for all residues. The scale of synthesis was 0.25 mmol using a FastMocTM strategy (16Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar) with PS-PEG resin (PE Perceptive Biosystems, Connecticut Path, MA). After cleavage, the crude synthetic peptide (sHEP) was resuspended in reducing buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.02 mEDTA, and 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.07) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (w/v), homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated in a 50 °C sonicating water bath for 30 min. The resuspended peptide was reduced by adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.01 m, overlaying with N2gas, and then incubating in a 50 °C water bath overnight. The reduced peptide was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, desalted with 15% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 40% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 40% ACN fraction was lyophilized and then further purified by RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column using the same gradient program as described above in purification of the native peptide from urine. The major peak was lyophilized, resuspended to 0.03 mg/ml with distilled H2O, adjusted to pH 7.5 with ammonium hydroxide, and then air-oxidized in an open vessel at room temperature with stirring for 18 h. The refolded peptide was then purified on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge followed by RP-HPLC as described for the reduced peptide. Cationic proteins were extracted from urine using a weak cation exchange resin and then further purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1), and hepcidin peaks were identified by characteristically migrating bands in Coomassie Blue-stained acid-urea PAGE. The fractions corresponding to the hepcidin peptides eluted between 24% and 30% acetonitrile. The identity of each peptide in peaks A andB of Fig. 1 was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and amino acid sequencing. The peptides were 20 and 25 amino acids long (Hepc20 and Hepc25, respectively) and differed by amino-terminal truncation but preserved the cysteine-rich domain (Fig.2). Mass analysis identified the peptide in peak C of Fig. 1 as the 22-amino acid form (Hepc22). The mass data (Table I) indicate that all 8 cysteine residues are connected by disulfide bonds. In urine, Hepc20 and Hepc25 are the major forms, whereas Hepc22 is a minor species. Collectively, the concentration of hepcidin ranges between 10 and 30 μg/liter (4–12 nm) in urine from normal donors. The remaining large peaks visible in Fig. 1 had previously been identified as variably amino-terminal-truncated forms of another antimicrobial peptide, human β-defensin-1 (11Valore E.V. Park C.H.

Purified hepcidin was carboxymethylated and then sequenced by Edman degradation. The three processed forms differ by amino-terminal truncation as denoted by arrows.

Membranes preloaded with human organ tissue poly(A) selected mRNA were probed with a 173-base pair probe generated by PCR from the cDNA clone. mRNA was found to be highly expressed in fetal and adult liver, with a much lower signal detected in the heart and spinal cord (Fig.4). A fourth membrane loaded with prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon was also probed, but no signal was detected (data not shown). A weak mRNA signal corresponding to 2.37 kilobases was seen in fetal and adult liver and spinal cord but was not further analyzed. Although the peptide was found in the urine, the mRNA was not detectable in the kidney or the bladder. A search of the protein data base revealed no sequence homology to any known peptides. Using the primary sequence of the peptide, the BLAST (tblastn) nucleic acid search program of the human EST data base identified a cDNA clone that spans the region of the peptide from Asp40 to Thr84(I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone 74054; DNA GenBankTMaccession number T48277; EST yb44e08) (17Hillier L.D. Lennon G. Becker M. Bonaldo M.F. Chiapelli B. Chissoe S. Dietrich N. DuBuque T. Favello A. Gish W. Hawkins M. Hultman M. Kucaba T. Lacy M. Le M. Le N. Mardis E. Moore B. Morris M. Parsons J. Prange C. Rifkin L. Rohlfing T. Schellenberg K. Marra M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 807-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). An identical genomic sequence match was found on human chromosome 19 (GenBankTMaccession number AD000684; locus CH19R30879). In addition, a search of EST data bases found matches to cDNA sequences from the liver of pig, rat, mouse, flounder, and the long-jawed mudsucker (Fig.5). All of the matches are to peptides that have yet to be isolated and characterized. The similarity is strongest in the region that corresponds to the peptides isolated from urine, namely, residues Arg55 to Thr84. The PCR products of the 5′ RACE reaction were sequenced and compared with the genomic sequence (Fig.6). The mRNA, 0.4 kilobase in length (GenBankTM accession numbers AAG23966 for cDNA and P81172 for the corresponding hepcidin precursor), matched the estimated size on the Northern blot. The gene consists of three exons and two introns, and the third exon encodes the sequence of the peptides found in urine. The putative unprocessed peptide encoded by all three exons would be 84 amino acid residues long. A potential signal-peptide cleavage site between Gly24 and Ser25 would generate a 60-amino acid propeptide species. Consensus sites for myristylation sites and phosphorylation sites occur on Gly44 and Thr24, respectively. In addition, a potential furin cleavage site is found at Arg59 (18Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Since our initial studies, additional human EST sequences have appeared in the GenBankTM data bases (GenBankTMaccession numbers AI937227, AI829866, and AI797446) with minor sequence variations in the noncoding regions. The colony-forming unit assay (19Porter E.M. van Dam E. Valore E.V. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of purified hepcidin forms against various microbial strains. In the initial screen, all the strains were tested against 30 μm Hepc20 and Hepc25 (Hepc22 was not tested because it is present in small concentrations in the urine). Both peptides were antimicrobial against E. coliML35p and, to a lesser extent, against S. epidermidis,S. aureus, C. albicans, and group BStreptococcus, but both were inactive againstPseudomonas aeruginosa (Fig.7). A dose-response CFU assay performed against E. coli and S. epidermidis showed that both hepcidin peptides were microbicidal at the highest concentration of 30 μm against both strains (data not shown). In this assay and in the initial screen, Hepc20 was more active than Hepc25; however, both peptides were inhibited by the addition of 100 mm NaCl to the assay mixture. Spores of two human pathogenic strains of A. fumigatus and A. niger were subjected to a germination assay (Fig.8). Hepc20 was more potent than Hepc25 against both strains. Hepc20 was antifungal against A. niger, where no hyphae were detected after 48 h at 20 μm, but 40 μm was required against the more resistant strain, A. fumigatus. Hepc25 only retarded spore germination in A. niger at the highest concentration of 40 μm and was ineffective against A. fumigatus at the same concentration. Neither peptide was active in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. We assessed fungicidal activity by following germination after removal of the antifungal peptides and additional incubation in fresh media. No germination was observed after 48 h. At the highest concentrations, Hepc20 was fungicidal against both strains, as indicated by the lack of spore germination in fresh medium. Hepc25 did not exhibit fungicidal activity at any concentration used in this assay. To test for cytotoxic effects of hepcidin, K562 cells were assessed for viability after incubation with Hepc20 and Hepc25, using trypan blue as an indicator of membrane integrity. At the highest concentration of 30 μm, cells incubated for 15 h in the presence of Hepc20 or Hepc25 were 88% and 74% viable, respectively. When cells were treated with 30 μmhuman α-defensin HNP-1, only 9% viable cells remained at the end of the incubation period. Thus, hepcidin is not cytotoxic at a concentration that is ∼3000-fold higher than that found in the urine. Crude synthetic material was completely reduced with DTT and purified by RP-HPLC. The major HPLC peaks were analyzed by AU-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. As expected, the peptide migrated more slowly upon reduction. The gain of 8 Da corresponding to eight additional hydrogen atoms in MALDI-MS confirmed that the synthetic peptide was completely reduced. The reduced peptide was refolded by air oxidation and compared with the native peptide. The synthetic Hepc20 had identical AU-PAGE migration, eluted identically in C18 RP-HPLC, and had an identical electrospray mass and antimicrobial activity against E. coliin a CFU assay compared with native Hepc20. We report here the first member of a new vertebrate family of small antimicrobial peptides that contain 8 cysteine residues and are active against both bacteria and fungi. Hepcidin mRNA encodes a larger precursor and is found primarily in the liver, but the peptides were first discovered in and isolated from urine. The native peptide was purified from human urine by cation exchange chromatography and RP-HPLC and characterized by amino acid sequencing, MALDI-TOF-MS, and CD spectroscopy. The human hepcidin forms, 2–3 kDa in size, have an overall charge of +3 at neutral pH and are only 20–25 amino acids in length (8 of these amino acids are cysteine residues (∼30% cysteine)). Mass spectrometry data confirm all 8 cysteines to be engaged in four intramolecular disulfide bonds. The symmetric arrangement of pairs of cysteines around a cationic segment (HRSK) resembles that of antimicrobial protegrins and tachyplesins, peptides that have a two-strand β-sheet structure stabilized by interstrand disulfide bonds. Based on this similarity and on preliminary molecular models, we propose the following cysteine connectivity pattern: 1-4, 2-8, 3-7, and 5-6 (Fig. 2). This arrangement of disulfide bonds exhibits three possible β-turns and provides a fold with the least steric hindrance among the side chains. The proposed disulfide connectivity pattern makes the hepcidin structure similar to the “cystine knot” class of antimicrobial peptides (20Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7159-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cDNA structure suggests that the peptide is translated as an 84-amino acid prepropeptide that is amino-terminally processed to the 20- to 25-amino acid peptide (Fig. 6). A strong consensus sequence (score = 16.45 using the PC Gene program) for a signal sequence cleavage site is located between Gly24 and Ser25 that would produce a 60-residue propeptide. Another likely processing site is carboxyl-terminal to Arg59, a consensus site for the subtilisin/kexin family of mammalian propeptide processing enzymes (propeptide convertases) with a preference for cleavage after the paired basic residues Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg. Among other functions, the propeptide convertases cleave propeptides to generate one or more bioactive peptides from a single precursor (18Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The abundance of propeptide convertases in the liver may explain our inability to isolate the larger propeptide from native sources (liver tissue, bile, and blood serum). The small size of hepcidin, its conservation between animal species, and its compact folding pattern may account for our difficulties in producing a useful antibody. A search of the protein data base revealed no homology to hepcidin in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, searching the EST data base revealed liver cDNA homologues in pig, rat, mouse, flounder, and the long-jawed mudsucker (Fig. 5). All 8 cysteine residues are conserved with particularly strong sequence similarity in residues 60–84 that encompass the processed forms isolated from the urine. It is noteworthy that the putative propeptide convertase cleavage sites are also conserved. In humans, the paired basic residues are Arg-Arg, whereas the other homologues have the same recognition sequence or an alternative recognition sequence of Lys-Arg. It is possible that if the proregion is cleaved from the precursor as a single peptide, it could also have a biological function. To test this possibility, the proregion (Ser25-Arg59) was synthesized, and an antibody reactive with the synthetic peptide was produced (Research Genetics). Preliminary data utilizing the synthetic propiece peptide have shown that it exhibits an antibacterial activity equally potent to that of Hepc20 and Hepc25 (data not shown). However, a Western blot analysis capable of detecting 500 ng of the synthetic peptide did not detect the propiece peptide in cationic extracts of urine, serum, liver extract, and bile (data not shown), making it unlikely that this form is stable and abundant. Acid liver extracts did contain a peptide with a mass identical to Hepc25 that eluted at the same acetonitrile concentration as Hepc25 from urine. While this study was under review, we noted an interim report that an antimicrobial peptide identical to Hepc25, LEAP-1, was isolated from human plasma ultrafiltrate (22Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J. Schulz A. Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Adermann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The presence of Hepc25 in ultrafiltrate suggests that the peptide originating in the liver reaches the kidney in blood plasma. Hepcidin may be the functional homologue of the insect defensin-like peptide drosomycin. Hepcidin is expressed in human liver, whereas drosomycin is found in the fat body (the liver equivalent) ofDrosophila; both peptides have four disulfide bonds, and both are potent antifungal peptides. In parallel studies, Pigeonet al. 2Pigeon, C., Ilyin, G., Courselaud, B., Leroyer, P., Turlin, B., Brissot, P., and Loreal, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,7811–7819 identified a murine hepcidin as a hepatic mRNA inducible in vivo by iron overload and lipopolysaccharide. The ability of lipopolysaccharide to increase hepcidin mRNA in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes is consistent with the proposed role of hepcidin in inflammation and host defense. Like hepcidin, drosomycin is expressed constitutively but is also inducible upon microbial challenge. Like drosomycin, both Hepc20 and Hepc25 forms inhibit spore germination in the two pathogenic strains of Aspergillus tested. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether hepcidin, like the cysteine-rich antimicrobial defensins (23Yang D. Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J. Shogan J. Anderson M. Schroder J.M. Wang J.M. Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J.

Participants were evaluated on 2 occasions approximately 3 years apart. Of the participants 58% reported urine loss at some time and 30.7% reported incontinence on a regular basis at least once per month. During 3 years the cumulative incidence of regular incontinence in previously continent women was 8.0%. Among those with regular incontinence 64.9% said the volume of loss was 1 or 2 drops, while 35.1% reported that they needed to change their garments. Only 25.5% of the patients had sought treatment. Continence status was significantly related to body mass index and race but not to patient age, parity, caffeine or alcohol intake, smoking, physical activity, prior gynecological surgery or several psychological variables. The results indicate that urinary incontinence is common among middle-aged women. That few seek treatment suggests a need for more information about women's attitudes toward incontinence and more attention to this problem by health care providers. © 1991 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byStewart W, Hirsh A, Kirchner H, Clarke D, Litchtenfeld M and Minassian V (2018) Urinary Incontinence Incidence: Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Factors that Explain VariationJournal of Urology, VOL. 191, NO. 4, (996-1002), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2014.Botlero R, Davis S, Urquhart D and Bell R (2011) Incidence and Resolution Rates of Different Types of Urinary Incontinence in Women: Findings From a Cohort StudyJournal of Urology, VOL. 185, NO. 4, (1331-1337), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2011.Subak L, Richter H and Hunskaar S (2009) Obesity and Urinary Incontinence: Epidemiology and Clinical Research UpdateJournal of Urology, VOL. 182, NO. 6S, (S2-S7), Online publication date: 1-Dec-2009.Dooley Y, Kenton K, Cao G, Luke A, Durazo-Arvizu R, Kramer H and Brubaker L (2018) Urinary Incontinence Prevalence: Results From the National Health and Nutrition Examination SurveyJournal of Urology, VOL. 179, NO. 2, (656-661), Online publication date: 1-Feb-2008.Fenner D, Trowbridge E, Patel D, Fultz N, Miller J, Howard D and DeLancey J (2018) Establishing the Prevalence of Incontinence Study: Racial Differences in Women's Patterns of Urinary IncontinenceJournal of Urology, VOL. 179, NO. 4, (1455-1460), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2008.Thom D, van den Eeden S, Ragins A, Wassel-Fyr C, Vittinghof E, Subak L and Brown J (2018) Differences in Prevalence of Urinary Incontinence by Race/EthnicityJournal of Urology, VOL. 175, NO. 1, (259-264), Online publication date: 1-Jan-2006.TEO R, YISA S, MAYNE C and TINCELLO D (2018) A COMPARISON OF URODYNAMIC DIAGNOSES AND DETRUSOR MUSCLE FUNCTION IN WHITE AND SOUTH INDIAN ASIAN WOMENJournal of Urology, VOL. 174, NO. 1, (184-186), Online publication date: 1-Jul-2005.LANDIS J, KAPLÅN S, SWIFT S and VERSI E (2018) Efficacy of Antimuscarinic Therapy for Overactive Bladder With Varying Degrees of Incontinence SeverityJournal of Urology, VOL. 171, NO. 2, (752-756), Online publication date: 1-Feb-2004.GARNETT S and ABRAMS P (2018) The Natural History Of The Overactive Bladder Ana Detrusor Overactivity.

Materials and Methods: We assess 143 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux that stopped spontaneously or was a surgically corrected for functional bowel and/or bladder disorders, including bladder instability, constipation and infrequent voiding, termed the dysfunctional elimination syndromes. Results: Dysfunctional elimination syndromes were present in 66 of 143 children (43%) thought to have primary vesicoureteral reflux. Of these 66 patients 54 (82%) had a breakthrough urinary tract infection and underwent reimplantation compared to only 18% without the syndromes. Of 70 children who had a breakthrough urinary tract infection dysfunctional elimination syndromes were present in 54 (77%) and absent in 16 (23%). Of the remaining 73 patients who did not have a breakthrough infection dysfunctional elimination syndromes were present in 12 (16%) and absent in 61 (84%). In children with dysfunctional elimination syndromes the resolution of reflux that was 1 grade less severe required an average of 1.6 years longer. After the disappearance of reflux, urinary tract infection developed in 18 children, including 14 (78%) with dysfunctional elimination syndromes. Unsuccessful surgical outcomes involving persistent, recurrent and contralateral reflux occurred only in children with dysfunctional elimination syndromes. Conclusions: Dysfunctional elimination syndromes are common and are often unrecognized in children with primary reflux. These syndromes are associated with delayed reflux resolution and an increased rate of breakthrough urinary tract infection, which leads to reimplantation surgery. Dysfunctional elimination syndromes also adversely affect the results of reimplantation and represent a risk for recurrent urinary tract infection after resolves. The evaluation and management of dysfunctional elimination syndromes should be an integral part of the treatment of every child with vesicoureteral reflux. Effective evaluation and treatment may be made cost-effective by decreasing the followup, the number of breakthrough urinary tract infections and the number of children requiring reimplantation.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1990731735", "title": "Virulence factors in Escherichia coli urinary tract infection", "text": "Uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli are characterized by the expression of distinctive bacterial properties, products, or structures referred to as virulence factors because they help the organism overcome host defenses and colonize or invade the urinary tract. Virulence factors of recognized importance in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) include adhesins (P fimbriae, certain other mannose-resistant adhesins, and type 1 fimbriae), the aerobactin system, hemolysin, K capsule, and resistance to serum killing. This review summarizes the virtual explosion of information regarding the epidemiology, biochemistry, mechanisms of action, and genetic basis of these urovirulence factors that has occurred in the past decade and identifies areas in need of further study. Virulence factor expression is more common among certain genetically related groups of E. coli which constitute virulent clones within the larger E. coli population. In general, the more virulence factors a strain expresses, the more severe an infection it is able to cause. Certain virulence factors specifically favor the development of pyelonephritis, others favor cystitis, and others favor asymptomatic bacteriuria. The currently defined virulence factors clearly contribute to the virulence of wild-type strains but are usually insufficient in themselves to transform an avirulent organism into a pathogen, demonstrating that other as-yet-undefined virulence properties await discovery. Virulence factor testing is a useful epidemiological and research tool but as yet has no defined clinical role. Immunological and biochemical anti-virulence factor interventions are effective in animal models of UTI and hold promise for the prevention of UTI in humans.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990731735", "source": "openalex"}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Data were collected using a postal survey which was sent to 29 500 community‐dwelling women aged ≥ 18 years in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. Subjects were asked about the type of urinary incontinence they had experienced and their treatment behaviour. RESULTS Of the women who responded, 35% reported involuntary loss of urine in the preceding 30 days; stress urinary incontinence was the most prevalent type. The lowest prevalence was in Spain (23%), while the prevalence was 44%, 41% and 42% for France, Germany and the UK, respectively. About a quarter of women with urinary incontinence in Spain (24%) and the UK (25%) had consulted a doctor about it; in France (33%) and Germany (40%) the percentages were higher. Overall, &lt; 5% of the women had ever undergone surgery for their condition. While pads were used by half of the women, there were some differences among the countries. CONCLUSIONS Millions of women in Europe have urinary incontinence; the consultation and treatment rates were low in the European countries included in this study.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013470197", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3184192997", "title": "Practice Parameter: The Diagnosis, Treatment, and Evaluation of the Initial Urinary Tract Infection in Febrile Infants and Young Children", "text": "To formulate recommendations for health care professionals about the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and young children (ages 2 months to 2 years).Comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature, supplemented with consensus opinion of Subcommittee members.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Quality Improvement selected a Subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in the fields of epidemiology and informatics, infectious diseases, nephrology, pediatric practice, radiology, and urology to draft the parameter. The Subcommittee, the AAP Committee on Quality Improvement, a review panel of office-based practitioners, and other groups within and outside the AAP reviewed and revised the parameter.The Subcommittee identified the population at highest risk of incurring renal damage from UTI-infants and young children with UTI and fever. A comprehensive bibliography on UTI in infants and young children was compiled. Literature was abstracted in a formal manner, and evidence tables were constructed. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed to assess various strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation.The overall problem of managing UTI in children between 2 months and 2 years of age was conceptualized as an evidence model. The model depicts the relationship between the steps in diagnosis and management of UTI. The steps are divided into the following four phases: 1) recognizing the child at risk for UTI, 2) making the diagnosis of UTI, 3) short-term treatment of UTI, and 4) evaluation of the child with UTI for possible urinary tract abnormality. Phase 1 represents the recognition of the child at risk for UTI. Age and other clinical features define a prevalence or a prior probability of UTI, determining whether the diagnosis should be pursued. Phase 2 depicts the diagnosis of UTI. Alternative diagnostic strategies may be characterized by their cost, sensitivity, and specificity. The result of testing is the division of patients into groups according to a relatively higher or lower probability of having a UTI. The probability of UTI in each of these groups depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but also on the prior probability of the UTI among the children being tested. In this way, the usefulness of a diagnostic test depends on the prior probability of UTI established in Phase 1. Phase 3 represents the short-term treatment of UTI. Alternatives for treatment of UTI may be compared, based on their likelihood of clearing the initial UTI. Phase 4 depicts the imaging evaluation of infants with the diagnosis of UTI to identify those with urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Children with VUR are believed to be at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections, resulting in hypertension and renal failure. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy or surgical procedures such as ureteral reimplantation may prevent progressive renal damage. Therefore, identifying urinary abnormalities may offer the benefit of preventing hypertension and renal failure. Because the consequences of detection and early management of UTI are affected by subsequent evaluation and long-term management and, likewise, long-term management of patients with UTI depends on how they are detected at the outset, the Subcommittee elected to analyze the entire process from detection of UTI to the evaluation for, and consequences of, urinary tract abnormalities.

The normal prostate reaches 20 plus or minus 6 gm. in men between 21 and 30 years old, and this weight remains essentially constant with increasing age unless benign prostatic hyperplasia develops. The prevalence of pathological benign prostatic hyperplasia is only 8 per cent at the fourth decade; however, 50 per cent of the male population has pathological benign prostatic hyperplasia when they are 51 to 60 years old. The average weight of a prostate that is recognized at autopsy to contain benign prostatic hyperplasia is 33 plus or minus 16 gm. Only 4 per cent of the prostates in men more than 70 years old reach sizes greater than 100 gm. An analysis of a logistic growth curve of benign prostatic hyperplasia lesions removed at prostatectomy indicates that the growth of benign prostatic hyperplasia is initiated probably before the patient is 30 years old. The early phase of benign prostatic hyperplasia growth (men between 31 and 50 years old) is characterized by a doubling time for the tumor weight of 4.5 years. In the mid phase of benign prostatic hyperplasia growth (men between 51 and 70 years old) the doubling time is 10 years, and increases to more than 100 years in patients beyond 70 years old. © 1984 by

In addition the effects of age, hormones, and iatrogenically induced scar tissue on these structures, are discussed specifically with regard to understanding the proper basis for treatment of urinary incontinence. According to the Theory stress and urge symptoms may both derive, for different reasons from the same anatomical defect, a lax vagina. This laxity may be caused by defects within the vaginal wall itself, or its supporting structures i.e. ligaments, muscles, and their connective tissue insertions. The vagina has a dual function. It mediates (transmits) the various muscle movements involved in bladder neck opening and closure through three separate closure mechanisms. It also has a structural function, and prevents urgency by supporting the hypothesized stretch receptors at the proximal urethra and bladder neck. Altered collagen/elastin in the vaginal connective tissue and/or its ligamentous supports may cause laxity. This dissipates the muscle contraction, causing stress incontinence, and/or activation of an inappropriate micturition reflex, (“bladder instability”) by stimulation of bladder base stretch receptors. The latter is manifested by symptoms of frequency, urgency, nocturia with or without urine loss.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1895721865", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2766947181", "title": "Urinary Incontinence in Women", "text": "<h3>Importance</h3> Urinary incontinence, the involuntary loss of urine, is a common health condition that may decrease quality of life. Ten to twenty percent of women and up to 77% of women residing in nursing homes have urinary incontinence, yet only 25% seek or receive treatment. <h3>Observations</h3> This review summarizes the evaluation and therapeutic options for women affected by urinary incontinence. The initial assessment should focus on understanding the effect of incontinence on quality of life, the patient's goals and preferences for treatment, the results of previous treatments, and the presence of concomitant conditions, such as advanced pelvic organ prolapse, that may require referral. Infection and hematuria need to be ruled out. In the absence of urinary infection or serious underlying pathology (such as cancer or serious neurologic disease) associated with urinary incontinence, the clinician should initiate unsupervised pelvic muscle exercises and lifestyle modifications appropriate to the patient to reduce her symptoms. These recommendations can include weight loss, adequate hydration, avoidance of excessive fluids, and regular voiding intervals that reduce urgency incontinence episodes. Urgency incontinence medications, with timely reassessment of symptoms, can be started without extensive evaluation. Specialist treatments for urgency incontinence include onabotulinumtoxinA and percutaneous or implanted neuromodulators. Stress incontinence surgery, the midurethral sling, is associated with symptom improvement in 48% to 90% of women and has low rates of mesh complications (&lt;5%). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Urinary incontinence is common in women, although few seek care despite many effective treatment options. Clinicians should prioritize urinary incontinence detection, identify and treat modifiable factors, incorporate patient preference into evaluation and treatment, initiate conservative and medical therapy, and refer to specialists when underlying pathology is identified or conservative measures are ineffective.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2766947181", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we used LC-MS/MS to profile the proteome of human urinary exosomes. Overall, the analysis identified 1132 proteins unambiguously, including 177 that are represented on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database of disease-related genes, suggesting that exosome analysis is a potential approach to discover urinary biomarkers. We extended the proteomic analysis to phosphoproteomic profiling using neutral loss scanning, and this yielded multiple novel phosphorylation sites, including serine-811 in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter, NCC. To demonstrate the potential use of exosome analysis to identify a genetic renal disease, we carried out immunoblotting of exosomes from urine samples of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bartter syndrome type I, showing an absence of the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter 2, NKCC2.

Materials and Methods: Primary outcome variables were obtained from voiding diaries. After baseline evaluation candidates who satisfied inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. Test stimulation results determined eligibility for randomization into a stimulation (treatment) or delay (control) group. The stimulation group included 34 patients who underwent implantation and were followed for 6 months. The delay group comprised 42 patients who received standard medical therapy for 6 months and then were offered implantation. The stimulation group completed a therapy evaluation test (on versus off) after 6 months. Results: At 6 months the number of daily incontinence episodes, severity of episodes and absorbent pads or diapers replaced daily due to incontinence were significantly reduced in the stimulation compared to the delay group (all p <0.0001). Of the 34 stimulation group patients 16 (47%) were completely dry and an additional 10 (29%) demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in incontinence episodes 6 months after implantation. Efficacy appeared to be sustained for 18 months. During the therapy evaluation test the group returned to baseline levels of incontinence when stimulation was inactivated. Urodynamic testing confirmed that sacral nerve stimulation did not adversely affect voiding function. Complications included implantable pulse generator site pain in 15.9% of the patients, implant site pain in 19.1% and lead migration in 7.0%. Surgical revision was required in 32.5% of patients with implants to resolve a complication. There were no reports of permanent injury or nerve damage. Conclusions: Sacral nerve stimulation is safe and effective in treating refractory urinary urge incontinence. References 1 United States Department of Health and Human Services.

To evaluate the frequency of urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection in children with chronic constipation and report on the resolution of these with treatment of the underlying constipation. Methods. We evaluated the frequency of urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection in 234 chronic constipated and encopretic children before, and at least 12 months after, the start of treatment for constipation. Results. Twenty-nine percent complained of daytime urinary incontinence and 34% of nighttime urinary incontinence. Urinary tract infection was present in 11% and was more commonly present in girls than in boys (33% vs 3%). Vesicoureteral reflux was present in four and megacystis in four of the 25 children who had a voiding cystourethrogram because of urinary tract infection. One girl who came in had constipation and acute urinary retention. The treatment for constipation consisted of disimpaction and maintenance treatment, which included the prevention of reaccumulation of stools and reconditioning to normal bowel habits through timed toilet sitting. Follow-up, at least 12 months after start of treatment for constipation, revealed that the constipation was relieved successfully in 52%. Relief of constipation resulted in disappearance of daytime urinary incontinence in 89% and nighttime urinary incontinence in 63% of patients, and disappearance of recurrent urinary tract infections in all patients who had no anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract. Conclusion. Urinary symptoms were found in a significant number of children who had functional constipation and encopresis. With treatment of the constipation, most patients became clean and dry and further recurrence of urinary tract infections was prevented.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995469149", "source": "openalex"}

We address meaningful points that may help optimize clinical results in patients with an orthotopic bladder substitute. Materials and Methods: The review involved an objective evaluation of the basic science literature of functional, structural and physiological characteristics of gastrointestinal tissue as a substitute for bladder. Potential problems that may be associated with particular parts of the gut for use in reconstruction are discussed. We also summarize the clinical results and complications of orthotopic reconstruction. Results: In the last 10 years the paradigm for choosing urinary diversion has changed substantially: In 2002 all patients undergoing cystectomy were neobladder candidates. It is critically important to understand the phenomenon of maturation. The motor and pharmacological response of the implanted gut changes dramatically toward that of the bladder. Structural and ultrastructural changes in the ileal mucosa lead to a primitive epithelium similar to urothelium. The need for reflux prevention is not the same as in ureterosigmoidostomy conduit or continent diversion. Reflux prevention in neobladders is even less important than in a normal bladder. When using nonrefluxing techniques, the risk of obstruction is at least twice that after direct anastomosis. Kidney function is not impaired by diversion if stenosis is recognized and managed. Patient health status is more influenced by underlying disease than by diversion. Complications of neobladders are actually similar to or lower than the true rates after conduit formation, in contrast to the popular view that conduits are simple and safe. Some degree of nocturnal leakage is a consistent finding in most reports despite a technically sound operation. The precise pathogenesis of urinary retention requiring clean intermittent catheterization remains uncertain. There are new complications, such as neobladder rupture and mucous tamponade. Conclusions: Orthotopic reconstruction has passed the test of time. In these patients life is similar to that in individuals with a native lower urinary tract. Until a better solution is devised orthotopic bladder reconstruction remains the best option for patients requiring cystectomy.

The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2095918352", "source": "openalex"}

Men between 40 and 79 years old with no history of prostate or other urological surgery, and who also were free of conditions associated with neurogenic bladder were invited to participate. A previously validated questionnaire was completed by the subject. Urine flow measures, current medications and family histories of urinary disease were also obtained. Nonresponse corrected scores for a composite of obstructive symptoms showed moderate to severe symptomatology among 13% of the men 40 to 49 years old and 28% of those older than 70 years. Prostatism is a highly prevalent symptom complex among unselected men in the community. The specific urinary symptoms of nocturia, weak stream, restarting, urgency and sensation of incomplete emptying are strongly age-related and, therefore, may be predictive of a prostatic disease process.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W100997517", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2106445408", "title": "Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion, Mortality, and Cardiovascular Events", "text": "The optimal range of sodium intake for cardiovascular health is controversial.We obtained morning fasting urine samples from 101,945 persons in 17 countries and estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion (used as a surrogate for intake). We examined the association between estimated urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the composite outcome of death and major cardiovascular events.The mean estimated sodium and potassium excretion was 4.93 g per day and 2.12 g per day, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the composite outcome occurred in 3317 participants (3.3%). As compared with an estimated sodium excretion of 4.00 to 5.99 g per day (reference range), a higher estimated sodium excretion (≥ 7.00 g per day) was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.30), as well as increased risks of death and major cardiovascular events considered separately. The association between a high estimated sodium excretion and the composite outcome was strongest among participants with hypertension (P=0.02 for interaction), with an increased risk at an estimated sodium excretion of 6.00 g or more per day. As compared with the reference range, an estimated sodium excretion that was below 3.00 g per day was also associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.44). As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome.In this study in which sodium intake was estimated on the basis of measured urinary excretion, an estimated sodium intake between 3 g per day and 6 g per day was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events than was either a higher or lower estimated level of intake. As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2148342716", "title": "Discovery of Urinary Biomarkers", "text": "A myriad of proteins and peptides can be identified in normal human urine. These are derived from a variety of sources including glomerular filtration of blood plasma, cell sloughing, apoptosis, proteolytic cleavage of cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, and secretion of exosomes by epithelial cells. Mass spectrometry-based approaches to urinary protein and peptide profiling can, in principle, reveal changes in excretion rates of specific proteins/peptides that can have predictive value in the clinical arena, e.g. in the early diagnosis of disease, in classification of disease with regard to likely therapeutic responses, in assessment of prognosis, and in monitoring response to therapy. These approaches have potential value, not only in diseases of the kidney and urinary tract but also in systemic diseases that are associated with circulating small protein and peptide markers that can pass the glomerular filter. Most large scale biomarker discovery studies reported thus far have used one of two approaches to identify proteins and peptides whose excretion in urine changes in specific disease states: 1) two-dimensional electrophoresis with mass spectrometric and/or immunochemical identification of proteins and 2) top-down mass spectrometric methods (SELDI-TOF-MS and capillary electrophoresis-MS). These studies have been chiefly in the areas of nephrology, urology, and oncology. We review these applications, focusing on two areas of progress, viz. in bladder cancer and in acute rejection of renal transplants. Progress has been limited so far. However, with the advent of powerful LC-MS/MS methods along with methods for quantifying LC-MS/MS output, there is hope for an accelerated discovery and validation of disease biomarkers in urine.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148342716", "source": "openalex"}

Each year, more than 1 million patients in U.S. acute-care hospitals and extended-care facilities acquire such an infection; the risk with short-term catheterization is 5% per day. CAUTI is the second most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection, and studies suggest that patients with CAUTI have an increased institutional death rate, unrelated to the development of urosepsis. Novel urinary catheters impregnated with nitrofurazone or minocycline and rifampin or coated with a silver alloy-hydrogel exhibit antiinfective surface activity that significantly reduces the risk of CAUTI for short-term catheterizations not exceeding 2-3 weeks.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159668600", "source": "openalex"}

As biofilm ultimately develops on all of these devices, the major determinant for development of bacteriuria is duration of catheterization. While the proportion of bacteriuric subjects who develop symptomatic infection is low, the high frequency of use of indwelling urinary catheters means there is a substantial burden attributable to these infections. Catheter-acquired urinary infection is the source for about 20% of episodes of health-care acquired bacteremia in acute care facilities, and over 50% in long term care facilities. The most important interventions to prevent bacteriuria and infection are to limit indwelling catheter use and, when catheter use is necessary, to discontinue the catheter as soon as clinically feasible. Infection control programs in health care facilities must implement and monitor strategies to limit catheter-acquired urinary infection, including surveillance of catheter use, appropriateness of catheter indications, and complications. Ultimately, prevention of these infections will require technical advances in catheter materials which prevent biofilm formation.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129028806", "source": "openalex"}

The technique has been elaborated from previous experimental and clinical studies and aims at restoration of the pubourethral ligament and the suburethral vaginal hammock. Thirty-eight patients suffered from genuine stress incontinence as objectively verified and 12 patients had symptoms and signs of both urge and stress incontinence. Thirty-nine (78%) patients were completely cured from their stress incontinence symptoms. Another six patients (12%) reported a considerable improvement of their urinary incontinence leaking only occasionally. Concerning urge incontinence symptoms a significant relief of the symptoms was obtained in 6 of 12 patients. No intra- or postoperative complications occurred.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103186559", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2037728383", "title": "Urinary Concentrations of Bisphenol A and 4-Nonylphenol in a Human Reference Population", "text": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, which are used in baby bottles, as protective coatings on food containers, and for composites and sealants in dentistry. 4-Nonylphenol (NP) is used to make nonylphenol ethoxylates, nonionic surfactants applied as emulsifying, wetting, dispersing, or stabilizing agents in industrial, agricultural, and domestic consumer products. The potential for human exposure to BPA and NP is high because of their widespread use. We measured BPA and NP in archived urine samples from a reference population of 394 adults in the United States using isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The concentration ranges of BPA and NP were similar to those observed in other human populations. BPA was detected in 95% of the samples examined at concentrations > or = 0.1 microg/L urine; the geometric mean and median concentrations were 1.33 microg/L (1.36 microg/g creatinine) and 1.28 microg/L (1.32 microg/g creatinine), respectively; the 95th percentile concentration was 5.18 microg/L (7.95 microg/g creatinine). NP was detected in 51% of the samples examined > or = 0.1 microg/L. The median and 95th percentile concentrations were < 0.1 microg/L and 1.57 microg/L (1.39 microg/g creatinine), respectively. The frequent detection of BPA suggests widespread exposure to this compound in residents of the United States. The lower frequency of detection of NP than of BPA could be explained by a lower exposure of humans to NP, by different pharmacokinetic factors (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination), by the fact that 4-n-nonylphenol--the measured NP isomer--represents a small percentage of the NP used in commercial mixtures, or a combination of all of the above. Additional research is needed to determine the best urinary biomarker(s) to assess exposure to NP. Despite the sample population's nonrepresentativeness of the U.S. population (although sample weights were used to improve the extent to which the results represent the U.S. population) and relatively small size, this study provides the first reference range of human internal dose levels of BPA and NP in a demographically diverse human population.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037728383", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in 281 men were randomly assigned (1:1) to 5 mg tadalafil for 6 weeks, followed by dose escalation to 20 mg for 6 weeks or 12 weeks of placebo. Results: Tadalafil significantly improved the mean change from baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score at 6 weeks (5 mg tadalafil −2.8 vs placebo −1.2) and at 12 weeks (5/20 mg tadalafil −3.8 vs placebo −1.7). Larger changes were observed with inclusion of the placebo run-in at 12 weeks (5/20 mg tadalafil −7.1 vs placebo −4.5). Significant improvements were also seen in the International Prostate Symptom Score irritative and obstructive domains, the International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life index, a question about urinary symptom improvement and the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (significant at 12 weeks) vs placebo. International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain scores significantly improved in the 56% of men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia who were sexually active and had erectile dysfunction. Changes in uroflowmetry parameters were similar in the placebo and tadalafil groups. Commonly reported (2% or greater) treatment emergent adverse events were \"erection increased,\" dyspepsia, back pain, headache, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (each 5.1% or less). No change in post-void residual volume was seen with tadalafil treatment. Conclusions: Tadalafil once daily was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant symptomatic improvement for lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tadalafil also improved erectile function in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction. References 1 : Urologic diseases in America project: benign prostatic hyperplasia.

We included women aged 18-89 years and estimated age-specific incidence rates and cumulative incidence (lifetime risk) of SUI surgery, POP surgery, and either incontinence or prolapse surgery with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated lifetime risk until the age of 80 years to be consistent with prior studies.From 2007 to 2011, we evaluated 10,177,480 adult women who were followed for 24,979,447 person-years. Among these women, we identified 65,397 incident, or first, SUI and 57,755 incident prolapse surgeries. Overall, we found that the lifetime risk of any primary surgery for SUI or POP was 20.0% (95% CI 19.9-20.2) by the age of 80 years. Separately, the cumulative risk for SUI surgery was 13.6% (95% CI 13.5-13.7) and that for POP surgery was 12.6% (95% CI 12.4-2.7). For age-specific annual risk, SUI demonstrated a bimodal peak at age 46 years and then again at age 70-71 years with annual risks of 3.8 and 3.9 per 1,000 women, respectively. For POP, the risk increased progressively until ages 71 and 73 years when the annual risk was 4.3 per 1,000 women.Based on a U.S. claims and encounters database, the estimated lifetime risk of surgery for either SUI or POP in women is 20.0% by the age of 80 years.III.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2402471166", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were recruited between November 2004 and February 2006, and the study was completed May 2006.Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 222), 4 mg of tolterodine ER (n = 217), 0.4 mg of tamsulosin (n = 215), or both tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin (n = 225) for 12 weeks.Patient perception of treatment benefit, bladder diary variables, International Prostate Symptom Scores, and safety and tolerability were assessed.A total of 172 men (80%) receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin reported treatment benefit by week 12 compared with 132 patients (62%) receiving placebo (P<.001), 146 (71%) receiving tamsulosin (P=.06 vs placebo), or 135 (65%) receiving tolterodine ER (P=.48 vs placebo). Patients receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin compared with placebo experienced significant reductions in urgency urinary incontinence (-0.88 vs -0.31, P=.005), urgency episodes without incontinence (-3.33 vs -2.54, P=.03), micturitions per 24 hours (-2.54 vs -1.41, P<.001), and micturitions per night (-0.59 vs -0.39, P.02). Patients receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin demonstrated significant improvements on the total International Prostate Symptom Score (-8.02 vs placebo, -6.19, P=.003) and QOL item (-1.61 vs -1.17, P=.003). All interventions were well tolerated. The incidence of acute urinary retention requiring catheterization was low (tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin, 0.4%; tolterodine ER, 0.5%; tamsulosin, 0%; and placebo, 0%).These results suggest that treatment with tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin for 12 weeks provides benefit for men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms including overactive bladder.

The present document serves as a stand-alone terminology update reflecting refinement and current advancement of knowledge on pediatric LUT function. Methods A variety of worldwide experts from multiple disciplines within the ICCS leadership who care for children with LUT dysfunction were assembled as part of the standardization committee. A critical review of the previous ICCS terminology document and the current literature was performed. Additionally, contributions and feedback from the multidisciplinary ICCS membership were solicited. Results Following a review of the literature over the last 7 years, the ICCS experts assembled a new terminology document reflecting current understanding of bladder function and LUT dysfunction in children using the resources from the literature review, expert opinion and ICCS member feedback. Conclusions The present ICCS terminology document provides a current and consensus update to the evolving terminology and understanding of LUT function in children. Neurourol.

This is a narrative review aimed at acting as an introduction to the epidemiology and burden of UTIs. This review is based on relevant literature according to the experience and expertise of the authors. The prevalence of UTI increases with age, and in women aged over 65 is approximately double the rate seen in the female population overall. Etiology in this age group varies by health status with factors such as catheterization affecting the likelihood of infection and the pathogens most likely to be responsible. In younger women, increased sexual activity is a major risk factor for UTIs and recurrence within 6 months is common. In the female population overall, more serious infections such as pyelonephritis are less frequent but are associated with a significant burden of care due to the risk of hospitalization. Healthcare-associated UTIs (HAUTIs) are the most common form of healthcare-acquired infection. Large global surveys indicate that the nature of pathogens varies between the community and hospital setting. In addition, the pathogens responsible for HAUTIs vary according to region making adequate local data key to infection control. UTIs create a significant societal and personal burden, with a substantial number of medical visits in the United States every year being related to UTIs. European data indicate that recurrent infections are related to increased absenteeism and physician visits. In addition, quality of life measures are significantly impacted in women suffering from recurrent UTIs. Data suggest that nonantimicrobial prophylactic strategies offer an opportunity to reduce both the rate of UTIs and the personal burden experience by patients.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2943512397", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1502228150", "title": "Neural Control of the Lower Urinary Tract", "text": "This article summarizes anatomical, neurophysiological, pharmacological, and brain imaging studies in humans and animals that have provided insights into the neural circuitry and neurotransmitter mechanisms controlling the lower urinary tract. The functions of the lower urinary tract to store and periodically eliminate urine are regulated by a complex neural control system in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral autonomic ganglia that coordinates the activity of smooth and striated muscles of the bladder and urethral outlet. The neural control of micturition is organized as a hierarchical system in which spinal storage mechanisms are in turn regulated by circuitry in the rostral brain stem that initiates reflex voiding. Input from the forebrain triggers voluntary voiding by modulating the brain stem circuitry. Many neural circuits controlling the lower urinary tract exhibit switch-like patterns of activity that turn on and off in an all-or-none manner. The major component of the micturition switching circuit is a spinobulbospinal parasympathetic reflex pathway that has essential connections in the periaqueductal gray and pontine micturition center. A computer model of this circuit that mimics the switching functions of the bladder and urethra at the onset of micturition is described. Micturition occurs involuntarily in infants and young children until the age of 3 to 5 years, after which it is regulated voluntarily. Diseases or injuries of the nervous system in adults can cause the re-emergence of involuntary micturition, leading to urinary incontinence. Neuroplasticity underlying these developmental and pathological changes in voiding function is discussed. © 2015 American Physiological Society.

Two laboratory studies (A, B) and one field study (C) were conducted to determine if urine color (Ucol) indicates hydration status accurately and to clarify the interchangeability of Ucol, urine osmolality (Uosm), and urine specific gravity (Usg) in research. Ucol, Uosm, and Usg were not significantly correlated with plasma osmolality, plasma sodium, or hematocrit. This suggested that these hematologic measurements are not as sensitive to mild hypohydration (between days) as the selected urinary indices are. When the data from A, B, and C were combined, Ucol was strongly correlated with Usg and Uosm. It was concluded that (a) Ucol may be used in athletic/industrial settings or field studies, where close estimates of Usg or Uosm are acceptable, but should not be utilized in laboratories where greater precision and accuracy are required, and (b) Uosm and Usg may be used interchangeably to determine hydration status.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165129567", "source": "openalex"}

Relations between electrolyte excretion and blood pressure were studied in individual subjects within each centre and the results of these regression analyses pooled for all 52 centres. Relations between population median electrolyte values and population blood pressure values were also analysed across the 52 centres. Sodium excretion ranged from 0.2 mmol/24 h (Yanomamo Indians, Brazil) to 242 mmol/24 h (north China). In individual subjects (within centres) it was significantly related to blood pressure. Four centres found very low sodium excretion, low blood pressure, and little or no upward slope of blood pressure with age. Across the other 48 centres sodium was significantly related to the slope of blood pressure with age but not to median blood pressure or prevalence of high blood pressure. Potassium excretion was negatively correlated with blood pressure in individual subjects after adjustment for confounding variables. Across centres there was no consistent association.

Pyelonephritis is the commonest disease of the kidneys at autopsy. Active pyelonephritis has been found in 10% to 20% of autopsies in several general hospitals,<sup>4-6</sup>and healed pyelonephritis occurs about as frequently as does active pyelonephritis.<sup>6</sup> 2. Pyelonephritis has been implicated, with varying degrees of evidence, in such disorders as hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, toxemias of pregnancy, various disturbances in electrolyte metabolism, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and stone formation. 3. Despite the importance of this group of diseases the diagnosis of infection of the urinary tract is made in only about 20%", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2082847784", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2414688552", "title": "Global epidemiology of urinary tract infections", "text": "Purpose of review Both in the community and hospital setting, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Initial appropriate empirical treatment requires a good knowledge of epidemiological data. In this review, the most recent global epidemiological data of UTIs have been summarized. Recent findings Community-associated UTI (CAUTI) prevalence is 0.7% and the main risk factors are age, history of UTI, sexual activity and diabetes. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli and resistance rates to common antibiotics depend very much on the geographical location. The lowest observed resistance was for fosfomycin (range: 0–2.9%), nitrofurantoin (range: 0–4.4%) and mecillinam (range: 0–4%). Healthcare-associated UTI (HAUTI) frequency among HCAIs is 12.9 (confidence interval: 10.2–16%), 19.6 and 24% in the United States, Europe and developing countries, respectively. In urology departments, the prevalence is 5.1%. Resistance to almost all antibiotics in HAUTIs is above 20% and there is a significant geographical variation. Community onset HAUTIs bacterial spectrum is similar to hospital onset HAUTIs and different from CAUTIs. Summary It is challenging to provide with an exact frequency of UTIs. Both CAUTI and HAUTI frequency, pathogen spectrum and resistance rates vary according to geographical setting.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2414688552", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2115234115", "title": "Weight Loss to Treat Urinary Incontinence in Overweight and Obese Women", "text": "Obesity is an established and modifiable risk factor for urinary incontinence, but conclusive evidence for a beneficial effect of weight loss on urinary incontinence is lacking. We randomly assigned 338 overweight and obese women with at least 10 urinary-incontinence episodes per week to an intensive 6-month weight-loss program that included diet, exercise, and behavior modification (226 patients) or to a structured education program (112 patients). The mean (+/-SD) age of the participants was 53+/-11 years. The body-mass index (BMI) (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the weekly number of incontinence episodes as recorded in a 7-day diary of voiding were similar in the intervention group and the control group at baseline (BMI, 36+/-6 and 36+/-5, respectively; incontinence episodes, 24+/-18 and 24+/-16, respectively). The women in the intervention group had a mean weight loss of 8.0% (7.8 kg), as compared with 1.6% (1.5 kg) in the control group (P<0.001). After 6 months, the mean weekly number of incontinence episodes decreased by 47% in the intervention group, as compared with 28% in the control group (P=0.01). As compared with the control group, the intervention group had a greater decrease in the frequency of stress-incontinence episodes (P=0.02), but not of urge-incontinence episodes (P=0.14). A higher proportion of the intervention group than of the control group had a clinically relevant reduction of 70% or more in the frequency of all incontinence episodes (P<0.001), stress-incontinence episodes (P=0.009), and urge-incontinence episodes (P=0.04). A 6-month behavioral intervention targeting weight loss reduced the frequency of self-reported urinary-incontinence episodes among overweight and obese women as compared with a control group. A decrease in urinary incontinence may be another benefit among the extensive health improvements associated with moderate weight reduction.

As a consequence, characterization of the variations of the urine metabolome under basal conditions becomes critical in order to avoid confounding effects in cohort studies. Such physiological information is however very scarce in the literature and in metabolomics databases so far. Here we studied the influence of age, body mass index (BMI), and gender on metabolite concentrations in a large cohort of 183 adults by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We implemented a comprehensive statistical workflow for univariate hypothesis testing and modeling by orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS), which we made available to the metabolomics community within the online Workflow4Metabolomics.org resource. We found 108 urine metabolites displaying concentration variations with either age, BMI, or gender, by integrating the results from univariate p-values and multivariate variable importance in projection (VIP). Several metabolite clusters were further evidenced by correlation analysis, and they allowed stratification of the cohort. In conclusion, our study highlights the impact of gender and age on the urinary metabolome, and thus it indicates that these factors should be taken into account for the design of metabolomics studies.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2341820027", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1999823179", "title": "Type 1 fimbrial expression enhances Escherichia coli virulence for the urinary tract.", "text": "Type 1 fimbriae are adhesion organelles expressed by many Gram-negative bacteria. They facilitate adherence to mucosal surfaces and inflammatory cells in vitro, but their contribution to virulence has not been defined. This study presents evidence that type 1 fimbriae increase the virulence of Escherichia coli for the urinary tract by promoting bacterial persistence and enhancing the inflammatory response to infection. In a clinical study, we observed that disease severity was greater in children infected with E. coli O1:K1:H7 isolates expressing type 1 fimbriae than in those infected with type 1 negative isolates of the same serotype. The E. coli O1:K1:H7 isolates had the same electrophoretic type, were hemolysin-negative, expressed P fimbriae, and carried the fim DNA sequences. When tested in a mouse urinary tract infection model, the type 1-positive E. coli O1:K1:H7 isolates survived in higher numbers, and induced a greater neutrophil influx into the urine, than O1:K1:H7 type 1-negative isolates. To confirm a role of type 1 fimbriae, a fimH null mutant (CN1016) was constructed from an O1:K1:H7 type 1-positive parent. E. coli CN1016 had reduced survival and inflammatogenicity in the mouse urinary tract infection model. E. coli CN1016 reconstituted with type 1 fimbriae (E. coli CN1018) had restored virulence similar to that of the wild-type parent strain. These results show that type 1 fimbriae in the genetic background of a uropathogenic strain contribute to the pathogenesis of E. coli in the urinary tract.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999823179", "source": "openalex"}

Nerve sparing radical prostatectomy was performed in men deemed appropriate candidates. Recovery of erections sufficient for intercourse and urinary continence were analyzed controlling for patient age, pathological tumor stage and the performance of unilateral or bilateral nerve sparing surgery in men followed for a minimum of 18 months. Erections were regained in 149 of 236 preoperatively potent men (63%) treated with bilateral and 24 of 59 (41%) treated with unilateral nerve sparing surgery. Recovery of erections correlated with patient age and pathological tumor stage in patients treated with bilateral nerve sparing surgery. Continence was regained in 409 of 435 patients (94%) and did not correlate with patient age, tumor stage or nerve sparing surgery. Anatomical radical retropubic prostatectomy can be performed with favorable results in preserving potency and urinary continence. Better results are achieved in younger men with organ confined cancer. © 1993 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByAtala A (2018)

Materials and Methods: We identified 1,057 patients who underwent radical cystectomy with conduit urinary diversion using ileum or colon at our institution from 1980 to 1998 with complete followup information. Patients were followed for long-term clinical outcomes and analyzed for the incidence of diversion specific complications. Results: A total of 844 patients died at a median of 4.1 years (range 0.1 to 28.1) following cystectomy. Median followup of the surviving 213 patients was 15.5 years (range 0.3 to 29.1). There were 643 (60.8%) patients with 1,453 complications directly attributable to the urinary diversion performed with a mean of 2.3 complications per patient. Bowel complications were the most common, occurring in 215 patients (20.3%), followed by renal complications in 213 (20.2%), infectious complications in 174 (16.5%), stomal complications in 163 (15.4%) and urolithiasis in 162 (15.3%). The least common were metabolic abnormalities, which occurred in 135 patients (12.8%), and structural complications, which occurred in 122 (11.5%). Increasing age at cystectomy (HR 1.21, p <0.001), increasing Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (HR 1.23, p = 0.02) and recent era of surgery (HR 1.68, p <0.001) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of complications. Conclusions: Conduit urinary diversion is associated with a high overall complication rate but a low reoperation rate. Long-term followup of these patients is necessary to closely monitor for potential complications from the urinary diversion that can occur decades later. References 1 : Cancer statistics, 2009.

Blood, 24-h urine samples, and 24-h food recall were obtained from all individuals.Serum and urinary creatinine correlated significantly with body weight, but the level of correlation with lean mass was even greater. There was no significant correlation between body weight and lean mass with cystatin C. Individuals with moderate/intense physical activity presented significantly lower mean body mass index (23.1 +/- 2.5 versus 25.7 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) and higher lean mass (55.3 +/- 10.0 versus 48.5 +/- 10.4%), serum creatinine (1.04 +/- 0.12 versus 0.95 +/- 0.17 mg/dl), urinary creatinine (1437 +/- 471 versus 1231 +/- 430 mg/24 h), protein intake (1.4 +/- 0.6 versus 1.1 +/- 0.6 g/kg per d), and meat intake (0.7 +/- 0.3 versus 0.5 +/- 0.4 g/kg per d) than the sedentary individuals. Conversely, mean serum cystatin did not differ between these two groups. A multivariate analysis of covariance showed that lean mass was significantly related to serum and urinary creatinine but not with cystatin, even after adjustment for protein/meat intake and physical activity.Cystatin C may represent a more adequate alternative to assess renal function in individuals with higher muscle mass when mild kidney impairment is suspected.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109355833", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: A total of 90 patients with transitional cell carcinoma provided voided urine samples at least 5 days postoperatively. NMP22 was determined using a commercial test kit. At initial cystoscopic examination 3 to 6 months later the disease status was recorded, and the NMP22 values before and after transurethral resection of bladder tumor were compared. Results: Of 125 followup cystoscopic examinations (60 patients had 1, 26 had 2, 3 had 3 and 1 had 4 recurrences) transitional cell carcinoma was pathologically confirmed in 33. No malignancy was present at 79 examinations (if tumor was seen endoscopically, pathological evaluation indicated atypia, dysplasia or no abnormality). NMP22 values in these 2 populations were significantly different (malignancy median 20.81 units per ml. and no malignancy median 5.72 units per ml., Mann-Whitney U test for differences between 2 medians p = 0.00005). Of the 33 recurrences 23 (70 percent) had NMP22 values greater than the reference range (10 units per ml.). Additionally, NMP22 identified all 6 subjects (100 percent) who had invasive disease 3 to 6 months later. Of 72 patients with NMP22 less than 10 units per ml. 62 (86 percent) had no malignancy at subsequent cystoscopy. Conclusions: NMP22 was highly predictive of tumor status at followup cystoscopy. This quantitative, noninvasive assay, with high negative predictive value (86 percent) and sensitivity to detect malignancy (100 percent for invasive disease and 70 percent overall), may be a helpful adjunct to cytology and endoscopy for monitoring disease status after endoscopic tumor resection.

Materials and Methods: At 23 centers a total of 203 children were included in the study, including 128 girls and 75 boys 1 to younger than 2 years. Vesicoureteral reflux grade III in 126 cases and IV in 77 was detected after a febrile urinary tract infection (194) after prenatal screening (9). Voiding cystourethrography and dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy were done before randomization and after 2 years. The febrile urinary tract infection rate was analyzed by the intent to treat principle. Results: We noted a total of 67 febrile recurrences in 42 girls and a total of 8 in 7 boys (p = 0.0001). There was a difference in the recurrence rate among treatment groups in girls with febrile infection in 8 of 43 (19%) on prophylaxis, 10 of 43 (23%) with endoscopic therapy and 24 of 42 (57%) on surveillance (p = 0.0002). In girls the recurrence rate was associated with persistent reflux after 2 years (p = 0.0095). However, reflux severity (grade III or IV) at study entry did not predict recurrence. Conclusions: In this randomized, controlled trial there was a high rate of recurrent febrile urinary tract infection in girls older than 1 year with dilating vesicoureteral reflux at study entry but not in boys. Antibiotic prophylaxis and endoscopic treatment decreased the infection rate. References 1 : Relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infection and renal damage in children.

The purpose of this study was to analyze prospectively whether the urinary albumin-to -creatinine (A/C) ratio can independently predict ischemic heart disease (IHD) in a population-based cohort. In 1983, urinary albumin and creatinine levels were measured, along with the conventional atherosclerotic risk factors, in 2085 consecutive participants without IHD, renal disease, urinary tract infection, or diabetes mellitus. The participants were followed up until death, emigration, or December 31, 1993. IHD was defined as a hospital discharge diagnosis or cause of death including the diagnoses ICD-8 and 410 to 414. Seventy-nine individuals developed IHD during the 21 130 person-years of follow-up. They were characterized by a preponderance of males and higher age, body mass index, blood pressure, lipoproteins, and proportion of current smokers. Microalbuminuria was defined as an A/C ratio) &gt;90 percentile (&gt;0.65 mg/mmol). When adjusted for other risk factors, the relative risk of IHD associated with microalbuminuria was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.9, P =0.002), and the 10-year disease-free survival decreased from 97% to 91% ( P &lt;0.0001) when microalbuminuria was present. An interaction between microalbuminuria and smoking was observed, and the presence of microalbuminuria more than doubled the predictive effect of the conventional atherosclerotic risk factors for development of IHD. It is concluded that microalbuminuria is not only an independent predictor of IHD but also substantially increases the risk associated with other established risk factors.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149734505", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2162916526", "title": "Pharmacology of the Lower Urinary Tract: Basis for Current and Future Treatments of Urinary Incontinence", "text": "The lower urinary tract constitutes a functional unit controlled by a complex interplay between the central and peripheral nervous systems and local regulatory factors. In the adult, micturition is controlled by a spinobulbospinal reflex, which is under suprapontine control. Several central nervous system transmitters can modulate voiding, as well as, potentially, drugs affecting voiding; for example, noradrenaline, GABA, or dopamine receptors and mechanisms may be therapeutically useful. Peripherally, lower urinary tract function is dependent on the concerted action of the smooth and striated muscles of the urinary bladder, urethra, and periurethral region. Various neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adenosine triphosphate, nitric oxide, and neuropeptides, have been implicated in this neural regulation. Muscarinic receptors mediate normal bladder contraction as well as at least the main part of contraction in the overactive bladder. Disorders of micturition can roughly be classified as disturbances of storage or disturbances of emptying. Failure to store urine may lead to various forms of incontinence, the main forms of which are urge and stress incontinence. The etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders remain incompletely known, which is reflected in the fact that current drug treatment includes a relatively small number of more or less well-documented alternatives. Antimuscarinics are the main-stay of pharmacological treatment of the overactive bladder syndrome, which is characterized by urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. Accepted drug treatments of stress incontinence are currently scarce, but new alternatives are emerging. New targets for control of micturition are being defined, but further research is needed to advance the pharmacological treatment of micturition disorders.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162916526", "source": "openalex"}

AUM solidified with agar enabled the recovery of a wide range of urease-positive and -negative urinary pathogens. Liquid AUM supported growth at concentrations of up to 108 cfu ml−1, as found in normal urine. Reproducible, steady-state growth also occurred over many generations in continuous culture. AUM was capable of forming crystals and encrustations resembling those found in natural urinary tract infections. The medium is a suitable replacement for normal urine for use in a wide range of experiments modelling the growth and attachment of urinary pathogens in the clinical environment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020354602", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: To assess currently marketed antimicrobial urinary catheters for preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI). Data Sources: Electronic databases, conference proceedings, bibliographies, trialists, and catheter manufacturers (search dates, 1966 to June 2005). Study Selection: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of nitrofurazone-coated or silver alloy–coated antimicrobial urinary catheter use for less than 30 days; no language restriction. Data Extraction: Study design, study sample, inclusion and exclusion criteria, allocation, blinding, UTI definition, ascertainment methods, and proportion developing symptomatic UTI (primary end point) or bacteriuria (secondary end point) were extracted by using a structured data collection instrument. Data Synthesis: Twelve qualifying trials (13 392 total participants or catheters) were identified. They compared nitrofurazone-coated silicone (n = 3) or silver-coated latex (n = 9) catheters with silicone or latex catheters. No study addressed symptomatic UTI. All trials suggested protection against bacteriuria with test catheter use. However, effect size varied considerably and postrandomization exclusions were very common. Effect size was greatest in trials of nitrofurazone-coated catheters (all post-1995) and in pre-1995 silver alloy–coated catheter trials and was smallest in post-1995 silver alloy–coated catheter trials. Control group bacteriuria rate, control catheter type (latex vs. silicone), and patient sample (urology vs. other) also predicted effect size. Few studies addressed secondary bloodstream infection, mortality, costs, or microbial resistance. Short-term adverse effects were minimal. Limitations: The study was limited by the number, size, and quality of studies and by lack of the following: intention-to-treat analyses, data on clinical end points, and trials comparing nitrofurazone-coated with silver alloy–coated catheters. Conclusions: According to fair-quality evidence, antimicrobial urinary catheters can prevent bacteriuria in hospitalized patients during short-term catheterization, depending on antimicrobial coating and several other variables. Older data probably lack current relevance. Cost implications and effect on infectious complications remain undefined.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990229031", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2082988422", "title": "Antibiotic Prophylaxis and Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Children", "text": "Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P > or = 0.20 for all interactions).Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed the records of 100 patients and mailed a questionnaire to those without recent followup. Results: Overall 84 patients were continent, including 36 with the original artificial urinary sphincter in place who were dry at a median followup of 11 years and 27 in whom the device was successfully replaced due to mechanical failure who were previously continent for a median of 7 years. In 21 patients it was removed due to infection or erosion and reimplantation was successful 3 to 6 months later or they remained dry without another artificial urinary sphincter. Of the male patients with a bulbar and bladder neck sphincter 92% and 84%, respectively, were continent at 10 years as well as 73% of the females. Device survival was 66% at 10 years. Overall 37% of the prostheses were removed due to infection or erosion in the 10-year period with the highest risk in females (56%) and lowest in males with a bulbar sphincter (23%). Conclusions: The artificial urinary sphincter is effective long-term treatment for incontinence in male patients. In female patients the risk of erosion is high, although overall long-term continence is satisfactory. References 1 : Treatment of urinary incontinence by an implantable prosthetic sphincter.

We compared sensory nerve provocative ability of sodium versus potassium, and determined whether intravesical potassium sensitivity discriminates patients with interstitial cystitis from normal subjects and those with other sensory disorders of the bladder. Materials and Methods: A total of 231 patients with interstitial cystitis and 41 normal subjects underwent intravesical challenge with 40 ml. water and then 40 ml. of 40 mEq./100 ml. potassium chloride. Subjective responses of urgency or pain stimulation were recorded on a scale of 0 to 5. In 19 normal subjects potassium absorption was measured at baseline, after injury of the bladder mucus with protamine, after heparin treatment to reverse mucus damage and then for a final time. These subjects simultaneously recorded the symptoms of sensory urgency and pain at baseline, after protamine and after heparin. Another group of normal volunteers underwent a challenge with sodium versus potassium to determine which cation was more provocative. Patients with bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), detrusor instability, and acute and chronic urinary tract infection but no current infection were also evaluated for potassium sensitivity. Results: Neither normal subjects nor patients with interstitial cystitis reacted to water administered intravesically. There was marked sensitivity to intravesical potassium in 75% of patients with interstitial cystitis versus 4% of controls (p <0.01). Only 1 patient with BPH responded to potassium and none of the 5 with chronic urinary tract infection responded. All 4 patients (100%) with a current acute urinary tract infection reacted positively to the potassium challenge. Of 16 patients with detrusor instability 25% responded. Normal subjects had minimal sensitivity to potassium before (11%) and markedly increased sensitivity after (79%) protamine treatment, and these symptoms were reversed by heparin in 42%. Potassium absorption directly correlated with symptoms (0.4, 3.0 and 1.3 mEq. before and after protamine, and after heparin reversal, respectively). In regard to sodium versus potassium provocation, potassium was far more provocative for causing urgency after protamine (10 versus 90%). Neither group underwent provocation before protamine. Conclusions: Chronic diffusion of urinary potassium into the bladder interstitium may induce sensory symptoms, damage tissue and be a major toxic factor in the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis. Intravesical potassium sensitivity is a reliable method for detecting abnormal epithelial permeability. It discriminates between patients with interstitial cystitis and normal subjects with intact epithelial function, and it is a useful diagnostic test for interstitial cystitis. Potassium sensitivity correlates with increased potassium absorption in normal subjects, and potassium is far more provocative than sodium. Potassium sensitivity is also present in acute urinary tract infection and occasionally detrusor instability but not in BPH or chronic urinary tract infections.

Clinical behavioral disorders and subclinical psychological symptoms are reviewed. Aspects of screening, assessment, counseling and in severe cases treatment are outlined, and recommendations are formulated. Materials and Methods: Relevant publications on psychological and psychiatric aspects are reviewed. The recommendations passed several rounds of consensus finding, and were circulated among International Children's Continence Society members and external experts. Results: In addition to subclinical effects on self-esteem, quality of life and distress, the rate of comorbid clinical behavioral disorders is increased. In fact, 20% to 30% of children with nocturnal enuresis, 20% to 40% with daytime urinary incontinence and 30% to 50% with fecal incontinence fulfill the criteria for ICD-10 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV psychiatric disorders. These concomitant disturbances require assessment and counseling, and in severe cases treatment. They have a negative effect on compliance and outcome if not addressed and left untreated. Conclusions: Because the comorbidity rate is high, screening for psychological symptoms is recommended for all children in all settings with enuresis and/or daytime urinary and/or fecal incontinence. Standardized, validated questionnaires are recommended. In addition to clinical observation and history, a short screening questionnaire can be used as a first step. If problem behaviors are present a longer broadband questionnaire is recommended. If problem items in the clinical range are noted, a full child psychiatric or psychological assessment is recommended.

A survey, consisting of a multi-stage probability sample of 13,912 households, was done in Washtenaw County, Michigan to estimate these prevalences. A total of 1,955 senior citizens 60 or more years old was interviewed. The prevalences of urinary incontinence, difficult bladder emptying and irritative bladder symptoms were 18.9, 22.1 and 11.8 per cent, respectively, in men, and 37.7, 10.8 and 17.4 per cent, respectively, in women. Urinary incontinence was significantly more prevalent among all respondents with bladder emptying and irritative symptoms than those without such symptoms (p less than 0.001). The frequency of voiding was significantly increased among respondents with incontinence, or emptying or irritative symptoms compared to asymptomatic respondents (p less than 0.001). These survey data are of importance to senior citizens, care providers and governmental agencies. © 1986 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 136Issue 5November 1986Page: 1021-1025 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 1986 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Ananias C.

Patients, subjects and methods Items covering as wide a range of urinary symptoms as possible were devised after consultation with clinicians and a health scientist, a literature review and discussion with patients. Additional items assessed the degree of ‘bother’ that symptoms were causing. Eighty‐five women with clinical symptoms attending for urodynamic assessment and 20 women with nonewere asked to self‐complete the questionnaire. The instrument's validity was assessed by interviewing patients and measuring levels of missing data, comparing symptom scores between clinical and non‐clinical populations and comparison with frequency/volume charts and data from pad tests. The instrument's reliability was assessed by measuring both internal consistency and stability, using a 2‐week test‐retest analysis. Results The questionnaire was completed by the patients with a mean of only 2% of items missing; most questions were easily understood. Construct validity was good, with the instrument easily differentiating clinical and non‐clinical populations. Criterion validity, as tested against frequency/volume charts and pad‐test data, was acceptable, with Kappa coefficients of 0.29–0.79 for frequency/volume data and Spearman rank correlations of 0.50–0.97 and 0.31–0.67 for frequency/volume and pad‐test data, respectively. The reliability of the instrument was good; a Cronbach's alpha of 0.78 indicated that the symptom questions had high internal consistency, while stability was excellent, with 78% of symptoms and problems answered identically on two occasions, and Spearman rank correlations of 0.86 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion The instrument has good psychometric validity and reliability. The stability demonstrated at baseline and the ability to differentiate clearly between community and clinical populations suggest that it should be ideal for measuring changes following therapeutic intervention. The addition of life‐impact items and a ‘bother’ factor may provide the opportunity to identify those women who wish treatment for their symptoms; this dimension requires further exploration.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109504141", "source": "openalex"}

Enteric bacteria (in particular, Escherichia coli) remain the most frequent cause of UTIs, although the distribution of pathogens that cause UTIs is changing. More important is the increase in resistance to some antimicrobial agents, particularly the resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole seen in E. coli. Physicians distinguish UTIs from other diseases that have similar clinical presentations with use of a small number of tests, none of which, if used individually, have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Among the diagnostic tests, urinalysis is useful mainly for excluding bacteriuria. Urine culture may not be necessary as part of the evaluation of outpatients with uncomplicated UTIs, but it is necessary for outpatients who have recurrent UTIs, experience treatment failures, or have complicated UTIs, as well as for inpatients who develop UTIs.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165186144", "source": "openalex"}

Appropriate core clinical categories and a subclassification were developed to give a numeric coding to each definition. An extensive process of 22 rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus).A Terminology Report for male lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms and dysfunction, encompassing around 390 separate definitions/descriptors, has been developed. It is clinically-based with the most common diagnoses defined. Clarity and user-friendliness have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in male lower urinary tract and pelvic floor dysfunction. Male-specific imaging (ultrasound, radiology, CT, and MRI) has been a major addition whilst appropriate figures have been included to supplement and help clarify the text.A consensus-based Terminology Report for male lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms and dysfunction has been produced aimed at being a significant aid to clinical practice and a stimulus for research.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2913863236", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: A total of 177 patients with urinary retention refractory to standard therapy were enrolled in the study. Greater than 50% improvement in baseline voiding symptoms during a 3 to 7-day percutaneous test stimulation qualified a patient for surgical implantation of an InterStim∥ Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota. system. Of the patients who qualified for implantation 37 were randomly assigned to a treatment and 31 to a control group. Patients in the treatment group underwent early surgical implantation of the sacral nerve stimulation system, while implantation was delayed in the control group for 6 months. Followup evaluations, including voiding diary analysis and temporary deactivation of the stimulator at 6 months, were conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after implantation in the treatment group, and after 3 and 6 months in the control group. Results: Compared to the control group, patients implanted with the InterStim system had statistically and clinically significant reductions in the catheter volume per catheterization (p <0.0001). Of the patients treated with implants 69% eliminated catheterization at 6 months and an additional 14% had a 50% or greater reduction in catheter volume per catheterization. Therefore, successful results were achieved in 83% of the implant group with retention compared to 9% of the control group at 6 months. Temporary inactivation of sacral nerve stimulation therapy resulted in a significant increase in residual volumes (p <0.0001) but effectiveness of sacral nerve stimulation was sustained through 18 months after implant. Conclusions: Results of this prospective, randomized clinical study demonstrate that sacral nerve stimulation is effective for restoring voiding in patients with retention who are refractory to other forms of treatment.

Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved, multicenter registered trial randomized women with refractory urge incontinence, detrusor overactivity incontinence and 6 or greater urge incontinence episodes in 3 days to botulinum toxin A or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. Refractory was defined as inadequate symptom control after 2 or more attempts at pharmacotherapy and 1 or more other first line therapies for detrusor overactivity incontinence. The primary outcome measure was time to failure, as evidenced by a Patient Global Impression of Improvement score of 4 or greater at least 2 months after injection, or changes in treatment (initiation or increase) at any time after injection. Safety data, including increased post-void residual volume, defined as more than 200 ml irrespective of symptoms, was obtained at specified time points. Results: Approximately 60% of the women who received botulinum toxin A had a clinical response based on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. The median duration of their responses was 373 days, significantly longer than the 62 days or less for placebo (p <0.0001). In the botulinum toxin A group increased post-void residual urine (12 of 28 women or 43%) and urinary tract infection in those with increased post-void residual urine (9 of 12 or 75%) exceeded expected ranges. Further injections were stopped after 43 patients were randomized, including 28 to botulinum toxin A and 15 to placebo. Conclusions: Local injection of 200 U botulinum toxin A was an effective and durable treatment for refractory overactive bladder. However, a transient post-void residual urine increase was experienced in 43% of patients. Botulinum toxin A for idiopathic overactive bladder is still under investigation.

To more precisely define the role of CAUTI in patients' symptoms, a subset of 1034 patients, 89 of whom developed CAUTI with more than 10<sup>3</sup>colony-forming units per milliliter, who did not have another potentially confounding site of infection besides the urinary tract, was analyzed. <h3>Outcome Measures</h3> Presence of fever, symptoms commonly associated with community-acquired urinary tract infection, and peripheral leukocytosis. <h3>Results</h3> There were 235 new cases of nosocomial CAUTI during the study period. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic; only 123 infections (52%) were detected by patients' physicians using the hospital laboratory. In the subset analysis, there were no significant differences between patients with and without CAUTI in signs or symptoms commonly associated with urinary tract infection—fever, dysuria, urgency, or flank pain—or in leukocytosis. Only 1 of the 235 episodes of CAUTI that were prospectively studied was unequivocally associated with secondary bloodstream infection. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Whereas CAUTls are a major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the hospital, they are rarely symptomatic and infrequently cause bloodstream infection. Symptoms referable to the urinary tract, fever, or peripheral leukocytosis have little predictive value for the diagnosis of CAUTI.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153529759", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects had to have urodynamic evidence of bladder dysfunction, be ambulatory, and not have dementia.Intervention.—Subjects were randomized to 4 sessions (8 weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment, drug treatment (with oxybutynin chloride, possible range of doses, 2.5 mg daily to 5.0 mg 3 times daily), or a placebo control condition.Main Outcome Measures.—Reduction in the frequency of incontinent episodes as determined by bladder diaries, and patients' perceptions of improvement and their comfort and satisfaction with treatment.Results.—For all 3 treatment groups, reduction of incontinence was most pronounced early in treatment and progressed more gradually thereafter. Behavioral treatment, which yielded a mean 80.7% reduction of incontinence episodes, was significantly more effective than drug treatment (mean 68.5% reduction; P=.04) and both were more effective than the placebo control condition (mean 39.4% reduction; P&lt;.001 and P=.009, respectively). Patient-perceived improvement was greatest for behavioral treatment (74.1% \"much better\" vs 50.9% and 26.9% for drug treatment and placebo, respectively). Only 14.0% of patients receiving behavioral treatment wanted to change to another treatment vs 75.5% in each of the other groups.Conclusion.—Behavioral treatment is a safe and effective conservative intervention that should be made more readily available to patients as a first-line treatment for urge and mixed incontinence.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171846085", "source": "openalex"}

We performed a meta-analysis of the existing literature pertaining to endoscopic treatment to allow comparison with reports of open surgical correction. Materials and Methods: We searched all peer reviewed articles published through 2003 pertaining to endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. A total of 63 articles were double reviewed by 9 pediatric urologists, and the data were tabulated on data retrieval sheets. A mixed effects logistic regression model was used to obtain overall estimates of event probabilities (eg reflux resolution, ureteral obstruction) together with their 95% confidence intervals. Individual study estimates were obtained with overall estimate and observation characteristics using empirical Bayes calculations. Differences between or among specific groups were assessed using the F-test. Results: The database included 5,527 patients and 8,101 renal units. Following 1 treatment the reflux resolution rate (by ureter) for grades I and II reflux was 78.5%, grade III 72%, grade IV 63% and grade V 51%. If the first injection was unsuccessful, the second treatment had a success rate of 68%, and the third treatment 34%. The aggregate success rate with 1 or more injections was 85%. The success rate was significantly lower for duplicated (50%) vs single systems (73%), and neuropathic (62%) vs normal bladders (74%). The success rate was similar among children and adults. Following a previous failed open reimplantation endoscopic treatment was successful in 65% of patients. After endoscopic treatment with variable followup pyelonephritis developed in 0.75% of patients and cystitis in 6%. There were few reports of renal scarring following treatment. Conclusions: Endoscopic treatment provides a high rate of success in children with reflux that decreases with increasing grade, although multiple treatments may be necessary. Future reports of endoscopic therapy should include rates of urinary tract infection and renal scarring.

However, evidence concerning its effectiveness in grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux is lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of urinary tract infection in young children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. Materials and Methods: Children 1 month to 3 years old with grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux were assigned randomly to receive daily cotrimoxazole or no treatment, and followed for 18 months. A urinary tract infection constituted an exit criterion. Infection-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Results: A total of 225 children were enrolled in the study. Distribution of gender, age at inclusion and reflux grade were similar between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of urinary tract infection between the 2 groups (17% vs 26%, p = 0.2). However, a significant association was found between treatment and patient gender (p = 0.017). Prophylaxis significantly reduced urinary tract infection in boys (p = 0.013), most notably in boys with grade III vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.042). Conclusions: These data suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce the overall incidence of urinary tract infection in children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. However, such a strategy may prevent further urinary tract infection in boys with grade III reflux. References 1 : Controlled trial of prophylactic treatment in childhood urinary-tract infection.

Materials and Methods: The RRISK is a population based cohort study of 2,109 randomly selected middle-aged and older women. Incontinence and other variables were assessed by self-report questionnaires and in person interviews. Labor and delivery and surgical data were abstracted from medical records archived since 1946. Logistic regression was used to estimate the OR with 95% CIs for incontinence while adjusting for covariates. Results: The age adjusted prevalence of weekly incontinence was highest among Hispanic women, followed by white, black and Asian-American women (36%, 30%, 25% and 19%, respectively, p <0.001). Type of incontinence also differed among groups, with weekly stress incontinence prevalence being 18%, 15%, 8% and 8% (p <0.001), and weekly urge incontinence prevalence being 10%, 9%, 14% and 7% (p <0.001). After adjustment for age, parity, hysterectomy, estrogen use, body mass, menopausal status and diabetes, the risk of stress incontinence remained significantly lower in black (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23–0.57) and Asian-American (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.86) women compared to white women. In contrast, the risk of urge incontinence was similar in black (adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.79–1.81) and Asian-American (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52–1.43) women compared to white women. Conclusions: Significant differences in the adjusted risk of stress incontinence among Hispanic, white, black and Asian-American women suggest the presence of additional, as yet unrecognized, risk or protective factors for stress incontinence.

We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of last search: January 2007.All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs in all populations.Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (UTIs - symptomatic and asymptomatic, side effects, adherence to therapy). Relative risk (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.Ten studies (n = 1049, five cross-over, five parallel group) were included. Cranberry/cranberry-lingonberry juice versus placebo, juice or water was evaluated in seven studies, and cranberries tablets versus placebo in four studies (one study evaluated both juice and tablets). Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs at 12 months (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) compared with placebo/control. Cranberry products were more effective reducing the incidence of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, than elderly men and women or people requiring catheterisation. Six studies were not included in the meta-analyses due to methodological issues or lack of available data. However, only one reported a significant result for the outcome of symptomatic UTIs. Side effects were common in all studies, and dropouts/withdrawals in several of the studies were high.There is some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. It's effectiveness for other groups is less certain. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. It is not clear what is the optimum dosage or method of administration (e.g. juice, tablets or capsules). Further properly designed studies with relevant outcomes are needed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3167492129", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2117925356", "title": "Naturally Occurring Human Urinary Peptides for Use in Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease", "text": "Because of its availability, ease of collection, and correlation with physiology and pathology, urine is an attractive source for clinical proteomics/peptidomics. However, the lack of comparable data sets from large cohorts has greatly hindered the development of clinical proteomics. Here, we report the establishment of a reproducible, high resolution method for peptidome analysis of naturally occurring human urinary peptides and proteins, ranging from 800 to 17,000 Da, using samples from 3,600 individuals analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to MS. All processed data were deposited in an Structured Query Language (SQL) database. This database currently contains 5,010 relevant unique urinary peptides that serve as a pool of potential classifiers for diagnosis and monitoring of various diseases. As an example, by using this source of information, we were able to define urinary peptide biomarkers for chronic kidney diseases, allowing diagnosis of these diseases with high accuracy. Application of the chronic kidney disease-specific biomarker set to an independent test cohort in the subsequent replication phase resulted in 85.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results indicate the potential usefulness of capillary electrophoresis coupled to MS for clinical applications in the analysis of naturally occurring urinary peptides.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117925356", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of the present work was to develop a sensitive quantitative urinary test to identify renal injury in the rodent to facilitate early assessment of pathophysiological influences and drug toxicity. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies were made against the purified ectodomain of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), and these were used to construct a sandwich Kim-1 ELISA. The assay range of this ELISA was 50 pg/ml to 5 ng/ml, with inter- and intra-assay variability of <10%. Urine samples were collected from rats treated with one of three doses of cisplatin (2.5, 5, or 7.5 mg/kg). At one day after each of the doses, there was an approximately three- to fivefold increase in the urine Kim-1 ectodomain, whereas other routinely used biomarkers measured in this study [plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), glycosuria, proteinuria] lacked the sensitivity to show any sign of renal damage at this time point. When rats were subjected to increasing periods (10, 20, 30, or 45 min) of bilateral ischemia, there was an increasing amount of urinary Kim-1 detected. After only 10 min of bilateral ischemia, Kim-1 levels on day 1 were 10-fold higher (5 ng/ml) than control levels, whereas plasma creatinine and BUN were not increased and there was no glycosuria, increased proteinuria, or increased urinary NAG levels. Thus urinary Kim-1 levels serve as a noninvasive, rapid, sensitive, reproducible, and potentially high-throughput method to detect early kidney injury in pathophysiological studies and in preclinical drug development studies for risk-benefit profiling of pharmaceutical agents.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2172018609", "source": "openalex"}

However, potential metabolic consequences in the early postoperative period as well as long term remain a serious problem. Materials and Methods: We review the possible complications associated with removing bowel and incorporating it in the urinary tract. Results: Metabolic complications following continent urinary diversion are common. In the majority of cases, and with correct patient selection and education, problems may be minimized with use of an appropriate bowel segment and early intervention. Conclusions: Careful patient selection and vigilant followup are essential for good long-term results in patients undergoing continent urinary diversion.

Objective: To test the sensitivity and specificity of a single measurement of urinary neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL) and other urinary proteins to detect acute kidney injury in a spectrum of patients. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Emergency department of Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York. Participants: 635 patients admitted to the hospital with acute kidney injury, prerenal azotemia, chronic kidney disease, or normal kidney function. Measurements: Diagnosis of acute kidney injury was based on the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage) criteria and assigned by researchers who were blinded to experimental measurements. Urinary NGAL was measured by immunoblot, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) by enzyme measurement, α1-microglobulin and α1-acid glycoprotein by immunonephelometry, and serum creatinine by Jaffe kinetic reaction. Experimental measurements were not available to treating physicians. Results: Patients with acute kidney injury had a significantly elevated mean urinary NGAL level compared with the other kidney function groups (416 µg/g creatinine [SD, 387]; P = 0.001). At a cutoff value of 130 µg/g creatinine, sensitivity and specificity of NGAL for detecting acute injury were 0.900 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98) and 0.995 (CI, 0.990 to 1.00), respectively, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 181.5 (CI, 58.33 to 564.71) and 0.10 (CI, 0.03 to 0.29); these values were superior to those for NAG, α1-microglobulin, α1-acid glycoprotein, fractional excretion of sodium, and serum creatinine. In multiple logistic regression, urinary NGAL level was highly predictive of clinical outcomes, including nephrology consultation, dialysis, and admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 24.71 [CI, 7.69 to 79.42]). Limitations: All patients came from a single center. Few kidney biopsies were performed. Conclusion: A single measurement of urinary NGAL helps to distinguish acute injury from normal function, prerenal azotemia, and chronic kidney disease and predicts poor inpatient outcomes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109531898", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2101859335", "title": "ATP is released from rabbit urinary bladder epithelial cells by hydrostatic pressure changes–possible sensory mechanism?", "text": "The responses of rabbit urinary bladder to hydrostatic pressure changes and to electrical stimulation have been investigated using both the Ussing chamber and a superfusion apparatus. These experiments enabled us to monitor changes in both ionic transport across the tissue and cellular ATP release from it. The urinary bladder of the rabbit maintains an electrical potential difference across its wall as a result largely of active sodium transport from the urinary (mucosal) to the serosal surface. Small hydrostatic pressure differences produced by removal of bathing fluid from one side of the tissue caused reproducible changes in both potential difference and short‐circuit current. The magnitude of these changes increases as the volume of fluid removed increases. Amiloride on the mucosal (urinary), but not the serosal, surface of the membrane reduces the transepithelial potential difference and short‐circuit current with an IC 50 of 300 n m . Amiloride reduces the size of, but does not abolish, transepithelial potential changes caused by alterations in hydrostatic pressure. Field electrical stimulation of strips of bladder tissue produces a reproducible release of ATP. Such release was demonstrated to occur largely from urothelial cells and is apparently non‐vesicular as it increases in the absence of calcium and is not abolished by tetrodotoxin. It is proposed that ATP is released from the urothelium as a sensory mediator for the degree of distension of the rabbit urinary bladder and other sensory modalities.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101859335", "source": "openalex"}

Associations have previously been reported between urinary BPA concentrations and heart disease, diabetes and liver enzymes in adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003/04. We aimed to estimate associations between urinary BPA concentrations and health measures in NHANES 2005/06 and in data pooled across collection years. Methodology and Findings A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES: subjects were n = 1455 (2003/04) and n = 1493 (2005/06) adults aged 18–74 years, representative of the general adult population of the United States. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, BMI, waist circumference, and urinary creatinine concentration. Main outcomes were reported diagnoses of heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina and diabetes and serum liver enzyme levels. Urinary BPA concentrations in 2005/06 (geometric mean 1.79 ng/ml, 95% CI: 1.64 to 1.96) were lower than in 2003/04 (2.49 ng/ml, CI: 2.20 to 2.83, difference p-value = 0.00002). Higher BPA concentrations were associated with coronary heart disease in 2005/06 (OR per z-score increase in BPA = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.75, p = 0.043) and in pooled data (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.17 to 1.72, p = 0.001). Associations with diabetes did not reach significance in 2005/06, but pooled estimates remained significant (OR = 1.24, CI: 1.10 to 1.40, p = 0.001). There was no overall association with gamma glutamyl transferase concentrations, but pooled associations with alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase remained significant. Conclusions Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, is consistently associated with reported heart disease in the general adult population of the USA. Studies to clarify the mechanisms of these associations are urgently needed.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088514819", "source": "openalex"}

These infections are often caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Gram-negative bacterial species that cause CAUTIs express a number of virulence factors associated with adhesion, motility, biofilm formation, immunoavoidance, and nutrient acquisition as well as factors that cause damage to the host. These infections can be reduced by limiting catheter usage and ensuring that health care professionals correctly use closed-system Foley catheters. A number of novel approaches such as condom and suprapubic catheters, intermittent catheterization, new surfaces, catheters with antimicrobial agents, and probiotics have thus far met with limited success. While the diagnosis of symptomatic versus asymptomatic CAUTIs may be a contentious issue, it is generally agreed that once a catheterized patient is believed to have a symptomatic urinary tract infection, the catheter is removed if possible due to the high rate of relapse. Research focusing on the pathogenesis of CAUTIs will lead to a better understanding of the disease process and will subsequently lead to the development of new diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114594973", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: We analyzed data on 17,850 adults 20 years old or older who participated in the 2001 to 2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Any urinary incontinence was defined as a positive response to questions on urine leakage during physical activity, before reaching the toilet and during nonphysical activity. During this period changes in demographic and clinical factors associated with urinary incontinence included age, race/ethnicity, obesity, diabetes and chronic medical conditions (prostate disease in men). Age standardized prevalence estimates and prevalence ORs of urinary incontinence trends were determined using adjusted multivariate models with appropriate sampling weights. Results: The age standardized prevalence of urinary incontinence in the combined surveys was 51.1% in women and 13.9% in men. Prevalence in women increased from 49.5% in 2001 to 2002, to 53.4% in 2007 to 2008 (Ptrend = 0.01) and in men from 11.5% to 15.1%, respectively (Ptrend = 0.01). In women increased prevalence was partially explained by differences in age, race/ethnicity, obesity, diabetes and select chronic diseases across the survey periods. After adjustment the prevalence OR for 2007 to 2008 vs 2001 to 2002 decreased from 1.22 (95% CI 1.03–1.45) to 1.16 (95% CI 0.99–1.37). In men adjustment for potentially associated factors did not explain the increasing prevalence of urinary incontinence. Conclusions: The age standardized prevalence of urinary incontinence increased in men and women from 2001 through 2008. Decreasing obesity and diabetes may lessen the burden of urinary incontinence, especially in women.

The lack of early biomarkers has impaired our ability to initiate potential therapeutic or preventive interventions in cisplatin nephrotoxicity in a timely manner. In this study, we have explored the expression and urinary excretion of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxic injury.Mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg (high dose) or 5 mg/kg (low dose) cisplatin. The expression of NGAL was measured in the kidney and urine by Western analysis and immunofluorescence, and compared to changes in serum creatinine and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG).Cisplatin resulted in tubule cell necrosis and apoptosis following the high dose, but not the low dose. By Western analysis, NGAL protein was rapidly induced in the kidney within 3 h of high-dose cisplatin. By immunofluorescence, NGAL was induced predominantly in proximal tubule cells in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, reminiscent of a secreted protein. NGAL was easily detected in the urine by Western analysis within 3 h of cisplatin administration in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. By comparison, changes in urinary NAG or serum creatinine were not evident until 96 h after cisplatin. Using defined concentrations of purified recombinant NGAL, urinary NGAL excretion following cisplatin administration was quantified to be in the 20-80 ng/ml range.The results indicate that NGAL represents an early and quantitative urinary biomarker for cisplatin nephrotoxicity.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011250217", "source": "openalex"}

Our laboratory has developed methods for the in-depth characterization of body fluids; these involve a linear ion trap-Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) and a linear ion trap-orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap) mass spectrometer. Here we applied these methods to the analysis of the human urinary proteome. Results We employed one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography for protein separation and fractionation. Fractionated proteins were digested in-gel or in-solution, and digests were analyzed with the LTQ-FT and LTQ-Orbitrap at parts per million accuracy and with two consecutive stages of mass spectrometric fragmentation. We identified 1543 proteins in urine obtained from ten healthy donors, while essentially eliminating false-positive identifications. Surprisingly, nearly half of the annotated proteins were membrane proteins according to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Furthermore, extracellular, lysosomal, and plasma membrane proteins were enriched in the urine compared with all GO entries. Plasma membrane proteins are probably present in urine by secretion in exosomes. Conclusion Our analysis provides a high-confidence set of proteins present in human urinary proteome and provides a useful reference for comparing datasets obtained using different methodologies. The urinary proteome is unexpectedly complex and may prove useful in biomarker discovery in the future.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171215275", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: Of 92 patients diagnosed with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma at our institution from 1985 to 1995, 38 (41 kidneys) underwent ureteroscopic treatment and followup. Semirigid and flexible ureteroscopes were used to examine the collecting system. Tumors were biopsied, and treated with fulguration, the neodymium: YAG laser and/or the holmium: YAG laser. Patients were treated every 6 to 12 weeks until tumor-free and then followed on a strict endoscopic protocol. Results: Mean and median followup was 35.1 and 26 months, respectively (range 3 to 116). Grading of ureteroscopic biopsies was possible in 40 of 41 cases. Initial grading of tumors was low (grade 1 or 1 to 2) in 21 kidneys, grade 2 in 14 and grade 3 in 5. Of 41 kidneys 28 (68%) were documented as tumor-free ureteroscopically at some time following treatment, including 8 (29%) with subsequent recurrences that were treated endoscopically and 24 (86%) with no evidence of disease at the most recent followup. No patient to date has had progression of disease during endoscopic followup. High tumor grade, size and multifocality were significantly associated with tumor persistence and recurrence. Location in the kidney versus ureter was not a significant prognostic factor. Of the recurrent tumors 75% were not identified radiographically but were only discovered endoscopically. Two of 8 kidneys removed after endoscopic treatment had no tumor Stage (pT0). Conclusions: Endoscopic treatment of upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma is a reasonable method to treat carefully select patients based on strict indications. Complete endoscopic followup at regular intervals is essential to rule out recurrences. References 1 : Tumours of the upper urinary calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter. Eur. Urol.1976; 2: 120.

Seventy-six patients (25 infected and 51 noninfected) died during hospitalization; death rates were 19 per cent in infected patients and 4 per cent in noninfected patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that seven of 21 prospectively monitored variables were associated with mortality among the catheterized patients. The adjusted odds ratio for mortality between those who acquired infection and those who did not was 2.8 (95 per cent confidence limits, 1.5 to 5.1). The acquisition of infection was not associated with the severity of underlying disease; among patients who died, infections occurred in 38 per cent of those classified as having nonfatal underlying disease (15 of 39) and in 27 per cent of those classified as having fatal disease (10 of 37). Twelve deaths may have been caused by acquired urinary-tract infections. Two patients had urinary-tract pathogens in premortem blood cultures. Another 10 died with clinical pictures compatible with serious infection, but no diagnostic cultures were performed. We conclude that the acquisition of urinary-tract infection during indwelling bladder catheterization is associated with nearly a threefold increase in mortality among hospitalized patients, but the reason for this association is not yet clear.

Age, weight of the prostate, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, pathological stage and preservation or wide excision of the neurovascular bundles had no significant influence on preservation of urinary control.

Isolation of urinary exosomes by the established ultracentrifugation method has some limitations for use in a clinical laboratory. We sought a rapid and simple way to obtain urinary exosomes. We used a commercially available nanomembrane concentrator to enrich exosomes from urine by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10-30 min. Urinary exosomal markers tumor susceptibility gene 101, aquaporin-2, neuron-specific enolase, annexin V, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and podocalyxin (PODXL) were recovered from the nanomembrane concentrator and detected by Western blotting, and typical features of urinary vesicles were found by electron microscopy. Exosomal markers were detected in as little as 0.5 ml of urine. By the nanomembrane method, exosomal proteins could be recovered from urine samples frozen at -80 degrees C or refrigerated overnight at 4 degrees C then stored at -80 degrees C. By enriching exosomes we could detect PODXL, a podocyte marker, which decreased by 71% in five male patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and abundant proteinuria. We conclude that 1) use of a nanomembrane concentrator simplifies and accelerates the enrichment of urinary exosomes; and 2) the nanomembrane concentrator can concentrate exosomal proteins from clinical urine samples. This enhanced method may accelerate the translation of urinary exosomal biomarkers from bench to bedside for the diagnosis, classification, and prognostication of renal diseases.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2169550143", "source": "openalex"}

Women were eligible for the study if they had predominant symptoms associated with the condition, a positive stress test, and urethral hypermobility. The primary outcomes were success in terms of overall urinary-incontinence measures, which required a negative pad test, no urinary incontinence (as recorded in a 3-day diary), a negative cough and Valsalva stress test, no self-reported symptoms, and no retreatment for the condition, and success in terms of measures of stress incontinence specifically, which required only the latter three criteria. We also assessed postoperative urge incontinence, voiding dysfunction, and adverse events.A total of 655 women were randomly assigned to study groups: 326 to undergo the sling procedure and 329 to undergo the Burch procedure; 520 women (79%) completed the outcome assessment. At 24 months, success rates were higher for women who underwent the sling procedure than for those who underwent the Burch procedure, for both the overall category of success (47% vs. 38%, P=0.01) and the category specific to stress incontinence (66% vs. 49%, P<0.001). However, more women who underwent the sling procedure had urinary tract infections, difficulty voiding, and postoperative urge incontinence.The autologous fascial sling results in a higher rate of successful treatment of stress incontinence but also greater morbidity than the Burch colposuspension.

METHODS: Type and frequency of incontinent episodes were assessed by 6049 community‐dwelling women using a self‐completed questionnaire. Postcards were subsequently mailed every 4 months to inquire about falls and fractures. Incident fractures were confirmed by radiographic report. Logistic and proportional hazard models were used to assess the independent association of urge urinary incontinence and risk of falling or fracture. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 78.5 (± 4.6) years. During an average follow‐up of 3 years, 55% of women reported falling, and 8.5% reported fractures. One‐quarter of the women (1493) reported weekly or more frequent urge incontinence, 19% (1137) reported weekly or more frequent stress incontinence, and 708 (12%) reported both types of incontinence. In multivariate models, weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was associated independently with risk of falling (odds ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14‐1.40) and with non‐spine nontraumatic fracture (relative hazard 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06‐1.69; P = .02). Stress incontinence was not associated independently with falls or fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was associated independently with an increased risk of falls and non‐spine, nontraumatic fractures in older women. Urinary frequency, nocturia, and rushing to the bathroom to avoid urge incontinent episodes most likely increase the risk of falling, which then results in fractures. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of urge incontinence may decrease the risk of fracture.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4236488639", "title": "Annual Direct Cost of Urinary Incontinence", "text": "In Brief OBJECTIVE To estimate the annual direct cost of urinary incontinence in 1995 US dollars. METHODS Epidemiologically based models using diagnostic and treatment algorithms from published clinical practice guidelines and current disease prevalence data were used to estimate direct costs of urinary incontinence. Prevalence and event probability estimates were obtained from literature sources, national data sets, small surveys, and expert opinion. Average national Medicare reimbursement was used to estimate costs, which were determined separately by gender, age group, and type of incontinence. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all variables. RESULTS The annual direct cost of urinary incontinence in the United States (in 1995 dollars) was estimated as $16.3 billion, including $12.4 billion (76%) for women and $3.8 billion (24%) for men. Costs for community-dwelling women ($8.6 billion, 69% of costs for women) were greater than for institutionalized women ($3.8 billion, 31%). Costs for women over 65 years of age were more than twice the costs for those under 65 years ($7.6 and $3.6 billion, respectively). The largest cost category was routine care (70% of costs for women), followed by nursing home admissions (14%), treatment (9%), complications (6%), and diagnosis and evaluations (1%). Costs were most sensitive to changes in incontinence prevalence, routine care costs, and institutionalization rates and costs. CONCLUSION Urinary incontinence is a very costly condition, with annual expenditures similar to other chronic diseases in women. Annual direct costs of urinary incontinence are over $16 billion in the United States, including $12.4 billion (76%) for women.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4236488639", "source": "openalex"}

Prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha were detected in urine from females by selected ion monitoring of the prostaglandin E2-methylester-methoxime bis-acetate and the prostaglandin F2alpha-methyl ester-Tris-trimethylsilylether derivative. Additional evidence for the presence of prostaglandin F2alpha was obtained by isolating from female urine an amount of this prostaglandin sufficient to yield a complete mass spectrum. The methods utilized permitted quantitative analysis. The origin of urinary prostaglandin was determined by stimulating renal prostaglandin synthesis by arachidonic acid or angiotensin infusion. Arachidonic acid, the precursor of prostaglandin E2, when infused into one renal artery of a dog led to a significant increase in the excretion rate of this prostaglandin. Similarly, infusion of angiotensin II amide led to a significantly increased ipsilateral excretion rate of prostaglandin E2 and F2a in spite of a simultaneous decrease in the creatinine clearance. In man, i.v. infusion of angiotensin also led to an increased urinary eliminiation of prostaglandin E. These results show that urinary prostaglandins may originate from the kidney, indicating that renally synthesized prostaglandins diffuse or are excreted into the tubule. Thus, urinary prostaglandins are a reflection of renal prostaglandin synthesis and have potential as a tool to delineate renal prostaglandin physiology and pathology.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130969262", "source": "openalex"}

Thus we undertook RRCP and urinary diversion using a three-step technique. First, using a six-port approach and the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), one surgeon carried out a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy and cystoprostatectomy using a technique developed specifically for robotic surgery. The neurovascular bundles were easily identified and dissected away, the specimen entrapped in a bag and removed through a 5-6 cm suprapubic incision. Second, a different surgical team exteriorized the bowel through this incision and created a neobladder extracorporeally. Third, the neobladder was internalized, the incision closed and the primary surgeon completed the urethro-neovesical anastomosis with robotic assistance.RRCP was carried out in 14 men and three women by the primary surgeon (M.M.). The form of urinary reconstruction was ileal conduit in three, a W-pouch with a serosal-lined tunnel in 10, a double-chimney or a T-pouch with a serosal-lined tunnel in two each. The mean operative duration for robotic radical cystectomy, ileal conduit and orthotopic neobladder were 140, 120 and 168 min, respectively. The mean blood loss was < 150 mL. The number of lymph nodes removed was 4-27, with one patient having N1 disease. The margins of resection were free of tumour in all patients.We developed a technique for nerve-sparing RRCP using the da Vinci system which allows precise and rapid removal of the bladder with minimal blood loss. The bowel segment can be exteriorized and the most complex form of orthotopic bladder can be created through the incision used to deliver the cystectomy specimen. Performing this part of the operation extracorporeally reduced the operative duration.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100198850", "source": "openalex"}

They underwent 3 phases of a metabolic study, a placebo phase and 2 treatment phases in which they ingested either 1.2 1. orange juice (containing 60mEq. potassium and 190mEq. citrate per day) with meals or potassium citrate tablets (60mEq. per day) with water and meals. Compared to potassium citrate, orange juice delivered an equivalent alkali load and caused a similar increase in urinary pH (6.48 versus 6.75 from 5.71) and urinary citrate (952 versus 944 from 571mg. per day). Therefore, orange juice, like potassium citrate, decreased urinary undissociated uric acid levels and increased the inhibitor activity (formation product) of brushite (calcium phosphate). However, orange juice increased urinary oxalate and did not alter calcium excretion, whereas potassium citrate decreased urinary calcium without altering urinary oxalate. Thus, orange juice lacked the ability of potassium citrate to decrease urinary saturation of calcium oxalate. Overall, orange juice should be beneficial in the control of calcareous and uric acid nephrolithiasis. © 1993 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byAssimos D (2019) Re: The Effect of Lemonade and Diet Lemonade upon Urinary Parameters Affecting Calcium Urinary Stone FormationJournal of Urology, VOL. 201, NO. 5, (853-853), Online publication date: 1-May-2019.Pak C, Maalouf N, Rodgers K and Poindexter J (2018) Comparison of Semi-Empirical and Computer Derived Methods for Estimating Urinary Saturation of Calcium OxalateJournal of Urology, VOL. 182, NO. 6, (2951-2956), Online publication date: 1-Dec-2009.Pak C (2018) Medical Stone Management: 35 Years of AdvancesJournal of Urology, VOL. 180, NO. 3, (813-819), Online publication date: 1-Sep-2008.Pak C, Rodgers K, Poindexter J and Sakhaee K (2018) New Methods of Assessing Crystal Growth and Saturation of Brushite in Whole Urine: Effect of pH, Calcium and CitrateJournal of Urology, VOL. 180, NO. 4, (1532-1537), Online publication date: 1-Oct-2008.Kang D, Sur R, Haleblian G, Fitzsimons N, Borawski K and Preminger G (2018) Long-Term Lemonade Based Dietary Manipulation in Patients With Hypocitraturic NephrolithiasisJournal of Urology, VOL. 177, NO. 4, (1358-1362), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2007.GETTMAN M, OGAN K, BRINKLEY L, ADAMS-HUET B, PAK C and PEARLE M (2018) EFFECT OF CRANBERRY JUICE CONSUMPTION ON URINARY STONE RISK FACTORSJournal of Urology, VOL. 174, NO. 2, (590-594), Online publication date: 1-Aug-2005.GOLDFARB D and ASPLIN J (2018) EFFECT OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE ON URINARY LITHOGENICITYJournal of Urology, VOL. 166, NO. 1, (263-267), Online publication date: 1-Jul-2001.Whitson P, Pietrzyk R and Pak C (2018) RENAL STONE RISK ASSESSMENT DURING SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHTSJournal of Urology, VOL. 158, NO. 6, (2305-2310), Online publication date: 1-Dec-1997.Seltzer M, Low R, McDonald M, Shami G and Stoller M (2018) Dietary Manipulation With Lemonade to Treat Hypocitraturic Calcium NephrolithiasisJournal of Urology, VOL. 156, NO. 3, (907-909), Online publication date: 1-Sep-1996.Preminger G (2018) Editorial: Nephrolithiasis—Solutions for Emerging ProblemsJournal of Urology, VOL. 156, NO. 3, (910-911), Online publication date: 1-Sep-1996.Parivar F, Low R and Stoller M (2018) The Influence of Diet on Urinary Stone DiseaseJournal of Urology, VOL. 155, NO. 2, (432-440), Online publication date: 1-Feb-1996.Stoller M (2018) Editorial: Gout and Stones or Stones and Gout?Journal of Urology, VOL. 154, NO. 5, (1670-1670), Online publication date: 1-Nov-1995.Gupta M, Bolton D, Gupta P and Stoller M (2018) Improved Renal Function Following Aggressive Treatment of Urolithiasis and Concurrent Mild to Moderate Renal InsufficiencyJournal of Urology, VOL. 152, NO. 4, (1086-1090), Online publication date: 1-Oct-1994.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients referred from the urology service, in whom urinary tract abnormalities were strongly suspected, underwent multi-detector row CT urography. The technique included unenhanced, nephrographic, compression, and excretory-phase images through the abdomen and pelvis. Transverse images and three-dimensional reformations were reviewed by one of two radiologists. Findings were retrospectively compared with results of urinalysis, cystoscopy and/or ureteroscopy, and/or surgery. RESULTS: Multi-detector row CT urography depicted many clinically diagnosed urinary tract abnormalities, including 15 of 16 uroepithelial malignancies, five congenital anomalies, five urinary tract calculi, and 18 calyceal and/or papillary, 30 renal pelvic and/or ureteral, and 25 bladder abnormalities. All abnormalities were detected on transverse images. These abnormalities included diffuse urothelial wall thickening in four patients (three of whom had transitional cell carcinoma), a renal abscess, a colovesical fistula, and incidentally detected extrarenal disease (a liver mass, hepatic metastases, lymph node metastases, an aortic dissection, and a pheochromocytoma; each of these findings was seen in one patient).

In this study, we used microarray expression profiling to examine the gene expression patterns in superficial transitional cell carcinoma (sTCC) with surrounding CIS (13 patients), without surrounding CIS lesions (15 patients), and in muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC; 13 patients). Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of CIS in the surrounding urothelium. We identified a few gene clusters that contained genes with similar expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with surrounding CIS and invasive TCC. However, no close relationship between TCC with adjacent CIS and invasive TCC was observed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Expression profiling of a series of biopsies from normal urothelium and urothelium with CIS lesions from the same urinary bladder revealed that the gene expression found in sTCC with surrounding CIS is found also in CIS biopsies as well as in histologically normal samples adjacent to the CIS lesions. Furthermore, we also identified similar gene expression changes in mTCC samples. We used a supervised learning approach to build a 16-gene molecular CIS classifier. The classifier was able to classify sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of surrounding CIS with a high accuracy. This study demonstrates that a CIS gene expression signature is present not only in CIS biopsies but also in sTCC, mTCC, and, remarkably, in histologically normal urothelium from bladders with CIS. Identification of this expression signature could provide guidance for the selection of therapy and follow-up regimen in patients with early stage bladder cancer.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145424370", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the records of 303 children younger than 2 years with initial UTI investigated with DMSA scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography (VCU) within 3 months after UTI was performed. Results: In 156 of the 303 children (51%) DMSA scintigraphy showed renal lesions. VUR was found in 80 patients (26%) and VUR grade significantly correlated with the presence of renal lesions. A normal DMSA scintigraphy and dilating VUR (grade III) occurred in 7 infants. At followup after 1 to 2 years, 6 of these 7 patients had normal DMSA scans and 1 had a scarred duplex kidney. VUR resolved spontaneously in 5 and improved spontaneously to grade 1 in 2 patients. None of the 7 children had recurrent UTI. Conclusions: DMSA scintigraphy in infants with UTI may replace VCU as a first line investigation. A strategy to perform VCU in only patients with renal lesions is proposed. In this study 147 of 303 VCUs would have been unnecessary as only 1 child with a damaged kidney was missed. References 1 : Minimum incidence and diagnostic rate of first urinary tract infection.

We estimated 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion from a morning fasting urine sample (Kawasaki formula). We used restricted cubic spline plots to describe the association between sodium and potassium excretion and CV events and mortality, and to identify reference categories for sodium and potassium excretion. We used Cox proportional hazards multivariable models to determine the association of urinary sodium and potassium with CV events and mortality.CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF).At baseline, the mean (SD) estimated 24-hour excretion for sodium was 4.77 g (1.61); and for potassium was 2.19 g (0.57). After a median follow-up of 56 months, the composite outcome occurred in 4729 (16.4%) participants, including 2057 CV deaths, 1412 with MI, 1282 with stroke, and 1213 with hospitalization for CHF. Compared with the reference group with estimated baseline sodium excretion of 4 to 5.99 g per day (n = 14,156; 6.3% participants with CV death, 4.6% with MI, 4.2% with stroke, and 3.8% admitted to hospital with CHF), higher baseline sodium excretion was associated with an increased risk of CV death (9.7% for 7-8 g/day; hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26-1.86; and 11.2% for >8 g/day; HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.31-2.10), MI (6.8%; HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11-1.98 for >8 g/day), stroke (6.6%; HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.01 for >8 g/day), and hospitalization for CHF (6.5%; HR, 1.51; 1.12-2.05 for >8 g/day). Lower sodium excretion was associated with an increased risk of CV death (8.6%; HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39 for 2-2.99 g/day; 10.6%; HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.09-1.73 for <2 g/day), and hospitalization for CHF (5.2%; HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.49 for 2-2.99 g/day) on multivariable analysis. Compared with an estimated potassium excretion of less than 1.5 g per day (n = 2194; 6.2% with stroke), higher potassium excretion was associated with a reduced risk of stroke (4.7% [HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.94] for 1.5-1.99 g/day; 4.3% [HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90] for 2-2.49 g/day; 3.9% [HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91] for 2.5-3 g/day; and 3.5% [HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.92] for >3 g/day) on multivariable analysis.The association between estimated sodium excretion and CV events was J-shaped. Compared with baseline sodium excretion of 4 to 5.99 g per day, sodium excretion of greater than 7 g per day was associated with an increased risk of all CV events, and a sodium excretion of less than 3 g per day was associated with increased risk of CV mortality and hospitalization for CHF. Higher estimated potassium excretion was associated with a reduced risk of stroke.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116529135", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2107795177", "title": "Pharmacology of the Lower Urinary Tract", "text": "The functions of the lower urinary tract, to store and periodically release urine, are dependent on the activity of smooth and striated muscles in the urinary bladder, urethra, and external urethral sphincter. This activity is in turn controlled by neural circuits in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. Various neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, nitric oxide, and neuropeptides, have been implicated in the neural regulation of the lower urinary tract. Injuries or diseases of the nervous system, as well as drugs and disorders of the peripheral organs, can produce voiding dysfunctions such as urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence or inefficient voiding and urinary retention. This chapter will review recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of voiding disorders and the targets for drug therapy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107795177", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: During 9 years 65 patients with post-prostatectomy incontinence underwent placement of the AMS800* American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, Minnesota. artificial urinary sphincter. Review of charts and a telephone questionnaire were conducted to determine patient perceived satisfaction. Results: A total of 50 patients participated in the survey. Median followup was 23.4 months. Preoperative incontinence was severe. Of the patients 90 percent reported continuous leakage, and 70 percent wore an average of 6 diapers and 24 percent wore an average of 7.4 pads daily. The long-term complete continence rate was 20 percent. Of the patients with wetness 55 percent had leakage of a few drops daily and 22 percent had leakage of less than a teaspoon. Of all patients 50 percent had leakage daily, 24 percent had leakage 1 or more times a week and wore an average of 1.5 pads per day, and 6 percent reported changing clothes due to wetness. A total of 90 percent of the patients reported satisfaction with the artificial urinary sphincter and 96 percent stated that they would recommend or had recommended the artificial urinary sphincter to a friend. In retrospect, 92 percent of the patients would have the artificial urinary sphincter placed again, 90 percent of those undergoing revision reported no change in satisfaction and 14 percent reported improved sexual activity. Conclusions: Patient satisfaction with the artificial urinary sphincter for post-prostatectomy incontinence is uniformly high. Although postoperative continence was not 100 percent, relative improvement in continence was the most significant factor affecting patient perceived outcome. Using these parameters criteria for a successful outcome can be established, and patient concerns regarding the artificial urinary sphincter can be dispelled.

Dietary estimates were converted to urine equivalents based on 79 pairs of dual measurements.Bayesian hierarchical modelling used survey data and their characteristics to estimate mean sodium intake, by sex, 5 years age group and associated uncertainty for persons aged 20+ in 187 countries in 1990 and 2010. Country-level covariates were national income/person and composition of food supplies.Mean sodium intake (g/day) as estimable by 24 h urine collections, without adjustment for non-urinary losses.In 2010, global mean sodium intake was 3.95 g/day (95% uncertainty interval: 3.89 to 4.01). This was nearly twice the WHO recommended limit of 2 g/day and equivalent to 10.06 (9.88-10.21) g/day of salt. Intake in men was ∼10% higher than in women; differences by age were small. Intakes were highest in East Asia, Central Asia and Eastern Europe (mean >4.2 g/day) and in Central Europe and Middle East/North Africa (3.9-4.2 g/day). Regional mean intakes in North America, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand ranged from 3.4 to 3.8 g/day. Intakes were lower (<3.3 g/day), but more uncertain, in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Between 1990 and 2010, modest, but uncertain, increases in sodium intakes were identified.Sodium intakes exceed the recommended levels in almost all countries with small differences by age and sex. Virtually all populations would benefit from sodium reduction, supported by enhanced surveillance.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155793865", "source": "openalex"}

In this first phase 3 study we assessed the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Materials and Methods: A total of 683 North American women 22 to 84 years old were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo controlled study. The case definition included a predominant symptom of SUI with a weekly incontinence episode frequency (IEF) of 7 or greater, the absence of predominant symptoms of urge incontinence, normal diurnal and nocturnal frequency, a bladder capacity of 400 ml or greater, and a positive cough stress test and stress pad test. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo (339) or 80 mg duloxetine daily (344) as 40 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Primary outcome variables included IEF and an incontinence quality of life questionnaire. Van Elteren’s test was used to analyze percent changes in IEF with a stratification variable of weekly baseline IEF (less than 14 and 14 or greater). ANCOVA was used to analyze incontinence quality of life scores. RESULTS: Mean baseline IEF was 18 weekly and 436 subjects (64%) had a baseline IEF of 14 or greater. There was a significant decrease in IEF with duloxetine compared with placebo (50% vs 27%, p <0.001) with comparably significant improvements in quality of life (11.0 vs 6.8, p <0.001). Of subjects on duloxetine 51% had a 50% to 100% decrease in IEF compared with 34% of those on placebo (p <0.001). These improvements with duloxetine were associated with a significant increases in the voiding interval compared with placebo (20 vs 2 minutes, p <0.001) and they were observed across the spectrum of incontinence severity. The discontinuation rate for adverse events was 4% for placebo and 24% for duloxetine (p <0.001) with nausea the most common reason for discontinuation (6.4%). Nausea, which was also the most common side effect, tended to be mild to moderate and transient, usually resolving after 1 week to 1 month. Of the 78 women who experienced treatment emergent nausea while taking duloxetine 58 (74%) completed the trial. Conclusions: These phase 3 data are consistent with phase 2 data and they provide further evidence for the safety and efficacy of duloxetine as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of women with SUI.

Of the patients, 113 died. Mortality was increased in patients with baseline microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (odds ratios as compared with normoalbuminuria, 1.78 [P &amp;lt; 0.05] and 2.86 [P &amp;lt; 0.01]) and in patients with soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in the third tertile and C-reactive protein in the second and third tertiles (odds ratios as compared with the first tertile, 2.05 [ P &amp;lt; 0.01], and 1.80 [P &amp;lt; 0.05] and 2.92 [ P &amp;lt; 0.01]). These associations were mutually independent. The mean yearly change in urinary albumin excretion was 9.4%; in von Willebrand factor, 8.1%; in tissue-type plasminogen activator, 2.8%; in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, 5.2%; in soluble E-selectin, −2.3%; in C-reactive protein, 3.8%; and in fibrinogen, 2.3%. The longitudinal development of urinary albumin excretion was significantly and independently determined by baseline levels of and the longitudinal development of BMI, systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, glycated hemoglobin and plasma von Willebrand factor (baseline only), soluble E-selectin (baseline only), tissue-type plasminogen activator, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen. The longitudinal developments of markers of endothelial function and inflammation were interrelated. In type 2 diabetes, increased urinary albumin excretion, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation are interrelated processes that develop in parallel, progress with time, and are strongly and independently associated with risk of death.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171285048", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027509324", "title": "Multidisciplinary consensus on the classification of prenatal and postnatal urinary tract dilation (UTD classification system)", "text": "ObjectiveUrinary tract (UT) dilation is sonographically identified in 1–2% of fetuses and reflects a spectrum of possible uropathies. There is significant variability in the clinical management of individuals with prenatal UT dilation that stems from a paucity of evidence-based information correlating the severity of prenatal UT dilation to postnatal urological pathologies. The lack of correlation between prenatal and postnatal US findings and final urologic diagnosis has been problematic, in large measure because of a lack of consensus and uniformity in defining and classifying UT dilation. Consequently, there is a need for a unified classification system with an accepted standard terminology for the diagnosis and management of prenatal and postnatal UT dilation.MethodsA consensus meeting was convened on March 14–15, 2014, in Linthicum, Maryland, USA to propose: 1) a unified description of UT dilation that could be applied both prenatally and postnatally; and 2) a standardized scheme for the perinatal evaluation of these patients based on sonographic criteria (i.e. the classification system). The participating societies included American College of Radiology, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology, the Society for Fetal Urology, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the Society for Pediatric Urology, the Society for Pediatric Radiology and the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasounds.ResultsThe recommendations proposed in this consensus statement are based on a detailed analysis of the current literature and expert opinion representing common clinical practice. The proposed UTD Classification System (and hence the severity of the UT dilation) is based on six categories in US findings: 1) anterior-posterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD); 2) calyceal dilation; 3) renal parenchymal thickness; 4) renal parenchymal appearance; 5) bladder abnormalities; and 6) ureteral abnormalities. The classification system is stratified based on gestational age and whether the UT dilation is detected prenatally or postnatally. The panel also proposed a follow-up scheme based on the UTD classification.ConclusionThe proposed grading classification system will require extensive evaluation to assess its utility in predicting clinical outcomes. Currently, the grading system is correlated with the risk of postnatal uropathies. Future research will help to further refine the classification system to one that correlates with other clinical outcomes such as the need for surgical intervention or renal function.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027509324", "source": "openalex"}

An isolated ileal reservoir was constructed using the technique described for patients with a continent ileostomy. The ureters were implanted into an afferent segment provided with a reflux-preventing nipple valve. There were few operative complications and no operative mortality. Late complications involving malfunction of the nipple valves occurred in 8 patients and were corrected surgically. Postoperative followup presently is between 9 months and 6 1/2 years. Two patients have died: 1 in an accident and 1 of metastatic bladder carcinoma. The remaining 10 patients are continent and without reflux to the upper urinary tract. The reservoir generally is emptied by intermittent self-catheterization between 3 to 6 times daily. The volume capacity of the reservoir is more than 500 ml. Urinary cultures have been constantly negative in 7 patients and the contents of the reservoir more or less permanently contained bacteria in 5. Dilatation of the upper urinary tracts, progressive renal deterioration or metabolic disturbances have not been encountered. All patients are satisfied with this type of urinary diversion, especially those who have undergone other types of diversion previously.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013617338", "source": "openalex"}

At six months, eight (16%) women in the cranberry group, 19 (39%) in the lactobacillus group, and 18 (36%) in the control group had had at least one recurrence. This is a 20% reduction in absolute risk in the cranberry group compared with the control group (95% confidence interval 3% to 36%, P=0.023, number needed to treat=5, 95% confidence interval 3 to 34). <b>Conclusion:</b> Regular drinking of cranberry juice but not lactobacillus seems to reduce the recurrence of urinary tract infection. <h3>What is already known on this topic</h3> Up to 60% of women will have a urinary tract infection and a third of them will have several recurrences Vaccinium berries and products containing lactobacilli may affect the coliform bacteria that cause urinary tract infection <h3>What this study adds</h3> 50 ml of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily reduced recurrences of symptomatic urinary tract infection by about half compared with the control group <i>Lactobacillus</i> GG drink had no effect on recurrence Self treatment with cranberry juice may reduce the need for antimicrobials for recurrent urinary tract infection", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158130653", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2081746977", "title": "Urinary, Circulating, and Tissue Biomonitoring Studies Indicate Widespread Exposure to Bisphenol A", "text": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the highest-volume chemicals produced worldwide, and human exposure to BPA is thought to be ubiquitous. Thus, there are concerns that the amount of BPA to which humans are exposed may cause adverse health effects. Importantly, results from a large number of biomonitoring studies are at odds with the results from two toxicokinetic studies.We examined several possibilities for why biomonitoring and toxicokinetic studies could come to seemingly conflicting conclusions.We examined > 80 published human biomonitoring studies that measured BPA concentrations in human tissues, urine, blood, and other fluids, along with two toxicokinetic studies of human BPA metabolism.The > 80 biomonitoring studies examined included measurements in thousands of individuals from several different countries, and these studies overwhelmingly detected BPA in individual adults, adolescents, and children. Unconjugated BPA was routinely detected in blood (in the nanograms per milliliter range), and conjugated BPA was routinely detected in the vast majority of urine samples (also in the nanograms per milliliter range). In stark contrast, toxicokinetic studies proposed that humans are not internally exposed to BPA. Some regulatory agencies have relied solely on these toxicokinetic models in their risk assessments.Available data from biomonitoring studies clearly indicate that the general population is exposed to BPA and is at risk from internal exposure to unconjugated BPA. The two toxicokinetic studies that suggested human BPA exposure is negligible have significant deficiencies, are directly contradicted by hypothesis-driven studies, and are therefore not reliable for risk assessment purposes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081746977", "source": "openalex"}

Early therapeutic or preventive intervention is hampered by the lack of an early biomarker for acute renal injury. Recent studies showed that urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL or lipocalin 2) is up-regulated early (within 1-3 h) after murine renal injury and in pediatric ARD after cardiac surgery. The authors hypothesized that postoperative urinary NGAL concentrations are increased in adult patients developing ARD after cardiac surgery compared with patients without ARD.After institutional review board approval, 81 cardiac surgical patients were prospectively studied. Urine samples were collected immediately before incision and at various time intervals after surgery for NGAL analysis by quantitative immunoblotting. ARD was defined as peak postoperative serum creatinine increase by 50% or greater compared with preoperative serum creatinine.Sixteen of 81 patients (20%) developed postoperative ARD, and the mean urinary NGAL concentrations in patients who developed ARD were significantly higher early after surgery (after 1 h: 4,195 +/- 6,520 [mean +/- SD] vs. 1,068 +/- 2,129 ng/ml; P < 0.01) compared with patients who did not develop ARD. Mean urinary NGAL concentrations continued to increase and remained significantly higher at 3 and 18 h after cardiac surgery in patients with ARD. In contrast, urinary NGAL in patients without ARD decreased rapidly after cardiac surgery.Patients developing postoperative ARD had significantly higher urinary NGAL concentrations early after cardiac surgery. Urinary NGAL may therefore be a useful early biomarker of ARD after cardiac surgery. These findings may facilitate the early detection of acute renal injury and potentially prevent progression to acute renal failure.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007193748", "source": "openalex"}

We describe our experience with complications during and after transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery after 9 years of practice. Materials and Methods: A total of 1,311 laparoscopic procedures were performed by 5 senior urologists in the same department since 1992, of which 72% were classified as difficult or very difficult (prostatectomy, nephrectomy for cancer, nephroureterectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, para-aortic lymph node dissection), 27.5% as moderately difficult (nephrectomy for benign disease, adrenalectomy, genitourinary prolapse, ureteropelvic junction, pelvic and ureteral stones, ureterovesical reimplantation, pelvic lymph node dissection) and 0.5% as easy (lymphocele, renal cyst and so forth). Results: There was no mortality or anesthetic complications. The overall transfusion rate was 2.4%. Complications were serious in 0.7% of cases, all of which required reoperation, intermediate in 1.8% of which 1% required reoperation and minor in 1.1%. The main complications were bowel (1.2%), vascular (0.5%) and ureteral injuries (0.8%). The conversion rate was 1.2% and the reoperation rate was 2.4%. Of the patients 1.2% had to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Postoperative complications were observed in 19% of cases. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with essentially the same complications as open surgery, and they, particularly bowel injuries and bleeding, can be diagnosed and often treated with repeat laparoscopy. Conclusions: Complications during and after transperitoneal laparoscopy remain low and are not superior to those observed during and after open surgery. As laparoscopy becomes more widely used, urologists wishing to learn this technique must realize that the learning process is long but essential. References 1 : Laparoscopic nephrectomy.

Population studies from numerous countries have reported that the prevalence of UI ranged from approximately 5% to 70%, with most studies reporting a prevalence of any UI in the range of 25–45%. Prevalence figures increase with increasing age, and in women aged ≥70 years more than 40% of the female population is affected. Prevalence rates are even higher in the elderly-elderly and amongst nursing home patients. There are only a few studies describing progression as well as remission of UI in the general population as well as in selected groups of the population. The mean annual incidence of UI has been reported to range from 1% to 9%, while estimates of remission are more varying, from 4% to 30%. The prevalence of UI is strongly related to the age of the woman and thus, due to the increase in mean life expectancy, the overall prevalence of UI in women is expected to increase in the future.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2906018298", "source": "openalex"}

Case series and randomized controlled trials of the effect of surgical, behavioral and pharmacological weight loss on urinary incontinence are summarized.Epidemiological studies showed that obesity is a strong independent risk factor for prevalent and incident urinary incontinence. There was a clear dose-response effect of weight on urinary incontinence with each 5-unit increase in body mass index associated with about a 20% to 70% increase in the urinary incontinence risk, and the maximum effect of weight rarely exceeded an OR of greater than 4 to 5 on well controlled analyses. The odds of incident urinary incontinence during 5 to 10 years increased by approximately 30% to 60% for each 5-unit increase in body mass index. There may be a stronger association of increasing weight with prevalent and incident stress incontinence, including mixed incontinence, than with urge incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome. Weight loss studies indicated that surgical and nonsurgical weight loss led to significant improvements in urinary incontinence symptoms.Epidemiological studies document overweight and obesity as important risk factors for urinary incontinence. Weight loss by surgical and more conservative approaches is effective to decrease urinary incontinence symptoms and should be strongly considered a first line treatment in this patient population.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088695478", "source": "openalex"}

Although biomarkers for nephrotoxicity are available, they often lack sensitivity and are not specific as indicators of epithelial cell injury. Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) is a type 1 membrane protein with extracellular immunoglobulin and mucin domains. The mRNA and protein for Kim-1 are expressed at very low levels in normal rodent kidney, but expression increases dramatically after injury in proximal tubule epithelial cells in postischemic rodent kidney and in humans during ischemic acute renal failure. To evaluate the utility of Kim-1 as a biomarker for other types of renal injury, we analyzed tissue and urinary expression in response to three different types of nephrotoxicants in the rat: S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine (TFEC), folic acid, and cisplatin. Marked increases in Kim-1 expression were confirmed by immunoblotting in all three models. The protein was shown to be localized to the proximal tubule epithelial cell by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, Kim-1 protein was detected in urine of toxicant-treated rats. The temporal pattern of expression in response to TFEC is similar to the Kim-1 expression pattern in the postischemic kidney. In folic acid-treated kidneys, Kim-1 is clearly localized to the apical brush border of the well-differentiated proximal tubular epithelial cells. After folic acid treatment, expression of Kim-1 is present in the urine despite no significant increase in serum creatinine. Cisplatin treatment results in early detection of urinary Kim-1 protein and diffuse Kim-1 expression in S3 cells of the proximal tubule. Kim-1 can be detected in the tissue and urine on days 1 and 2 after cisplatin administration, occurring before an increase in serum creatinine. The upregulation of expression of Kim-1 and its presence in the urine in response to exposure to various types of nephrotoxicants suggest that this protein may serve as a general biomarker for tubular injury and repair processes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068446361", "source": "openalex"}

A structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain ADHD diagnostic status, on the basis of slightly modified criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.One hundred nineteen children met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Children with higher urinary dialkyl phosphate concentrations, especially dimethyl alkylphosphate (DMAP) concentrations, were more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD. A 10-fold increase in DMAP concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.55 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.10), with adjustment for gender, age, race/ethnicity, poverty/income ratio, fasting duration, and urinary creatinine concentration. For the most-commonly detected DMAP metabolite, dimethyl thiophosphate, children with levels higher than the median of detectable concentrations had twice the odds of ADHD (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93 [95% confidence interval: 1.23-3.02]), compared with children with undetectable levels.These findings support the hypothesis that organophosphate exposure, at levels common among US children, may contribute to ADHD prevalence.

Preliminary data have suggested phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor efficacy in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and Methods: After a 4-week placebo run-in period 1,058 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia lower urinary tract symptoms were randomly allocated to receive 12-week, once daily treatment with placebo or tadalafil (2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg). Results: The International Prostate Symptom Score least squares mean change from baseline to end point was significantly improved for 2.5 (−3.9, p = 0.015), 5 (−4.9, p <0.001), 10 (−5.2, p <0.001) and 20 mg (−5.2, p <0.001) tadalafil compared to placebo (−2.3). International Prostate Symptom Score improvements at 4, 8 and 12 weeks were significant for all tadalafil doses and they demonstrated a dose-response relationship. Tadalafil (2.5 mg) significantly improved the International Prostate Symptom Score obstructive subscore and the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain, the latter in sexually active men with a history of erectile dysfunction. Statistically significant improvements were noted for 5, 10 and 20 mg tadalafil compared to placebo, as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score irritative and obstructive subscores, International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of Life, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (nonsignificant for 10 mg), Global Assessment Question and International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain. No statistically significant effect of treatment compared to placebo was noted for peak flow at any tadalafil dose. Treatment emergent adverse events were infrequent in all tadalafil groups. Conclusions: Once daily tadalafil demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant efficacy and it was well tolerated in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia lower urinary tract symptoms. Of the doses studied 5 mg tadalafil appeared to provide a positive risk-benefit profile. References 1 : Urologic Diseases in America Project: benign prostatic hyperplasia. J Urol2005; 173: 1256.

After this colonization, sterile artificial urine containing 1,000 micrograms of tobramycin per ml was flowed past this established biofilm, and a significant proportion of the bacterial cells within the biofilm were found to be still viable after 12 h of exposure to this very high concentration of aminoglycoside antibiotic. Planktonic (floating) cells taken from the test system just before the exposure of the biofilm to the antibiotic were completely killed by 50 micrograms of tobramycin per ml. The MIC of tobramycin for cells taken from the seeding cultures before colonization of the catheter material, and for surviving cells recovered directly from the tobramycin-treated biofilm, was found to be 0.4 micrograms/ml when dispersed cells were assayed by standard methods.

Here we review the epidemiology, virulence mechanisms, and host response to the most frequently isolated Gram-positive uropathogens: Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis , and Streptococcus agalactiae . We also review several emerging, rare, misclassified, and otherwise underreported Gram-positive pathogens of the urinary tract including Aerococcus , Corynebacterium, Actinobaculum, and Gardnerella . The literature strongly suggests that urologic diseases involving Gram-positive bacteria may be easily overlooked due to limited culture-based assays typically utilized for urine in hospital microbiology laboratories. Some UTIs are polymicrobial in nature, often involving one or more Gram-positive bacteria. We herein review the risk factors and recent evidence for mechanisms of bacterial synergy in experimental models of polymicrobial UTI. Recent experimental data has demonstrated that, despite being cleared quickly from the bladder, some Gram-positive bacteria can impact pathogenic outcomes of co-infecting organisms. When taken together, the available evidence argues that Gram-positive bacteria are important uropathogens in their own right, but that some can be easily overlooked because they are missed by routine diagnostic methods. Finally, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that a surprising variety of fastidious Gram-positive bacteria may either reside in or be regularly exposed to the urinary tract and further suggests that their presence is widespread among women, as well as men. Experimental studies in this area are needed; however, there is a growing appreciation that the composition of bacteria found in the bladder could be a potentially important determinant in urologic disease, including susceptibility to UTI.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2328462275", "source": "openalex"}

The oxidized DNA is continuously repaired and the oxidized bases are excreted in the urine. A simple routine analytical procedure is described for urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA damage adduct, as an indicator of oxidative damage in humans and rodents. This adduct was purified from human urine and characterized. The described assay employs a series of solid-phase extraction steps that separate 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine from other urinary constituents, followed by analysis by gradient reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a dual-electrode high-efficiency electrochemical detection system. Analysis of urine from three species by this method indicates that mice excrete approximately 3.3-fold more 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine than humans (582 vs. 178 residues per cell per day), a result that supports the proposal that oxidative damage to DNA increases in proportion to species-specific basal metabolic rates.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010597170", "source": "openalex"}

Less is known about UI in younger women, and few large surveys have been able to determine risk factors by linking their data to patients' medical findings.We conducted a population-based, age-stratified postal survey of 6000 women aged between 30 and 90 years who were enrolled in a large health maintenance organization in Washington State.The response rate was 64% (n = 3536) after exclusion criteria were applied. The population-based prevalence of UI was 45%. Prevalence increased with age, from 28% for 30- to 39-year-old women to 55% for 80- to 90-year-old women. Eighteen percent of respondents reported severe UI. The prevalence of severe UI also increased notably with age, from 8% for 30- to 39-year-old women to 33% for 80- to 90-year-old women. Older age, higher body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), greater medical comorbidity, current major depression, a history of hysterectomy, and parity increased the odds of having UI. Not being white and having had only cesarean deliveries decreased the odds of having UI. Major depression (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-3.72) and obesity, defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-2.87), had the strongest association with UI. Among women with UI, age, BMI, medical comorbidity, current major depression, diabetes, a history of hysterectomy, and having had only cesarean deliveries were significantly associated with severe UI.Urinary incontinence is highly prevalent in women across their adult life span, and its severity increases linearly with age. Age, BMI, race, medical comorbidity, current major depression, a history of hysterectomy, parity, and having only had cesarean deliveries are each independent factors significantly associated with the likelihood of having UI.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124448307", "source": "openalex"}

Multiple correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between cortisol levels and severity of PTSD that was due to a substantial association with scores on the avoidance subscale.The present findings replicate the authors' previous observation of low urinary cortisol excretion in combat veterans with PTSD and extend these findings to a non-treatment-seeking civilian group. The results also demonstrate that low cortisol levels are associated with PTSD symptoms of a clinically significant nature, rather than occurring as a result of exposure to trauma per se, and that low cortisol levels may persist for decades following exposure to trauma among individuals with chronic PTSD.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1886580089", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2165375223", "title": "Integrative control of the lower urinary tract: preclinical perspective", "text": "Storage and periodic expulsion of urine is regulated by a neural control system in the brain and spinal cord that coordinates the reciprocal activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract (LUT): (a) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (b) an outlet (bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the urethral sphincter). Control of the bladder and urethral outlet is dependent on three sets of peripheral nerves: parasympathetic, sympathetic and somatic nerves that contain afferent as well as efferent pathways. Afferent neurons innervating the bladder have A‐δ or C‐fibre axons. Urine storage reflexes are organized in the spinal cord, whereas voiding reflexes are mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination centre (the pontine micturition centre) located in the brainstem. Storage and voiding reflexes are activated by mechanosensitive A‐δ afferents that respond to bladder distension. Many neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, nitric oxide and neuropeptides are involved in the neural control of the LUT. Injuries or diseases of the nervous system as well as disorders of the peripheral organs can produce LUT dysfunctions including: (1) urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence or (2) inefficient voiding and urinary retention. Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is triggered by C‐fibre bladder afferent axons, many of which terminate in the close proximity to the urothelium. The urothelial cells exhibit ‘neuron‐like’ properties that allow them to respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli and to release transmitters that can modulate the activity of afferent nerves.

Spiral computerized tomography (CT) is becoming a frequently used radiographic examination to establish the diagnosis and severity of calculus disease. Our objective for this study was to determine the precision of spiral CT in identifying the chemical composition of 6 different types of urinary calculi with region of interest measurements using spiral CT. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 chemically pure stones were separated into 6 groups. The stones along with phantoms containing butter (fat) and jello (water) were mounted vertically in the scanner gantry. Then 1 mm. thickness scanning was performed with a high speed scanner at the 2 energy levels of 80 and 120 kV. The determination of the chemical composition was performed using the absolute CT value measured at 120 kV. and the dual kilovolt CT values measured at 80 and 120 kV. Hounsfield unit at 80 kV. - Hounsfield unit at 120 kV.). Results: The absolute CT value measured at 120 kV. was able to identify precisely the chemical composition of uric acid, struvite and calcium oxalate stones. It was imprecise in differentiating calcium oxalate from brushite stone and struvite from cystine stone. However, dual kilovolt CT value was able to differentiate these latter stones with statistical significance (p <0.03). Uric acid stones were easily differentiated from all other stones using the absolute CT value. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the chemical composition of urinary calculi can be accurately determined by CT scanning in an in vitro setting.

Approximately 6.5 million of the 27 million white men who are 50 to 79 years old in the United States in 2000 were estimated to meet the criteria for discussing treatment. Materials and Methods: The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously. Results: In 2000 approximately 4.5 million visits were made to physician offices to for a primary diagnosis of BPH and almost 8 million visits were made with a primary or secondary diagnosis of BPH. In the same year approximately 87,400 prostatectomies for BPH were performed in inpatients in nonfederal hospitals in the United States. While the number of outpatient visits for BPH increased consistently during the 1990s, there was a dramatic decrease in the use of transurethral prostatectomy, inpatient hospitalization and length of hospital stay for this condition. These trends reflect the changing face of medical management for BPH, ie increasing use of pharmacological agents and minimally invasive therapies. In 2000 the direct cost of BPH treatment was estimated to be $1.1 billion exclusive of outpatient pharmaceuticals. Conclusions: Given the impact that BPH has on quality of life and health care cost in millions of American men, additional research into risk factors, diagnostic and therapeutic resource use, and effectiveness and cost benefit of therapies are warranted.

The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to Surgical Management of Stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society Guideline. Please refer to Part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the Guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. Results: The Panel identified 12 adult Index Patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional Index Patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, Guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management. Conclusions: Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This Guideline is intended for use in conjunction with the individual patient’s treatment goals. In all cases, patient preferences and personal goals should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2118051267", "title": "Detection of Intracellular Bacterial Communities in Human Urinary Tract Infection", "text": "Background Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections and are predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). While UTIs are typically considered extracellular infections, it has been recently demonstrated that UPEC bind to, invade, and replicate within the murine bladder urothelium to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). These IBCs dissociate and bacteria flux out of bladder facet cells, some with filamentous morphology, and ultimately establish quiescent intracellular reservoirs that can seed recurrent infection. This IBC pathogenic cycle has not yet been investigated in humans. In this study we sought to determine whether evidence of an IBC pathway could be found in urine specimens from women with acute UTI. Methods and Findings We collected midstream, clean-catch urine specimens from 80 young healthy women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and 20 asymptomatic women with a history of UTI. Investigators were blinded to culture results and clinical history. Samples were analyzed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy for evidence of exfoliated IBCs and filamentous bacteria. Evidence of IBCs was found in 14 of 80 (18%) urines from women with UTI. Filamentous bacteria were found in 33 of 80 (41%) urines from women with UTI. None of the 20 urines from the asymptomatic comparative group showed evidence of IBCs or filaments. Filamentous bacteria were present in all 14 of the urines with IBCs compared to 19 (29%) of 66 samples with no evidence of IBCs (p < 0.001). Of 65 urines from patients with E. coli infections, 14 (22%) had evidence of IBCs and 29 (45%) had filamentous bacteria, while none of the gram-positive infections had IBCs or filamentous bacteria. Conclusions The presence of exfoliated IBCs and filamentous bacteria in the urines of women with acute cystitis suggests that the IBC pathogenic pathway characterized in the murine model may occur in humans. The findings support the occurrence of an intracellular bacterial niche in some women with cystitis that may have important implications for UTI recurrence and treatment.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118051267", "source": "openalex"}

To evaluate the role of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in increasing the frequency and severity of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and renal parenchymal damage among patients with acute pyelonephritis and to determine whether urinary antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the frequency and/or severity of UTIs and/or prevents renal parenchymal damage among patients with mild/moderate VUR. METHODS. Patients 3 months to 18 years of age with acute pyelonephritis, with or without VUR, were assigned randomly to receive urinary antibiotic prophylaxis or not. Patients were monitored every 3 months for 1 year. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans were repeated at 6 months or if there was a recurrence of febrile UTI. Urinalysis and urine culture were performed at each clinic visit. Renal ultrasound scans and voiding cystourethrograms were repeated at the end of 1 year of follow-up monitoring. RESULTS. Of the 236 patients enrolled in the study, 218 completed the 1-year follow-up monitoring. Groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and reflux grade distribution for those with VUR. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups with respect to rate of recurrent UTI, type of recurrence, rate of subsequent pyelonephritis, and development of renal parenchymal scars. CONCLUSIONS. After 1 year of follow-up monitoring, mild/moderate VUR does not increase the incidence of UTI, pyelonephritis, or renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis. Moreover, a role for urinary antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing the recurrence of infection and the development of renal scars is not supported by this study.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096930444", "source": "openalex"}

The primary outcomes included measures of stress incontinence (symptoms, stress testing, or treatment) and measures of urge symptoms. Enrollment was stopped after the first interim analysis because of a significantly lower frequency of stress incontinence in the group that underwent the Burch colposuspension.Of 322 women who underwent randomization, 157 were assigned to Burch colposuspension and 165 to the control group. Three months after surgery, 33.6 percent of the women in the Burch group and 57.4 percent of the controls met one or more of the criteria for stress incontinence (P<0.001) [Corrected]. There was no significant difference between the Burch group and the control group in the frequency of urge incontinence (32.7 percent vs. 38.4 percent, P=0.48). After surgery, women in the control group were more likely to report bothersome symptoms of stress incontinence than those in the Burch group who had stress incontinence (24.5 percent vs. 6.1 percent, P<0.001).In women without stress incontinence who are undergoing abdominal sacrocolpopexy for prolapse, Burch colposuspension significantly reduced postoperative symptoms of stress incontinence without increasing other lower urinary tract symptoms.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976890255", "source": "openalex"}

After a baseline study period the stone formers were divided by randomization into 2 groups (1 and 2) and they were followed prospectively for 5 years. Followup in group 1 only involved a high intake of water without any dietetic change, while followup in group 2 did not involve any treatment. Each year clinical, laboratory and radiological evaluation was obtained to determine urinary stone risk profile (including relative supersaturations of calcium oxalate, brushite and uric acid by Equil 2), recurrence rate and mean time to relapse.The original urine volume was lower in male and female stone formers compared to controls (men with calcium oxalate stones 1,057 +/- 238 ml./24 hours versus normal men 1,401 +/- 562 ml./24 hours, p < 0.0001 and women calcium oxalate stones 990 +/- 230 ml./24 hours versus normal women 1,239 +/- 440 ml./24 hours, p < 0.001). During followup recurrences were noted within 5 years in 12 of 99 group 1 patients and in 27 of 100 group 2 patients (p = 0.008). The average interval for recurrences was 38.7 +/- 13.2 months in group 1 and 25.1 +/- 16.4 months in group 2 (p = 0.016). The relative supersaturations for calcium oxalate, brushite and uric acid were much greater in baseline urine of the stone patients in both groups compared to controls. During followup, baseline values decreased sharply only in group 1. Finally the baseline urine in patients with recurrences was characterized by a higher calcium excretion compared to urine of the patients without recurrences in both groups.We conclude that urine volume is a real stone risk factor in nephrolithiasis and that a large intake of water is the initial therapy for prevention of stone recurrences. In cases of hypercalciuria it is suitable to prescribe adjuvant specific diets or drug therapy.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158124838", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1540917893", "title": "The Holmium Laser in Urology", "text": "Objective: To review the physics related to the holmium laser, its laser-tissue interactions, and its application to the treatment of urological diseases. Summary and Background Data: The holmium: YAG laser is a solid-state, pulsed laser that emits light at 2100 nm. It combines the qualities of the carbon dioxide and neodymium: YAG lasers providing both tissue cutting and coagulation in a single device. Since the holmium wavelength can be transmitted down optical fibers, it is especially suited for endoscopic surgery. Methods: The authors provide a review of the literature as it relates to the holmium laser and its application to urology. Results: The holmium wavelength is strongly absorbed by water. Tissue ablation occurs superficially, providing for precise incision with a thermal injury zone ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. This level of coagulation is sufficient for adequate hemostasis. The most common urologic applications of the holmium laser that have been reported include incision of urethral and ureteral strictures; ablation of superficial transitional cell carcinoma; bladder neck incision and prostate resection; and lithotripsy of urinary calculi. Conclusions: The holmium:YAG laser is a multi-purpose, multi-specialty surgical laser. It has been shown to be safe and effective for multiple soft tissue applications and stone fragmentation. Its utilization in urology is anticipated to increase with time as a result of these features.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1540917893", "source": "openalex"}

In this study we examined epidemiological, economic and health care use trends for UTI in women in the United States. Materials and Methods: The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously. Results: The lifetime risk for UTI in women is high (greater than 50%). Between 1988 and 1994 the overall lifetime prevalence of UTI was estimated to be 53,067/100,000 women. Prescribing patterns demonstrated an increase in the trend toward using fluoroquinolones as first line therapy for UTI, which was associated with increased costs. Composite data revealed that overall expenditures for the treatment of UTIs in women in the United States, excluding spending on outpatient prescriptions, were approximately $2.47 billion in 2000. Diagnosis and treatment of UTI in women is performed in various clinical settings. Inpatient hospitalization for UTI care has generally decreased in younger women but increased in elderly women. There has been a sharp increase in emergency room use by younger women, which may reflect disparities in access to health insurance or primary care providers. Most outpatient care of women with UTIs is performed in physician offices. Conclusions: Analysis of health care use and economic data on UTIs in women revealed various interesting trends. These findings will help shape understanding of UTI treatment in relation to other urological disorders in women. The results raise various important future research questions.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2724279953", "title": "Effect of Electroacupuncture on Urinary Leakage Among Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence", "text": "<h3>Importance</h3> Electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region may be effective for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), but evidence is limited. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess the effect of electroacupuncture vs sham electroacupuncture for women with SUI. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted at 12 hospitals in China and enrolling 504 women with SUI between October 2013 and May 2015, with data collection completed in December 2015. <h3>Interventions</h3> Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 18 sessions (over 6 weeks) of electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region (n = 252) or sham electroacupuncture (n = 252) with no skin penetration on sham acupoints. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 6 in the amount of urine leakage, measured by the 1-hour pad test. Secondary outcomes included mean 72-hour urinary incontinence episodes measured by a 72-hour bladder diary (72-hour incontinence episodes). <h3>Results</h3> Among the 504 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 55.3 [8.4] years), 482 completed the study. Mean urine leakage at baseline was 18.4 g for the electroacupuncture group and 19.1 g for the sham electroacupuncture group. Mean 72-hour incontinence episodes were 7.9 for the electroacupuncture group and 7.7 for the sham electroacupuncture group. At week 6, the electroacupuncture group had greater decrease in mean urine leakage (−9.9 g) than the sham electroacupuncture group (−2.6 g) with a mean difference of 7.4 g (95% CI, 4.8 to 10.0;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). During some time periods, the change in the mean 72-hour incontinence episodes from baseline was greater with electroacupuncture than sham electroacupuncture with between-group differences of 1.0 episode in weeks 1 to 6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.7;<i>P</i> = .01), 2.0 episodes in weeks 15 to 18 (95% CI, 1.3-2.7;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and 2.1 episodes in weeks 27 to 30 (95% CI, 1.3-2.8;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 1.6% in the electroacupuncture group and 2.0% in the sham electroacupuncture group, and all events were classified as mild. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Among women with stress urinary incontinence, treatment with electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region, compared with sham electroacupuncture, resulted in less urine leakage after 6 weeks. Further research is needed to understand long-term efficacy and the mechanism of action of this intervention. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01784172.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2724279953", "source": "openalex"}

However, controversy remains regarding the role of maintenance therapy, and its long-term effect on recurrence and progression. Materials and Methods: All patients in the study had transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with carcinoma in situ or an increased risk of recurrence. The criteria for increased risk were 2 or more episodes of tumor within the most recent year, or 3 or more tumors within 6 months. At least 1 week following biopsy of carcinoma in situ and resection of any stage Ta or T1 transitional cell tumors 660 patients were started on a 6-week induction course of intravesical and percutaneous Connaught BCG. Three months following initiation of BCG induction therapy 550 consenting patients were stratified by purified protein derivative skin test and the presence of carcinoma in situ, and then randomized by central computer to receive BCG maintenance therapy (maintenance arm) or no BCG maintenance therapy (no maintenance arm). Maintenance therapy consisted of intravesical and percutaneous BCG each week for 3 weeks given 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months from initiation of induction therapy. The 384 eligible patients who were disease-free at randomization constitute the primary intent to treat analytic group because they could be followed for disease recurrence. All patients were followed for adverse effects of treatment, recurrence, disease worsening and survival. Results: No toxicities above grade 3 were noted in the 243 maintenance arm patients. The policy of withholding maintenance BCG from patients with increased side effects may have diminished the opportunity to observe severe toxicity. Estimated median recurrence-free survival was 35.7 months (95% confidence interval 25.1 to 56.8) in the no maintenance and 76.8 months (64.3 to 93.2) in the maintenance arm (log rank p <0.0001). Estimated median time for worsening-free survival, defined as no evidence of progression including pathological stage T2 disease or greater, or the use of cystectomy, systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy, was 111.5 months in the no maintenance and not estimable in the maintenance arm (log rank p = 0.04). Overall 5-year survival was 78% in the no maintenance compared to 83% in the maintenance arm. Conclusions: Compared to standard induction therapy maintenance BCG immunotherapy was beneficial in patients with carcinoma in situ and select patients with Ta, T1 bladder cancer. Median recurrence-free survival time was twice as long in the 3-week maintenance arm compared to the no maintenance arm, and patients had significantly longer worsening-free survival.

Forty-two (71%) patients had a cystoscopy that showed various degrees of epithelial inflammation similar to that seen in chronic interstitial cystitis. All of 12 available bladder biopsies had histological features resembling those of interstitial cystitis. Urodynamically, either detrusor overactivity or decreased bladder compliance with or without vesico-ureteric reflux was detected to some degree in all of 47 patients. Thirty patients (51%) had unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis on renal ultrasonography, and four (7%) showed features suggestive of papillary necrosis on radiological imaging. Eight patients had a raised serum creatinine level.A syndrome of cystitis and contracted bladder can be associated with street-ketamine abuse. Secondary renal damage can occur in severe cases which might be irreversible, rendering patients dependent on dialysis. The present data do not establish the precise cause nor the incidence. Street-ketamine abuse is not only a drug problem, but might be associated with a serious urological condition causing a significant burden to healthcare resources.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066655743", "source": "openalex"}

The immediate postoperative morbidity rate was 18 per cent. Increased morbidity was found in patients with a resection time of more than 90 minutes, gland size of more than 45gm., acute urinary retention and patient age greater than 80 years, and in the black population. Of the patients 77 per cent had significant pre-existing medical problems. Operative mortality, significant morbidity and hospital stay were reduced in comparison to studies done 15 and 30 years ago. © 1989 by The American Urological Association Education and Research,

This analytical approach allowed us to directly measure the individual phthalate metabolites responsible for the animal reproductive and developmental toxicity while avoiding contamination from the ubiquitous parent compounds. The monoesters with the highest urinary levels found were monoethyl phthalate (95th percentile, 3,750 ppb, 2,610 microg/g creatinine), monobutyl phthalate (95th percentile, 294 ppb, 162 microg/g creatinine), and monobenzyl phthalate (95th percentile, 137 ppb, 92 microg/g creatinine), reflecting exposure to diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, and benzyl butyl phthalate. Women of reproductive age (20-40 years) were found to have significantly higher levels of monobutyl phthalate, a reproductive and developmental toxicant in rodents, than other age/gender groups (p < 0.005). Current scientific and regulatory attention on phthalates has focused almost exclusively on health risks from exposure to only two phthalates, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-isononyl phthalate. Our findings strongly suggest that health-risk assessments for phthalate exposure in humans should include diethyl, dibutyl, and benzyl butyl phthalates.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097972057", "source": "openalex"}

The prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence during the previous 12 months were assessed by questionnaire. Factors potentially associated with urinary incontinence were assessed by questionnaire, interview, and physical examination. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent associations between these factors and the primary outcome of daily incontinence.Forty-one percent (3285) of the women reported urinary incontinence, with 14% (1130) reporting daily incontinence. In multivariate analysis, the prevalence of daily urinary incontinence increased significantly with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.3 per 5 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.5), prior hysterectomy (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.6), higher body mass index (OR 1.6 per 5 units, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), history of stroke (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7), diabetes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), and poor overall health (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.1). Faster gait speed (OR 0.8 per 0.2 units, 95% CI 0.6-1.0) was associated with decreased incontinence.Urinary incontinence is a common problem in older women, more common than most chronic medical conditions. Of the associated factors that are preventable or modifiable, obesity and hysterectomy may have the greatest impact on the prevalence of daily incontinence.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023359850", "source": "openalex"}

We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess BPA variability and estimated associations between log10-transformed urinary BPA concentrations and demographic, occupational, dietary, and environmental factors, using mixed models.Geometric mean (GM) creatinine-standardized concentrations (micrograms per gram) were 1.7 (16 weeks), 2.0 (26 weeks), and 2.0 (birth). Creatinine-standardized BPA concentrations exhibited low reproducibility (ICC = 0.11). By occupation, cashiers had the highest BPA concentrations (GM: 2.8 μg/g). Consuming canned vegetables at least once a day was associated with higher BPA concentrations (GM = 2.3 μg/g) compared with those consuming no canned vegetables (GM = 1.6 μg/g). BPA concentrations did not vary by consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, canned fruit, or store-bought fresh and frozen fish. Urinary high-molecular-weight phthalate and serum tobacco smoke metabolite concentrations were positively associated with BPA concentrations.These results suggest numerous sources of BPA exposure during pregnancy. Etiological studies may need to measure urinary BPA concentrations more than once during pregnancy and adjust for phthalates and tobacco smoke exposures.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982404766", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike in younger adults, distinguishing symptomatic urinary tract infection from asymptomatic bacteriuria is problematic, as older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities, are less likely to present with localized genitourinary symptoms. Consensus guidelines have been published to assist clinicians with diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection; however, a single evidence-based approach to diagnosis of urinary tract infection does not exist. In the absence of a gold standard definition of urinary tract infection that clinicians agree upon, overtreatment with antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection remains a significant problem, and leads to a variety of negative consequences including the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Future studies improving the diagnostic accuracy of urinary tract infections are needed. This review will cover the prevalence, diagnosis and diagnostic challenges, management, and prevention of urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165998094", "source": "openalex"}

In this study we assessed temporal changes in urinary and sexual function up to 5 years following radical prostatectomy in a population based cohort.A sample of 1,288 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy and completed a baseline survey within 6 to 12 months of diagnosis were included in the analysis. Two and 5-year functional and quality of life data were collected, as was information on the use of erectile aids. Temporal functional changes and potentially confounding or modifying factors were assessed using longitudinal regression models.Of these men 14% reported frequent urinary leakage or no urinary control 60 months after diagnosis, which was slightly higher than the 10% reporting incontinence at 24 months (p = 0.007). At 60 months 28% of the men had erections firm enough for intercourse compared with 22% at 24 months (p = 0.003). Sildenafil was the most commonly used erectile aid (43% ever used) and 45% of users reported that it helped \"somewhat\" or \"a lot.\"Urinary and sexual dysfunction were common 5 years following radical prostatectomy in this large, community based cohort of prostate cancer survivors.

Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 109 patients referred for the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in our multicenter study. Patients were requested to complete a 72-hour micturition diary and pad test, and repeat each test during a 1-week interval. The test-retest reliability of various parameters of the 72-hour micturition diary and pad test was analyzed and compared. Further analysis was done to compare the test-retest reliability of 24, 48 and 72-hour studies performed on the same days after a 1-week interval. Reliability was assessed by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) with a cutoff value of 0.7 indicating test-retest reliability. Results: Of the 109 patients 106 (97%) with a median age of 64 years completed the study. The number of pads and total weight gain appeared to be reliable measures of the 24, 48 and 72-hour pad tests. For the 24-hour diary the total number of incontinence episodes was a reliable measure, while the total number of voiding episodes was marginally reliable (mean CCC 0.785 and 0.689, respectively). For the 48-hour diary the number of incontinence episodes and total number of voiding episodes were reliable measures (mean CCC 0.78 and 0.83, respectively), while for the 72-hour diary each parameter was highly reliable (CCC 0.86 and 0.826, respectively). However, an increased test period was associated with decreased patient compliance. Conclusions: The 24-hour pad test and micturition diary are reliable instruments for assessing the degree of urinary loss and number of incontinent episodes, respectively. Increasing test duration to 48 and 72 hours increases reliability but is associated with decreased patient compliance.

Dissecting the urethra at a more distal site increases the risk of urethral injury and erosion, and often the urethral circumference is so small that a 4 cm. cuff is too large. We present a novel technique for distal cuff placement using transcorporal dissection that leaves corporal tunica albuginea on the dorsal surface of the urethra, allowing for its safer mobilization and adding to its bulk. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the charts of 31 men who underwent this technique and contacted 26 by telephone. The indications for distal transcorporal cuff placement varied. In 7 men with inadequate urethral coaptation with a 4 cm. proximal cuff at initial implantation a primary transcorporal tandem cuff was implanted distal. In 8 men persistent or recurrent incontinence despite a 4 cm. proximal cuff led to secondary distal reimplantation. Previous artificial urinary sphincter erosion and/or infection in 10 cases, previous urethral surgery at the optimal cuff site in 5 and radiation changes at the optimal cuff site in 1 led to selection of the more distal site and technique. Of the transcorporally placed cuffs 18 were 4 cm. and 13 were 4.5 cm. Preoperatively 5.2 pads were used daily. Of the 31 patients 27 were impotent preoperatively, 1 had normal erections, 1 had partial erections with the MUSE drug delivery system (Vivus, Inc., Menlo Park, California) and 2 had a previously placed penile prosthesis. Results: At a mean followup of 17 months 26 of the 31 patients (84%) had occasional or no stress incontinence requiring 0 to 1 pad daily, 2 with pure urge incontinence used 1 to 2 pads daily and 3 had mixed incontinence requiring 0 to 3 pads daily. Of the 26 men surveyed 25 were very satisfied with the postoperative level of incontinence. Postoperatively erectile function deteriorated in 1 patient and was unchanged in the remainder. There was no erosion or infection of the transcorporally placed cuffs, although 3 were replaced for malfunction. Conclusions: This technique offers significant advantages in cases of revision. The technique protects the urethra from intraoperative dissection injury and decreases the risk of erosion because the urethra is buttressed at its vulnerable location. In addition, bulk is added to the urethra, allowing for better cuff sizing, which is usually a problem at this location where the urethra is small, thereby, improving continence in revised cases. Our success has recently led us to abandon tandem cuff placement altogether. There is a potential for deteriorating erectile function in potent men who undergo implantation in this fashion.

We previously demonstrated that high serum levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1), an antiangiogenic protein, and low levels of placental growth factor (PlGF), a proangiogenic protein, predict subsequent development of preeclampsia. In the absence of glomerular disease leading to proteinuria, sFlt1 is too large a molecule to be filtered into the urine, while PlGF is readily filtered.To test the hypothesis that urinary PlGF is reduced prior to onset of hypertension and proteinuria and that this reduction predicts preeclampsia.Nested case-control study within the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention trial of healthy nulliparous women enrolled at 5 US university medical centers during 1992-1995. Each woman with preeclampsia was matched to 1 normotensive control by enrollment site, gestational age at collection of the first serum specimen, and sample storage time at -70 degrees C. One hundred twenty pairs of women were randomly chosen for analysis of serum and urine specimens obtained before labor.Cross-sectional urinary PlGF concentrations, before and after normalization for urinary creatinine.Among normotensive controls, urinary PlGF increased during the first 2 trimesters, peaked at 29 to 32 weeks, and decreased thereafter. Among cases, before onset of preeclampsia the pattern of urinary PlGF was similar, but levels were significantly reduced beginning at 25 to 28 weeks. There were particularly large differences between controls and cases of preeclampsia with subsequent early onset of the disease or small-for-gestational-age infants. After onset of clinical disease, mean urinary PlGF in women with preeclampsia was 32 pg/mL, compared with 234 pg/mL in controls with fetuses of similar gestational age (P<.001). The adjusted odds ratio for the risk of preeclampsia to begin before 37 weeks of gestation for specimens obtained at 21 to 32 weeks, which were in the lowest quartile of control PlGF concentrations (<118 pg/mL), compared with all other quartiles, was 22.5 (95% confidence interval, 7.4-67.8).Decreased urinary PlGF at mid gestation is strongly associated with subsequent early development of preeclampsia.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137433871", "source": "openalex"}

Catecholaminesecreting tumors were histologically proven. The sensitivity of fractionated plasma metanephrines was 97% (30 of 31 patients), compared with a sensitivity of 90% (28 of 31) for urinary total metanephrines and catecholamines (P = 0.63). The specificity of fractionated plasma metanephrines was 85% (221 of 261), compared with 98% (257 of 261; P < 0.001) for urinary measurements. The likelihood ratios for positive tests were 6.3 (95% confidence interval, 4.7 to 8.5) for fractionated plasma metanephrines and 58.9 (95% confidence interval, 22.1 to 156.9) for urinary total metanephrines and catecholamines. An adrenal pheochromocytoma was missed by urinary testing in two patients with familial syndromes and one asymptomatic patient with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass. An extra-adrenal paraganglioma was missed by plasma testing in one patient. In conclusion, measurements of 24-h urinary total metanephrines and catecholamines yield fewer false-positive results, an attribute preferred for testing low-risk patients, but fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements may be preferred in high-risk patients with familial endocrine syndromes.", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979170245", "source": "openalex"}

Furthermore, studies now indicate that dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome is associated with pathological conditions. We propose that the urinary microbiome may influence chronic inflammation observed in the prostate, leading to prostate cancer development and progression. Therefore, we profiled the urinary microbiome in men with positive vs negative biopsies for prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Urine was collected from men prior to biopsy for prostate cancer. DNA was extracted from urine pellet samples and subjected to bacterial 16S rDNA Illumina® sequencing and 16S rDNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We determined the association between bacterial species and the presence or absence of cancer, cancer grade, and type and degree of prostate inflammation. Results: Urine samples revealed diverse bacterial populations. There were no significant differences in α or β diversity and no clear hierarchical clustering of benign or cancer samples. We identified a cluster of pro-inflammatory bacteria previously implicated in urogenital infections in a subset of samples. Many species, including known uropathogens, were significantly and differentially abundant among cancer and benign samples, in low vs higher grade cancers and in relation to prostate inflammation type and degree. Conclusions: To our knowledge we report the most comprehensive study to date of the male urinary microbiome and its relationship to prostate cancer. Our results suggest a prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria and uropathogens in the urinary tract of men with prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods: Questionnaire data from 1,271 men presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms in 12 countries were analyzed. Statistical methods included distributions, cross tabulations, chi-square analysis and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: Although prevalence and bothersomeness were moderately positively related, voiding symptoms were the most prevalent whereas the most bothersome were predominantly storage symptoms, including incontinence. While prevalence showed a broadly decreasing trend with age, bothersomeness was relatively unrelated to age. Conclusions: These findings suggest that symptom occurrence alone does not necessarily reflect the degree to which patients are bothered by lower urinary tract symptoms. Therefore, when deciding on treatment it is important not only to consider the presence and frequency of lower urinary tract symptoms but also the bother that they cause.

Materials and Methods: We evaluated a consecutive series of 536 patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy with attempted bilateral, unilateral or no nerve sparing, as defined by the surgeon, without prior radiotherapy at a minimum followup of 1 year with documented assessment of urinary continence status. Because outlet obstruction may influence continence rates, its incidence and management was also evaluated. Results: One year after surgery 505 of 536 patients (94.2%) were continent, 27 (5%) had grade I stress incontinence and 4 (0.8%) had grade II stress incontinence. Incontinence was found in 1 of 75 (1.3%), 11 of 322 (3.4%) and 19 of 139 patients (13.7%) with attempted bilateral, attempted unilateral and without attempted nerve sparing, respectively. The proportional differences were highly significant, favoring a nerve sparing technique (p <0.0001). On multiple logistic regression analysis attempted nerve sparing was the only statistically significant factor influencing urinary continence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy (OR 4.77, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.44, p = 0.0001). Outlet obstruction at the anastomotic site in 33 of the 536 men (6.2%) developed at a median of 8 weeks (IQR 4 to 12) and was managed by dilation or an endoscopic procedure. Conclusions: The incidence of incontinence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy is low and continence is highly associated with a nerve sparing technique. Therefore, nerve sparing should be attempted in all patients if the principles of oncological surgery are not compromised.
