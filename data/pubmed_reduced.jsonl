It is clear that there are varying degrees of cardiogenic shock but there is no robust classification scheme to categorize this disease state. A multidisciplinary group of experts convened by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions was assembled to derive a proposed classification schema for cardiogenic shock. Representatives from cardiology (interventional, advanced heart failure, noninvasive), emergency medicine, critical care, and cardiac nursing all collaborated to develop the proposed schema. A system describing stages of cardiogenic shock from A to E was developed. Stage A is \"at risk\" for cardiogenic shock, stage B is \"beginning\" shock, stage C is \"classic\" cardiogenic shock, stage D is \"deteriorating\", and E is \"extremis\". The difference between stages B and C is the presence of hypoperfusion which is present in stages C and higher. Stage D implies that the initial set of interventions chosen have not restored stability and adequate perfusion despite at least 30 minutes of observation and stage E is the patient in extremis, highly unstable, often with cardiovascular collapse. This proposed classification system is simple, clinically applicable across the care spectrum from pre-hospital providers to intensive care staff but will require future validation studies to assess its utility and potential prognostic implications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104355/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

However, at least in the Western world, middle-aged male patients with acute myocardial infarction are no more the rule. Due to a higher life expectancy and major medical advances, physicians are to treat older and frailer individuals, usually with multiple comorbidities. In this context, myocardial ischaemia and infarction frequently result from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand-i.e., type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI), according to the current universal definition-rather than coronary atherothrombosis. Moreover, the increasing use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has led to a heightened detection of T2MI-often causing relatively little myocardial injury-, which seems to have doubled its numbers in recent years. Nevertheless, owing to its multifaceted pathophysiology and clinical presentation, T2MI is still underdiagnosed. Perhaps more importantly, T2MI is also victim of undertreatment, as drugs that constitute the cornerstone of therapy in most cardiovascular diseases are much more unlikely to be prescribed in T2MI than in coronary atherothrombosis. In this paper, we review the recent literature on the classification, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of T2MI, trying to summarise the state-of-the-art knowledge about this increasingly important pathologic condition. Finally, based on the current scientific evidence, we also propose an algorithm that may be easily utilised in clinical practice, in order to improve T2MI diagnosis and risk stratification.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157215/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

Early pharmacological reperfusion of the culprit coronary artery and early coronary angiography (pharmacoinvasive strategy) can be the solution to the logistical problem that primary angioplasty rises. Several studies have demonstrated pharmacoinvasive strategy as effective and safe as primary angioplasty ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which is postulated as the choice to follow in communities where access to PPCI is limited. The Mexico City Government together with the National Institute of Cardiology have developed a pharmaco-invasive reperfusion treatment program to ensure effective and timely reperfusion in STEMI. The model comprises a network of care at all three levels of health, including a system for early pharmacological reperfusion in primary care centers, a digital telemedicine system, an inter-hospital transport network to ensure primary angioplasty or early percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis and a training program with certification of the health care personal.

Abnormal changes to the proteome, the complete cellular protein complement, are responsible for the various disease phenotypes. The proteome is dynamic, however, and is constantly changing due to a combination of factors, including temporal and functional regulation of gene expression, differrential mRNA splicing and subsequent protein post-translational modifications. This dynamic response is compounded during the development of acute responses of the heart (such as myocardial preconditioning, stunning and infarction), just as it is during the development and onset of chronic heart disease (eg, heart failure). Proteomic analyses enable the identification and characterization of these disease-induced protein changes using a multitude of experimental techniques. This review provides an overview of proteomic technology with emphasis on the unique problems associated with the analysis of the heart, summarizes the latest proteomic studies, assesses what information analogous genomic studies can provide for the design and execution of proteomics, and finally discusses the implications of proteomics for the identification and development of diagnostics and therapeutic targets specifically for heart disease. The future holds great promise for the availability of a panel of cardiac serum biomarkers able to delineate different stages of each heart disease, thus allowing the design of clinical interventions potentially using stage-specific therapeutics.

Peri-procedural PCI-related MI (type 4a MI) in CCS patients should be diagnosed in cases of major peri-procedural acute myocardial injury indicated by an increase in cTn concentrations of >5-times the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) together with evidence of new peri-procedural myocardial ischaemia as demonstrated by electrocardiography (ECG), imaging, or flow-limiting peri-procedural complications in coronary angiography. Measurement of cTn baseline concentrations before elective PCI is useful. In patients presenting with acute MI undergoing PCI, peri-procedural increases in cTn concentrations are usually due to their index presentation and not PCI-related, apart from obvious major peri-procedural complications, such as persistent occlusion of a large side branch or no-reflow after stent implantation. The distinction between type 4a MI, PCI-related acute myocardial injury, and chronic myocardial injury can be challenging in individuals undergoing PCI.

This paper seeks to review the evolution of CR and its well-established benefits, as well as reasons behind the poor referral and utilization. CR is a secondary prevention program for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that was first initiated in the 1970s as a hospital-based exercise program after an acute MI, but then evolved into a comprehensive multi-disciplinary program for patients with a wider range of cardiovascular diseases. CR mortality and morbidity benefits have endured over decades, even as interventional and pharmacological cardiovascular therapeutics have improved and as patients have become relatively more stable. Despite being an evidence-based clinical standard, referral and participation in CR are disconcertingly low. In efforts to combat poor referral rates, and improve care in the contemporary care environment, the approach to CR is evolving. Innovations include broadening CR beyond the hospital setting into remote- and hybrid-based formats, while still incorporating exercise training, risk factor reduction, and education, as well as behavioral and psychosocial support. Nonetheless, there still remain many challenges to overcome in order to increase participation of all ages, financials, races, and sexes. With new performance measures as well as an increasing number of NIH-funded studies on the horizon, there is hope that CR will become a relatively more valued and utilized component of cardiovascular preventative care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34741670/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

{"id": "28450365", "title": "Critical Issues for the Translation of Cardioprotection.", "text": "The translation from numerous successful animal experiments on cardioprotection beyond that by reperfusion to clinical practice has to date been disappointing. Animal experiments often use reductionist approaches and are mostly performed in young and healthy animals which lack the risk factors, comorbidities, and comedications which are characteristics of patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction or undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Conceptually, it is still unclear by how much the time window for successful reperfusion is extended by preconditioning, and how long the duration of ischemia can be so that adjunct cardioprotection by postconditioning at reperfusion still protects. Experimental studies addressing long-term effects of adjunct cardioprotection beyond infarct size reduction, that is, on repair, remodeling, and mortality, are lacking. Technically, reproducibility and robustness of experimental studies are often limited. Grave faults in design and conduct of clinical trials have also substantially contributed to the failure of translation of cardioprotection to clinical practice. Cardiovascular surgery with ischemic cardioplegic arrest is only a surrogate of acute myocardial infarction and confounded by the choice of anesthesia, hypothermia, cardioplegia, and traumatic myocardial injury. Trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction have been performed on agents/interventions with no or inconsistent previous animal data and in patients who had either some reperfusion already at admission or were reperfused too late to expect any myocardial salvage. Of greatest concern is the lack of adequate phase II dosing and timing studies when rushing from promising proof-of-concept trials with surrogate end points such as infarct size to larger clinical outcome trials. Future trials must focus on interventions/agents with robust preclinical evidence, have solid phase II dosing and timing data, and recruit patients who have truly a chance to benefit from adjunct cardioprotection.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28450365/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

A total of 78 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining novel stent designs (Biofreedom™, COMBO), use of drug-coated balloons in patients with high bleeding risk, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation myocardial infarction, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (alirocumab) and approaches of hypertension management. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril-valsartan during acute hospital admission and the management of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Electrophysiology data included trials examining atrial fibrillation ablation, wearable cardiac defibrillators (LifeVest) and His-bundle pacing.

On the basis of the SHOCK trial, early revascularization is the most relevant procedure to improve the outcome of patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock. The majority of these patients present with multivessel coronary disease. The randomized CULPRIT-SHOCK trial showed that in the emergency setting, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be confined to the culprit lesion. Regarding vascular access site, no data derived from randomized controlled trials in cardiogenic shock are available. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is nowadays rarely performed in cardiogenic shock with rates less than 5% but is still a treatment option if coronary anatomy is not amenable to PCI. Regarding antiplatelet treatment, a randomized trial testing the intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor cangrelor versus an oral P2Y12 inhibitor in infarct-related cardiogenic shock is currently being performed.

Greater levels of TNF may not be linked to an increased risk of recurrent coronary events in the stable phase after myocardial ischemia (MI). Coronary atheroma is connected to endothelial and smooth muscle cells, as well as macrophages that emit the multifunctional cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Transplanted tumours become more vulnerable when TNF-<i>α</i> was first recognized to have a function in hemorrhagic necrosis. TNF-<i>α</i> has been demonstrated to induce heart failure, pulmonary edoema, and cardiomyopathy in people with advanced heart failure when it is elevated in the bloodstream. It has been postulated that prolonged overexpression of TNF-<i>α</i> after ischemia may contribute to poor cardiac outcomes by increasing TNF-<i>α</i> when the myocardium undergoes both temporary ischemia and reperfusion. A rise in TNF levels has been seen after a myocardial infarction, but it is unclear if these higher levels, found months after the initial event, are associated with an increased risk of subsequent heart attacks. We looked at TNF levels in the blood of 270 patients with coronary heart disease in the Chinese Hypertension League's Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) experiment to see if this notion held true. Recurrent coronary syndrome and coronary mortality were monitored prospectively in the participants. The min max imbalance normalization can be used to assess a patient's baseline characteristics, including hormone and cholesterol test results. Type 2 stimulant connection to aggregate the TNF-signaling qualities and fuzzy techniques was applied. There may now be enough preliminary evidence from the crucial bundle neural network analysis to identify the risk of coronary heart disease associated with TNF pregeneration studies.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology STEMI guideline was developed to provide advice regarding the optimal acute management of STEMI patients irrespective of where they are initially identified: in the field, at a non-percutaneous coronary intervention-capable centre or at a percutaneous coronary intervention-capable centre. We had also planned to evaluate and incorporate sex and gender considerations in the development of our recommendations. Unfortunately, inadequate enrollment of women in randomized trials, lack of publication of main outcomes stratified according to sex, and lack of inclusion of gender as a study variable in the available literature limited the feasibility of such an approach. The Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to develop specific evidence-based recommendations for the early identification of STEMI patients, practical aspects of patient transport, regional reperfusion decision-making, adjunctive prehospital interventions (oxygen, opioids, antiplatelet therapy), and procedural aspects of mechanical reperfusion (access site, thrombectomy, antithrombotic therapy, extent of revascularization). Emphasis is placed on integrating these recommendations as part of an organized regional network of STEMI care and the development of appropriate reperfusion and transportation pathways for any given region.

In this article, we will objectively review the evolution of the ischemia paradigm, the trial evidence comparing revascularization to medical therapy in SIHD, and what contemporary practice should be in 2022. Randomized trials, including COURAGE and, most recently, the ISCHEMIA trial, have shown no reduction in \"hard outcomes\" like death and myocardial infarction (MI) in SIHD compared to medical therapy. The trial excluded high-risk patients with left main disease, low ejection fraction (EF) < 35%, and severe unacceptable angina. Irrespective of the severity of ischemia and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), revascularization did not offer any prognostic advantage over medical therapy. On the other hand, there was a durable improvement in symptoms. While there are many caveats to the ISCHEMIA trial, the overall strengths of the trial outweigh these limitations. The findings of ISCHEMIA are consistent with previous trials. It is time for the cardiology community to pivot towards medical therapy as the initial step for most patients with SIHD.

{"id": "11192359", "title": "ACE inhibitors in heart failure: an update.", "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now accepted as part of the routine management of patients with heart failure. Their use has been mandated in all the new major mortality trials to test the efficacy of beta-blockers in heart failure. Morbidity and mortality remain high in those with heart failure even with the benefits proven for both these groups of agents. In spite of the evidence for benefit of ACE inhibitors they are persistently used in lower doses in clinical practice than tested in the large-scale trials. This was so prevalent as to allow the conduct of a substantial study, the ATLAS trial, to compare high and low dose ACE inhibition. Its equivocal findings have allowed different interpretations. Clinical experience would suggest that starting with a low dose is appropriate but the dose should be titrated then without undue delay to the levels used in the trials wherever possible. The evidence for benefit with these drugs had been obtained largely in patients with impaired systolic function. However the AIRE study selected patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction rather than with impaired systolic function. A substantial and long-term benefit was found from ACE inhibition. A cohort of patients had ventricular function assessed and as anticipated almost one half had preserved systolic function. Whilst the absolute benefit in lives saved was greater in the higher risk/low ejection fraction group, the relative risk reduction was not significantly different between those with preserved or impaired systolic function. The publication of the HOPE trial, although not a study of patients with heart failure, has clarified the situation considerably for those taking day to day care of patients. The HOPE study selected patients on the basis of high cardiovascular risk excluding those with known impaired systolic function. Although not an entry requirement for the study, ejection fraction was measured in a substantial majority and was above 40% indicating preservation of systolic function. The ACE inhibitor ramipril markedly reduced the combined end-point of cardiovascular death, stroke and myocardial infarction. Importantly there was a highly significant 20% risk reduction in the rate of myocardial infarction, a prospectively defined end-point, over the average four and a half year follow-up. Taken together with the retrospectively derived evidence from the heart failure trials there is now compelling evidence that the ACE inhibitors prevent myocardial infarction. The majority of patients with clinical heart failure have underlying ischaemic heart disease. Prevention of myocardial infarction and control of blood pressure are two key factors in the management of these patients irrespective of systolic ventricular function. The ACE inhibitors like the beta-blockers therefore have a pivotal role in their management. A challenge to current clinical trials is to determine whether these properties are shared to the same degree by the angiotensin antagonists or if even further gains in benefit can come from their combination. The neutral findings of the ELITE II study comparing the angiotensin antagonist, losartan, with the ACE inhibitor, captopril, have heightened interest in the on-going trials addressing these issues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11192359/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

Whilst cardiac cachexia has long been a neglected clinical entity, current HF guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) include a section on weight management in patients with HF at risk of cardiac cachexia. This article highlights some recent studies of metabolic and functional alterations of the muscle in HF that were presented at the annual meeting of the ESC in August 2012 in Munich, Germany. The studies presented were focused on dysfunction of respiratory and limb skeletal musculature as well as metabolic features of myocardium in HF. Strategies improving muscle function and peak oxygen consumption in HF such as (inspiratory) muscle training and treatment of central sleep apnea by adaptive servoventilation are described. The latter shows promising results regarding HF symptoms and exercise capacity but still has to prove survival benefits in larger trials. A rat model highlights the value of microRNAs to regulate exercise-induced skeletal muscle angiogenesis. Another study provides evidence for changes in substrate utilisation depending on the functional status of mitochondria in the failing heart and points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mediator of metabolic remodelling.

Since a considerable number of patients with chest pain, however, have a non cardiac etiology of their pain, properly triaging these patients represents a diagnostic challenge for physicians in the emergency department. As the available diagnostic procedures have limited accuracy, many different diagnostic strategies have been evaluated. Among these, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) at rest or in combination with stress procedures has been investigated in many trials. MPI has been proven to be useful, especially in a patient population with a low to intermediate probability of an ischemic event. Perfusion scintigraphy has a high sensitivity in the detection of myocardial infarction and reveals an excellent negative predictive value, allowing a safe discharge strategy of patients with a negative scan result. Moreover, it enables risk stratification and provides incremental and independent prognostic information regarding short to long term future cardiac adverse events. Several cost effectiveness studies have shown that perfusion imaging leads to lower overall direct costs, mainly by a reduction of unnecessary hospital admissions and diagnostic angiograms, without worsening of the clinical outcome of these patients. As a possible study endpoint, myocardial perfusion imaging in the acute setting enables the quantification of salvaged myocardium and therefore the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Besides perfusion agents, several infarct avid radiopharmaceuticals have been developed, which in part show promising results.

Recently, a specific cutoff for 0/3h high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) change (7 ng/L) was proposed, warranting external validation. Patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department were prospectively enrolled into an international multicenter diagnostic study. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists applying the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, on the basis of complete cardiac workup, cardiac imaging, and serial hs-cTnT. Hs-cTnT concentrations were measured at presentation, after 1 hour, and after 3 hours. The objective was to externally validate the proposed cutoff, and if necessary, derive and internally as well as externally validate novel 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm in an independent multicenter cohort. Among 2076 eligible patients, application of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm triaged 1512 patients (72.8%) to either rule out or rule in NSTEMI, leaving 564 patients (27.2%) in the observe-zone (adjudicated NSTEMI prevalence, 120/564 patients, 21.3%). The suggested 0/3h-hs-cTnT-change of <7 ng/L triaged 517 patients (91.7%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 33.3% (95% CI, 25.5-42.2), missing 80 patients with NSTEMI, and ≥7 ng/L triaged 47 patients toward rule-in (8.3%), resulting in a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8-99.2). Novel derived 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone patients ruled out NSTEMI with a 3h hs-cTnT concentration <15 ng/L and a 0/3h-hs-cTnT absolute change <4 ng/L, triaging 138 patients (25%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 99.2% (95% CI, 96.0-99.9), missing 1 patient with NSTEMI. A 0/3h-hs-cTnT absolute change ≥6 ng/L triaged 63 patients (11.2%) toward rule-in, resulting in a specificity of 98% (95% CI, 96.2-98.9) Thereby, the novel 0/3h-criteria reduced the number of patients in the observe zone by 36%s and the number of type 1 myocardial infarction by 50%. Findings were confirmed in both internal and external validation. A combination of a 3h-hs-cTnT concentration (<15 ng/L) and a 0/3h absolute change (<4 ng/L) is necessary to safely rule out NSTEMI in patients remaining in the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm.

In patients with angiographic evidence of CAD, the presence of major depressive disorder was the best single predictor of cardiac events during the 12 months following diagnosis. Significantly, 6-month cumulative mortality following diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been shown to be higher in depressed patients than in nondepressed patients. A decrease in heart rate variability may mediate the deleterious effect of depression on post-myocardial infarction prognosis. Other factors such as mental stress and altered platelet function may also predispose depressed patients to a heightened risk of cardiac events.

We analyzed data from UK Biobank, which enrolled participants between 2006 and 2010 with follow-up through March 2019. We excluded persons with systolic hypertension or baseline CVD. We defined incident CVD as a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. We used Cox regression to quantify associations between IDH and CVD, as well as the individual outcomes included in the composite outcome. We studied 151 831 participants with normal systolic blood pressure (mean age 54 years, 40% male). Overall, 24.5% had IDH by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition compared with 6% by the ESC/NICE definition. Compared with normal diastolic blood pressure, IDH by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition was not significantly associated with CVD risk (hazard ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.18]) whereas IDH by the ESC/NICE definition was significantly associated with a modest increase in CVD (hazard ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.04-1.29]). Similar results were found by sex and among participants not taking baseline antihypertensives. Furthermore, neither IDH definition was associated with the individual outcomes of nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. In conclusion, the proportion of UK Biobank participants with IDH was significantly higher by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition compared with the ESC/NICE definitions; however, only the ESC/NICE definition was statistically associated with increased CVD risk.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32713275/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

ESC 2012 and ACCF/AHA 2013 guidelines on the management of STEMI were systematically reviewed for consistency. Recommendations were matched, directly compared in terms of class of recommendation and level of evidence, and classified as \"identical\", \"overlapping\", or \"different\". Out of 32 recommendations compared, 26 recommendations (81%) were classified as identical or overlapping, and six recommendations (19%) were classified as different. Most diverging recommendations were related to minor differences in class of recommendation between the two documents. This applies to recommendations for reperfusion therapy >12 hours after symptom onset, immediate transfer of all patients after fibrinolytic therapy, rescue PCI for patients with failed fibrinolysis, and intra-aortic balloon pump use in patients with cardiogenic shock. More substantial differences were observed with respect to the type of P2Y12 inhibitor and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The majority of recommendations for the management of STEMI according to ESC and ACCF/AHA guidelines were identical or overlapping. Differences were explained by gaps in available evidence, in which case expert consensus differed between European and American guidelines due to divergence in interpretation, perception, and culture of medical practice. Systematic comparisons of European and American guidelines are valuable and indicate that interpretation of available evidence leads to agreement in the vast majority of topics.

These studies provide important prognostic data and are proving to be of value in evaluating patients with cardiogenic shock. Neither the thallium-201 myocardial perfusion image nor the gated cardiac blood pool scan can distinguish between acute and chronic myocardial damage. In clinical situations where this is important, infarct avid imaging with technetium-99m pyrophosphate allows determination of whether a given perfusion defect or wall motion abnormality is acute. Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 at rest and after exercise is also proving to be of value in evaluating patients with suspected ischemic heart disease.

The advances in imaging are the result of those of microprocessors which enable three-dimensional reconstruction of ultrasonic, radiological or magnetic resonance images. This provides intracardiac or intravascular views which are very similar to those seen by the surgeon. This is a major tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. Similarly, the introduction of programmes of tissue recognition enables fine ultrasonic analysis of the vascular wall and of endothelial function leading to the opening of a new chapter of preventive vascular medicine from the earliest age. Paediatric interventional cardiology has also progressed rapidly and the past year has been that of a consensus on the closure of a great number of atrial septal defects by new prostheses implanted and anchored in a simpler and safer manner. Prenatal diagnosis has become a crucial factor in the treatment and prognosis of congenital heart disease which is life-threatening in the first hours of life, explaining the benefit when this is applied to transposition of the great vessels or to coarctation of the aorta. Finally, advances in genetics have led to the identification of several genes of heart malformations and the correlations between interstitial microdeletions and syndromes often associated with heart disease: chromosome 22q11 and the Di George syndrome, chromosome 7q and the Williams syndrome.

With the completion of a number of trials using bone marrow (BM)-derived adult stem cells, critical examination of the overall clinical benefits, limitations and potential side effects of this revolutionary treatment will pave the way for future clinical research. At present, clinical trials have been conducted almost exclusively using BM stem cells. The primary endpoints of these trials are mainly safety and feasibility, with secondary endpoints in the efficacy of post-myocardial infarction (MI) cardiac repair. Intervention with BM-derived cells was mainly carried out by endogenously-mobilised BM cells with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and more frequently, by intracoronary infusion or direct intramyocardial injection of autologous BM cells. While these studies have been proven safe and feasible without notable side effects, mixed outcomes in terms of clinical benefits have been reported. The major clinical benefits observed are improved cardiac contractile function and suppressed left ventricular negative remodelling, including reduced infarct size and improved cardiac perfusion of infarct zone. Moderate and transient clinical benefits have been mostly observed in studies with intracoronary infusion or direct intramyocardial injection of BM cells. These effects are widely considered to be indirect effects of implanted cells in association with paracrine factors, cell fusion, passive ventricular remodelling, or the responses of endogenous cardiac stem cells. In contrast, evidence of cardiac regeneration characterised by differentiation of implanted stem cells into cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell lineages, is weak or lacking. To elucidate a clear risk-benefit of this exciting therapy, future studies on the mechanisms of cardiac cell therapy will need to focus on confirming the ideal cell types in relation to dosage and timing for post-MI cardiac repair, developing more effective cell delivery techniques, and devising innovative cell tracking modalities that could unveil the fates of implanted cells such as survival, engraftment and functionality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19907881/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

Their manifold interrelations may be best analysed within a biopsychosocial model of disease. A systematic research was done on empirical studies published during the last 15 years and dealing with epidemiological, etiopathogenetic and therapeutic dimensions of the comorbidity of depression, anxiety and heart disease. From an epidemiological perspective recurrent depressions are associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease. Depressive disorders play a major role in triggering critical cardiac events, e.g. myocardial infarction. The prevalence rates of depressive disorders in various cardiological conditions are significantly higher than the frequencies that can be expected in healthy general population. Depression shows a negative impact on the somatic morbidity and mortality during the further course of illness. Anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders seem to be interrelated with cardiological conditions in quite a similar way, probably contributing even more negatively to critical and lethal cardiological events than depression. From an etiopathogenetic perspective some clusters of depressive symptoms seem to be linked to cardiotoxicity more closely than other, vital exhaustion, anhedonia, and hopelessness probably mediating a special risk. In any case, postmyocardial infarct depression that proves treatment-resistent indicates a negative prognosis of the prevailing cardiological condition. On a level of psychological and psychosocial constructs type-A personality, anger/hostility, type-D personality, and alexithymia have been explored regarding its proper pathogenetic role. Psychological and psychopathological variables have to be set into a context of psychosocial stressors on the one hand, and have to be simultaneously analysed with various underlying psycho- and neurobiological variables on the other. Above all, HPA- and sympathicomedullary dysfunctions, reduced heart rate variability, altered functions of thrombocytes, and increased proinflammatory processes have to be recognized as significantly contributing to the pathophysiology both of depression and of heart condition. Neurobiological aspects of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders must be interlinked with these underpinnings of depression. Differential effects on critical cardiological events must be supposed. From a therapeutic perspective several RCTs demonstrate that SSRIs may safely and efficiently treat depressive disorders in cardiological conditions, and may even improve the general somatic prognosis. Cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies have been empirically validated in treating depression and anxiety with cardiological patients. So far, however, a differential indication of psychopharmacological versus psychotherapeutic approaches has not been proved yet. Depression and anxiety disorders in patients with heart disease paradigmatically define a psychosomatic-somatopsychic challenge to any health delivery system. A psychosomatic perspective may best be practised within a Consultation-Liaison psychiatric service that cooperates continuously and closely with cardiological departments and experts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22075746/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

In particular, attention has been refocused on earlier reperfusion efforts with streptokinase. The effect of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function and early mortality was studied in subsets of patients in a randomized trial (Netherlands Interuniversity Cardiology Institute). Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hours after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Of the patients eligible for this detailed analysis, 245 were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiography was preformed in 212 of the 245 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 versus 1,179 U/liter in control subjects, p = 0.0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% versus 43% in control subjects, p = 0.0001). Twelve month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (8% versus 16% in the control group, p less than 0.01). In multivariate regression analysis infarct size limitation, improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction and 3 month mortality were predicted by sigma ST, time from onset of symptoms to admission and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most useful in patients admitted within 2 hours after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sigma ST segment of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with sigma ST less than 1.2 mV, admitted 2 to 4 hours after onset of symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3108346/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

We outline a \"chessboard of healing,\" involving the possibility-spaces for dealing constructively with bodily breakdown. This set of strategies is shown to be nonarbitrary, drawn directly from contemporary work on the phenomenology of the lived body. For example, as we both experience the body as that which 'I am', and as that which 'I have', separable from the self, patients can react to illness by moving towards their bodies in modes of listening and befriending, or away from their body, ignoring or detaching themselves from symptoms.

{"id": "11518189", "title": "Delayed preconditioning of myocardium: current perspectives.", "text": "The protection conferred by ischemic preconditioning (PC) of myocardium occurs in a bimodal time course. The early cardioprotection wanes rapidly and is succeeded by a delayed phase of protection. This \"second window\" lasts for up to 72 hours, depending on species and end-point. A widely adopted paradigm for delayed PC is the following: 1) freely diffusible molecules or radicals, generated during the PC period, act in autocrine and/or paracrine manner as triggers of cellular adaptation; 2) they cause the activation of a protein kinase signal cascade; 3) the activated kinases phosphorylate important substrate proteins. In the case of delayed PC, it is thought that the phosphorylation of transcription factors, initiating the synthesis of late appearing effector proteins that promote cell survival during subsequent ischemia, may be a crucial event. Investigation of the proximal components of this sequence has altered our perceptions of several biological mediators, previously thought to be short acting, including adenosine, NO, free radicals and bradykinin. Signal transduction components include protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases and various mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases but their patterns of regulation are complex and as yet poorly defined. Gene expression is modified in a regulated fashion to induce new proteins that promote cell repair and to protect against subsequent ischemia-reperfusion insult. It is likely that the complex nature of the preconditioning stimulus causes the activation of a variety of transcription factors, regulating a large number of target genes. So far, attention has focussed on a small number of protein products as potential distal mediators of delayed preconditioning. These include the heat shock proteins, manganese superoxide dismutase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and cyclo-oxygenase-2.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11518189/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

Importantly, preclinical studies demonstrate that progressive microcirculatory failure (the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon) contributes significantly to myocardial reperfusion injury. Diagnostic techniques to measure tissue perfusion have validated this concept in humans, and it is now clear that abnormal tissue perfusion occurs frequently in STEMI patients undergoing reperfusion therapy. Moreover, because tissue perfusion correlates poorly with epicardial blood flow (TIMI flow grade), clinical studies show that tissue perfusion is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in STEMI patients and is associated with infarct size, ventricular function, CHF and ventricular arrhythmias. The mechanisms responsible for abnormal tissue perfusion are multifactorial and include both mechanical obstruction and vasoconstrictor humoral factors. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside, maintains microcirculatory flow following reperfusion by activating four well-characterized extracellular receptors. Because activation of adenosine receptors attenuates the mechanical and functional mechanisms leading to the \"no reflow\" phenomenon and activates other cardioprotective pathways as well, it is not surprising that both experimental and clinical studies show striking myocardial salvage with intravenous infusions of adenosine administered in the peri-reperfusion period. For example, a post hoc analysis of the AMISTAD II trial indicates a significant reduction in 1 and 6-month mortality in STEMI patients undergoing reperfusion therapy who are treated with adenosine within 3 hours of symptoms. In conclusion, adenosine's numerous cardioprotective effects, including attenuation of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon, support its use in high risk STEMI undergoing reperfusion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18000974/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

This article contains an overview of the most notable developments reported in recent months. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have provided one of the major advances in interventional cardiology as they have very effectively reduced the restenosis rate. Both randomized clinical trials and large observational studies have confirmed their safety, and their use has been extended to include highly complex conditions. Although thrombosis is one complication that can affect both conventional stents and DESs, the rate of late stent thrombosis is slightly, though significantly, higher with DESs. Primary angioplasty is the treatment of choice for patients with acute myocardial infarction if carried out under appropriate conditions, within a reasonable time period in a specialized center by experienced personnel. Use of thrombectomy devices can improve procedural outcomes and it appears that DES implantation is safe and effective, though more data are still needed. In patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, early treatment using an invasive approach coupled to the administration of various combinations of antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs continues to be fundamental. Although left main coronary artery lesions are generally treated surgically, advances in percutaneous techniques and the use of DESs mean that an increasing number of patients are being treated using percutaneous coronary interventions. A number of studies have shown good results in other lesions and in high-risk patients with, for example, bifurcation lesions, chronic occlusions or diabetes. Intracoronary ultrasound is the predominant intracoronary diagnostic technique and it can be used to assist in optimizing DES implantation. In addition, measurement of the fractional flow reserve is helpful in evaluating the severity of moderate lesions whereas the high-resolution images provided by optical coherence tomography are particularly informative. Multislice computed tomography enables the presence of coronary artery disease to be ruled out and the technique is also useful as a complementary tool for interventional cardiologists. Research into regenerative techniques is promising but remains experimental at present. With regard to noncoronary interventions, new data have become available that support the use of a percutaneous approach in patients with patent foramen ovale. In addition, clinical experience with percutaneous aortic valve replacement, via either the transfemoral or transapical route, is increasing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19174054/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

This is a planned secondary analysis of the Use of TROPonin In Acute coronary syndromes (UTROPIA, NCT02060760) observational cohort study. Appropriateness of cTn testing was adjudicated for emergency department patients with cTn increases >99<sup>th</sup> percentile and analyzed using both contemporary and high-sensitivity (hs) cTnI assays according to sub-specialty, diagnoses, and symptoms. Appropriateness was determined from 1272 and 1078 adjudication forms completed for 497 and 422 patients with contemporary and hs-cTnI increases, respectively. Appropriateness of cTnI testing across adjudication forms was 71.5% and 72.0% for cTnI and hs-cTnI, respectively. Compared with emergency physicians, cardiologists were less likely to classify cTnI orders as appropriate (cTnI: 79% vs 56%, P < .0001; hs-cTnI: 82% vs 51%, P < .0001). For contemporary cTnI, appropriateness of 95%, 70%, and 39% was observed among adjudication forms completed by cardiologists for type 1 myocardial infarction, type 2 myocardial infarction, and myocardial injury, respectively; compared with 90%, 86%, and 71%, respectively, among emergency physicians. Similar findings were observed using hs-cTnI. Discordance in appropriateness adjudication forms occurred most frequently in cases of myocardial injury (62% both assays) or type 2 myocardial infarction (cTnI 31%; hs-cTnI 23%). Marked differences exist in the perception of what constitutes appropriate clinical use of cTn testing between cardiologists and emergency physicians, with emergency physicians more likely to see testing as appropriate across a range of clinical scenarios.

{"id": "3046624", "title": "The case for treating hypertension in the elderly.", "text": "Not so long ago it was fashionable to ignore a little bit of hypertension in an elderly person. The rationalizations for this position included the limited epidemiological data establishing the risk of elevated blood pressure in the age group over 65, particularly for women; and concern that lowering the blood pressure might not be desirable, from the standpoint of reduced blood flow to vital organs. There was also concern over the known greater responsiveness or sensitivity of older people to customary doses. It was also argued by some that even if the blood pressure could be safely controlled it was hardly worth it, since age itself is the most powerful predictor of mortality in the elderly. Moreover, it seemed unlikely to many that the risk of hypertension could be reduced--that is, that life expectancy could be extended; at the same time it seemed fairly certain that the quality of life would be compromised by therapy. However, since systolic blood pressure continues to be predictive of coronary heart disease mortality well into the ninth decade, and since considerable life expectancy remains for those who have survived to their senior years, it seems logical to attempt to reduce the risk and preserve life expectancy by controlling blood pressure. The question is, is the evidence that treatment helps really convincing, or are we simply extrapolating from studies carried out in younger subjects? Review of the early literature, which focused almost exclusively on stroke survivors and the influence of hypertension on stroke recurrence, provides inconsistent, conflicting, and not persuasive information.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3046624/", "source_file": "pubmed_cardiology.jsonl"}

The 2002 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of unstable angina and non ST-segment myocardial infarction and the 2004 guidelines for ST-segment myocardial infarction assign priority to the long-term administration of four critical classes of drugs: antiplatelet agents, in particular aspirin and clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. Despite clinical trial evidence demonstrating their ability to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, available preventive pharmacotherapies remain underutilized. Suboptimal compliance with current recommendations, as with other management guidelines, arises from a host of entrenched physician, patient, and system-related factors. Optimal management of acute coronary syndrome acknowledges a continuum of care in which acute stabilization represents a single important component.

The present update to the 2011 and 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society APT guidelines incorporates new evidence on how to optimize APT use, particularly in situations in which few to no data were previously available. The recommendations update focuses on the following primary topics: (1) the duration of dual APT (DAPT) in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome and non-acute coronary syndrome indications; (2) management of DAPT in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery; (3) management of DAPT in patients who undergo elective and semiurgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; (4) when and how to switch between different oral antiplatelet therapies; and (5) management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients who undergo PCI. For PCI patients, we specifically analyze the particular considerations in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical or bioprosthetic valves (including transcatheter aortic valve replacement), venous thromboembolic disease, and established left ventricular thrombus or possible left ventricular thrombus with reduced ejection fraction after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Comprehensive prevention of CAD requires manipulation of genetic risk. The availability of microarrays of single-nucleotide polymorphisms enabling genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to the discovery of 33 genetic risk variants for CAD. Surprisingly, 23 risk variants mediate their risk through unknown mechanisms, with only 10 associating with hypertension or lipids. Thus, there are several mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of CAD yet to be elucidated. The first risk variant discovered by GWAS was 9p21.3, which occurs in 75% of all populations except African, with a mean increased risk of 25% per copy. Of the 33 variants for CAD, the increased risk varies from 6% to 92% with a mean increased risk of 18%, occurring on average in 47% of the population. The maximum number of risk alleles per individual would be 66. In the CARDIoGRAM (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta Analysis) study of 23 variants, the average per individual was 17, the minimum 7, and the maximum 37. The top 10th percentile has an odds ratio of 1.88 and the lowest percentile an odds ratio of 0.55. Routine genetic screening is unlikely until management is improved by genetic testing.

There are no data regarding the subpopulation of patients who may benefit from such support besides patients with mechanical complications of myocardial infarction. Prospective nationwide registry data of patients with myocardial infarction and CS treated with PCI between 2003 and 2014 were analyzed.

A total of 1120 ECGs from patients with acute myocardial infarction and 10,452 control ECGs, recorded at an emergency department with computerized ECGs, were studied. Artificial neural networks were trained to detect acute myocardial infarction by use of measurements from the 12 ST-T segments of each ECG, together with the correct diagnosis.

In addition, scientifically interesting hypotheses have been generated through the results of epidemiological studies. Properly conducted randomized studies without systematic errors and with statistical power adequate for demonstrating moderate and reasonable benefits in relevant clinical outcomes have provided reliable and strong results altering clinical practice, thus providing adequate treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The dissemination and use of evidence-based medicine in treating coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and in prevention will prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths annually in developed and developing countries. CVD is responsible for approximately 12 million deaths annually throughout the world, and approximately 60% of these deaths occur in developing countries. During recent years, an increase in mortality and morbidity rates due to CVD has occurred in developing countries. This increase is an indication that an epidemiological (demographic, economical, and health-related) transition is taking place in developing countries and this transition implies a global epidemic of CVD, which will require wide-ranging and globally effective strategies for prevention. The identification of conventional and emerging risk factors for CVD, as well as their management in high-risk individuals, has contributed to the decrease in the mortality rate due to CVD.

A decade later Marchionini and several coworkers published 5 scientific communications in the Klinische Wochenschrift on \"Der Säuremantel der Haut und Bakterienabwehr\" (acid mantle and defense against bacteria). They described experimental detail, documented age- and body site as well as skin disease-dependent skin pH shifts, and discussed the significance of the pH and bacterial growth on the skin. In their fourth and fifth communication, they made the first connection between the altered quantitative and qualitative bacterial growth in pathologically modified skin and the shifted skin pH and attributed it partly to the gap in the acid mantle (pathologische Lücke des Säuremantels). They also investigated the pH of several topical dermatologic preparations and concluded that their benefit can at least partly be attributed to their acid character and recommended the systematic investigation of acid treatments in dermatology. At that time, the physiologic role of the acid skin surface was thought to be a protective mechanism against invading organisms. Hence, it seemed reasonable to allocate protection to an easy and conceivable term such as \"mantle.\" Today, \"acid mantle\" as a term is still a very suitable metaphor to illustrate the protective quality of the \"acid\" in the skin and the term has become part of colloquial speech. In the meantime, our understanding of the skin pH has broadened, and we know that the acid character and its gradual change within the skin also help to orchestrate epidermal differentiation and corneocyte shedding. For many more biochemical processes within the skin, the compartmental pH is crucial, for example, in pigmentation, ion homeostasis, epidermal (stem) cell behavior, and so on. The often existing difference between the H+ concentration of extra- and intracellular as well as subcellular compartments establishes an ionic, electric, and/or osmotic driving force; hence, H+ concentration per se acts as an extra-, intra,- and subcellular signaling modality affecting and controlling many cellular functions. One may even consider pH a universal signal and effector. It is therefore also no surprise that skin pH shifts have been observed in various skin pathologies. More recently, in carefully controlled trials (acne, atopic dermatitis, incontinence-associated dermatitis, aged skin), the benefits of targeted skin acidification have become evident and the use of topical preparations with reduced pH may be recommended. The currently prevailing formulation concepts for direct acidification are based on a reduced pH of the hydrophilic product phase in combination with a buffer with a sufficiently high buffering capacity within the vehicle.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125885/", "source_file": "pubmed_derm.jsonl"}

Further, clinical trials struggle to keep participants engaged in the study and as many as 40% drop out. To overcome these challenges pharmaceutical companies and research institutions (e.g., universities) increasingly use an emerging concept: virtual clinical trials (VCT) based on a remote approach. VCT (site-less) are a relatively new method of conducting a clinical trial, taking full advantage of technology (apps, monitoring devices, etc.) and inclusion of web platforms (recruitment, informed consent, counselling, measurement of endpoints, and any adverse reactions) to allow the patient to be home-based at every stage of the clinical trial. Studies have shown that VCT are not only operationally feasible, but also successful. They have higher recruitment rates, better compliance, lower drop-out rates, and are conducted faster than traditional clinical trials. The visual nature of dermatological conditions, the relative ease in evaluating skin diseases virtually, and the fact that skin diseases often are not life-threatening and rarely require complex examinations make VCT very attractive for dermatological research. Further, making correct diagnoses based on photographs and patient symptomatology has always been part of the dermatologist's routine. Thus, VCT are in many ways made for dermatology.

Radiation is being used less extensively because superior methods of treatment are available for many conditions which formerly were frequently treated by this modality. The concept of applying the radiation at the level of the basic pathologic process has been developed into clinical practice by the use of generators which can produce very soft (or superficial) ionizing radiation. Topical or systemic corticosteroids do not cure skin diseases but produce dramatic suppression of signs and symptoms. For best results consideration must be given to the diagnosis, the natural history of the disease to be treated, the method of administration and a search for possible contraindications to the use of these steroids. Basic dermatological principles (removal of offending agents, bland soothing applications, sedation, etc.) must be adhered to.

Inflammaging is thought to contribute to many age-related chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and even certain cancers. Recent studies suggest that the human microbiome may play a critical role in inflammaging. As the largest organ of the body and home to a significant portion of the human microbiome, the skin may play a unique role in inflammaging. In this review article, we present common dermatological diseases through the lens of inflammaging, look at how our skin may play a role in reducing inflammaging, and highlight the need for further focused research in this area.

Basal level autophagy plays an important role in cellular homeostasis through the elimination of the old or damaged organelles, as well as aggregated intracellular proteins. Autophagy refers to sequestration of intact organelles along with a portion of cytosol, into a double-or multi-membrane structure known as phagophore, which elongates, and after closure, forms a vesicular structure known as the autophagosome. Subsequently, the mature autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, thereby forming a single membrane structure, an autolysosome. Autophagy plays a critical role in inflammation, autoimmunity and cellular differentiation. Skin serves as the first line of defense against a variety of environmental insults and autophagy is thought to be a form of an endogenous defense mechanism against such environmental derangements. Autophagy has been linked with keratinocyte differentiation and melanocyte survival, as well as with the pathogenesis of diverse skin disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, vitiligo, infectious skin diseases and cancer. Autophagy has been one of the most studied phenomena in cell biology and pathophysiology, and given its broad clinical implications, has become a major target for drug discovery. The last decade has seen a substantial upsurge in autophagy-related research and publications; still, the dermatology literature appears to be less initiated. Autophagy will probably change our understanding of dermatological disorders/medicines.

In addition to occlusives and humectants, barrier restoring ingredients such as ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide were considered beneficial. Equally important was the absence of potentially irritating substances. The use of OTC products can improve rosacea symptomatology and signs. As adjuncts, these products are recommended before and during prescription therapy and as part of a maintenance regimen.

After a brief history of topical drug delivery, a review of the structure and function of the skin and routes of drug absorption and their limitations is provided. The most prevalent diseases and current topical treatment approaches are then detailed, the organization of which reflects the key disease categories of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, microbial infections, skin cancers, and genetic skin diseases. The complexity of topical product development through to large-scale manufacturing along with recommended risk mitigation approaches are then highlighted. As such topical treatments are applied externally, patient preferences along with the challenges they invoke are then described, and finally the future of this field of drug delivery is discussed, with an emphasis on areas that are more likely to yield significant improvements over the topical medicines in current use or would expand the range of medicines and diseases treatable by this route of administration. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review of the key aspects of the skin and its associated diseases and current treatments along with the intricacies of topical formulation development should be helpful in making judicious decisions about the development of new or improved topical medicines. These aspects include the choices of the active ingredients, formulations, the target patient population's preferences, limitations, and the future with regard to new skin diseases and topical medicine approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914467/", "source_file": "pubmed_derm.jsonl"}

Although the risk of severe infections with psoriatic treatments is well established, little is known about cutaneous infections. Therefore, we studied the frequency of cutaneous infections in patients with psoriasis who underwent biologic treatment. A total of 878 patients (237 females and 641 males) were analyzed in this follow-up survey conducted in 2020 and based on the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry. The observed skin phenotypes were psoriasis vulgaris (83.3%), pustular psoriasis (7.5%), and psoriatic arthritis (28.9%). The most frequently prescribed systemic drug was apremilast (11.3%), followed by ixekizumab (11.0%), risankizumab (10.9%), and secukinumab (10.4%). The incidence of cutaneous bacterial infections was 12 (1.37% of the total patients), with cellulitis being the most common (8/12, 67%). The incidence of viral infections was 11 (1.25%) including the most common, herpes zoster (9/11, 82%); and that of fungal infections was 45 (5.13%) including 33 (73%) and seven (16%) patients with trichophytosis and oral candidiasis, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that cutaneous bacterial infections were frequently observed in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-α (odds raio [OR] 9.917, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.069-47.572, p = 0.004) and interleukin (IL)-17 (OR 10.798, 95% CI 2.35-49.616, p = 0.002) inhibitor treatments.

To this end, MEDLINE searches from January 1966 through June 2006 and EMBASE searches from January 1974 through June 2006 were conducted. Relevant human efficacy studies, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case-control studies, were selected on the basis of the key words 'compliance,' 'adherence,' 'pharmionics,' 'topical,' 'medication,' or 'dermatology.' Studies were included and reviewed on the basis of their experimental design, controls, and statistical analysis. Analysis revealed that suboptimal adherence to topical medications is a common cause of minimal response or lack of response to drugs and is linked with poor dermatologic outcomes in diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and acne. It is concluded that non-adherence to topical medications is as common as non-adherence to oral medications, and its relationship to poor health outcomes is clear. Several barriers to topical medication adherence and predictors of non-adherence are similar to those for oral medications, while other barriers and predictors are unique to topical medications and the nature of dermatologic disease.

Systematic review of 125 randomized controlled trials identified from the Archives of Dermatology, British Journal of Dermatology, Clinical & Experimental Dermatology, Journal of Dermatological Treatment and Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology published between 1994 and 2001 (25 from each). Studies were retrieved in hard copy from the Cochrane Skin Group specialized register of trials and data were abstracted and summarized. Participant efficacy outcomes were mentioned in some form in only 32 of 125 trials (25.6%, 95% exact confidence interval 18.2-34.2%).

The pathogen to be treated can be identified sometimes by the clinical symptoms (e.g. in classical erysipelas) or by microbiological analysis. The latter requires adequate sampling methods. Due to the demographic development, which entails age-related multimorbidity and polypharmacy, criteria for the selection of the correct antibiotic not only encompass the pathogen spectrum and the tissue penetration of the drug, but also the risks for adverse events and unwanted interactions with other drugs. In this review article the mode of action, mechanisms of resistance, pharmacokinetics, adverse events, and drug interactions of the dermatologically important antibiotics are summarized, as are some relevant indications for their appropriate use in dermatology. For most bacterial skin and soft tissue infections beta-lactam antibiotics represent the first line therapy. They are efficacious, their adverse events are well known and defined, and they are mostly cost-effective. Penicillins G and V are recommended for classical erysipelas (caused by hemolytic streptococci). For uncomplicated soft tissue infections originating from wounds, which are mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus, the first line therapy are cephalosporins group 1 and 2, or isoxazoyl penicillins. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is indicated only for complicated soft tissue infections when a different spectrum of bacterial pathogens is suspected or when (multi-) resistant bacteria are supposed to be the causative organism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549482/", "source_file": "pubmed_derm.jsonl"}

The porphyrin precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or its methyl ester (MAL, so far the only approved formulation in Europe) is applied topically as photosensitizer to exclude systemic reactions. Possible light sources include lasers as well as incoherent light sources; irradiation with incoherent light sources is cheaper and more appropriate for large treatment areas.

Probiotics are - like microflora of the skin - non-pathogenic microbes, which do not induce inflammatory responses in the skin. Common pathways for probiotics, non-pathogenic microbes, and microflora are characterized, in order to facilitate their more effective therapeutic use. These microbes display a majority of their effects directly at the site of application and thereby induce natural defense mechanisms. However, promotion of immunological tolerance is just as important in producing positive effects. Tolerance of the resident flora on surface organs developed during evolution and the mechanisms of action are multifaceted. Therefore, the topical application of probiotics and non-pathogenic microbes for prophylaxis and therapy of overwhelming cutaneous pro-inflammatory immune reactions is very promising.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has been defined as a purely \"functional\" type of renal failure that often occurs in patients with cirrhosis in the setting of marked abnormalities in arterial circulation, as well as overactivity of the endogenous vasoactive systems.<sup>4,5</sup> In 2007, the International Club of Ascites (ICA) classified HRS into types 1 and 2 (HRS-1 and HRS-2).<sup>5</sup> HRS-1 is characterised by a rapid deterioration of renal function that often occurs because of a precipitating event, while HRS-2 is a moderate and stable or slowly progressive renal dysfunction that often occurs without an obvious precipitant. Clinically, HRS-1 is characterised by acute renal failure while HRS-2 is mainly characterised by refractory ascites. Nevertheless, after these two entities were first described, new concepts, definitions, and diagnostic criteria have been developed by nephrologists for renal dysfunction in the general population and hospitalised patients. In particular, the definitions and characterisation of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease have been introduced/refined.<sup>6</sup> Accordingly, a debate among hepatologists of the ICA led to a complete revision of the nomenclature and diagnosistic criteria for HRS-1, which was renamed HRS-AKI.<sup>7</sup> Additionally, over recent years, greater granularity has been gained regarding the pathogenesis of HRS; it is now increasingly recognised that it is not a purely \"functional\" entity with haemodynamic derangements, but that systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and bile salt-related tubular damage may contribute significantly to its development. That is, HRS has an additional structural component that would not only make traditional diagnostic criteria less reliable, but would explain the lack of response to pharmacological treatment with vasoconstrictors plus albumin that correlates with a progressive increase in inflammation. Because classification, nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and pathogenic theories have evolved over the years since the traditional classification of HRS-1 and HRS-2 was first described, it was considered that all these novel aspects be reviewed and summarised in a position paper. The aim of this position paper authored by two hepatologists (members of ICA) and two nephrologists involved in the study of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, is to complete the re-classification of HRS initiated by the ICA in 2012 and to provide an update on the definition, classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of HRS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302175/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Under increasing time pressure, physicians rely more on technology than face-to-face time gathering data to make clinical decisions. As a result, they find it more challenging to understand the illness context and fully address patient needs. Patients experience dissatisfaction and a diminution of their role in the care process. For patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, stigma leads to greater care dissatisfaction, as there is no apparent structural basis to legitimize the symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that practical communication skills can improve the patient-provider relationship (PPR) and clinical outcomes, but these data are limited. The Rome Foundation convened a multidisciplinary working team to review the scientific evidence with the following aims: a) to study the effect of communication skills on patient satisfaction and outcomes by performing an evidence-based review; b) to characterize the influence of sociocultural factors, health care system constraints, patient perspective, and telehealth on the PPR; c) to review the measurement and impact of communication skills training on these outcomes; and d) to make recommendations to improve communication skills training and the PPR. Evidence supports the fact that interventions targeting patient-provider interactions improve population health, patient and provider experience, and costs. Communication skills training leads to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes. The following are relevant factors to consider in establishing an effective PPR: addressing health care system constraints; incorporating sociocultural factors and the role of gender, age, and chronic illness; and considering the changing role of telehealth on the PPR. We concluded that effective communication skills can improve the PPR and health outcomes. This is an achievable goal through training and system change.

Data also suggest that simulation training may accelerate the acquisition of specific technical skills in colonoscopy and upper endoscopy early in training. However, the available literature suggests that the benefits of simulator training appear to attenuate and cease after a finite period. Further studies are needed to determine if meeting competency metrics using simulation will predict actual clinical competency. Simulation training is a promising modality that may aid in endoscopic education. However, for widespread incorporation of simulators into gastroenterology training programs to occur, simulators must show a sustained advantage over traditional mentored teaching in a cost-effective manner. Because most studies evaluating simulation have focused on novice learners, the role of simulation training in helping practicing endoscopists gain proficiency using new techniques and devices should be further explored.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31122746/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

The growing burden of MASLD and MASH has led to the publication of a large number of MASLD/MASH guidelines by national and international societies. However, important differences among the recommendations have created confusion, contributing to a low implementation rate and suboptimal management of MASLD and MASH. Creating a consensus recommendation has become more important since the approval of a selective agonist of thyroid hormone β receptor (resmetirom) for MASH treatment in the United States. We built a consensus among the most recently published recommendations for MASLD/MASH. A comprehensive search for MASLD and MASH guidelines, guidance documents, or similar publications from January 2018 to January 2025 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and society websites was conducted. Each selected document was assessed across 8 specific domains with 145 variables. Variables with <50% concordance were used for the Delphi statement development. A supermajority threshold of 67% was set for statement acceptance. There were 61 documents published from 2018 through January 2025. Four rounds of Delphi were conducted: 46 statements were generated for Round 1, 32 statements for Round 2, 16 statements for Round 3, and 8 statements for Round 4, whereby 100% of statements achieved a greater than 90% agreement.

OBJECTIVES Describe the history of pediatric gastroenterology's development in Cuba since its inception at the National Gastroenterology Institute in the early 1970s, its contributions, and efforts to extend it to pediatric hospitals throughout Cuba. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION This is a historical review based on document analysis. Institutional sources from the National Gastroenterology Institute and Ministry of Public Health were reviewed, as well as international and national literature on the history of pediatric gastroenterology and unpublished texts since its emergence in 1972. DEVELOPMENT Although pediatric gastroenterology has not been formally recognized as a medical specialty in Cuba, there have been important achievements in establishing a network of specialized health care services for digestive diseases of children and adolescents. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and other auxiliary diagnostic modalities have been introduced for children and play a major role in clinical trials and research. This article describes the international context that promoted the specialty's development in Cuba. Reference is made to specialized training from its initial stages in 1972, its consolidation as an emerging discipline in Cuban medicine, and its diffusion in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Professional development and specialized training to meet health human resource needs in pediatric hospitals are described, as well as Cuban participation in the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. National and international milestones, publications, awards and recognitions that indicate advances despite difficulties are also presented. CONCLUSIONS Since 1972, there have been major strides in the development of pediatric gastroenterology practice in Cuba. The establishment of a national network of specialized services in pediatric hospitals throughout Cuba has provided quality health care for digestive diseases of childhood. Pediatric gastroenterology's development and achievements in healthcare and research are such that it deserves official recognition as a medical specialty Cuba.

Because patients with chronic diseases account for substantial use of health care resources, payers and health systems are focusing on maximizing the value of care for these patients. Because chronic liver diseases impose a major health burden worldwide affecting the health and lives of many individuals and families as well as substantial costs for individuals and payers, hepatologists must understand how they can improve their practices. Hepatologists practice a high-intensity cognitive subspecialty, using complex and costly procedures and medications. High-value patient care requires multidisciplinary coordination, labor-intensive support for critically ill patients, and effective chronic disease management. Under current fee-for-service reimbursement, patient values, medical success, and financial success can all be misaligned. Many current attempts to link health outcomes to reimbursement are based on compliance with process measures, with less emphasis on outcomes that matter most to patients, thus slowing transformation to higher-value team-based care. Outcome measures that reflect the entire cycle of care are needed to assist both clinicians and administrators in improving the quality and value of care. A comprehensive set of outcome measures for liver diseases is not currently available. Numerous researchers now are attempting to fill this gap by devising and testing outcome indicators and patient-reported outcomes for the major liver conditions.

The topics include a comparison of the risk of recurrent bleeding in patients taking clopidogrel versus aspirin plus a proton pump inhibitor, the introduction of rifaximin for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea, and the results of an oral vaccine for cholera tested in a high endemic area where there is also a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection. In inflammatory bowel disease, the impact of a biomarker of inflammation, C-reactive protein, to the response to a new biologic therapy is identified as potentially important because it might facilitate the selection of patients for these treatments. Results of device, endoscopic, and surgical treatment of obesity are reviewed, including the evidence of significant impact of surgery-induced weight loss on comorbid diseases. In the field of cancer, colonoscopic screening results in more polyps detected, down-staging of cancers identified, and improved cancer survival. A new familial syndrome associated with a serrated adenoma/carcinoma phenotype and variability in microsatellite instability is described. A controlled study demonstrates that a urine-derived substance, ulinastatin, reduces the risk of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis. Hepatic stellate cells are involved in the fibrogenesis associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. These areas of clinical research demonstrate the breadth of significant advances that will impact on the clinical practice of gastroenterology and hepatology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16361039/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Systems biology draws from the chaos and complexity theory and applies computational models to predict emerging behavior of the interactions between genes, gene products, and environmental factors. Adaptation of systems biology to translational and clinical sciences has been termed network medicine, and is likely to change the way we think about preventing, predicting, diagnosing, and treating complex human diseases. Network medicine finds gene-disease associations by analyzing the unparalleled digital information discovered and created by high-throughput technologies (dubbed as \"omics\" science) and links genetic variance to clinical disease phenotypes through intermediate organizational levels of life such as the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. Supported by large reference databases, unprecedented data storage capacity, and innovative computational analysis, network medicine is poised to find links between conditions that were thought to be distinct, uncover shared disease mechanisms and key drivers of the pathogenesis, predict individual disease outcomes and trajectories, identify novel therapeutic applications, and help avoid off-target and undesirable drug effects.

It is important to develop a mechanism for identifying, categorizing, and evaluating the over 100 GI PROs that exist. Here we describe a new, National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported, online PRO clearinghouse-the GI-PRO database. Using a protocol developed by the NIH Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS(®)), we performed a systematic review to identify English-language GI PROs. We abstracted PRO items and developed an online searchable item database. We categorized symptoms into content \"bins\" to evaluate a framework for GI symptom reporting. Finally, we assigned a score for the methodological quality of each PRO represented in the published literature (0-20 range; higher indicates better). We reviewed 15,697 titles (κ>0.6 for title and abstract selection), from which we identified 126 PROs. Review of the PROs revealed eight GI symptom \"bins\": (i) abdominal pain, (ii) bloat/gas, (iii) diarrhea, (iv) constipation, (v) bowel incontinence/soilage, (vi) heartburn/reflux, (vii) swallowing, and (viii) nausea/vomiting. In addition to these symptoms, the PROs covered four psychosocial domains: (i) behaviors, (ii) cognitions, (iii) emotions, and (iv) psychosocial impact. The quality scores were generally low (mean 8.88 ± 4.19; 0 (min)-20 (max). In addition, 51% did not include patient input in developing the PRO, and 41% provided no information on score interpretation. GI PROs cover a wide range of biopsychosocial symptoms. Although plentiful, GI PROs are limited by low methodological quality.

{"id": "30643356", "title": "Endoscopic foregut surgery and interventions: The future is now. The state-of-the-art and my personal journey.", "text": "In this paper, I reviewed the emerging field of endoscopic surgery and present data supporting the contention that endoscopy can now be used to treat many foregut diseases that have been traditionally treated surgically. Within each topic, the content will progress as follows: \"lessons learned\", \"technical considerations\" and \"future opportunities\". Lessons learned will provide a brief background and update on the most current literature. Technical considerations will include my personal experience, including tips and tricks that I have learned over the years. Finally, future opportunities will address current unmet needs and potential new areas of development. The foregut is defined as \"the upper part of the embryonic alimentary canal from which the pharynx, esophagus, lung, stomach, liver, pancreas, and part of the duodenum develop\". Foregut surgery is well established in treating conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), achalasia, esophageal diverticula, Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, gastric-outlet obstruction, and obesity. Over the past decade, remarkable progress in interventional endoscopy has culminated in the conceptualization and practice of endoscopic foregut surgery for various clinical conditions summarized in this paper. Regarding GERD, there are now several technologies available to effectively treat it and potentially eliminate symptoms, and the need for long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors. For the first time, fundoplication can be performed without the need for open or laparoscopic surgery. Long-term data going out 5-10 years are now emerging showing extended durability. In respect to achalasia, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) which was developed in Japan, has become an alternative to the traditional Heller's myotomy. Recent meta-analysis show that POEM may have better results than Heller, but the issue of post-POEM GERD still needs to be addressed. There is now a resurgence of endoscopic treatment of Zenker's diverticula with improved technique (Z-POEM) and equipment; thus, patients are choosing flexible endoscopic treatment as opposed to open or rigid endoscopy options. In regard to BE, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) which is well established in Asia, is now becoming more mainstream in the West for the treatment of BE with high grade dysplasia, as well as early esophageal cancer. In combination with all the ablation technologies (radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, hybrid argon plasma coagulation), the entire spectrum of Barrett's and related dysplasia and early cancer can be managed predominantly by endoscopy. Importantly, in regard to early gastric cancer and submucosal tumors (SMTs) of the stomach, ESD and full thickness resection (FTR) can excise these lesions <i>en-bloc</i> and endoscopic suturing is now used to close large defects and perforations. For treatment of patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), endoscopic gastro-jejunostomy is now showing better results than enteral stenting. G-POEM is also emerging as a treatment option for patients with gastroparesis. Obesity has become an epidemic in many western countries and is becoming also prevalent in Asia. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is now becoming an established treatment option, especially for obese patients with body mass index between 30 and 35. Data show an average weight loss of 16 kg after ESG with long-term data confirming sustainability. Finally, in respect to endo-hepatology, there are many new endoscopic interventions that have been developed for patients with liver disease. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided liver biopsy and EUS-guided portal pressure measurement are exciting new frontiers for the endo-hepatologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643356/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

These evidence-based guidelines, developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology with international collaboration, are the first to specifically address the endoscopic management of these conditions, aiming to support patients, clinicians, and others in making informed decisions. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology formed a guideline panel with a balanced representation to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Cochrane Gut Group supported the guideline-development process, including conducting literature searches and performing systematic reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used, including developing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, which underwent public comment. The panel formulated 19 conditional recommendations for adult patients with nonvariceal, nonpeptic ulcer bleeding due to malignant tumors, MWTs, Dieulafoy's lesions, and gastric antral vascular ectasia. For patients with active bleeding from malignant tumors, the panel suggested topical hemostatic agents over conventional endoscopic hemostatic therapy; it also suggested the administration of oncologic therapy after the endoscopic intervention. In patients with active bleeding from MWTs (oozing and spurting), the panel suggested endoscopic band ligation or endoscopic through-the-scope clip over epinephrine injection alone. For nonbleeding MWTs with visible vessels, adherent clots, flat pigmented spots, or clean-based ulcers, the panel suggested against endoscopic hemostatic therapy. For Dieulafoy's lesions, the panel suggested mechanical modalities with endoscopic band ligation or through-the-scope clip, contact thermocoagulation, or injection of sclerosants over epinephrine injection alone. For patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia, the panel suggested endoscopic band ligation over argon plasma coagulation. This guideline has been formally endorsed by leading international endoscopy societies: the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the Sociedad Interamericana de Endoscopía Digestiva, and the World Endoscopy Organization, as well as by the American Gastroenterological Association.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40778886/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

We sought to create a primer of QI in gastroenterology for the practicing clinician. We performed a systematic review of QI literature in gastroenterology. We included search terms for inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis, liver disease, colorectal cancer screening, endoscopy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We used general search terms for QI as well as specific terms to capture established quality metrics for each GI disease area. We found 33 studies that met our definitions for QI. There were 17 studies of endoscopy including screening colonoscopy, six on liver disease, four on IBD, two on GERD, three on GI bleeding, and one on celiac disease. Education was the most common intervention, although most successful studies combined education with another intervention. Other effective interventions included retraining sessions to reach ADR goals in colonoscopy, nursing protocols to increase HCC screening, and EMR decision support tools to prompt reassessment of PPI therapy. Many studies showed improved compliance to metrics, but few were able to show differences in length of stay, readmissions, or mortality. Our review of quality improvement literature in gastroenterology revealed common themes of successful programs: Education was frequently used but often insufficient, the EMR may be underutilized in guiding decision making, and patient-reported outcomes were infrequently assessed.

The equipment is obsolete and there are no adaptations to the needs of the GI specialist to provide good medical care. Thus, due to all the above, the AU does not hold the position it deserves in our specialty. This probably stems from a lack of impulse and/or support to the technique, which has underestimated its usefulness and has limited the implementation of resources in the GI units.

Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) suffer from a high symptom burden and a deteriorated quality of life (QOL), with uncertain prognosis and limited treatment options. Caregivers of these patients also bear an emotional and physical burden similar to that of caregivers for patients with cancer. Despite the proven benefits of nonhospice PC for other serious illnesses and cancer, there are no evidence-based structures and processes to support its integration within the routine care of patients with ESLD and their caregivers. In this article, we review the current state of PC for ESLD and propose key structures and processes to integrate nonhospice PC within routine hepatology practice. Results found that PC is highly underutilized within ESLD care, and limited prospective studies are available to demonstrate methods to integrate PC within routine hepatology practices. Hepatology providers report lack of training to deliver PC along with no clear prognostic criteria on when to initiate PC. A well-informed model with key structures and processes for nonhospice PC integration would allow hepatology providers to improve clinical outcomes and QOL for patients with ESLD and reduce health care costs. Educating hepatology providers about PC principles and developing clear prognostic criteria for when and how to integrate PC on the basis of individual patient needs are the initial steps to inform the integration.

This study was conducted to reveal the current global research status and trends in GI. Articles published during 2009 to 2018 in international GI journals were retrieved from the PubMed database. The top 20 countries by output were determined. The gross domestic product (GDP) of each country was also retrieved to figure out the correlation between outputs in GI and economy. The 5 highest-ranking countries were compared in the number of total articles, articles per capita, articles published in top journals, the accumulated impact factor (IF), and average IF. Total articles and articles per capita of the 5 countries were conducted time-trend analysis. The frequently-used terms in titles and abstracts of articles published in 2009 and 2018 were retrieved to conduct co-occurrence analysis to figure out the change of research highlights in GI. A total of 120,267 articles were included, of which 116,485 articles were from 20 highest-output countries. There was a positive correlation between output and GDP (r = 0.921, P < .001). The USA, Japan, China, Italy, and the UK were the 5 highest-ranking countries. The USA was the largest contributor with 26,215 articles, accounting for 17.4% of the total, but with no significant increasing trend (P = .122). Other 4 countries all showed increasing trends (all P < .001). For articles per capita, Italy ranked 1st among the 5 countries with 1591.0 articles per 10 million. The USA showed a decreasing trend (P = .026), other 4 countries all showed increasing trends (all P < .001). The UK had the highest average IF (6.685). For change of research highlights, it is more inclined to research of endoscopy, inflammatory bowel diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is delightful that the global research output in GI field would be continuingly increased as the major highest-output countries showed increasing trends. However, the developing countries fell behind both in quantity and quality when compared with developed countries.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33847628/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Despite existing guidelines, real-world data on training conditions remain limited. This pan-European survey aims to systematically explore the perceptions surrounding ERCP training. A survey was distributed through the friends of United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Young Talent Group network to physicians working in a UEG member or associated states who regularly performed ERCPs. Of 1035 respondents from 35 countries, 649 were eligible for analysis: 228 trainees, 225 trainers, and 196 individuals who regularly performed ERCP but were neither trainees nor trainers. The mean age was 43 years, with 72.1% identifying as male, 27.6% as female, and 0.3% as non-binary. The majority (80.1%) agreed that a structured training regimen is desirable. However, only 13.7% of trainees and 28.4% of trainers reported having such a structured program in their institutions. Most respondents (79.7%) supported the concept of concentrating training in centers meeting specific quality metrics, with 64.1% suggesting a threshold of 200 annual ERCPs as a prerequisite. This threshold revealed that 36.4% of trainees pursued training in lower-volume centers performing <200 ERCPs annually. As many as 70.1% of trainees performed <50 annual ERCPs, whereas only 5.0% of trainers performed <50 ERCPs annually. A low individual trainee caseload (<50 ERCPs annually) was more common in lower-volume centers than in higher-volume centers (82.9% vs. 63.4%). The first pan-European survey investigating ERCP training conditions reveals strong support for structured training and the concentration of training efforts within centers meeting specific quality metrics. Furthermore, this survey exposes the low availability of structured training programs with many trainees practicing at lower-volume centers and 71% of all trainees having little hands-on exposure. These data should motivate to standardize ERCP training conditions further and ultimately improve patient care throughout Europe.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39601382/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

{"id": "28044203", "title": "Advances with Neonatal Aerodigestive Science in the Pursuit of Safe Swallowing in Infants: Invited Review.", "text": "Feeding, swallowing, and airway protection are three distinct entities. Feeding involves a process of sequential, neurosensory, and neuromotor interactions of reflexes and behaviors facilitating ingestion. Swallowing involves anterograde bolus movement during oral-, pharyngeal-, and esophageal phases of peristalsis into stomach. During these events, coordination with airway protection is vital for homeostasis in clearing any material away from airway vicinity. Neurological-airway-digestive inter-relationships are critical to the continuum of successful feeding patterns during infancy, either in health or disease. Neonatal feeding difficulties encompass a heterogeneous group of neurological, pulmonary, and aerodigestive disorders that present with multiple signs posing as clinical conundrums. Significant research breakthroughs permitted understanding of vagal neural pathways and functional aerodigestive connectivity involved in regulating swallowing and aerodigestive functions either directly or indirectly by influencing the supra-nuclear regulatory centers and peripheral effector organs. These neurosensory and neuromotor pathways are influenced by pathologies during perinatal events, prematurity, inflammatory states, and coexisting medical and surgical conditions. Approaches to clarify pathophysiologic mapping of aerodigestive interactions, as well as translating these discoveries into the development of personalized and simplified feeding strategies to advance child health are discussed in this review article.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28044203/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

The workshop aimed to provide a roadmap to help strategically guide research efforts during the next decade. Attendees were a diverse group of internationally recognized leaders in basic and clinical FBD research. This document summarizes the results of their deliberations, including the following general conclusions and recommendations. First, the high prevalence, economic burden, and impact on quality of life associated with FBDs necessitate an urgent need for improved understanding of FBDs. Second, preclinical discoveries are at a point that they can be realistically translated into novel diagnostic tests and treatments. Third, FBDs are broadly accepted as bidirectional disorders of the brain-gut axis, differentially affecting individuals throughout life. Research must integrate each component of the brain-gut axis and the influence of biological sex, early-life stressors, and genetic and epigenetic factors in individual patients. Fourth, research priorities to improve diagnostic and management paradigms include enhancement of the provider-patient relationship, longitudinal studies to identify risk and protective factors of FBDs, identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes in symptom severity and treatment response, and incorporation of emerging \"-omics\" discoveries. These paradigms can be applied by well-trained clinicians who are familiar with multimodal treatments. Fifth, essential components of a successful program will include the generation of a large, validated, broadly accessible database that is rigorously phenotyped; a parallel, linkable biorepository; dedicated resources to support peer-reviewed, hypothesis-driven research; access to dedicated bioinformatics expertise; and oversight by funding agencies to review priorities, progress, and potential synergies with relevant stakeholders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29288656/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

The majority of CRC cases diagnosed annually are due to sporadic events, but up to 6% are attributed to known monogenic disorders that confer a markedly increased risk for the development of CRC and multiple extracolonic malignancies. Lynch syndrome is the most common inherited CRC syndrome and is associated with mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, mainly MLH1 and MSH2 but also MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM. Although the risk of CRC and endometrial cancer may approach near 75% and 50%, respectively, in gene mutation carriers, the identification of these individuals and at-risk family members through predictive genetic testing provides opportunities for cancer prevention including specialized cancer screening, intensified surveillance, and/or prophylactic surgeries.

These three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures derived from pluripotent and adult hepatobiliary cells model organ structure and function. Building on gastrointestinal organoid establishment, hepatobiliary organoid cultures were generated from mouse leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5-positive liver progenitor cells. Subsequently, 3D hepatobiliary organoid cultures were developed from hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to model human and animal hepatobiliary health and disease. Hepatocyte organoids have been used to study Alagille syndrome, fatty liver disease, Wilson disease, hepatitis B viral infection, and cystic fibrosis. Cholangiocyte organoids have been established to study normal cholangiocyte biology and primary sclerosing cholangitis and to test organoid potential to form bile ducts and gallbladder tissue in vitro. Hepatobiliary cancer organoids, termed tumoroids, have been established from frozen and fresh human tissues and used as a drug-testing platform and for biobanking of cancer samples. CRISPR-based gene modifications and organoid exposure to infectious agents have permitted the generation of organoid models of carcinogenesis. This review summarizes currently available adult cell-derived hepatobiliary organoid models and their applications.

Swallowing difficulties are classified into oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and esophageal dysphagia. Despite its clinical importance, dysphagia is associated with several uncertainties regarding its optimal diagnostic work-up and management, particularly, considering the progress with diagnostic modalities and technologies. A Delphi consensus was performed with experts from various disciplines who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 41 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus was reached for all the statements. The panel agreed with the definition and prevalence of esophageal and OD types. The role of endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, EndoFLIP, barium swallow and other imaging tests in evaluating esophageal dysphagia has reached overall strong agreement. Videofluoroscopic swallow study, alongside fiber-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, as the methods of choice for the instrumental assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction is a strong recommendation. Regarding treatment, a weak recommendation was achieved for the use of PPIs, calcium-channel blockers, nitrates, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, antidepressants or peppermint oil for the treatment of hypercontractile esophagus. A strong recommendation exists for endoscopic and surgical treatment of achalasia, while a weak recommendation is provided for other esophageal motility disorders. Regarding OD, a weak recommendation was achieved for swallow therapy, to improve swallowing mechanics, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life. Swallow therapy could be more effective when using validated assessment tools, consistent treatment parameters, and considering long-term follow-up.

A multidisciplinary approach for solving gastrointestinal problems.", "text": "While endoscopy used to have more therapeutic abilities than radiology, interventional radiology is now racing to lead the minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in medicine as well as surgery. Expecting the new epidemic of hepatocellular carcinoma, radiologists and gastroenterologists are on the run competing in many procedures that are needed. While some radiologists worry about non-radiologists who \"intervene\" in radiology, many gastroenterologists defend their specialty. Both gastroenterologists and radiologists are invited to collaborate in diagnosing and treating many diseases. Treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeds should be multidisciplinary involving a team of gastroenterologists, radiologists and surgeons. The role of the interventional radiologist and surgeon arises only after the failure of the endoscopic treatment. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is the preferred treatment for variceal bleeding after failed endoscopy. As the entire field of gastroenterology continues towards less invasive, safer and more effective means of diagnosing and treating diseases, digestive endoscopy will continue to expand the ways in which this unique and minimally invasive technology can be applied to the benefit of patients. In line with this trend, there will be a decline in simple diagnostic standard endoscopies. Development of new techniques, such as CT colonography and capsule endoscopy will actually increase the demand for digestive endoscopy. The trend of future digestive endoscopy will continue to move from diagnostic to therapeutic modalities.

As such, any observed phenotypic changes including organ development, aging, and the occurrence of disease could be driven by epigenetic mechanisms in the presence of stable cellular DNA sequences. Indeed, with the exception of rare mutations, the human genome-sequence has remained remarkably stable over the past centuries. In contrast, substantial changes to our environment as part of our modern life style have not only led to a significant reduction of certain infectious diseases but also seen the exponential increase in complex traits including obesity and multifactorial diseases such as autoimmune disorders. It is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms operate at the interface between the genetic code and our environment, and a large body of existing evidence supports the importance of environmental factors such as diet and nutrition, infections, and exposure to toxins on human health. This seems to be particularly the case during vulnerable periods of human development such as pregnancy and early life. Importantly, as the first point of contact for many of such environmental factors including nutrition, the digestive system is being increasingly linked to a number of \"modern\" pathologies.

The 'Mother' of Paediatric Gastroenterology was Australian Charlotte ('Charlo') Anderson who established one of the world's first pediatric gastroenterology units in Melbourne in the early 1960s. Her earlier work in Birmingham had identified gluten as the component of wheat responsible for celiac disease and helped separate maldigestion (cystic fibrosis) and mucosal malabsorption. The first comprehensive textbook of Paediatric Gastroenterology was edited by Charlotte Anderson and Valerie Burke in 1975. Rudge Townley succeeded Charlotte Anderson in Melbourne and went on to further develop small bowel biopsy techniques making it a safe, simple, and quick procedure that led to much greater understanding of small bowel disease and ultimately the discovery of Rotavirus by Ruth Bishop et al. and subsequently to Rotavirus immunization. Australian Paediatric Gastroenterology subsequently developed rapidly with units being established in all mainland capital cities by the end of the 1970s. The Australian Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (AuSPGHAN) was established in the 1980s. Australians have contributed significantly in many areas of gastroenterology in infants, children, and adolescents including celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, liver disease, transplantation, gastrointestinal infection, allergy, indigenous health, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal motility, and the development of novel tests of gastrointestinal function and basic science.

{"id": "22248108", "title": "Future directions in esophageal motility and function - new technology and methodology.", "text": "Symptom based diagnosis is not reliable in patients with swallowing problems, heartburn, and other dyspeptic complaints. The aim of investigation is to provide clinically relevant measurements of gastrointestinal structure and function that explain the cause of symptoms, identify pathology, and guide effective management. Current practice rarely meets these ideals. This review considers recent advances in technology such as high-resolution manometry (HRM) with esophageal pressure topography (EPT), HRM with impedance, high frequency ultrasound, and endoscopic functional luminal impedance planimetry (Endo-FLIP) that provide new opportunities to identify the pathophysiologic basis of esophageal symptoms and disease. As experience with these new devices increases researchers are developing new methodologies that maximize their utility in clinical practice. For example, application of HRM to assess motility and function during and after a test meal can identify the causes of swallowing problems, reflux and other postprandial symptoms and intra-operative application of Endo-FLIP may help surgeons perform antireflux surgery. These examples illustrate the potential of physiologic measurement to direct rational and effective clinical management for individual patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22248108/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Despite overwhelming evidence that ALD-related mortality and healthcare costs are rising, patients with ALD are generally undertreated for AUD. Though multidisciplinary care models integrating addiction medicine, hepatology, and social workers, with established training for health professionals on ALD-related stigma can address this treatment gap, numerous barriers exist, which include a lack of addiction providers, insufficient training in addiction amongst primary care and non-addiction medicine providers, limited knowledge and negative beliefs regarding AUD pharmacotherapy, and negative attitudes of clinicians towards patients with AUD. In this issue of Digestive Disease and Sciences, Jagdish et al. implemented a one-hour educational intervention for gastroenterology fellows at a tertiary academic care center consisting of a formal lecture presentation created in collaboration with an addiction medicine specialist. By sharing their work in increasing confidence in addiction medicine-guided training for gastroenterology fellows and highlighting perceived attitudes of providers charged with caring for this vulnerable patient population, progress can be made for health professional trainees in screening, diagnosis, and initial management of AUD to improve access to multidisciplinary, life-saving care for patients with ALD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40512451/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When we compared studies from China to studies from other countries in subgroup analyses, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19.

Here we present a multimethod formative evaluation (feasibility, knowledge acquisition, self-efficacy, and practice patterns) of PCA:Hep. Feasibility was measured by completion of coursework and achieving a course grade of >80%. Knowledge acquisition was measured through assessments before and throughout the course. Pre/post-course surveys were conducted to determine self-efficacy and practice patterns. The hepatologists (n = 39) enrolled in a 12-week online course and spent 1-3 hours on the course weekly. The course was determined to be feasible as 97% successfully completed the course and 100% passed. The course was acceptable to participants; 91.7 % reported a positive course experience and satisfaction with knowledge gained (91.6%). The pre/post knowledge assessment showed an improvement of 6.0% (pre 85.9% to post 91.9%, 95% CI [2.8, 9.2], P = 0.001). Self-efficacy increased significantly (P < 0.001) in psychological symptom management, hospice, and psychosocial support. A year after training, over 80% of the hepatologists reported integrating a variety of PC skills into routine patient care. Conclusion: PCA:Hep is feasible, acceptable, and improves learner knowledge and confidence in palliative care skills.

The female representation in specialty academic conferences not only reflects the existing gender disparities in that specialty but also can influence young female trainees to join that field. Digestive Disease Week (DDW) is the premier digestive disease event. We aimed to calculate the proportion of female representation among speakers and moderators at the DDW meetings held from 2018 to 2020. The data for DDW 2018-2020 were collected via the online web-based planner. The gender of speakers of presentations and moderators of sessions were identified by a google search. We further categorized the data by each participating society (AGA, ASGE, AASLD, and SSAT), by presentation track, by session track, and total overall representation in each year. Despite the subject of the gender gap being in focus, the proportion of female moderators and speakers was low in DDW in the last 3 years.

The aim of this study was to implement EMC among Gastroenterology (GI) trainees and assess the impact of EMC on competency in manometry interpretation. GI fellows across 14 fellowship programs were invited to complete EMC from February 2018 to October 2018. EMC includes an introductory video, baseline assessment of manometry interpretation, individualized learning pathways, and final assessment of manometry interpretation. The primary outcome was competency for interpretation in 7 individual skill sets. Forty-four GI trainees completed EMC. Participants completed 30 cases, each including 7 skill sets. At baseline, 4 (9%) participants achieved competency for all 7 skills compared with 24 (55%) at final assessment (P < 0.001). Competency in individual skills increased from a median of 4 skills at baseline to 7 at final assessment (P < 0.001). The greatest increase in skill competency was for diagnosis (Baseline: 11% vs Final: 68%; P < 0.001). Accuracy improved for distinguishing between 5 diagnostic groups and was highest for the Outflow obstructive motility disorder (Baseline: 49% vs Final: 76%; P < 0.001) and Normal motor function (50% vs 80%; P < 0.001).

Colonoscopy is recommended when an FOBT performed for colorectal cancer screening is positive. Guidelines suggest no further evaluation if anemia and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are absent. Online surveys included 4 vignettes: positive FOBT in average-risk adults 50 years of age or older with/without iron-deficiency anemia and with/without upper GI symptoms. For each scenario, respondents were asked if they would perform colonoscopy only, EGD only, colonoscopy+EGD on same day, or colonoscopy followed by EGD on different day if colonoscopy was negative. Surveys were returned by 778 (11%) of 7094 potential responders. In patients without anemia or upper GI symptoms, 65% performed colonoscopy only; 35% added EGD (9% same day, 25% different day). EGD was added in 91% with anemia, 96% with symptoms, and 100% with anemia+symptoms. In patients with positive FOBT alone (no symptoms or anemia), multivariate analysis revealed fear of litigation as the primary factor associated with adding EGD to colonoscopy (odds ratio=4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-7.3). When EGD+colonoscopy were planned for positive FOBT, private practice was associated with performing EGD on a different day (odds ratio=6.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-13.5 for private versus academic setting). One third of gastroenterologists perform EGD in addition to colonoscopy for a positive FOBT alone. Fear of litigation is the most important factor in deciding whether to add EGD to colonoscopy.

A questionnaire comprised of clinical vignettes with multiple-choice questions was distributed to both aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive pediatric gastroenterologists. Vignettes focused on management of commonly encountered general gastroenterology and aerodigestive issues, such as gastroesophageal (GE) reflux, aspiration, and feeding difficulties. Tests of equal proportions were used to compare rates of testing and empiric therapy within and across groups. Multivariate analysis was used to assess differences in response rates between aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive providers. A total of 88 pediatric gastroenterologists from 18 institutions completed the questionnaire. There were 35 aerodigestive gastroenterology providers and 53 nonaerodigestive gastroenterology providers. The nonaerodigestive group included 31 general gastroenterologists and 22 providers with self-identified subspecialty gastroenterology expertise. Aerodigestive specialists were more likely than nonaerodigestive gastroenterologists to pursue testing over empiric therapy in cases involving isolated respiratory symptoms (P < .05); aerodigestive providers were more likely to recommend pH-impedance testing, videofluoroscopic swallow studies, and upper gastrointestinal barium study (P < .05 for each test) depending on the referring physician. For vignettes involving infant GE reflux, both groups chose empiric treatments more frequently than testing (P < .001), although aerodigestive providers were more likely than nonaerodigestive providers to pursue testing like upper gastrointestinal barium studies (P < .05).

Authors provide a comprehensive framework of patient well-being known as REVAMP, which is consistent with CBT principles, and elaborate on research and interventions that can be adopted within the gastroenterology practice setting. Building positive resources can bolster patients with GI disorders against comorbid psychological and psychiatric distress. Positive psychology interventions can be implemented within gastroenterology practice.

The present analysis is aimed at delineating four different means to combine results of multiple tests and discuss their applicability and limitations. In serial testing, the overall test outcome is rated as being positive if the outcome is positive in all individual tests applied in series. Serial testing increases the overall specificity at the expense of decreasing sensitivity. In parallel testing, the overall test outcome is rated as being positive if the outcome is positive in any of the multiple tests. Parallel testing increases the overall sensitivity at the expense of decreasing specificity. In majority testing, the overall test outcome follows the rating by the majority of testers. Majority testing avoids the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity associated with serial and parallel testing and leads to relatively high overall values for both test characteristics. For majority testing to function well, however, it requires many independent testers, which can render this method costly and impractical in the clinical setting. Sequential testing applies to situations in which the output of a previous test provides the input for a later test. Sequential testing generally results in an overall test with lower sensitivity and specificity values than any of the individual tests and should be avoided if possible. All methods to improve test performance by combining the results of multiple tests have limitations and need to be regarded with skepticism. In the long run, the best solutions are provided by improvements of the individual test or performance by the individual diagnostician/reviewer through training and acquisition of new skills.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29111998/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Self-reported wait times varied widely, with 26.8% of respondents reporting waiting less than two weeks, 52.4% less than one month, 77.1% less than three months, 12.5% reported waiting longer than six months and 3.6% longer than one year. One-third of patients believed their wait time was too long, with 9% rating their wait time as 'far too long'; 96.4% believed that maximal wait time should be less than three months, 78.9% believed it should be less than one month and 40.3% believed it should be less than two weeks. Of those working or attending school, 22.6% reported missing at least one day of work or school because of their symptoms in the month before their appointment, and 9.0% reported missing five or more days in the preceding month. A total of 20.2% of respondents reported being very worried about having a serious disease (ie, scored 6 or higher on 7-point Likert scale), and 17.6% and 14.8%, respectively, reported that their symptoms caused major impairment of social functioning and with the activities of daily living.

The University of Virginia Digestive Health Service Center (DHSC) is a fully integrated inpatient service combining gastroenterology, hepatology, surgery, pathology, radiology, and nutritional services. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether integration of digestive health services can contain resource use among gastrointestinal (GI) inpatient admissions. This is a cohort study of 2934 inpatient cases admitted to a referral academic medical center between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2000, with a primary diagnosis of an esophageal disorder, appendicitis, abdominal hernia, intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, biliary tract disease, liver disease, a pancreatic disorder, or GI hemorrhage. Cases were grouped by admitting service (DHSC vs. other nonintegrated inpatient services). Total cost, length of stay, and 30-day readmission rate were adjusted for differences in baseline patient characteristics and compared. DHSC admission was associated with significant cost savings (P = 0.0363) and reduced length of stay (P < 0.0001). Cost savings were attributable to patients admitted for liver disease (P = 0.0077), GI hemorrhage (P = 0.0031), and diverticulitis (P = 0.0497); reductions in length of stay were seen for patients with liver disease (P = 0.0314), GI hemorrhage (P = 0.0212), diverticulitis (P = 0.0017), esophageal disorders (P = 0.0006), and abdominal hernia (P = 0.0458). DHSC patients with pancreatic disorders had increased total cost (P = 0.0247), but no difference in length of stay (P = 0.7504) and a lower 30-day readmission rate (P = 0.0478). Integration of digestive health services reduces resource use for patients with digestive diseases and may improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic disorders.

In luminal Crohn disease (CD), exclusive enteral nutrition is used as a first-line induction therapy and immunomodulators (IMM) are used since diagnosis in the majority of patients. Infliximab (IFX) is mostly considered as first-line biological. Sixty percentage of centres have experience with vedolizumab and/or ustekinumab and 40% use biosimilars. In the majority of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients 5-aminosalicylates are continued as concomitant therapy to IMM (usually azathioprine [AZA]/6-MP). After ileocaecal resection (ICR) in CD patients without postoperative residual disease, AZA monotherapy is the preferred treatment. A majority of centres follows both the Porto diagnostic criteria as well as paediatric (ESPGHAN/ECCO) guidelines on medical and surgical IBD management. This reflects the value of international societal guidelines. However, potentially desirable answers might have been given instead of what is true daily practice, and the most highly motivated people might have answered, leading to some bias.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30664566/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Therapeutic endoscopy procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), are performed less frequently in children relative to adults. A formal study to evaluate institutional volumes and practice patterns for advanced therapeutic pediatric endoscopy procedures has, however, not been previously undertaken. A self-administered 16-question (5-minute) online survey assessing practice patterns for performance of pediatric endoscopy procedures was distributed to all registered North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition programs. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text comments. Respondents from 82.9% of North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition centers completed this survey. Responses revealed that esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy are performed at the vast majority of centers (>90%), with most performing >50/year. Therapeutic endoscopy procedures are performed less frequently in the pediatric population, with 18.97% reporting that ERCP is not performed at their institution. Where ERCP is performed, 91.38% reported <25/year. Endoscopic ultrasound is not performed at more than half (53.33%) of institutions. Approximately 71.67% of respondents do not believe their institution's current arrangement for performing pediatric therapeutic endoscopy procedures is adequate. Although the range of endoscopic procedures performed in children parallels that performed in adults, there are notable differences in pediatric and adult gastroenterologists' endoscopy training and procedure volumes. Our results and respondent comments suggest that pediatric patients would benefit from a partnership between pediatric and adult gastroenterologists, with adult gastroenterologists performing more complex therapeutic endoscopic procedures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30789864/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Prescription data from 2013 to 2017 by 761 hepatologists identified in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part D Public Use File were analyzed. Annual prescription volumes were compared for providers with >10 annual prescriptions of a given drug type. Provider characteristics associated with opioid prescriptions were identified through multivariate logistic regression analyses. The proportion of hepatologists prescribing >10 annual opioid prescriptions decreased from 29% to 20.6%. Median annual opioid prescriptions per hepatologist significantly decreased from 24 to 20. Tramadol remained the most prescribed analgesic. Nonopioid analgesic prescription volume did not increase significantly. Provider characteristics associated with increased opioid prescriptions included male sex, practice location in the South and Midwest (vs West), more years in practice, and a greater proportion of beneficiaries who are white or with low-income subsidy claims. Characteristics associated with fewer prescriptions included non-university-based practice, having a greater proportion of female beneficiaries, and later prescription year. Hepatologists are prescribing less opioids. However, the prevalence of tramadol use and the lack of increase in nonopioid analgesic use highlights the need for advancing the science and training of pain management in chronic liver disease and targeted implementation of nonopioid treatment programs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082613/", "source_file": "pubmed_gastro.jsonl"}

Equipped with this information, we believe that young women would be poised to make better decisions for their future. We discussed community engagement and outreach to target schools in the surrounding Jamaica Hospital Medical Center community. In the midst of the pandemic, when educational systems moved toward virtual and electronic platforms, the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center obstetrics and gynecology team established a virtual program to promote the health and wellness of young women in middle and high schools. To accomplish these objectives, the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center obstetrics and gynecology team created seven modules that cover the following topics: Module 1-an informational session that addresses female hygiene and other health-related topics for young women and girls. This session allowed the team to assess the knowledge of our cohort. Module 2-a tutorial on the anatomy of the female body to empower young women and girls to understand how their bodies work. Modules 3 and 4-two sessions focused on puberty and the associated changes young women and girls should expect. Module 5-a session focused on sexually transmitted infections and their long-term effects, both physically and emotionally. Module 6-a session focused on physical and mental health wellness (including topics that resonate with our cohort such as body image and eating disorders). Module 7-a session focused on breast health, specifically gauged to the needs of our cohort.Each module required a commitment of at least 60 minutes, and, in some instances, a module had to be split into two sessions to ensure that the subject matter of that module was sufficiently covered. These modules were collaboratively developed from feedback provided by obstetricians in the community and educators at our target schools. The modules included interactive elements such as Poll Everywhere, videos, and diagrams that facilitated thoughtful and academic discussions. We successfully implemented this pilot program in two classes (one middle school class and one high school class), with the curriculum adjusted to cater to its audience. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both the students and their educator liaisons.

In recent years, however, private equity firms have ventured into general obstetrics and gynecology, drawn by its promise of steady returns, its fragmented landscape, and the potential to integrate related laboratory, ultrasound, and fertility services into obstetric care. Obstetrics and gynecology practices may soon face the prospect of acquisition by private equity firms offering professional management, centralized back-office functions, streamlined customer service, and the capital needed to reach a broader patient base. However, physicians may have concerns about the tradeoffs that accompany private equity acquisitions. Private equity-owned practices have been known to increase the use of lucrative services, deploy advanced practice professionals in place of physicians, and circumvent conflict-of-interest laws, potentially distorting clinical care and driving up costs for consumers. Furthermore, firms generally aim to exit their investment within a 3- to 7-year timeframe, and short-term growth plans may leave physician-owners with uncertain long-term management.

Concerns have arisen about the potential impact on medical students, residents, and fellows training in restricted areas and the effect on gynecologic training and the future provision of competent comprehensive women's health care in the United States. To qualitatively explore the anticipated impacts of the <i>Dobbs</i> ruling on training in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN). A participatory action research approach employing methods of qualitative analysis was used. Trainees and leaders in national OB/GYN professional and academic organizations with missions related to clinical care and training of medical students, residents, and fellows in OB/GYN participated. Two focus groups were held via Zoom in July 2022. Using an iterative process, transcripts underwent coding by 2 independent researchers to identify categories and common themes. Themes were organized into categories and subcategories. An additional reviewer resolved discrepancies. Twenty-six OB/GYN leaders/stakeholders representing 14 OB/GYN societies along with 4 trainees participated. Eight thematic categories were identified: competency, provision of reproductive health care, residency selection, inequity in training, alternative training, law-based vs evidence-based medicine, morality and ethics, and uncertainty about next steps. This qualitative study of leaders and learners in OB/GYN identified 8 themes of potential impacts of the <i>Dobbs</i> ruling on current and future training in OB/GYN.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37363665/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

{"id": "38082319", "title": "Physiotherapy practice in women's health: awareness and attitudes of obstetricians and gynecologists in Ghana.", "text": "Physiotherapy is relatively well integrated into women's health in many high-income countries (HICs) as compared to low- and middle- countries (LMICs) like Ghana. Suboptimal integration of physiotherapy in modern obstetrics and gynecology especially in low resource settings is partly due to issues related to the awareness and attitudes of referring physicians. This study assessed the awareness and attitude levels towards physiotherapy in women's health among obstetricians/gynecologists and factors associated with its utilization in Ghana. A cross-sectional study was conducted among obstetricians/gynecologists working at a tertiary hospital in Ghana using an \"Awareness and Attitude Questionnaire\" adapted from a standardized questionnaire. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was performed and logistic regression was used to assess the association between doctors' awareness level of physiotherapy's role in women's health and years of clinical practice. Sixty-one (61) respondents comprising 7 consultants, 20 senior residents and 34 junior residents, with age median age of 35 years (range: 29-65 years) were recruited. There were more males than females (82% versus 18%) with a mean (SD) duration of practice of (9.41 ± 4.71) years. The participants reported a considerable awareness of physiotherapists' role in obstetrics (between 72.1% for intrapartum to 91.8% for postnatal) but wide variation in gynecology (from 19.7% in PID to 95. 1% in uterine prolapse). Consultants were more (71.4%) aware of the role of physiotherapy in antenatal care and gynecology while senior residents had more awareness in intrapartum and postnatal care. Junior residents generally showed lowest awareness levels. Duration of clinical practice (≥ 10years) was not significantly associated with doctors' awareness regarding the importance of physiotherapy in childbirth. There were mixed findings concerning doctors' attitudes toward physiotherapy: (1) 41% indicated that physiotherapists have been effective in their inter-professional relationship; (2) none of the doctors strongly agreed that physiotherapy may not contribute significantly to the complete well-being of gynecological patients. The main factors influencing utilization of physiotherapy were the perceived notion of non-availability of physiotherapists to cover various wards and physiotherapists not attending ward rounds with doctors to facilitate more education on the scope of physiotherapy practice. Although obstetricians/gynecologists showed appreciable awareness and attitudes towards physiotherapy, there remains a considerable gap in provider education to ensure optimal utilization of physiotherapy in contemporary obstetrics and gynecology. Further research is recommended to assess implementation challenges associated with regular utilization of physiotherapy services in women's health in the hospital.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38082319/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

We aimed to study trends in the publication of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in women's health over the last two decades. The primary objective was to describe longitudinal trends in the geographical distribution of RCTs in obstetrics and gynaecology. We also described trends in trial funding, publication sources and separately published trial protocols. RCTs were identified by searching the Web of Science alone, due to the large number of results and descriptive nature of analyses. Using the filter tool, only studies labelled as \"Clinical trial\" or \"Article\" were included; all other document types were excluded. Trial protocols were identified and analysed separately. Indexing data were extracted using the Web of Science selection tools. As we aimed simply to describe research trends using a single platform, we did not check for duplicates. No process for data pooling was necessary. Correlation of GDP, funding and number of RCTs was calculated using Pearson's r test. We identified 39,071 RCTs. The number of annual publications globally increased from 1,406 in 2001 to 1,979 in 2020. The US (n = 12,479) and the UK (n = 3,745) were responsible for the most RCTs, followed by Italy (n = 2,676) and China (n = 2,338). The largest percentage increase in annual publications was seen in Iran (n = 5 to n = 113, +2,160 %) and the Western Pacific Region (n = 16 to n = 171, +968.8 %). GDP was significantly correlated with the number of published RCTs in 2019 for the 25 most prolific countries (p < 0.001), but not with the proportion of RCTs funded. Despite growing contributions from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions, most RCTs are still produced in a small nucleus of high-income countries.

Jackson Women's Health Organization decision ended constitutional protection for abortion, resulting in severely restricted access to reproductive health care and raising concerns about the repercussions on obstetrics and gynecology trainees. This qualitative study examines the observed effects of the Dobbs decision on obstetrics and gynecology training and practice one year out. Obstetrics and gynecology physicians involved in patient care and medical education were invited to participate in online focus groups. We attempted to recruit participants from a diversity of subspecialties and regions of the United States. Eighteen physicians participated in five sessions conducted July-October 2023. Using an iterative process, two independent researchers coded transcripts to identify themes and subthemes. An additional reviewer resolved discrepancies. Eight themes were identified: dichotomy of care in restrictive versus protective states, loss of the patient-physician relationship, moral distress to physicians, legal concerns for physicians, new issues for training programs, loss of patient care experiences for trainees, loss of access to care for patients, and disappointment and frustration with policy makers. Themes were grouped into their effects on patients, trainees, physicians, and society overall, reflecting negative changes in patient care, training, and physician morale. This qualitative study found that physicians see the Dobbs ruling as having negative effects on patients, trainees, and physicians. Participants observed that these changes are leading to a dichotomy of care in which patients in restrictive and protective states receive different care and some patients may not receive medically necessary treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40480850/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

Examples of this conceptual shift are occurring in many areas of science, but nowhere is it more germane than in the medical sciences that serve women. After a historical focus on reproduction and the development of obstetrics-gynecology, medicine has now gained a broader view of the woman using sex- and gender-based science, and a new field called \"women's health\" is evolving. Complexity science does not invalidate or eliminate the need for reductionist science, it simply makes a wider array of phenomena understandable. Its method allows going beyond the metaphor of the body as a machine and challenges the user to re-examine how health and illness are understood. This article explores how these changes in science must inform the development of an academic discipline in women's health.

This article reviews data regarding changes in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Residency education is focusing more on a core curriculum in general obstetrics and gynecology, while subspecialty fellowship training has grown in popularity. There are no recent data to describe whether OB-GYNs are working fewer hours, yet more are employed in larger practices at mostly metropolitan locations. A team-based care model that incorporates nonphysician clinicians and digital conversion of clinical data has been encouraged to increase accessibility, improve comprehensiveness, commit to more continuity of care, and reduce redundancy. Compared with other medical specialists, OB-GYNs retire slightly earlier, especially females who will represent the field more. The specialty is moving toward a more comprehensive women's health care practice model that is more patient-centered, efficient, cost controlling, team-based, and adaptable to the needs of a diverse population.

Each module, containing objectives, assigned readings, and cases with answers, is used in a small-group format and can be completed in 20-30 minutes prior to the start of a clinical day. Modules were implemented at two academic centers with first-year OB-GYN residents. Qualitative real-time feedback and summative quantitative feedback from OB-GYN residents were obtained. Twenty-one OB-GYN residents completed the curriculum, which was well received by trainees and program directors. All residents (100%) felt the curriculum increased knowledge of prenatal genetics and felt more comfortable counseling patients after completion. Seventy-three percent enjoyed the discussion/case-based format; associated articles were found helpful by 100% of trainees.

Similarly, midwifery training encompasses independent care of low-risk pregnant women and assist in care of high-risk pregnancy in partnership with obstetricians. Although its necessary to acquaint most learners with core clinical skills in obstetrics and gynaecology, learning opportunities on patients can be limited, due to the intrusive nature of women's health examination. Simulation Based Education (SBE) can facilitate learning hands-on clinical examination and procedural skills, using realistic part-task and high-fidelity simulators prior to approaching patients. This can apply to both medical and midwifery undergraduate training, further creating opportunities for professional interaction and shared learning space to facilitate interprofessional education. IPE has been shown to improve professional relationships in practicing clinicians. This learning pedagogy can be applied in the undergraduate setting as well, to decrease risk of conflict and appreciate roles of other interprofessional staff in future clinical practice.

We have also found that emotional and mental health problems are often converted into physical symptomatology that carries fewer stigmas and is often viewed as easier to treat. Many women use their obstetrician-gynecologists for primary care, particularly during their reproductive years. Provision of behavioral healthcare is critical to health maintenance for many of these women. Barriers to the integration of behavioral healthcare into obstetrics and gynecology practice need to be understood and systemically addressed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14603140/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

A total of 244 telemedicine consultations in 185 female patients were evaluated. These consultations were overwhelmingly for gynecological cases (76%). Obstetric consultations, which constituted only 24% of the total number of consultations, involved predominantly pathologies of pregnancy. The mean age of patients who used the telemedicine system was 27 years. Ten percent of the study subjects resided in a country other than Poland at the time of their consultation. Only one patient required an urgent referral for an in-person consultation at an emergency department.

Our goals were to assess the needs of residents at our academic medical center and to design an interdisciplinary curriculum that addresses these needs utilizing a modified problem-based learning (PBL) format. The aim of this article is to report on the development, logistics, and successful implementation of our innovative curriculum. Based on results from a targeted needs-assessment, we designed a curriculum for both IM and OG residents to address curricular deficiencies in an efficient and effective manner. Procurement of support was achieved by reviewing overlapping competency requirements and results of the needs-assessment with the program directors. The curriculum consists of six ambulatory clinical cases which lead residents through a discussion of screening, diagnosis, prevention, and management within a modified PBL format. Residents select one learning objective each week which allows them to serve as content experts during case discussions, applying what they learned from their literature review to guide the group as they decide upon the next step for the case. This format helps accommodate different experience levels of learners, encourages discussion from less-vocal residents, and utilizes theories of adult learning. Sixty-five residents have participated in the curriculum since it was successfully implemented. IM residents report that the cases were their first opportunity to discuss the health concerns of younger women; OG residents felt similarly about cases related to older women. Implementation challenges included resident accountability. Residents identified the timing of the sessions and clinical coverage requirements as barriers to conference attendance. Interdisciplinary modified PBL conferences focusing on shared curricular needs in ambulatory women's health are well-received by both IM and OG residents. This format utilizes theories of adult learning and maximizes limited time and resources by teaching IM and OG residents concurrently, and can be successfully implemented at a large academic medical center.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19743908/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

Grounded theory analysis of the OB/GYN residents' interviews revealed the idealized obstetrical patient is quiet and easily controlled. Residents praised women whom they believed were suppressing their labor pain, a racialized and classed concept that furthers misconceptions about the \"obstetric hardiness\" of Black women and the hypersensitivity of wealthy White women. Participants' conceptions of \"bad\" patients included those with less cultural health capital due to low health literacy and socioeconomic status, which impeded the patients' ability to participate in shared decision-making. Despite acknowledging the importance of patient autonomy regarding pain control during labor, the interviewed residents positioned themselves as the ultimate authority. Their subjective assessment of patients' pain inherently invoked their personal biases, such as conflating low socioeconomic status and race. Some participants posited an inverse relationship between hardship and pain, while others questioned whether those with low health literacy exaggerate their pain due to fear of the clinical encounter or to secure medical attention. Both framings have concerning implications for inadequate pain control and the unintentional perpetuation of obstetric violence and obstetric racism within the profession.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36155358/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

Several challenges have to be faced in order to improve current clinical practice in both obstetrics and gynaecology. For instance, a complete understanding of fetal physiology and establishing accurately predictive antepartum and intrapartum monitoring are yet to be achieved. In gynaecology, the complexity of molecular biology results in a lack of understanding of gynaecological cancer, which also contributes to poor outcomes. In this review, we aim to describe some important applications of AI in obstetrics and gynaecology. We also discuss whether AI can lead to a deeper understanding of pathophysiological concepts in obstetrics and gynaecology, allowing delineation of some grey zones, leading to improved healthcare provision.

Twelve residents at the University of Hawai'i completed the curriculum during their second year of training. Of these, 6 residents completed an examination assessing knowledge both before and immediately after the curriculum. Five of these residents completed the examination 1-2 years after completing the curriculum. Average pre-rotation examination scores were 57%, which increased significantly immediately after the curriculum to 87% (<i>P</i>=.003) and remained significantly higher after 1-2 years with average scores of 71% (<i>P</i>=.025). A secondary objective was to assess resident comfort and confidence levels in the subject. All residents who completed the curriculum completed surveys assessing comfort in their pediatric and adolescent gynecology training and both perceived confidence and competence in this area. Despite completing the curriculum, 7 of 12 (58%) did not feel comfortable evaluating pediatric gynecology patients, and 5 of 12 (42%) did not feel prepared nor competent to care for pediatric and adolescent patients. A formal pediatric and adolescent gynecology curriculum increased examination performance, which suggests knowledge retention. However, despite curriculum completion, residents still desired more training in the subject area.

A literature search was conducted in Scopus and Overton between December 2023 to February 2024, and PubMed in October 2024 to broadly explore peer-reviewed publications focusing on understanding the development of devices used specifically in obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) care in LMICs.

Most students reflected on clinical, communication and reasoning skills, lack of medical knowledge, and the development of their own and others' professional practice. The 4 levels of reflection students demonstrated were: listing, where students only state the clinical experience; describing, where students describe the clinical experience, including what they did well and what they did not; applying, where students discuss what they need to change and how to develop, and integrating, where students apply reflection to future clinical practice. Few respondents demonstrated the ability to reflect to the level of integration except with facilitated discussion. The range of experiences on which students reflected was appropriate. The information obtained from the emergent themes has been useful for programme development. At the end of the process students were still not reflecting at the level of integration.

At the onset of menopause, women exhibit an increase in cholesterol and an increased risk of CVD. Unfortunately, hyperlipidemia is largely undertreated in women, although the rate of hypercholesterolemia among women is similar to that of men. More aggressive intervention is recommended for persons with multiple risk factors and/or monogenic dyslipidemias.

Based on these gaps, a gender-integrated curriculum was developed, implemented, and tested with medical students. Significant positive attitudes were seen among male and female students for themes such as access to safe abortion; understanding reproductive health concerns and their complex relationship with gender roles; violence against women as a health issue; and sexuality and health. These results strengthened the resolve to advocate for such a curriculum to be integrated across all medical colleges in the state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31044431/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

The committee proposed eight new clinical preventive service recommendations aimed at closing significant gaps in preventive healthcare. This article reviews the process, findings, and the implications for obstetrician gynecologists and other primary care clinicians. Obstetricians and gynecologists play a major role in delivering primary care to women and many of the services recommended by the Committee are part of the core set of obstetrics and gynecology services. The women's health amendment to the ACA (Federal Register, 2010) requires that new private health plans cover - with no cost-sharing requirements - preventive healthcare services for women. Congress requested that a review be conducted to ascertain whether there were any additional needed preventive services specific to women's health that should be included. The IOM Committee on Preventive Services for Women recommended eight clinical measures specific to women's health that should be considered for coverage without co-payment. The US Department of HHS reviewed and adopted these recommendations, and, as a result, new health plans will need to include these services as part of insurance policies with plan years beginning on or after 1 August 2012. The authors discuss the implications of the IOM recommendations on practicing clinicians and on their potential impact on women's health and well being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22011955/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

In 2014, with Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology's guidance, these divisions were referred to as academic specialists divisions and the faculty within as academic specialists to emphasize that they provide specialized women's health care in academic settings. The divisions comprised approximately 30% of departments' full-time faculty (median 12). In 27% of the departments, these divisions contributed more than half of departmental revenue, and 49% contributed 26-50%. Nearly 90% of divisions provided a sizeable proportion of the department's total teaching efforts. Compensation relied more on clinical productivity than on seniority, quality, academic contributions, or academic rank. Subsequently, five performance domains were identified to help divisions define divisional excellence: clinical, education, research, service & advocacy, and academic environment. Furthermore, excellent divisions were characterized as those with outstanding clinicians and educators who emphasize scholarly productivity. Although academic specialists contribute significantly to their departments' financial, clinical, and educational productivity, many have limited opportunities for scholarly activity. Achieving divisional excellence likely will depend on the ability to recruit and retain faculty with career expectations that align with the division's prioritized performance domains.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030879/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

The professional liability crisis is among the most potent factors affecting the types and numbers of services that obstetricians and gynecologists will provide in the future. The setting for obstetrics and gynecology practice is likely to be affected by advances in technology and trends in delivery and reimbursement systems. Two factors with potential to affect the organization of practice are the high numbers of women entering the specialty and increasing practice expenses, largely associated with liability costs. Other factors affecting future patterns of delivery include the anticipated aging of the female population and the changing social and economic roles of women. In particular, the feminist movement has focused more attention on women's health care and is expected to have a continuing impact on the delivery of obstetric and gynecologic care. The Council concludes that the most salient issues for the specialty in the future will be the following: (1) the direction of the professional liability crisis, (2) medical practice competition, (3) the feminization of poverty, (4) ethical issues arising from technological and social imperatives, (5) the changing gender profile of the specialty, and (6) the impact of the feminist movement on women's health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3316730/", "source_file": "pubmed_gynecology.jsonl"}

Research has also demonstrated strong associations between addictive use of technology and comorbid psychiatric disorders. In the present study, 23,533 adults (mean age 35.8 years, ranging from 16 to 88 years) participated in an online cross-sectional survey examining whether demographic variables, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and depression could explain variance in addictive use (i.e., compulsive and excessive use associated with negative outcomes) of two types of modern online technologies: social media and video games. Correlations between symptoms of addictive technology use and mental disorder symptoms were all positive and significant, including the weak interrelationship between the two addictive technological behaviors. Age appeared to be inversely related to the addictive use of these technologies. Being male was significantly associated with addictive use of video games, whereas being female was significantly associated with addictive use of social media. Being single was positively related to both addictive social networking and video gaming. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that demographic factors explained between 11 and 12% of the variance in addictive technology use. The mental health variables explained between 7 and 15% of the variance. The study significantly adds to our understanding of mental health symptoms and their role in addictive use of modern technology, and suggests that the concept of Internet use disorder (i.e., \"Internet addiction\") as a unified construct is not warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26999354/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies published in both English and Chinese were included. Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%). Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder. Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure. This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We identified single-herb medicines that may warrant further study in cancer patients. Our search included PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Embase, and Cochrane databases, selecting only single-herb randomized controlled trials between 1996 and 2016 in any population for data extraction, excluding herbs with known potential for interactions with cancer treatments. One hundred articles involving 38 botanicals met our criteria. Among herbs most studied (≥6 randomized controlled trials each), lavender, passionflower, and saffron produced benefits comparable to standard anxiolytics and antidepressants. Black cohosh, chamomile, and chasteberry are also promising. Anxiety or depressive symptoms were measured in all studies, but not always as primary endpoints. Overall, 45% of studies reported positive findings with fewer adverse effects compared with conventional medications. Based on available data, black cohosh, chamomile, chasteberry, lavender, passionflower, and saffron appear useful in mitigating anxiety or depression with favorable risk-benefit profiles compared to standard treatments.

Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles published until February 2015. Eighty-one unique studies comprising 31,794 school students met inclusion criteria. Small effect sizes for both depression (g=0.23) and anxiety (g=0.20) prevention programs immediately post-intervention were detected. Small effects were evident after 12-month follow-up for both depression (g=0.11) and anxiety (g=0.13). Overall, the quality of the included studies was poor, and heterogeneity was moderate. Subgroup analyses suggested that universal depression prevention programs had smaller effect sizes at post-test relative to targeted programs. For anxiety, effect sizes were comparable for universal and targeted programs. There was some evidence that externally-delivered interventions were superior to those delivered by school staff for depression, but not anxiety.

The databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published between 1995 and 2016. Data was extracted on study and participants' characteristics, independent and dependent variables, used measures and effects sizes of associations between social relationships and mental health or wellbeing. A narrative review was performed to synthesize findings along the constructs social support, social networks, negative social interactions, family functioning and relationship quality. Of the 63 included studies, 47 were cross-sectional and 16 longitudinal. Most studies included a measure of social support (n = 58), while other concepts were less often studied (social networks n = 6; negative social interaction n = 3; family functioning n = 2; relationship quality n = 1). Over half of studies included depression as outcome (n = 33), followed by wellbeing (n = 14), composite mental health measures (n = 10), anxiety (n = 8), psychological distress (n = 7), posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 3), and hopelessness (n = 1). Although trends for associations of social support with mental health and wellbeing were consistent, around a quarter of studies failed to report significant associations. Social networks were related to depression, but not to other mental health or wellbeing measures. Family functioning, negative social interactions and relationship quality showed consistent associations with mental health and wellbeing, however, only few studies were available. This review indicates that social relationships play an important role in mental health and wellbeing in persons with disabilities, although findings are less consistent than in general populations and strength of associations vary between constructs.

Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and were included if they: (1) used human participants, (2) were longitudinal, (3) reported primary data, (4) had smoking as an exposure and depression and/or anxiety as an outcome, or (5) had depression and/or anxiety as the exposure and smoking as an outcome. Outcomes from 148 studies were categorized into: smoking onset, smoking status, smoking heaviness, tobacco dependence, and smoking trajectory. The results for each category varied substantially, with evidence for positive associations in both directions (smoking to later mental health and mental health to later smoking) as well as null findings. Overall, nearly half the studies reported that baseline depression/anxiety was associated with some type of later smoking behavior, while over a third found evidence that a smoking exposure was associated with later depression/anxiety. However, there were few studies directly supporting a bidirectional model of smoking and anxiety, and very few studies reporting null results. The literature on the prospective association between smoking and depression and anxiety is inconsistent in terms of the direction of association most strongly supported. This suggests the need for future studies that employ different methodologies, such as Mendelian randomization (MR), which will allow us to draw stronger causal inferences. We systematically reviewed longitudinal studies on the association of different aspects of smoking behavior with depression and anxiety. The results varied considerably, with evidence for smoking both associated with subsequent depression and anxiety, and vice versa. Few studies supported a bidirectional relationship, or reported null results, and no clear patterns by gender, ethnicity, clinical status, length to follow-up, or diagnostic test. Suggesting that despite advantages of longitudinal studies, they cannot alone provide strong evidence of causality.

Exercise is one such option that is supported by published extensive basic and clinical research data. The aim of this review was to examine the beneficial effects of exercise in depression. Physical activity and exercise have been shown to be effective in treating mild-to-moderate depression and in reducing mortality and symptoms of major depression. However, physical activity and exercise are still underused in clinical practice. This review attempts to propose a framework to help clinicians in their decision-making process, how to incorporate physical activity in their toolkit of potential therapeutic responses for depressed patients. We first summarize the interactions between depression and physical activities, with a particular focus on the potential antidepressant physiological effects of physical activity. We then identify some of the barriers blocking physical activity from being used to fight depression. Finally, we present several perspectives and ideas that can help in optimizing mitigation strategies to challenge these barriers, including actions on physical activity representations, ways to increase the accessibility of physical activity, and the potential of technology to help both clinicians and patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36137954/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. \"Lifestyle Medicine\" provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24721040/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Moderate to severe depression and anxiety were reported in 17% and 9% of cancer survivors, respectively. There were no significant differences between the 5 years and 10 years after diagnosis cohorts (p = 0.232). In both cohorts, we found higher depression and anxiety in women than in men (p < 0.001), and lower depression and anxiety in elderly patients (p < 0.001). Cancer survivors younger than 60 years of age were more depressed and anxious than the general population (p < 0.001).

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has strong evidence among people with mood and anxiety disorders, but limited studies reported the effectiveness of MBCT on perinatal comorbid conditions. This study aimed to examine the effects of an 8-week MBCT intervention on pregnant women with comorbid depression and anxiety. In this randomized controlled study, 38 pregnant women with a diagnosis of depression and varying levels of comorbid anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to either MBCT or a control group. Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Scales of Psychological Wellbeing were used as outcome measures at baseline, after MBCT, and through 1-month follow-up. Intent to treat analyses provided preliminary evidence that MBCT can be effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and in enhancing the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and psychological well-being. Improvements in outcomes were maintained 1 month. Results provide cross-cultural support for MBCT as a treatment for depression and anxiety in pregnant women.

We aimed to systematically evaluate the available literature on the prevalence, associates, and treatment of mental disorders in patients with cancer in LLMICs. We systematically searched Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of major depression or anxiety disorders in this population, defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases criteria. We qualitatively reviewed studies that examined the prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders defined by self-report tools, the prevalence of other mental disorders, associated factors of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the treatment of mental disorders in this population. Forty studies spanning a 15-year period were included in the review. The pooled prevalence defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases criteria was 21% for major depression (95% CI, 15 to 28) and 18% for anxiety disorders (95% CI, 8 to 30). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were most frequently associated with advanced disease and low levels of education. Among the four studies evaluating treatment, three evaluated the effectiveness of psychotherapy and one evaluated a yoga program. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with cancer generally appears higher in LLMICs than in upper-income countries. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a significant and underappreciated disease burden. We suggest that clinicians remain vigilant to psychiatric symptoms.

Fourteen-day actigraphy data of 359 participants with current (n = 93), remitted (n = 176), or no (n = 90) composite international diagnostic interview depression/anxiety diagnoses were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Objective estimates included sleep duration (SD), sleep efficiency, relative amplitude (RA) between day-time and night-time activity, mid sleep on free days (MSF), gross motor activity (GMA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Self-reported measures included insomnia rating scale, SD, MSF, metabolic equivalent total, and MVPA. Compared to controls, individuals with current depression/anxiety had a significantly different objective, but not self-reported, PA and CR: lower GMA (23.83 vs. 27.4 milli-gravity/day, p = .022), lower MVPA (35.32 vs. 47.64 min/day, p = .023), lower RA (0.82 vs. 0.83, p = .033). In contrast, self-reported, but not objective, sleep differed between people with current depression/anxiety compared to those without current disorders; people with current depression/anxiety reported both shorter and longer SD and more insomnia. More depressive/anxiety symptoms and number of depressive/anxiety diagnoses were associated with larger disturbances of the actigraphy measures. Actigraphy provides ecologically valid information on sleep, CR, and PA that enhances data from self-reported questionnaires.

They responded during their stay in the maternity ward to a set of questionnaires between the 1st and the 6th day after delivery. This included an anamnestic questionnaire as well as different scales that evaluated generalized self-efficacy feeling (GSES), marital adjustment (DAS), perceived sense of control during labor and delivery (LAS), birth experience (QEVA), anxiety manifestations (STAI-Y), depressive symptoms (EPDS) and peri-traumatic distress (PDI). Symptoms of anxiety, depression and peri-traumatic distress in the immediate postpartum period, as indicators of women's mental health, are predicted by different determinants. An anxious personality and perceived complications during childbirth for the woman or baby have been shown to be significant predictors of postpartum anxiety. Symptoms of depression are related to a history of depression, a low overall sense of general efficacy and lower satisfaction in the marital relationship. Peri-traumatic distress is related to certain dimensions of the childbirth experience, such as perceived sense of control, perceived complications and emotions felt during birth. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and peritraumatic distress are linked to aspects of the prenatal period, but also to the experience of childbirth. More specific prevention, screening and care measures, depending on the woman's symptomatology, can be implemented during pregnancy or at the maternity.

National audits aim to improve population-level clinical care by identifying unwarranted variations and making recommendations for clinicians, managers and service commissioners. The National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression aimed to improve clinical care for people admitted to English hospitals for treatment of anxiety and depression, to provide comparative data on quality of care, and to support local quality improvement initiatives by identifying and sharing examples of best practice. Thirteen standards were developed based on NICE guidelines, literature review and feedback from a steering committee and reference group of service users and carers. All providers of NHS inpatient mental health services in England were asked to submit details of between 20 and 100 eligible service users/patients admitted between April 2017 and September 2018. To ascertain data reliability, participating services re-audited 5 sets of case-notes with a second auditor, and the coordinating team checked 10 randomly-selected sets of case-notes from 3 services, also selected at random. The reference group and steering committee identified key findings and developed a series of recommendations, which were discussed in regional quality improvement workshops and on-line webinars. Data from 3795 case notes were analysed. A sizeable proportion of records indicated that at least one important aspect of initial assessment was not documented. Many service users/patients who could have benefited from an intervention targeted at optimising physical health did not receive it. Only a minority (39%) were referred for psychological therapy. Use of outcome measures varied considerably but no single outcome measure was being used routinely. Most individuals had a care plan recorded in the notes, but a review date was documented in only two-thirds, and almost half of individuals had not received a copy. There was considerable variation between English mental health services across many variables, and much scope for improvement. Clinicians should ensure that care plans are developed collaboratively with service users/patients and identified carers should be provided with information about support services. Health services should investigate the reasons for low referral rates for psychological therapies. Clinicians should ensure all service users have jointly developed crisis plans in place at discharge. Service managers should agree outcome measures to evaluate the treatment provided and clinicians should use these measures at initial assessment and review appointments.

Besides being more susceptible to the onset of depression, young people have a higher risk of loneliness, and their personal and social development is impacted by social relationships during this time. It is thought that mental health stigma can undermine both help-seeking and longer-term outcomes for disorders like depression in young people. However, how stigma (i.e., related to depression) might affect young people's feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and relationships is unclear. Using qualitative research methods, this study aimed to explore the subjective experiences of public and internalized stigma and its effects on loneliness, social isolation, and relationship quality in young people with depression symptoms. We carried out in-depth, semi-structured interviews with N = 22 young people aged 17-25 (M<sub>age</sub> = 22 years) who reported high symptoms of depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) score > 27) (i.e., community sample, N = 9) or had been previously diagnosed with depression by a medical professional (i.e., clinical sample, N = 13). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. We explored the subjective effects of depression stigma on loneliness, social isolation, and relationships. Participants described both public stigma (i.e., initiated by others) and internalized stigma (i.e., self-imposed) as disrupting social relationships and eliciting loneliness, isolation, and depressive symptomology. Four main themes about young people's subjective experiences of stigma were identified: 1) Others' Misunderstanding of Mental Health Disorders and the Impact Misunderstanding has on Relationships; 2) Effects of Stigma on the Self and Wellbeing; 3) Stigma Fosters Secrecy Versus Disclosure; and 4) Stigma Increases Loneliness Driven by Avoidance of Social Contexts. Young people's accounts revealed a wide range of consequences beyond their depression diagnosis. Participants often felt discriminated against, misunderstood, and judged by others as a result of public stigma; they discussed internalizing these attitudes. They suggested that a lack of understanding from others, for example from their partners, family, and peers, and unreliable and/or absent support systems resulted in increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation and reduced the quality and quantity of relationship formation, social bonds, and interactions. Stigma also reduced their self-esteem and confidence, which in turn fostered secrecy and a reluctance to disclose their depression. Despite depression's stigma, most participants reported having long-term goals and aspirations to reconnect with others. These goals stood in contrast to feeling hopeless and unmotivated during periods of depression. Overall, we reveal how stigma can impact feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and relationships among young people with depression, which could lead to targeted interventions to lessen the impact of stigma in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37479975/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Given that comorbid anxiety and major depressive disorders are very common in AUD, and that such comorbidity affects psychological treatments negatively, the primary aim of the present study was investigating whether ApBM training is moderated by anxiety/major depressive disorder comorbidity. The secondary aim was to examine whether ApBM's relapse-preventive effect can be replicated. <b><i>Method:</i></b> We conducted a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a clinical sample of AUD inpatients (n = 729) with a follow-up assessment after 1 year. All patients received 12 weeks of inpatient treatment as usual (TAU). On top of that, patients were randomized to a 12-session ApBM (TAU + ApBM), and a no-training control condition (TAU-only). Treatment success was defined as either no relapse or a single lapse shorter than 3 days in duration, ended by the patient and followed by at least 4 weeks of abstinence. Failure was defined as relapse, passed away, no contact, or refusal to provide information. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We found that TAU + ApBM had significantly higher success rates than TAU-only at 1-year follow-up. Importantly, anxiety/depressive comorbidity moderated ApBM's effects: Adding ApBM to TAU increased success rates more for patients with a comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder than for patients without such comorbidity. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our data suggest that adding ApBM to TAU works better in patients with a comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder; a promising finding gave the high rates of comorbidity in clinical practice.

Research indicates treatment response is a non-linear process characterized by combinations of gradual changes and abrupt shifts in depression symptoms, although less is known about differential trajectories of depression symptoms in therapist-supported digital mental health interventions (DMHI). Repeated measures latent profile analysis was used to empirically identify differential trajectories based upon biweekly depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among patients engaging in a therapist-supported DMHI from January 2020 to July 2021. Multivariate associations between symptom trajectories with sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were examined with multinomial logistic regression. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were defined as a five-point change on the PHQ-9 from baseline to week 12. The final sample included 2192 patients aged 18 to 82 (mean = 39.1). Four distinct trajectories emerged that differed by symptom severity and trajectory of depression symptoms over 12 weeks. All trajectories demonstrated reductions in symptoms. Despite meeting MCID criteria, evidence of treatment resistance was found among the trajectory with the highest symptom severity. Chronicity of major depressive episodes and lifetime trauma exposures were ubiquitous across the trajectories in a multinomial logistic regression model. These data indicate that changes in depression symptoms during DMHI are heterogenous and non-linear, suggesting a need for precision care strategies to address treatment resistance and increase engagement. Future efforts should examine the effectiveness of trauma-informed treatment modules for DMHIs as well as protocols for continuation treatment and relapse prevention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651947/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Multivariable linear regression analyses examined the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and patients' functional impairment. Approximately 46.3% and 27.0% showed some depression and anxiety symptomatology, while 8.0% and 3.0% experienced major depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Patients reported the most impairment in mobility and capacity for life activities. More functional impairment was identified in patients with gastrointestinal cancers, those receiving radiation therapy alone, and those scoring higher on depression and anxiety than in those with cancers originating in the head, neck, or lung or those receiving chemotherapy alone. Reports of better overall health status were negatively associated with functional impairment. Patients reported extensive perceived barriers to seeking psychiatric care, including not knowing where to get mental health support (86.7%), wanting to manage mental health independently (73.7%), and thinking mental health will resolve on its own (73.7%), and denying mental health concerns (61.0%). High frequency and severity of depression and anxiety symptomatology underscore the importance of integrating mental health services into existing oncological treatment protocols.

A community sample of depressed adolescents and non-depressed peers was followed-up with a structured diagnostic interview after 15 years. The participants (n=382) were divided into five groups depending on their status in adolescence: no depression (n=155); long-term MD (n=91); episodic MD (n=63); dysthymia (n=33); and subthreshold symptoms (n=40). Outcomes (age 19-31) included mood disorders, other mental disorders, suicidality, and treatment for mental disorders. The long-term group overall had a poorer outcome than the non-depressed group, with the episodic group in an intermediate position. The outcome of the dysthymic group was similar to that of the long-term group, while the subsyndromal group did not differ markedly from the non-depressed group. The long-term group was more likely than the episodic group to report adult anxiety disorders, multiple mental disorders, suicide attempts, and treatment; they also seemed to develop more persistent adult depressions, with a higher number of recurrent episodes and longer duration of antidepressant treatment. Even after adjustment for adolescent factors of clinical and etiological importance, the long-term group had a markedly less favourable outcome than the episodic group.

This article reviews statistical trends in diagnosis, treatment, drug prescriptions, and textual readings of diagnostic criteria and secondary literature. The association of anxiety with diffuse and amorphous conceptions of \"stress\" and \"neuroses\" became incompatible with professional norms demanding diagnostic specificity. At the same time, the contrasting nosologies of anxiety and depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III) extended major depressive disorder to encompass far more patients than any particular anxiety disorder. In addition, antidepressant drugs were not associated with the stigma and alleged side effects of the anxiolytic drugs. Various factors combined between the 1970s and the 1990s to transform conditions that had been viewed as \"anxiety\" into \"depression.\" New interests in the twenty-first century, however, might lead to the reemergence of anxiety as the signature mental health problem of American society.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20377760/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

This review focuses on their experiences of clinically significant anxiety and depression and provides recommendations for appropriately timed referrals to mental health professionals. Adults with congenital heart disease have a higher probability of experiencing symptoms consistent with mood and anxiety disorders, yet risk factors are not well understood. Although patients as a group are often interested in psychological treatment, there is currently under-recognition and under-treatment of mental health concerns. As provider and patient awareness of the biopsychosocial implications of living with congenital heart disease continues to grow, the focus of comprehensive care is broadening to include attention to psychosocial well-being.

Maternal deaths related to mental health in the perinatal period can be attributed to a lack of appropriate treatment and/or support. A barrier to women's help-seeking behaviors is the lack of discrete, perinatal specific interventions where women can self-assess and access support. This review examines original research evaluating perinatal mental health interventions used by women to improve mental health. An integrative literature review was undertaken. A comprehensive search strategy using 5 electronic databases resulted in the retrieval of 1898 articles. Use of an inclusion and exclusion criteria and Critical Appraisal Skills Program tools resulted in 4 original research papers. Thematic analysis identified universal themes. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation and Mindfulness-based interventions, specifically adapted to meet the needs of women in the perinatal period, demonstrate an overall improvement in mental health. Women involved in the interventions experienced both improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as secondary benefits from participating in the research. To improve perinatal mental health outcomes, innovative modes of providing effective perinatal mental health interventions that address the unique needs of women in the perinatal period are needed. Future development of perinatal mental health interventions require adaptions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation and/or Mindfulness-based methods to address mental health outcomes for women in the perinatal period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27118000/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

This epidemiological and clinical reality results in many conceptual hesitations. We first will summarize how the different (versions of the) classification systems do not seem to have been successful in their attempts to delineate the blurred line between depression and anxiety, before questioning whether a dialogue with a more phenomenological or psychopathological approach could be helpful in understanding the articulation between both affective phenomena, as well as in bridging neurobiological research and clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32436448/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

This study aims to provide a recent mental health screening prevalence, including anxiety and depression screening in the general public and to explore the associated risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted, employing a phone interview survey with 6,015 participants, using a quota sampling strategy to ensure equal representation of both sexes and administrative regions. The study assessed the prevalence of MDD and GAD risk and examined demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors associated with these mental health disorders. The national prevalence of people at risk of MDD and GAD were found to be 12.7 and 12.4%, respectively. Low diagnosis and treatment rates were observed, with only 1.5 and 0.5% of participants currently diagnosed and treated for depression and anxiety, respectively. Risk factors for MDD and GAD included female sex, lower education and income levels, smoking, and waterpipe use. Protective factors included physical activity, participation in volunteering activities and the practice of daily hobbies in the last 30 days. The relatively high prevalence of MDD and GAD risk and low diagnosis and treatment rates in Saudi Arabia emphasize the need for increased mental health promotion, early detection, and treatment accessibility. The study highlights the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors and fostering protective factors through targeted interventions.

A total of 340 patients completed a survey assessing mental health using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Major Depression Inventory. Quality of life was measured with the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire and the European Quality-of-Life visual analogue scale. To assess stigmatization, validated questions from the Danish Nationwide Survey of Patient Experiences were used. Predictors associated with anxiety, hopelessness, and depression were analysed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Overall, 15% of the patients had moderate or severe anxiety, 3% had moderate or pronounced hopelessness, and 8% had moderate or severe depression. The prevalence of all three was highest in patients with cirrhosis and was associated with a low quality of life. More patients with cirrhosis had perceived stigmatization compared to patients with liver disease without cirrhosis, which affected their self-perception, and more than one-third of the patients refrained from telling others about their liver disease.

To address this need, the current study undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 studies involving 88,336 persons examining the prospective relationship between anxiety and depression at both symptom and disorder levels. Using mixed-effect models, results suggested that all types of anxiety symptoms predicted later depressive symptoms (r = .34), and all types of depressive symptoms predicted later anxiety symptoms (r = .31). Although anxiety symptoms more strongly predicted depressive symptoms than vice versa, the difference in effect size for this analysis was very small and likely not clinically meaningful. Additionally, all types of diagnosed anxiety disorders predicted all types of later depressive disorders (OR = 2.77), and all depressive disorders predicted later anxiety disorders (OR = 2.73). Most anxiety and depressive disorders predicted each other with similar degrees of strength, but depressive disorders more strongly predicted social anxiety disorder (OR = 6.05) and specific phobia (OR = 2.93) than vice versa. Contrary to conclusions of prior reviews, our findings suggest that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia, whereas other anxiety and depressive disorders are bidirectional risk factors for one another.

The forms were sent over the internet to the officials responsible for medical education at universities in various regions of Turkey. A total of 2,778 medical faculty students were included in the study. Students were asked to fill out the sociodemographic data form, the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) Test. Students' 67.3% were female and 31.7% were male. About 90.2% of the students in the PHQ-9 scale had depressive symptoms in the major depressive disorder (MDD) dimension, and 44.5% in the GAD-7 scale had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Gender, being a preclinical student, history of psychiatric treatment in the past, currently receiving psychiatric treatment, death of someone due to pandemic, economic and health situation, perception of mental health were found associated with MDD and Moderate/Severe Anxiety symptoms. Students with Anxiety and MDD reported significantly more anxiety about contamination and negative beliefs about precautions' sufficiency. It was determined that medical school students in our country showed anxiety and depression at a remarkable level during the pandemic. Examining the underlying causes of these high rates will be beneficial in terms of taking precautions during the long-term pandemic.

Eight items were identified for the final screener: four items from the Patient Health Questionniare-9, two from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and two from the global depression literature. A cut-score of 7 was found to consistently increase the diagnostic likelihood of having a particular disorder.

However, past research has relied on nonclinical samples and nonspecific depression measures, raising the question of whether these features are unique to depression vis-à-vis frequently co-occurring conditions, especially anxiety. Using structured questions about recent life changes or difficulties, we interviewed a sample of individuals with varying levels of depression and anxiety (<i>N</i> = 486), including individuals in a major depressive episode (<i>n</i> = 228) and/or diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (<i>n</i> = 273). Interviews were transcribed to provide a natural language sample. Analyses isolated language features associated with gold standard, clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety. Many language features associated with depression were in fact shared between depression and anxiety. Language markers with relative specificity to depression included <i>I-usage</i>, <i>sadness</i>, and decreased <i>positive emotion,</i> while <i>negations</i> (e.g., \"not,\" \"no\"), <i>negative emotion,</i> and several emotional language markers (e.g., <i>anxiety, stress, depression</i>) were relatively specific to anxiety. Several of these results were replicated using a self-report measure designed to disentangle components of depression and anxiety. We next built machine learning models to detect severity of common and specific depression and anxiety using only interview language. Individuals' speech characteristics during this brief interview predicted their depression and anxiety severity, beyond other clinical and demographic variables. Depression and anxiety have partially distinct patterns of expression in spoken language. Monitoring of depression and anxiety severity via language can augment traditional assessment modalities and aid in early detection.

To identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in staff working in ICUs in nine English hospitals during June and July 2020. An anonymized brief web-based survey comprising standardized questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), well-being and alcohol use was administered to staff. Seven hundred and nine participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) doctors, 344 (49%) nurses and 74 (10%) other healthcare staff. Over half (59%) reported good well-being; however, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6%), PTSD (40%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%). Thirteen per cent of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past 2 weeks. Within the sample used in this study, we found that doctors reported better mental health than nurses across a range of measures. We found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in nurses. Whilst further work is needed to better understand the real level of clinical need amongst ICU staff, these results indicate the need for a national strategy to protect the mental health, and decrease the risk of functional impairment, of ICU staff whilst they carry out their essential work during COVID-19.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33434920/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

People's life pressures are increasing as society develop, resulting in a series of adverse emotions. If it is not paid attention to for a long time, it will lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. Depression and anxiety can occur separately or simultaneously, both of which are highly correlated. In recent years, the incidence of T2DM with the state of depression and anxiety has increased significantly. According to recent research, the state of depression and anxiety might increase the prevalence of T2DM and accelerate its progression by influencing patient's behavioral style and biological mechanisms. T2DM can also aggravate patients' state of depression and anxiety, worsening their life quality. However, few reviews have discussed the association between T2DM and the state of depression and anxiety. In order to reduce the prevalence of the two diseases, we ought to investigate them more thoroughly so that readers can recognize the close connection between the two and take appropriate interventions. Therefore, this article mainly discusses the interaction between T2DM and the state of depression and anxiety from behavioral and biological mechanisms, the effects of common hypoglycemic drugs on the state of depression and anxiety, and the effects of antidepressant anxiety treatments on T2DM. These three aspects are intended to shed light on the interaction between the two so as to find the appropriate interventions to reduce morbidity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40419162/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

However, none of the included studies exclusively targeted paternal mental health. Instead, they addressed paternal well-being indirectly by focusing on the mother, infant, or couple relationship. Studies did not require fathers to meet criteria for depression at baseline. This may have resulted in a selection bias, whereby the included fathers may not have required any treatment. We were also unable to perform additional statistical analyses because of the limited research available as well as the inconsistent outcome measures.

The present study therefore sought to identify predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms among U.S. adults with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online between October and December 2020. U.S. adults with disabilities (<i>n</i> = 441) completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, psychosocial processes, and a range of demographic and disability characteristics. In our sample, 61.0% and 50.0% of participants met criteria for a probable diagnosis of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Participants also experienced significantly higher levels of disability-related stigma and social isolation compared to prepandemic norms. Hierarchical regression analyses identified higher social isolation, presence of chronic pain, younger age, higher disability-related stigma, and higher worries about contracting COVID-19 as significant predictors of both depression and anxiety symptoms. This study highlights important demographic and psychosocial predictors of mental health risks for people with disabilities in the context of COVID-19. Findings further underscore the need to attend to those at elevated risk within the disability community as rehabilitation professionals, disability organizations, and policy makers work to support people with disabilities in postpandemic recovery and create a more equitable response to ongoing and future public health crises.

Then, they viewed a series of neutral and sexual films. They were instructed to increase or decrease their sexual arousal or respond \"as usual\" to the sexual films. They reported their sexual arousal after each film. Outcomes assessed included mental health (depression and anxiety) and sexual health (orgasm quality, ability to regulate sexual response to sex films). Reported sexual arousal was analyzed for the regulation task. Most women (64%) reported that clitoral and vaginal stimulation contributed to their usual method of reaching orgasm. Women who reported that clitoral stimulation was primarily responsible for their orgasm reported a higher desire to self-stimulate and demonstrated greater control over their self-reported sexual arousal. The primary stimulation site for orgasm was unrelated to measurements of depression or anxiety despite sufficient statistical power. Most women reported that clitoral and vaginal stimulation is important in orgasm. Women experience orgasms in many varied patterns, a complexity that is often ignored by current methods of assessing orgasm source. The reported source of orgasm was unrelated to orgasm intensity, overall sex-life satisfaction, sexual distress, depression, or anxiety.

It has been suggested that living with someone with depression is comparable to that of other serious mental health problems, such as schizophrenia or dementia. This meta-ethnography included 15 studies exploring experiences of living with a relative or partner with depression. Studies were heterogeneous regarding types of relationship with the depressed individual. The synthesis revealed a cyclical, psychosocial process that family caregivers undergo whilst providing care to a person with depression. The process consists of four phases: making sense of depression; changes in family dynamics; overcoming challenges; and moving forward. The findings illustrate that care giving is not a static process and that the needs of the depressed person are constantly changing. Some of the studies presented in the review represent caregivers recruited via support groups and so the person cared for may not have had professional diagnoses of depression. This synthesis indicated the need for professional support to be available to caregivers for their own mental health needs. The model put forward suggests that different types of support may be useful for caregivers at different stages of the process including couples or systemic therapy at the initial stages of management, addressing stigma to help those overcoming challenges of caring for their partner or relative and self-compassionate approaches for caregivers who may need support to look after themselves, avoid feelings of guilt and move forward towards acceptance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26706831/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Of the 1274 articles identified, seventeen met eligibility criteria and were included. All reported depression outcomes and ten reported anxiety or total mood disturbance. Compared with a control condition, almost half (47%) of the studies observed significant effects on depression scores in favour of the treatment group. The remaining studies reported a null effect. Effective dietary interventions were based on a single delivery mode, employed a dietitian and were less likely to recommend reducing red meat intake, select leaner meat products or follow a low-cholesterol diet. Although there was a high level of heterogeneity, we found some evidence for dietary interventions improving depression outcomes.

{"id": "38351574", "title": "Can Muscular Parameters Predict Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression?", "text": "Major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders are among the major public health issues. Therefore, identifying predictors of symptoms of depression and anxiety holds fundamental importance to avoid the aggravation of these conditions. Muscle strength and function (e.g., handgrip strength and timed-stands test) are widely recognized predictors of health outcomes; however, their association with symptoms of depression and anxiety is still not completely understood. This study investigated the associations between handgrip strength and timed-stands test scores with symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, we examined whether individuals exhibiting greater strength levels demonstrate reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with lower levels of strength. This is a community-based, cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited through social media and underwent a semi-structured interview to record sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, use of tobacco and medication, and symptoms of anxiety (Beck's Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and depression (Beck's Depressive Inventory [BDI]). Subsequently, anthropometric characteristics, handgrip strength, and functionality (i.e., timed-stands test) were assessed. In all, 216 individuals were evaluated. The adjusted regression model showed an inverse association between handgrip strength and anxiety (β = -0.22; 95% CI [-0.38, -0.07]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.07, <i>p</i> = .005) and depression symptoms (β = -0.25; 95% CI [-0.42, -0.07]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.05, <i>p</i> = .006). Similarly, timed-stands test scores were associated with anxiety (β = -0.33; 95% CI [-0.54, -0.13]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.09, <i>p</i> = .002) and depression (β = -0.32; 95% CI [-0.56, -0.09]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.06, <i>p</i> = .008).

Perinatal depression has adverse effects on the physical and mental health of mothers and children. However, according to current researches, Yoga has been considered as an effective exercise that can help pregnant women to regulate their emotions. Thus, this review reports the effectiveness of yoga on perinatal depression. We reviewed all of the relevant RCT (Randomized Control Trial, RCT) studies published until June 2021 from the major open-access databases. 12 RCTs were selected and included in this study, and the total number of people included in the analysis in the combined study was 594. The level of depression and anxiety of participants was evaluated using detailed and recognized scale. Compared with the control group, the yoga intervention group indicates a statistically significant decrease in depression levels (SMD (Standardised Mean Difference, SMD), -2.31; 95% CI, -3.67 to -0.96; P=0.139) and anxiety (SMD, -4.75; 95% CI, -8.3 to -1.19; P=0.002). In addition, we also conducted a subgroup analysis according to the type of population. The subgroup analysis successfully reduced the level of heterogeneity and the results indicated that the difference in population types in the combined analysis leads to the higher heterogeneity. The SMD value for healthy women is -2.3 (95% CI, -4.83 to 0.23) and for depressed women is -9.02 (95% CI, -11.42 to -6.62). Finally, the meta-analysis results of the self-control group prove that yoga can reduce the depression scores (SMD, 5.23; 95% CI, 1.90 to 8.56; P=0.049) compared with baseline. Yoga can effectively relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety in the perinatal period, which can be used as an auxiliary treatment option clinically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35772128/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

A recently developed computerized adaptive mental health assessment tool (computerized adaptive test-mental health [CAT-MH]) allows rapid, precise, and accurate assessment of numerous mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, without the need for a trained interviewer. The goal of this investigation was to determine the feasibility of administering CAT-MH for anxiety and depression in the preoperative setting and to obtain preliminary evidence of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in preoperative patients. In this prospective cohort study, 100 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled and asked to complete the CAT-MH in the preoperative clinic. Urgent and emergency surgeries were excluded as were pregnant patients. Primary feasibility outcomes were completion rate and time to completion. Secondary outcomes were prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression. All 100 enrolled patients completed the study. All patients were able to complete the mental health assessment (mean time: 3.6 ± 1.8 minutes standard deviation). Sixteen patients (16%) screened positive for anxiety (severity: mild, n = 7 [7%]; moderate, n = 7 [7%]); severe, n = 2 [2%]); 12 of 16 (75%) did not have a previous diagnosis of anxiety disorder.

Pregnant and up to 3 months postpartum women, older than 18 years of age. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) were used to assess mental health status. Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models were performed to identify factors associated with poor mental health. 5210 women participated (including 3411 pregnant and 1799 postpartum women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (EDS ≥13) was 16.1% in the pregnancy group and 17.0% in the postpartum . Moderate to severe generalised anxiety symptoms (GAD ≥10) were found among 17.3% of the pregnant and 17.7% of the postpartum women. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a pre-existing mental illness, a chronic somatic illness, having had COVID-19 or its symptoms, smoking, unplanned pregnancy and country of residence. Among COVID-19 restrictive measures specific to perinatal care, pregnant and postpartum women were most anxious about not having their partner present at the time of delivery, that their partner had to leave the hospital early and to be separated from their newborn after the delivery. Approximately one in six pregnant or postpartum women reported major depression or anxiety symptoms during the third wave of the pandemic. These findings suggest a continued need to monitor depression and anxiety in pregnancy and postpartum populations throughout and in the wake of the pandemic.

Approximately one-third of the veterans reported SI. In multivariate models, PTSD and anxiety diagnoses, severe depression symptoms, being married, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with more mental health visits in the subsequent year. Depression, PTSD, and anxiety diagnoses, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with receiving antidepressants. Presence of SI did not significantly affect subsequent year mental health utilization when adjusting for diagnostic and clinician variables, but inaugural visits involving mental health clinicians were consistently associated with subsequent mental health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24726814/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Studies are included for review when the published paper included an anxiety disorder or depression as the treatment focus, or as part of outcome measurement. Relaxed criteria were used to select studies including relevant single-cases, case series and single group studies along with studies that employed control groups. Twenty-four studies were identified. Twelve papers were of a single-case design (with or without replication). Two papers used uncontrolled single groups and ten studies used a control group. There were a total of 507 people in the various treatment and control groups, which ranged in size from 6 to 67 persons. All participants in the study had an ABI. Our review indicates CBT often shows a within-group pre- to post-treatment statistical difference for depression and anxiety problems, or a statistical difference between CBT-treated and non-treated groups. For studies that targeted the treatment of depression with CBT, effect-sizes ranged from 0 to 2.39 with an average effect-size of 1.15 for depression (large effect). For studies that targeted the treatment of anxiety with CBT, effect-sizes ranged from 0 to 3.47 with an average effect-size of 1.04 for anxiety (large effect). However, it was not possible to submit all twenty-four studies identified to effect-size analysis. Additionally, it is clear that CBT is not a panacea, as studies frequently indicate only partial reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms. This review suggests that if CBT is aimed at, for example, anger management or coping, it can be effective for anger or coping, but will not generalise to have an effect on anxiety or depression. CBT interventions that target anxiety and depression specifically appear to generate better therapeutic effects on anxiety and depression. Gaps in the literature are highlighted with suggestions for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23121258/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Recent research has shown that the affective state of stress is also present during the perinatal period and thus may add to a broader understanding of perinatal distress. The aims of the present study were to investigate the changes in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms across pregnancy, and to explore the prospective relationships between these symptoms. Two-hundred and fourteen pregnant women were recruited when they were less than 16 weeks gestation. Women completed depression, anxiety and stress measures on a monthly basis, from 16 weeks gestation through to 36 weeks gestation. The covariate measures of sleep quality and social support were assessed bi-monthly at 16, 24 and 32 weeks gestation. Levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were all shown to change over time, with women experiencing fewer symptoms during the middle of their pregnancy. Higher symptoms early in pregnancy predicted higher symptom levels throughout the rest of pregnancy. Higher depression scores early in pregnancy were also shown to predict higher anxiety and higher stress scores in late pregnancy. Increased stress scores during mid pregnancy also predicted higher anxiety scores in late pregnancy. Current findings indicate that symptom levels of depression, anxiety and stress vary over the course of pregnancy. Increased depression in early pregnancy seemed to be particularly pertinent as it not only predicted later depression symptoms, but also increased anxiety and stress in late pregnancy. Collectively, these results further highlight the importance of emotional health screening early in pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240846/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

The primary outcome of interest was the development of MHI (anxiety, major depressive disorder, depressive disorder not elsewhere classified, neurotic depression, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and suicide) after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A total of 10,389 men (20.4%) developed MHI during the study period.

Mental disorder such as depression is an important yet often neglected NCD and is becoming a growing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden. This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. On the basis of the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey, our results indicate that these mental health conditions have significant impacts on the individual medical expenditure, and they jointly contribute to 14.7% of total personal expected medical spending in China, with depression and depressive symptoms accounting for 6.9% and 7.8%, respectively. Given that patients with mental illness face multiple psychological and institutional barriers in seeking appropriate treatment, the high depression-induced medical costs may be primarily driven by the cost-shifting effect from mental health care to general health care, as mental disorders often coexist with other NCDs such as diabetes and hypertension. As an implication, our study calls for an urgent reform of China's mental health and insurance systems to remove the policy-induced obstacles for the access to mental health care resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28990318/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Depression and anxiety may occur together representing comorbid 'pure' conditions, or anxiety may predispose depression (or vice versa), or symptoms of anxiety and depression may be external manifestations of one underlying cause, or there may be an overlap of classifications. It is also possible that a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder exists: the association of subthreshold depressive symptoms and subthreshold depressive anxiety.

Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions-with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter.

We enrolled 200 pregnant women living with HIV from antenatal care clinics in the Kilimanjaro region. Women were eligible if they were in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and had been in PMTCT care for a minimum of one month. Data were collected via interviewer administered surveys. Participants self reported depression symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS) and anxiety symptoms (Brief Symptom Index, BSI). Multivariate logistic regression models examined factors associated with depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety. 25.0% of women met screening criteria for depression (EPDS ≥10). Depression was significantly associated with being single (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.1-15.5), food insecurity (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0-6.4), and HIV shame (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.3). 23.5% of participants met screening criteria for anxiety (BSI ≥1.01).

Following current developments in this field, studies were classified as 'mechanistic' or 'predictor' studies (i.e., informing neurobiological models about putative mechanisms versus aiming to provide predictive information). Mechanistic evidence points toward a dual-process model of psychotherapy in anxiety disorders with abnormally increased limbic activation being decreased, while prefrontal activity is increased. Partly overlapping findings are reported for depression, albeit with a stronger focus on prefrontal activation following treatment. No studies directly comparing neural pathways of psychotherapy between anxiety and depression were detected. Consensus is accumulating for an overarching role of the anterior cingulate cortex in modulating treatment response across disorders. When aiming to quantify clinical utility, the need for single-subject predictions is increasingly recognized and predictions based on machine learning approaches show high translational potential. Present findings encourage the search for predictors providing clinically meaningful information for single patients.

Study quality was evaluated using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies, and the modified Down's and Black checklist for interventional studies. Of 1827 titles initially identified, 42 were included in the systematic review. They comprised of four interventions (one RCT, three non-RCTs) and 38 observational studies (33 cross sectional, five prospective). In studies with DR/DME as the exposure (n = 28), its severity and related vision impairment were consistently associated with poor psychosocial outcomes, mostly higher incidence of depression and depressive symptoms. Baseline depression and depressive symptoms were also associated with greater DR incidence and progression of DR. Medical intervention strategies showed significant improvement in psychosocial outcomes in patients with DR, such as significant improvements in mental health domain scores of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ 25). Severity of DR, DME and associated vision loss are significantly associated with poor psychosocial outcomes. Aspects of depression and its symptoms show a bi-directional association, with increased incidence and progression of DR significant in those with baseline depression or depressive symptoms. Based on these findings, we propose two areas that may benefit from targeted interventions: (1) Prevention of development of poor psychological outcomes by preventing and delaying progression of DR/DME; and (2) Improved detection and management of poor psychological functioning by improving screening tools and multidisciplinary care for patients.

By removing mood and anxiety diagnostic criteria, the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) aims to delineate a distinct PTSD phenotype. We examined the effect of implementing ICD-11 criteria on rates of codiagnosed depression and anxiety in survivors with recent PTSD. Participants were 1,061 survivors of traumatic injury admitted to acute care centers in Israel. ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnostic rules were applied to the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV. Co-occurring disorders were identified using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Depression severity was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Assessments were performed 0-60 (\"wave 1\") and 90-240 (\"wave 2\") days after trauma exposure. Participants identified by ICD-11 PTSD criteria were equally or more likely than those identified by the ICD-10 alone to meet depression or anxiety disorder diagnostic criteria (for wave 1: depressive disorders, OR [odds ratio] = 1.98, 95% CI [confidence interval] = [1.36, 2.87]; anxiety disorders, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = [0.67, 1.64]; for wave 2: depressive disorders, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = [1.00, 2.91]; anxiety disorders, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = [0.54, 2.01]). ICD-11 PTSD was associated with higher BDI scores (M = 23.15 vs. 17.93, P < 0.001 for wave 1; M = 23.93 vs. 17.94, P < 0.001 for wave 2). PTSD symptom severity accounted for the higher levels of depression in ICD-11 PTSD.

Our findings suggested that sociotropy and autonomy may be associated with both depressive and anxious symptoms in patients with MDD and with GAD. Multiple mediation analyses indicated that brooding always acted as a mediating link between personality vulnerabilities (sociotropy and autonomy) and depressive and anxiety symptoms, independently of the patient group. In addition, in patients with MDD and those with GAD, brooding and immature defenses functioned together by linking sociotropy and autonomy, respectively, with depressive symptoms. Our results also showed that, in patients with GAD, both types of rumination explained the relationship between sociotropy and autonomy and anxiety symptoms. Overall, our findings provided evidence of the transdiagnostic role of the brooding, linking the vulnerability of personality dimensions and emotional symptoms.

Five to twelve years later, women were screened with the Clinical Interview Schedule, Revised Anxiety Subscale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during the third trimester of 328 pregnancies. Preconception personality disorder was associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of antenatal anxiety symptoms, which remained with adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental disorder (adjusted OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.31-6.15). Preconception personality disorder was associated with doubled odds of antenatal depressive symptoms, however this was attenuated with adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental disorder (adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.81-4.81). Our findings are restricted to pregnant women aged 29-35 years. Anxiety and depression may have been under-identified because they were assessed at a single antenatal time point. Residual confounding of the associations by preconception common mental disorder at other time points may have occurred.

A Pubmed search was conducted for relevant original articles with emphasis on the past 5 years. The studies we identified indicate that psychiatric comorbidity negatively impacts the prognosis of COPD, as it is associated with reduced adherence to treatment, reduced physical activity and a general reduction in quality of life, in turn leading to more frequent exacerbations and increased severity of exacerbations (which are more likely to require hospitalization), resulting in increased mortality. Despite the evidence showing a high prevalence and exceedingly negative impact of depression and anxiety in patients with COPD, very few clinical trials (for both pharmacological and psychological treatments) with small sample sizes have been conducted in this population.

Research shows that depression exhibits disturbances in biological rhythms. Yet, the relationship between these biological rhythms and concomitant anxiety symptoms is insufficiently investigated in structured clinical assessments. This multicenter study, carried out in four Chinese hospitals, comprehensively examined the relationship between anxiety and disruptions in biological rhythms among patients with depression. The study encompassed 218 patients diagnosed with depression and 205 matched healthy controls. The Chinese version of the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry was utilized to evaluate the participants' biological rhythms, focusing on four dimensions: sleep, activity, social, and diet. In patients with depression, there is a significant positive correlation between the severity of anxiety symptoms and the disturbances in biological rhythms. The severity of anxiety and depression, along with the quality of life, are independently associated with disruptions in biological rhythms. The mediation model reveals that anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and biological rhythms. This research highlights the role of anxiety within the spectrum of depressive disorders and the associated disturbances in biological rhythms.

The treatment group was treated with biofeedback exercise twice a day for 7 days, supplemented with psychotherapy for a period of 2 months (half-month intervals for one time). Intestinal medications in the treatment group were stopped after one month of treatment. While for the control group, patients were maintained with gastrointestinal motivational drugs, probiotics, anti-anxiety and depression medications. Both groups reduced the dosage of anxiolytics and depressants after 3 months.

Pharmacological dissection of the \"neurotic\" disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that process different immediacies of threat. It is critical that each module can generate normal responses, symptoms of another syndrome, or syndromal responses. We discuss the resultant possibilities for comorbid dysfunction of these modules both with each other and with some disorders not usually classified as anxiety related. The simplest case is symptomatic fear/anxiety comorbidity, where dysfunction in one module results in excess activity in a second, otherwise normal, module to generate symptoms and apparent comorbidity. More complex is syndromal fear/anxiety comorbidity, where more than one module is concurrently dysfunctional. Yet more complex are syndromal comorbidities of anxiety that go beyond the two dimensional fear/anxiety systems: depression, substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our account of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-anxiety comorbidity entails discussion of the neuropsychology of externalizing disorders to account for the lack of anxiety comorbidity in some of these. Finally, we link the neuropsychology of disorder to personality variation, and to the development of a biomarker of variation in the anxiety system among individuals that, if extreme, may provide a means of unambiguously identifying the first of a range of anxiety syndromes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27739392/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

This cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted on patients consecutively admitted with a new or existing cardiac diagnosis to one of the four main hospitals in Nablus, Palestine over an eight-month period. Data was obtained from hospital medical charts and an in-person interview, using a structured questionnaire with a sequence of validated instruments. All subjects were screened for depression and anxiety using the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42). Multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors among four categories (socio-demographic, clinical, psychosocial, lifestyle) independently associated with depression and anxiety. In total, 1053 patients with a confirmed cardiac diagnosis were included in the study with a participation rate of 96%. Based on the CDS and DASS-42, 54% met the criteria for severe depression (CDS > 100) and 19.2% for severe-to-very severe anxiety (DASS-anxiety > 15), respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were more prevalent among females and less educated patients. Factors independently associated with both depressive and anxiety symptoms were post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, low level of self-esteem, high somatic symptoms, low physical and mental health component scores, active smoking, physical inactivity, and longer disease duration. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms also reported poor social support and lower resilience. There was a high level of depression and anxiety in this sample of cardiac patients.

Thirty-three studies (including totally 3,478 participants, 107 effect sizes) of true and quasiexperimental controlled trials were eligible and included for meta-analysis using robust variance estimation in meta-regression. Outcome indicators were geriatric depression and anxiety. An overall significant treatment effect was identified for geriatric depression and anxiety (d = 0.577, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.288, 0.867, p < .001). Outcomes, geographic area, participants' marriage, service setting, and types of control group were moderators for treatment effects. Subgroup analysis observed statistically significant effect size among studies in Taiwan, used innovative service methods and small group interventions. Both in-person, home-based interventions and interventions provided by nurse practitioners and specially trained providers were statistically significant. Psychosocial services can benefit Chinese geriatric populations. Innovative and culturally relevant programs received strongest research supports. Future research should incorporate social interaction as an important component for serving Chinese older adults' mental wellbeing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30753474/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}
{"id": "38381769", "title": "Negative affect variability differs between anxiety and depression on social media.", "text": "Negative affect variability is associated with increased symptoms of internalizing psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety). The Contrast Avoidance Model (CAM) suggests that individuals with anxiety avoid negative emotional shifts by maintaining pathological worry. Recent evidence also suggests that the CAM can be applied to major depression and social phobia, both characterized by negative affect changes. Here, we compare negative affect variability between individuals with a variety of anxiety and depression diagnoses by measuring the levels and degree of change in the sentiment of their online communications. Participants were 1,853 individuals on Twitter who reported that they had been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (A cohort, n = 896) or a depressive disorder (D cohort, n = 957). Mean negative affect (NA) and negative affect variability were calculated using the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), an accurate sentiment analysis tool that scores text in terms of its negative affect content. Findings showed differences in negative affect variability between the D and A cohort, with higher levels of NA variability in the D cohort than the A cohort, U = 367210, p < .001, r = 0.14, d = 0.25. Furthermore, we found that A and D cohorts had different average NA, with the D cohort showing higher NA overall, U = 377368, p < .001, r = 0.12, d = 0.21. Our sample is limited to individuals who disclosed their diagnoses online, which may involve bias due to self-selection and stigma. Our sentiment analysis of online text may not completely capture all nuances of individual affect. Individuals with depression diagnoses showed a higher degree of negative affect variability compared to individuals with anxiety disorders. Our findings support the idea that negative affect variability can be measured using computational approaches on large-scale social media data and that social media data can be used to study naturally occurring mental health effects at scale.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38381769/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

However, depression in this population remains difficult to assess and is undertreated. Current estimates suggest a 20 to 30% prevalence of depression that meets diagnostic criteria in this population. The extent of other psychopathology in patients with ESRD is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to expand the research on psychiatric complications of ESRD and examine the prevalence of a broad range of psychopathology in an urban hemodialysis center and their impact on quality of life. With the use of a clinician-administered semistructured interview in this randomly selected sample of 70 predominately black patients, >70% were found to have a psychiatric diagnosis. Twenty-nine percent had a current depressive disorder: 20% had major depression, and 9% had a diagnosis of dysthymia or depression not otherwise specified. Twenty-seven percent had a current major anxiety disorder. A current substance abuse diagnosis was found in 19%, and 10% had a psychotic disorder. The mean Beck Depression Inventory score was 12.1 +/- 9.8. Only 13% reported being in current treatment by a mental health provider, and only 5% reported being prescribed psychiatric medication by their physician. A total of 7.1% had compound depression or depression coexistent with another psychiatric disorder. The construct of depression was also disentangled from the somatic effects of poor medical health by demonstrating a unique relationship between depressive affect and depression diagnosis, independent of health status. This study also suggests the utility of cognitive variables as a meaningful way of understanding the differences between patients who have ESRD with clinical depression or other diagnoses and those who have no psychiatric comorbidity. The findings of both concurrent and isolated anxiety suggest that the prevalence of psychopathology in patients with ESRD might be higher than previously expected, and the disorders may need to be treated independently. In addition, the data suggest that cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques may be especially advantageous in this population of patients who are treated with many medications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17699455/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Cross-sectional anxiety and depression symptom data were collected using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview generating DSM IV diagnoses from inpatients of an oncology ward in the tertiary hospital. In all, 315 patients were interviewed. Fifty three (16.8%) were diagnosed with major depression, while 30 (9.5%) were found to have generalized anxiety disorder, three to ten times higher than their corresponding prevalence rates in the general population. Patients with depression or anxiety tend to be unemployed, in stage 4 cancer, who can develop these symptoms at any time from the onset of cancer diagnosis, even when perceived social support is strong. Oncology patients with depression were more likely to be in terminal stages of cancer and to correctly identify themselves to have mental health issues, than those without (p<0.01). The psychological impact of cancer is appreciable. The lack of identifiable risk factors makes the task of diagnosing psychiatric conditions in cancer patients an onerous one.

Patients with higher baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms were more likely to self-select into multiple forms of treatment, an effect driven by patients in the MHP as adjunctive treatment to in-person therapy and psychotropic medication. Patients in combined treatments had significantly higher depressive and anxiety symptoms across treatment, but all treatment groups had similar decreasing depressive and anxiety symptom trajectories. Exploratory analyses revealed differential treatment outcomes across treatment combinations. Patients in the MHP in combination with another treatment had higher rates of major depressive episodes, psychiatric hospitalization, and attempted death by suicide at baseline. Patients with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms tend to self-select into using DMHI in addition to more traditional types of treatment, rather than as a stand-alone intervention, and have more severe clinical characteristics.

It is important to explore biomarkers of anxiety and suicidal ideation in major depression. In this study we hypothesized that the volume of subregions of the amygdala might be indicators of anxiety and suicidal ideation in patients with major depression. We recruited 59 drug-naïve patients with first-episode depression who scored >17 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression, and 30 healthy controls to participate in a magnetic resonance imaging study. We examined the volume of sub-regions of the amygdala thought to be involved in processing anxious emotion in the depression and healthy control groups. We performed pair-wise comparisons of amygdala subfield volumes in patients with depression and healthy controls with an analysis of variance. We used logistic regression to test the relationship between suicidal ideation and anxious character with the volume of subregions of the amygdala. 1) We found a significant difference in the volumes of the left amygdala (P = 0.003) and right amygdala (P = 0.001) between the two groups. There are significant differences in the volumes of the sub-region of the left amygdala. 2) The volume of the left lateral nucleus (P<0.001), basal nucleus (P<0.001), accessory basal nucleus (P<0.05), left Paralaminar-nucleus (P<0.001), right lateral-nucleus (P<0.05), right basal-nucleus (P<0.05), right anterior-amygdaloid area AAA (P<0.05), right paralaminar-nucleus (P<0.001) in the depression group are larger than healthy controls, however the volumes of the central-nucleus (P<0.05), medial-nucleus (P<0.001) in both sides are decreased in the major depression group. 3) There is a significantly larger volume of right medial nucleus in the suicidal ideation group comparing the hopelessness (P = 0.026), and the depressive patients without hopeless thoughts (P = 0.004). 4) We found a negative relation between the left basal nucleus and anxiety (OR: 0.940, 95%CI: 0.891-0.991), and a positive relation between the accessory basal nucleus on the left side and anxiety (OR: 1.007, 95%CI: 1.002-1.158).

The dual-process model hypothesises that psychological therapy is associated with increased emotional-regulation in prefrontal brain regions and decreased implicit emotional-reactivity in limbic regions; however, research has yielded inconsistent findings. Meta-analyses of brain activity changes accompanying psychological therapy (22 studies, n = 352) and neural predictors of symptomatic improvement (11 studies, n = 293) in depression and anxiety were conducted using seed-based d mapping. Both resting-state and task-based studies were included, and analysed together and separately. The most robust findings were significant decreases in anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and insula activation after therapy. Cuneus activation was predictive of subsequent symptom change. The results are in agreement with neural models of improved emotional-reactivity following therapy as evidenced by decreased activity within the anterior cingulate and insula. We propose compensatory as well as corrective neural mechanisms of action underlie therapeutic efficacy, and suggest the dual-process model may be too simplistic to account fully for treatment mechanisms.

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with humanitarian workers (national and international staff, consultants, United Nations volunteers). We applied validated measures useful for this setting. We applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to fit models with high prediction accuracy for each outcome and used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to obtain final coefficients and perform inference. A total of 277 humanitarian workers employed by 45 organizations completed the survey (a response rate in the order of 10%). We estimated prevalence of PTSD (24%), depression (39%), anxiety disorder (38%), hazardous alcohol consumption in men (35%) and women (36%), and the burnout components emotional exhaustion (24%) and depersonalization (19%). Chronic stress exposure was positively associated with PTSD (p < .001), depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), emotional exhaustion (p < .01), and depersonalization (p < .001). We found no significant association between emotion focused and problem focused coping and mental health outcomes. Associations between dysfunctional coping and depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .01) were positive. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower risk of hazardous alcohol consumption (p < .001). Contrary to expectations, working directly with humanitarian aid beneficiaries was significantly associated with lower risk for emotional exhaustion (p < .01).

Outcomes were prescription of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs, as defined by the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) convention, for comorbid anxiety and depression (n = 1028), anxiety only (n = 718), and depression only (n = 484). Heritability of each outcome was estimated using twin modelling, and the influence of common genetic variation was assessed from polygenic scores (PGS) for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and 40 other traits. Heritability of comorbid anxiety and depression was 79% compared with 41% for anxiety and 50% for depression alone. The PGS for depressive symptoms likewise predicted more variation in comorbid anxiety and depression (adjusted odds ratio per SD PGS = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.43-1.63; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.031, ΔAUC = 0.044) than the other outcomes, with nearly identical results when comorbid anxiety and depression was defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio per SD PGS = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.53-1.90; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.036, ΔAUC = 0.051).

Adult burn survivors (n=157) were identified from a provincial burn registry and matched 1:5 with non-burn control subjects from the general population (matching variables age and gender). The prevalence of mental health outcomes and the rates of health care utilization between the groups were compared for the 2years pre and post index date using anonymously linked population-based administrative health care data. Rates were adjusted for age, gender and sociodemographic characteristics. While the burn cohort had an increased prevalence of mental health problems after burn compared to the control cohort, the burn group also had an increased prevalence of pre-burn depression (16.6% vs 7.8%; p=0.0005) and substance use disorders (8.9% vs 3.2%; p=0.001) when compared to controls. Once the pre-existing prevalence of mental illness was taken into account there was no significant change in the prevalence of mental health problems when comparing the burn group to controls over time. Although burns may not increase rates of mental health issues and health care utilization, burn survivors are a vulnerable group who already demonstrate increased rates of psychopathology and need for care.

Although omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are reported to be promising nutrients for treating depression, currently, there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of randomized control trials that provide critical evidence regarding the potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in elderly patients with depression. This analysis was conducted to provide evidence for the clinical application of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depressive symptoms of elderly subjects older than 65 years. Seven databases were searched from their inception date until September 2016. Following this search, 6 studies were selected, which included 4605 patients (mean age, 76.97 years; male-female ratio=3752:853; mean dose of omega 3 intake, 1.3 g/d). These results were divided into 2 categories: well-being mental health group and depressive group. In the well-being mental health group, the Hedges g was 0.12 (95% confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.29), which indicated no significant effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on depressed mood compared with placebo. In the depressive group, the pooled Hedges g was -0.94 (95% CI, -1.37 to -0.50]) for the random-effects model, which indicated a large effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on those with depressed mood compared with placebo.

A total of 109 participants (69.7% males), from four dialysis centers, completed the self-report symptom scales HADS and BDI. Depression and anxiety disorders were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, overall agreement, kappa and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were assessed. Depressive disorders were found in 22% of the patients based on the SCID-I, while anxiety disorders occurred in 17%. The optimal screening cut-off score for depression was ≥ 7 for the HADS depression subscale (HADS-D), ≥ 14 for the HADS-total, ≥ 11 for the CDI and ≥ 17 for the BDI. The optimal screening cut-off for anxiety was ≥ 6 for the HADS anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and ≥ 14 for the HADS-total. At cut-offs commonly used in clinical practice for depression screening (HADS-D: 8; BDI: 16), the BDI performed slightly better than HADS-D. The BDI, CDI and HADS demonstrated acceptable performance as screening tools for depression, as did the HADS-A for anxiety, in our sample of dialysis patients. The recommended cut-off scores for each instrument were: ≥ 17 for BDI, ≥ 11 for CDI, ≥ 7 for HADS depression subscale, ≥ 6 for HADS anxiety subscale and ≥ 14 for HADS total.

However, the association cannot be interpreted unambiguously as an exposure effect because a common set of genetic factors can simultaneously contribute to increased liability for symptoms of anxiety, negative affect, and the perception of discrimination. The present study elucidates the association between discrimination and anxiety/negative affect by implementing strict genetic controls in a large sample of adults. We used data from the biomarker project of the Study of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), a national probability sample of noninstitutionalized, English-speaking respondents aged 25 to 74 y. Participants who consented to provide genetic data were biologically unrelated and of European ancestry as determined by genotype principal components analysis (<i>n</i> = 1,146). A single structural regression model was fit to the data with three measures of discrimination specified to load onto a latent factor and six measures of anxiety and negative affect specified to load onto a second latent factor. After accounting for potential genetic confounds-polygenic scores for anxiety, depression, and neuroticism and the first five genetic principal components-greater discrimination was associated with greater anxiety/negative affect (β = 0.53, SE = 0.04, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Findings suggest that measures of perceived discrimination should be considered environmental risk factors for anxiety/negative affect rather than indices of genetic liability for anxiety, depression, or neuroticism.

Depressive symptoms and anxiety disorder were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), as well as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), respectively. Sport participation was assessed using a single question. Additionally, sociodemographic factors were assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate sport participation's associations with depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders separately, having controlled for all sociodemographic covariates. Among all study participants, those with less participation in sport-related activities had a greater likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms (Odd ratio [OR] for never = 2.07; OR for 1-3 times per month = 1.77; OR for 1-2 times per week = 1.77), as well as anxiety disorders (OR for never = 1.61; OR for 1-3 times per month = 1.69; OR for 1-2 times per week = 1.38).

Research on CCBT has found solid evidence for efficacy when the use of a therapeutic computer program is supported by a clinician or other helping professional. Lower levels of efficacy have been found when CCBT is used as a stand-alone treatment. Current CCBT programs have many desirable features; however, few of the current programs incorporate services such as artificial intelligence that have the potential to help improve communication with patients.

This study examined therapists' practice of assigning and reviewing action recommendations in therapy sessions, and how it correlates with patients' depression and anxiety outcomes. We analyzed 2,444 therapy sessions from community-based behavioral health programs. Machine learning models and natural language processing techniques were deployed to discern action recommendations and their subsequent reviews. The extent of the review was quantified by measuring the proportion of session dialogues reviewing action recommendations, a metric we refer to as \"review percentage\". Using Generalized Estimating Equations modeling, we evaluated the correlation between this metric and changes in clients' depression and anxiety scores. Our models achieved 76% precision in capturing action recommendations and 71.1% in reviewing them. Using these models, we found that therapists typically provided clients with one to eight action recommendations per session to engage in outside therapy. However, only half of the sessions included a review of previously assigned action recommendations. We identified a significant interaction between the initial depression score and the review percentage (p = 0.045). When adjusting for this relationship, the review percentage was positively and significantly associated with a reduction in depression score (p = 0.032). This suggests that more frequent review of action recommendations in therapy relates to greater improvement in depression symptoms. Further analyses highlighted this association for mild depression (p = 0.024), but not for anxiety or moderate to severe depression. An observed positive association exists between therapists' review of previous sessions' action recommendations and improved treatment outcomes among clients with mild depression, highlighting the possible advantages of consistently revisiting therapeutic homework in real-world therapy settings.

We examined the temporal correlation/coupling between depression and anxiety (called Depression-Anxiety Coupling Strength, DACS) as a predictor of relapse in patients with MDD. We followed 97 patients with remitted MDD for an average of 394 days. Patients completed weekly self-ratings of depression and anxiety symptoms using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). Using these longitudinal ratings we computed DACS as random slopes in a linear mixed effects model reflecting individual-specific degree of correlation between depression and anxiety across time points. We then tested DACS as an independent variable in a Cox proportional hazards model to predict relapse. A total of 28 patients (29 %) relapsed during the follow-up period. DACS significantly predicted confirmed relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5, 95 % CI [1.01, 2.22], p = 0.043; Concordance 0.79 [SE 0.04]). This effect was independent of baseline depressive or anxiety symptoms or their average levels over the follow-up period, and was identifiable more than one month before relapse onset. Small sample size, in a single study. Narrow phenotype and comorbidity profiles. DACS may offer opportunities for developing novel strategies for personalized monitoring, early detection, and intervention. Future studies should replicate our findings in larger, diverse patient populations, develop individual patient prediction models, and explore the underlying mechanisms that govern the relationship of DACS and relapse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38866253/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

Although impediments to good depression and anxiety outcomes exist for all older adults, they are even more pronounced for older Latinos, who tend to have fewer socioeconomic resources. These factors underscore the need for prevention-based interventions that are effective, scalable, relevant, respectful, and specific to this population. The Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA) program is a community health worker-led, multicomponent, health promotion intervention. The diverse needs and circumstances of older Latinos (highly sedentary, culture-specific health beliefs, service disparities) were incorporated into the design of HOLA to reduce risk factors and improve health-related outcomes associated with common mental disorders in this group. The authors describe HOLA (highlighted in this case example) and why health promotion interventions like HOLA may hold promise as effective, practical, and nonstigmatizing interventions for preventing common mental disorders in older Latinos who are at risk for developing these disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28760514/", "source_file": "pubmed_mental_health.jsonl"}

To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions.

The present observational study seeks to describe the use of a proprietary precision prescribing algorithm piloted during routine clinical practice as part of Brightside's telepsychiatry services. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this intervention. Secondary aims include exploring remission and symptom improvement rates. Participants were adult patients enrolled in Brightside who completed at least 12 weeks of treatment for depression and/or anxiety and received a prescription for at least one psychiatric medication. A prescription recommendation was made by Brightside's algorithm at treatment onset and was utilized for clinical decision support. Participants received baseline screening surveys of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, and at weeks 2,4,6,8,10 and 12. Intent-to-treat (ITT) sensitivity analyses were conducted. Feasibility of the implementation was measured by the platform's ability to enroll and engage participants in timely psychiatric care, as well as offer high touch-point treatment options. Acceptability was measured by patient responses to a 5-star satisfaction rating. Brightside accessed and treated 6248 patients from October 2018 to April 2021, treating a majority of patients within 4-days of enrollment. The average plan cost was $115/month. 89% of participants utilized Brightside's core medication plan at a cost of $95/month. 13.4% of patients in the study rated Brightside's services as highly satisfactory, averaging a 4.6-star rating. Furthermore, 90% of 6248 patients experienced a MCID in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score. Remission rates were 75% (final PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score < 10) for the study sample and 59% for the ITT sample. 69.3% of Brightside patients were treated with the medication initially prescribed at intake.

This study compared two commonly used scales, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), in relation to their measurement range and cut points to consider the relative prevalence of both constructs, and if prevalence rates may be due to scale-specific case definition. Patients meeting the criteria for RA were recruited in Leeds, UK and Sydney, Australia and asked to complete a survey that included both scales. The data was analysed using the Rasch measurement model. A total of 169 RA patients were assessed, with a repeat subsample, resulting in 323 cases for analysis. Both scales met Rasch model expectations.

Cut points for depression were comparable across the two scales while a lower cut point for anxiety in the DASS was required to equate prevalence. This study provides further support for high prevalence of depression and anxiety in RA. It also shows that while these two scales provide a good indication of possible depression and anxiety, the estimates of prevalence so derived could vary, particularly for anxiety.

Multifactorial discrimination predicted high depression scores, psychological well-being, and substance use disorder diagnosis. Discrimination was positively associated with risk factors for high depression scores: chronic strain and total number of stressful life events. Discrimination was associated with significantly lower levels of mastery and self-esteem, protective factors for depressive symptomatology. Even after controlling for risk factors, discrimination remained a significant predictor for high depression scores. Among subjects with low depression scores, multifactorial discrimination also predicted anxiety and aggregate mental health scores.

The burden of disability after a stroke is also large, and is increasing at a faster pace in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Alarmingly, the incidence of stroke is increasing in young and middle-aged people (ie, age <55 years) globally. Should these trends continue, Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 (reducing the burden of stroke as part of the general target to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030) will not be met. In this Commission, we forecast the burden of stroke from 2020 to 2050. We project that stroke mortality will increase by 50%—from 6·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6·0 million–7·1 million) in 2020, to 9·7 million (8·0 million–11·6 million) in 2050—with <b>disability-adjusted life-years</b> (DALYs) growing over the same period from 144·8 million (133·9 million–156·9 million) in 2020, to 189·3 million (161·8 million–224·9 million) in 2050. These projections prompted us to do a situational analysis across the four pillars of the stroke quadrangle: surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation. We have also identified the barriers to, and facilitators for, the achievement of these four pillars. DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS (DALYS): The sum of the years of life lost as a result of premature mortality from a disease and the years lived with a disability associated with prevalent cases of the disease in a population. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health On the basis of our assessment, we have identified and prioritised several recommendations. For each of the four pillars (surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation), we propose pragmatic solutions for the implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce the global burden of stroke. The estimated direct (ie, treatment and rehabilitation) and indirect (considering productivity loss) costs of stroke globally are in excess of US$891 billion annually. The pragmatic solutions we put forwards for urgent implementation should help to mitigate these losses, reduce the global burden of stroke, and contribute to achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, the WHO Intersectoral Global Action Plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders (2022–2031), and the WHO Global Action Plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Reduction of the global burden of stroke, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, by implementing primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies and evidence-based acute care and rehabilitation services is urgently required. Measures to facilitate this goal include: the establishment of a framework to monitor and assess the burden of stroke (and its risk factors) and stroke services at a national level; the implementation of integrated population-level and individual-level prevention strategies for people at any increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, with emphasis on early detection and control of hypertension; planning and delivery of acute stroke care services, including the establishment of stroke units with access to reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke and workforce training and capacity building (and monitoring of quality indicators for these services nationally, regionally, and globally); the promotion of interdisciplinary stroke care services, training for caregivers, and capacity building for community health workers and other health-care providers working in stroke rehabilitation; and the creation of a stroke advocacy and implementation ecosystem that includes all relevant communities, organisations, and stakeholders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37827183/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Ischaemic stroke accounts for about 60%-80% of all strokes. It is of considerable significance to carry out multidimensional management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases. This evidence-based guideline aims to provide the latest detailed and comprehensive recommendations on the diagnosis, treatment and secondary prevention of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases. We had performed comprehensive searches of MEDLINE (via PubMed) (before 30 June 2019), and integrated the relevant information into charts and distributed to the writing group. Writing group members discussed and determined the recommendations through teleconference. We used the level of evidence grading algorithm of Chinese Stroke Association to grade each recommendation. The draft was reviewed by the Guideline Writing Committee of Chinese Stroke Association Stroke and finalised. This guideline is fully updated every 3 years. This evidence-based guideline is based on the treatment, care and prevention of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases, which emphasises on pathogenesis evaluation, intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, antiplatelet therapy, prevention and treatment of complications, and risk factor management. This updated guideline presents a framework for the management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the effectiveness of interventions for ALS. Two systematic reviewers from Cochrane Response supported the guideline panel. The working group identified a total of 26 research questions, performed systematic reviews, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and made specific recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided where insufficient evidence was available. A guideline mapping effort revealed only one other ALS guideline that used GRADE methodology (a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guideline). The available evidence was scarce for many research questions. Of the 26 research questions evaluated, the NICE recommendations could be adapted for 8 questions. Other recommendations required updates of existing systematic reviews or de novo reviews. Recommendations were made on currently available disease-modifying treatments, multidisciplinary care, nutritional and respiratory support, communication aids, psychological support, treatments for common ALS symptoms (e.g., muscle cramps, spasticity, pseudobulbar affect, thick mucus, sialorrhea, pain), and end-of-life management.

These challenges reflect not only the growing public health effect of dementia in an aging global population, but also more specific ethical complexities including early loss of patients' capacity to make decisions regarding their own care, the stigma often associated with a dementia diagnosis, the difficulty of balancing concern for patients' welfare with respect for patients' remaining independence, and the effect on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of family caregivers. Caring for patients with dementia requires respecting patient autonomy while acknowledging progressively diminishing decisional capacity and continuing to provide care in accordance with other core ethical principles (beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence). Whereas these ethical principles remain unchanged, neurologists must reconsider how to apply them given changes across multiple domains including our understanding of disease, clinical and legal tools for addressing manifestations of illness, our expanding awareness of the crucial role of family caregivers in providing care and maintaining patient quality of life, and societal conceptions of dementia and individuals' personal expectations for aging. This revision to the American Academy of Neurology's 1996 position statement summarizes ethical considerations that often arise in caring for patients with dementia; although it addresses how such considerations influence patient management, it is not a clinical practice guideline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34524968/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Von Monakow (1885) and Dejerine and Vialet (1893) gave the first descriptions of patients with cortical blindness who were unaware of their disability, but did not distinguish this unawareness from the rest of the clinical description. Anton (1999) described patients with cortical deafness and cortical blindness, considering these defects of awareness as a symptom independent from the neurological dysfunction. He conceptualized them as a phenomenon in its own right and tried to link this unawareness of a disability with specific neuro-anatomical changes. Finally, Babinski (1914) coined the term \"anosognosia\" to designate the clinical entity conceptualized by Anton (1899) and extended this concept from the unawareness of cortical deafness and blindness to the unawareness of hemiplegia. The choice of the term \"anosognosia\" to denote the observed phenomenon was important, because referring to \"lack of knowledge of the disease\" (anosognosia), he not only emphasized the separation between \"lack of knowledge\" and \"disease, \" but also suggested a general use of this term, because disease can refer to many other disabilities besides hemiplegia. Further investigations have shown that: (a) brain-damaged patients may be unaware of different kinds of disabilities; (b) anosognosia can be selective, in that an affected person with multiple impairments may be unaware of only one handicap, while appearing fully aware of any others; and (c) lack of acknowledgment of a disease may not necessarily be due to a defective awareness, but must sometimes be considered as an extreme but understable pattern of adaptation to stress. For this condition, the term \"Denial of Illness\" seems preferable to that of anosognosia.

In line with this uniformity, and also with Charcot's concept of hysteria as a functional disorder, neuroimaging studies suggest that for some of these disorders, there might be some changes of neural connectivity in specific pathways at the origin of the behavioral aspects.

Using the term \"cholestérine\" (cholesterin), the name of cholesterol at the time, he identified the biological nature of atheromatous plaques, and made detailed drawings. This observation, included in the famous thesis of Ivan Poumeau, indicates that Charcot did not neglect cerebrovascular pathology, ischemic in this case, but also pathology caused by hemorrhaging, as in the thesis of Charles Bouchard.

Charcot considered hysteria as a physiologic disorder that affected specific neuroanatomic areas of the brain comparable to the same areas that were damaged by structural neurologic disorders provoking the same or similar signs. He considered hysteria primarily a hereditary disorder, but environmental factors including physical and emotional stress served as provoking factors. Charcot drew the strict distinction between hysteria and consciously simulated neurologic disorders, although he was keenly aware that the two disorders could occur in the same patients or be difficult to distinguish at times.

Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis, written responses in comment sections were analyzed using content analysis. Thirty-two of 42 (73%) surveys were completed. Nine (45%) residents and 5 (42%) experienced providers responded that virtual rounds did not compromise learning and education on stroke service. Fifteen (75%) residents and all experienced providers agreed that virtual rounds protected caregivers from exposure to the virus. While more than a third of residents (37%) did not feel comfortable utilizing telemedicine in ED, the majority of experienced providers (89%) were at ease with it. A total of 58% of residents and 67% of experienced providers felt that they were spending less time at the bedside, and 42% of residents and 58% of experienced providers felt less connected to patients during the pandemic.

Overall, most hospitals have neurology departments (162, 83.1%) while less than half of the hospitals have a stroke center (80, 41.0%) and neurology emergency department (46, 23.6%). Among 162 hospitals with neurology department, 5 were excluded due to inadequate sharing, leaving 157 hospitals for analysis. About 84.1% of these neurology departments can administer intravenous thrombolysis while about one third of them has the ability to perform arterial thrombectomy (36.9%). In addition, 46.2% of hospitals can carry out computed tomography angiography (CTA) in emergency room. Tertiary care hospitals are much more equipped with modern medical resources compared to the secondary hospitals. In four administrative regions, the neurology services are better in more economically advanced regions. Neurological care services need to be enhanced at the county-level hospitals to improve health care delivery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31744462/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Neglect has a significant impact on functional outcomes, so it is important to detect. However, there is no consensus on which are the best screening tests to administer to detect neglect in time-limited clinical environments. Members of the European Academy of Neurology Scientific Panel on Higher Cortical Functions, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, and researchers produced recommendations for primary and secondary tests for bedside neglect testing based on a rigorous literature review, data extraction, online consensus meeting, and subsequent iterations. A total of 512 articles were screened, and 42 were included. These reported data from 3367 stroke survivors assessed using 62 neglect screens. Tests were grouped into cancellation, line bisection, copying, reading/writing, and behavioral. Cancellation tasks were most frequently used (97.6% of studies), followed by bisection, copying, behavioral, and reading/writing assessments. The panel recommended a cancellation test as the primary screening test if there is time to administer only one test. One of several cancellation tests might be used, depending on availability. If time permits, one or more of line bisection, figure copying, and baking tray task were recommended as secondary tests. Finally, if a functional and ecological test is feasible, the Catherine Bergego Scale was recommended. Overall, the literature suggests that no single test on its own is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of neglect. Therefore, the panel recommended that multiple neglect tests should be used whenever possible. This study provides consensus recommendations for rapid bedside detection of neglect in real-world, clinical environments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510782/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Wearable sensors, which capture data continuously in natural settings, offer a non-invasive and objective alternative to traditional methods. This review examines the role of wearable sensors in various paediatric neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, Gaucher disease, headaches, and sleep disorders. The review highlights their application in tracking motor function, seizure activity, and daily movement patterns to gain insights into disease progression and therapeutic response.

They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of brain CT angiography (CTA) with and without CT perfusion (CTP) between neurology senior residents and stroke fellows. In this neuroimaging study, nine practitioners (four senior neurology residents (SNRs) and five stroke fellows (SFs)) clinically assessed and interpreted the imaging data of 50 cases (15 normal images, 21 large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and 14 medium vessel occlusions (MeVOs) in two sessions, 1 week apart in comparison to final diagnosis of experienced neuroradiologist and experienced stroke neurologist consensus. Interrater agreement of CTA alone and CTA with CTP was quantified using kappa statistics, sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. Overall, arterial occlusions were correctly identified in 221/315 (70.1%) with CTA alone and in 266/315 (84.4%) with CTA and CTP (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The sensitivity of overall arterial occlusions detection with CTA alone was 94.2% (95% CI: 90.8%-96.6%) while with addition of CTP was 98% (95% CI: 95.6%-99.3%), The specificity of CTA alone was 74.7% (95% CI: 67.2%-81.3%) which increased with CTP to 84.4% (95% CI: 77.7%-89.8%). The likelihood of correct identification with CTA alone was 156/189 (82.54%) for LVOs and 65/126 (51.59%) for MeVOs. This increased to 169/189 (89.42%; <i>p</i> = 0.054) for LVOs and 97/126 (76.98%; <i>p</i> < 0.001) for MeVOs when the CTA images with CTP were viewed. There was good overall interrater agreement between readers when using CTA alone (<i>k</i> 0.71, 95% CI, 0.62-0.80) and almost perfect (<i>k</i> 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76-0.94) when CTP was added to the image for interpretation.

The resulting draft document had further input from contributors outside the synergium. Recommendations of the Synergium are: Basic Science, Drug Development and Technology: There is a need to develop: (1) New systems of working together to break down the prevalent 'silo' mentality; (2) New models of vertically integrated basic, clinical, and epidemiological disciplines; and (3) Efficient methods of identifying other relevant areas of science. Stroke Prevention: (1) Establish a global chronic disease prevention initiative with stroke as a major focus. (2) Recognize not only abrupt clinical stroke, but subtle subclinical stroke, the commonest type of cerebrovascular disease, leading to impairments of executive function. (3) Develop, implement and evaluate a population approach for stroke prevention. (4) Develop public health communication strategies using traditional and novel (eg, social media/marketing) techniques. Acute Stroke Management: Continue the establishment of stroke centers, stroke units, regional systems of emergency stroke care and telestroke networks. Brain Recovery and Rehabilitation: (1) Translate best neuroscience, including animal and human studies, into poststroke recovery research and clinical care. (2) Standardize poststroke rehabilitation based on best evidence. (3) Develop consensus on, then implementation of, standardized clinical and surrogate assessments. (4) Carry out rigorous clinical research to advance stroke recovery. Into the 21st Century: Web, Technology and Communications: (1) Work toward global unrestricted access to stroke-related information. (2) Build centralized electronic archives and registries. Foster Cooperation Among Stakeholders (large stroke organizations, nongovernmental organizations, governments, patient organizations and industry) to enhance stroke care. Educate and energize professionals, patients, the public and policy makers by using a 'Brain Health' concept that enables promotion of preventive measures.

National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was assessed for the stroke severity. A total of 135 (20.9%) patients developed AKI. Patients with AKI stages from 1 to 3 were 84 (62.2%), 26 (19.3%), and 25 (18.5%), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for AKI were higher NIHSS score (OR, 1.027; 95% CI 1.003-1.051), lower baseline eGFR (OR, 0.985; 95% CI 0.977-0.993), the presence of hypertension (OR, 1.592; 95% CI 1.003-2.529), and infectious complications (OR, 3.387; 95% CI 1.997-5.803) (P < 0.05 for all). AKI patients were also significantly associated with all-cause mortality in the neurology ICU [OR and 95% CI of AKI-stage 1, AKI-stage 2, and AKI-stage 3 were 4.961 (2.191-11.232), 19.722 (6.354-61.217), and 48.625 (17.616-134.222), respectively (P < 0.001 for all)]. AKI is common among patients with stroke and is associated with worse clinical outcomes after stroke. Prevention of AKI seems to be very important among these patients, because they are exposed to many risk factors for developing AKI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656546/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

The following Wikipedia articles were considered: Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Dementia; Epilepsy; Epileptic seizure; Migraine; Multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; Stroke; Traumatic brain injury. We analyzed information regarding the total article views for 90 days and the rank of these articles among all those available in Wikipedia. We determined the highest search volume peaks to identify possible relation with online news headlines. No relation between incidence or prevalence of neurological disorders and the search volume for the related articles was found. Seven out of 10 neurological conditions showed relations in search volume peaks and news headlines. Six out of these seven peaks were related to news about famous people suffering from neurological disorders, especially those from showbusiness.

There is a growing body of literature that supports using ultrasonography to improve diagnostic accuracy and aid in performing procedures. Despite the increasing utilization of this imaging modality in medicine, there has been no comprehensive review of the clinical applications of ultrasound in the field of neurology. We discuss the current uses and limitations of ultrasound for various neurological conditions. We review the role for ultrasound in commonly performed neurologic procedures including lumbar puncture, botulinum toxin injections, nerve blocks, and trigger point injections. We specifically discuss the technique for ultrasound-assisted lumbar puncture and occipital nerve block as these are commonly performed. We then focus on the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of neurologic conditions. This includes neuromuscular diseases such as motor neuron disorders, focal neuropathies, and muscular dystrophy as well as vascular conditions such as stroke and vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage. We also address ultrasound's use in critically ill patients to aid in identifying increased intracranial pressure, hemodynamics, and arterial and/or venous catheterization.

The natural history of recovery from prolonged VS/UWS is better in traumatic than nontraumatic cases. MCS is generally associated with a better prognosis than VS (conclusions of low to moderate confidence in adult populations), and traumatic injury is generally associated with a better prognosis than nontraumatic injury (conclusions of low to moderate confidence in adult and pediatric populations). Findings concerning other prognostic features are stratified by etiology of injury (traumatic vs nontraumatic) and diagnosis (VS/UWS vs MCS) with low to moderate degrees of confidence.

With the development of clinical EEG, the definition of electroclinical complexes became an essential tool to define epileptic syndromes, particularly focal epileptic syndromes. Modern advances in diagnostic technology, particularly in neuroimaging and molecular biology, now permit better definitions of epileptic syndromes. At the same time detailed studies showed that there does not necessarily exist a one-to-one relationship between epileptic seizures or electroclinical complexes and epileptic syndromes. These developments call for the reintroduction of an epileptic seizure classification based exclusively on clinical semiology, similar to the seizure classifications which were used by neurologists before the introduction of the modern diagnostic methods. This classification of epileptic seizures should always be complemented by an epileptic syndrome classification based on all the available clinical information (clinical history, neurological exam, ictal semiology, EEG, anatomical and functional neuroimaging, etc.).

Yet apathy undoubtedly has an important impact on caregiver stress, functional disability and quality of life. A detailed clinical assessment can distinguish apathy from depression and allow clinicians to make practical suggestions to reduce the impact of symptoms on individual patients and their families. Pharmacological approaches to treatment include cholinesterase inhibitors, dopamine agonists and stimulants. CASE 1A 66-year-old man with progressive supranuclear palsy returned to clinic for review. His wife was upset and finding it difficult to cope. She described him as 'completely lazy', as he just sat in his chair all day watching television, even though he could still do things for himself. She felt that he could not be bothered to speak to her anymore because he was 'obsessed with TV'. He did not seem to engage with the visits to the grandchildren that she arranged. He said that he felt fine apart from the problems with his walking.The neurologist was confident that the patient was not depressed, and that the wife's concerns reflected the apathy that is often very pronounced in progressive supranuclear palsy. By explaining to the man's wife that these problems were due to his disease, their relationship improved and she felt more able to cope with caring for him. CASE 2A 75-year-old man attended clinic with his wife. She had worried about him for over a year, as he had become increasingly withdrawn. He used to enjoy going to the local pub but now stayed at home all day. He seemed less concerned about his personal appearance, about which he used to be meticulous. More recently, she had noticed that he had become forgetful. On examination, he had a mild episodic memory deficit but no impairments in other domains.He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment but the presence of apathy suggested a high risk of him developing Alzheimer's disease.

Although today we would classify the syndrome as a conversion disorder, it was considered a separate disease by Paul Blocq (1860-1896), who described this phenomenon as the inability to maintain an upright posture, despite normal function of the legs in the bed. Paul Blocq's original 1888 articles on astasia abasia were read, partly translated from French to English, and the cases were summarized. A review of a selection of the literature following Blocq's description on astasia abasia was performed. Present day literature was consulted as well. Blocq reviewed what was known about astasia abasia in two papers. Although he was the first to use the combined term astasia abasia, he referred to similar descriptions of Charcot, Richer, Mitchell, Jaccoud, Roméi, and Erlenmeyer. Blocq's contribution was in compiling the experiences and observations of preeminent 19th century neurologists. He recognized that paralysis, jumping, fits, tremor, and bizarre behavior could all be associated with the syndrome. He distinguished the disorder from hysteria. Moreover, he presented a formal delineation of the gait disorder and provided a pathophysiologic concept. Prognosis was considered favorable. Paul Blocq directed attention to psychogenic gait disorders by publishing a small case series on astasia abasia. Today, these case descriptions would be likely considered cases of conversion or psychogenic gait disorder, with or without other conversion/psychogenic movement disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17516452/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

However, the scale and complexity of these data make them difficult to interpret and require the use of sophisticated bioinformatics applied to extensive datasets, including whole exome and genome sequences. Detailed analysis of genetic data has shown that accurate phenotype information is essential for correct interpretation of genetic variants and might necessitate re-evaluation of the patient in some cases. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates bioinformatics, clinical evaluation, and human genetics can help to address these challenges. However, despite numerous studies that show the efficacy of next-generation sequencing in establishing molecular diagnoses, pathogenic mutations are generally identified in fewer than half of all patients with genetic neurological disorders, exposing considerable gaps in the understanding of the human genome and providing opportunities to focus research on improving the usefulness of genomics in clinical practice.

The spectrum of neurologic insults in children is diverse and clinical practice is largely empirical, as few randomized, controlled trials have been reported. This lack of data poses a substantial challenge to the practice of pediatric neurocritical care (PNCC). PNCC has emerged as a novel subspecialty, and its presence is expanding within tertiary care centers. This review highlights the recent advances in the field, with a focus on traumatic brain injury (TBI), cardiac arrest, and stroke as disease models. Variable approaches to the structure of a PNCC service have been reported, comprising multidisciplinary teams from neurology, critical care, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and anesthesia. Neurologic morbidity is substantial in critically ill children and the increased use of continuous electroencephalography monitoring has highlighted this burden. Therapeutic hypothermia has not proven effective for treatment of children with severe TBI or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, results of studies of severe TBI suggest that multidisciplinary care in the ICU and adherence to guidelines for care can reduce mortality and improve outcome. There is an unmet need for clinicians with expertise in the practice of brain-directed critical care for children. Although much of the practice of PNCC may remain empiric, a focus on the regionalization of care, creating defined training paths, practice within multidisciplinary teams, protocol-directed care, and improved measures of long-term outcome to quantify the impact of such care can provide evidence to direct the maturation of this field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26863153/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Childhood AIS is instead associated with a variety of conditions including cerebral arteriopathies, congenital heart disease, infection, head and neck trauma, sickle cell anemia, and prothrombotic abnormalities. Although the pathophysiology and outcomes of adult AIS differ significantly from those in childhood AIS, therapeutic management remains similar, largely because of the paucity of evidence from devoted pediatric observational studies and clinical trials. The purpose of this article is to review the current guidelines and evidence in the treatment of childhood AIS, within the context of that which exists in adult AIS. Medical management of hypoxia, hyperglycemia, fever, blood pressure, and increased intracranial pressure has been insufficiently investigated in childhood stroke, resulting in a lack of guidance in these areas. Although acute antithrombotic management in childhood AIS has received relatively greater attention in published recommendations, it is based almost exclusively on consensus and expert opinion, and differs considerably among existing pediatric guidelines. Rehabilitation therapy in childhood AIS has great potential for meaningful improvements in long-term outcomes, especially given the plasticity of the young brain; however, little guidance for rehabilitative measures is provided by published recommendations. Ongoing and future multicenter cohort study efforts, and ultimately devoted pediatric clinical trials, will be essential to establish comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of childhood AIS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18496844/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Likewise, it changed the perception of classical neurology practice, research, and the way of looking at age-related conditions. Neurological disorders are the most frequent cause of major disability in the elderly and account for almost half of the incapacitation occurring beyond age 65 and more than 90% of serious dependency. However, a number of neurological changes occur also in the absence of a specific disease, making the assessment and management of neurological complaints and findings a specific expertise. Maximizing success in clinical care of the elderly requires expertise in geriatric neurology, which includes an understanding of current research regarding aging and age-related neurological dysfunctions, and the ability to work with other geriatric healthcare providers. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases mainly offer symptomatic relief without slowing progression, the landscape is evolving. Biomarkers of pathology and neuroimaging have continued to develop, with a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment. These advances have not only helped to improve our knowledge of disease pathophysiology but also disease stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring, and possible therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage. Neurological disorders are a leading cause of major disability and dependency in the elderly, underscoring the need for expertise in geriatric neurology for effective clinical care of this population. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases primarily provide symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, advancements in biomarkers and neuroimaging are significantly evolving. These advancements enhance our understanding of disease pathophysiology and stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring and potential therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage.

The long history of astasia-abasia reveals a cluster of neurologists, often emerging from oblivion herein and all of whom, through the precision of their clinical examinations and their pathophysiological findings, helped advance the understanding of the mechanisms by which human beings are the only erect, constantly bipedal mammals, whether immobile or walking.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37030986/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Ozone therapy increases interest in new neuroprotective strategies that may represent therapeutic targets for minimizing the effects of oxidative stress. The overview examines the latest literature in neurological pathologies treated with ozone therapy as well as our own experience with ozone therapy. The effectiveness of treatments is connected to the ability of ozone therapy to reactivate the antioxidant system to address oxidative stress for chronic neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, and other pathologies. Application options include large and small autohemotherapy, intramuscular application, intra-articular, intradiscal, paravertebral and epidural, non-invasive rectal, transdermal, mucosal, or ozonated oils and ointments.

Interestingly, the prevalence of migraine among the headache specialists themselves is much higher than in the general population. Although triptans have revolutionized the acute treatment of migraine, treatment is still problematic for the sizable percentages of patients with an incomplete or no response and recurrence of headache. Triptans are generally very safe when the physician, aware of the potential for coronary artery vasoconstriction, appropriately screens patients before and during their use. Serotonin syndrome as a complication of triptan use is quite rare. Although there is no definite evidence of teratogenesis, triptans should not be taken during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Caution is also advised when using a triptan during breastfeeding. The United States Headache Consortium parameters, which consider indications for preventative treatment and propose general principles of management, are reviewed. Unfortunately, the experience of many migraineurs with preventative medications is less than satisfactory because of side effects or lack of efficacy. Treatment of both migraine with prolonged aura and basilar migraine is anecdotally based. Many headache specialists do not use beta blockers for prevention for those with prolonged aura and basilar migraines because of concerns over the potential limitation of compensatory vasodilatory capacitance. There are seven case reports in the literature of an association between stroke and the use of beta blockers in migraineurs. Prevention using divalproex sodium and verapamil is favored by many headache specialists. Triptans are contraindicated in the treatment of patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine because of concern over the potential for cerebral vasoconstriction. The frequency of migraine is usually unchanged with the use of oral contraceptives although, occasionally, migraine may occur for the first time or increase in frequency. Studies have produced conflicting results as to whether low-dose estrogen oral contraception increases the risk of stroke. Migraine alone increases the risk of stroke, at least in women under the age of 45 years. Most women with migraine without aura and migraine with visual aura lasting less than 1 hour can safely use low-dose estrogen oral contraceptives when there are no other contraindications. Those with aura symptoms such as hemiparesis or dysphasia or prolonged focal neurologic symptoms and signs lasting more than 1 hour should avoid starting low-dose estrogen oral contraceptives and stop the medication if they are already taking it.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11471758/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

In the last years, some hospitals proposed a stroke clinical pathway performed on the basis of integrated actions of all specialists involved in stroke care. The organisation core is the stroke unit but a strong point is represented by the relationship with the emergency system and the post-discharge organisation. The Italian Stroke Forum is a scientific society linking several specialties, approaching different aspects of cerebrovascular disease, ranging from epidemiology to pathophysiology, diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment, and rehabilitation. For these characteristics the proposed guidelines published in SPREAD are accepted by 34 scientific societies and are largely adopted as the scientific background of the stroke clinical pathway. The Cerebrovascular Disease Association, was proposed as a Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society, has a similar organisation regarding the different neurological aspects involved in stroke care, from neuroepidemiology to neurorehabilitation. Recently, the American Board of Medical Specialties approved a Certification in Vascular Neurology as a new subspecialty requested by the American Academy of Neurology; maybe in the near future a Consensus Conference has to be organised in Italy also, with the aim of defining a common management of stroke and promoting the growth of vascular neurology disease as an independent area of medical expertise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16752070/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

This was fueled by pressures within the American health care system for timely, cost-effective, and high-quality care and by the growing chasm between inpatient and outpatient care. In this article, we sought to answer five questions: 1) What is a neurohospitalist? 2) How many neurohospitalists practice in the United States? 3) What are potential advantages of neurohospitalists? 4) What are the challenges of implementing a neurohospitalist practice? 5) What effect does a neurohospitalist have on clinical outcomes? We queried biomedical databases (e.g., PubMed) by using the search terms \"hospitalist,\" \"neurohospitalist,\" and \"neurology hospitalist.\" We also searched the Society of Hospital Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology Dendrite classified advertisement Web sites for hospitalist and neurology hospitalist growth by using the same search terms. We defined neurology hospitalists (neurohospitalists) as neurologists who devote at least one-quarter of their time managing inpatients with neurologic disease. Although the number of hospitalists has grown considerably over the past decade, limited data on neurohospitalists exist. Advertisements for neurohospitalist positions have increased from 2003 through 2007, but accurate assessment of growth is limited by the lack of a central organizational affiliation and unifying terminology. Health care pressures spawned the growth of medicine and pediatric hospitalists, who provide efficient, cost-effective care by reducing the length of hospitalization. Because neurologists experience the same pressures, we expect neurohospitalists to increase in number, especially within areas that have sufficient inpatient volume and resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18337585/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

A neuropaediatrician, before making indiscriminate use of such major complementary investigations as neurogenetics and imaging techniques to diagnose a dysmorphic syndrome, should obtain a detailed clinical history and, particularly, a very careful physical examination, including adequate neurological examination. Thus in neuropaediatrics the final diagnosis and early determination of normality or abnormality is based on two things: the clinical semiology derived from the clinical history and neurological examination, and complementary investigations (sophisticated or not) which make us relate these findings to clinical data. A large proportion of neurological disorders, especially those involving the intellect, are found in patients with some type of chromosome anomaly, which cause less than 6% of all malformations of the central nervous system. At the present time a wide range of dysmorphic syndromes are recognized, with or without accompanying chromosome anomalies. Many of these are also associated with mental deficiency or signs of neurological deficiency. Genetic studies should be requested when monogenetic disorders or mitochondrial disorders are suspected, and in multifactorial disorders. It has been shown that the presence of minor dysmorphic defects in children with epileptic seizures is associated with a much worse prognosis, possibly because it is also associated with cerebral malformations. Often these minor anomalies are seen in similar form in close relations of the children involved. It is therefore necessary to take care in evaluation of these defects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12389193/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

As the leading cause of disability and second cause of dementia, primary prevention should be the main way to fight the disease, since therapy is not efficient enough. Several observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use. On the other side, family history of breast carcinoma, mastopathy, thromboembolism, in certain cases gallbladder disease, will discourage the commencement of HRT.

In this survey, I will discuss in a historical perspective the different interpretations provided by classical and contemporary authors to explain this puzzling observation. First, I will take into account the different positions of classical authorities on this topic, starting from the first debates (mainly based on anatomo-clinical observations) on the organisation of language in the brain. Then, I will attempt to summarize the work of authors who have tackled this complex issue more recently, in systematic investigations using methods drawn from experimental psychology, to clarify the meaning of non-verbal cognitive disorders in aphasia. Finally, in the last part of the survey, I will discuss the interpretation of proponents of the 'semantic hub' hypothesis who have tried to analyse and explain the differences between the non-verbal semantic defects of patients with semantic dementia and aphasic stroke patients. The hypothesis which assumes that most non-verbal cognitive disorders observed in aphasic patients are due to a preverbal conceptual disorder, which cannot be attributed to a loss of semantic representations but rather to a defect in their controlled retrieval, seems substantially confirmed. Nevertheless, two main issues must still be clarified. The first is that some of the non-verbal cognitive defects of aphasic patients seem due to the negative influence of language disturbances on abstract non-verbal cognitive activities, rather than to a preverbal conceptual disorder. The second issue concerns the exact nature and the neuroanatomical correlates of the defective controlled retrieval of unimpaired conceptual representations, which should subsume most of the non-verbal cognitive disorders of aphasic patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24607882/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

An international panel was therefore convened, to agree on robust operational definitions for future studies and to validate them in an observational study involving 10 centres from the European Stroke Database Collaboration. Standardised neurological assessments were performed daily for the first 3 days on patients with acute stroke, consecutively admitted within 24 h of onset, using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) scoring system. An early deterioration episode (EDE) was defined as a >/=2 SSS-point worsening in either conscious level, arm, leg or eye movement scores, and/or a >/=3 SSS-point worsening in speech score, between consecutive neurological assessments. Stroke progression (SP) was defined as a similar neurological worsening comparing the day 3 assessment with the baseline assessment, or death occurring within 72 h of onset. The ability of SP to predict poor outcome (death or a Barthel ADL score <15/20 at 3 months), independently of initial stroke severity or other prognostic factors, was compared with possible alternative definitions, including one based on the Canadian Stroke Scale. The occurrence of EDEs and SP within the first 3 days of admission could be determined in 563 cases. EDEs occurred in 33% and SP in 26% of cases. Both were strong independent predictors of poor outcome. The prognostic efficiency of the European Progressing Stroke Study (EPSS) definition of SP was better than any of the alternatives examined, and clearly better than a definition based on changes in the total SSS score. The EPSS definitions of EDEs and SP have good construct and prognostic validity.

With aging societies, the prevalence of AD is increasing dramatically worldwide. The onset of AD is often not identified, and currently no available treatments are capable of stopping the disease process and its effect on cognitive decline. Thus, well-validated biomarkers of the preclinical stages of AD are needed. Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) is a member of the neuronal thread protein family and has a molecular weight of approximately 41 kD. AD7c-NTP has been identified as a biomarker for its specifically elevated levels in putative brain domains, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the urine of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Since the urine test is non-invasive, easy to perform, and patients accept it more easily than other methods, the urinary AD7c-NTP concentration has been recommended as a practical diagnostic tool for diagnosing AD and MCI. AD7c-NTP has undergone nearly 25 years of research course from its initial discovery to pathological verification, multi-center clinical evaluation, improvement of detection methods, epidemiological investigation, and combined application with other biomarkers. However, as a fluid biomarker, AD7c-NTP can be detected in urine instead of the traditional biomarker sources-CSF or blood, which has made the use of AD7c-NTP as a biomarker controversial.

Aspirin was the first antiplatelet agent to be used in this context and is still the most frequently prescribed preventive treatment for ischemic stroke. However, because the results of clinical studies with aspirin have been inconsistent, the dose of aspirin required for stroke prevention in persons with cerebrovascular disease has been a subject of debate among stroke neurologists. In the present discussion, low-dose aspirin is generally regarded by the experts as equivalent in effectiveness to high-dose aspirin, and its higher tolerability has the potential to significantly increase compliance with long-term therapy. Higher aspirin doses may have clinical utility in particular settings, but this requires further study. Despite the controversy, aspirin is now recognized as the treatment standard against which other antiplatelet agents are compared. Antiplatelet agents that may be more effective than aspirin have now been developed. Although each of these agents has been directly compared with aspirin in a large, randomized clinical trial, the lack of direct comparisons among these alternative antiplatelet therapies complicates decisions regarding long-term care of patients with cerebrovascular disease. An international panel of stroke neurologists reports that their selection of antiplatelet therapies for patients with prior history of TIA or stroke depends most heavily on drug efficacy and safety issues and is limited by availability (approval status of alternatives).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10532646/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

However, major advances have recently been made in our understanding of the genetic basis of monogenic inherited epilepsies. Progress has been particularly evident in familial idiopathic epilepsies and in many inherited symptomatic epilepsies, with the discovery that mutations in ion channel subunits are implicated, and direct molecular diagnosis of some phenotypes of epilepsy is now possible. This article reviews recent progress made in molecular genetics of epilepsy, focusing mostly on idiopathic epilepsy, and some types of myoclonus epilepsies. Mutations in the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 and beta2 subunit genes have been detected in families with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and those of two K(+) channel genes were identified to be responsible for underlying genetic abnormalities of benign familial neonatal convulsions. The voltage-gated Na(+) -channel (alpha1,2 and beta1 subunit), and GABA receptor (gamma2 subunit) may be involved in the pathogenesis of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy.

Therefore, we used samples and data from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (n = 91), the University of Kentucky Pathology Department (n = 31), and the University of Pittsburgh Pathology Department (n = 4) to study MVPs. Age at death was correlated with MVP density in the frontal neocortex, Brodmann Area 9 (r = 0.51; p < 0.0001). Exploratory analyses were performed to evaluate the association between conventional vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart attack, arrhythmia), and cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke); the only nominal association with MVP density was a self-reported history of brain trauma (Prevalence Ratio = 2.1; 95 CI 1.1-3.9, before correcting for multiple comparisons). No specific associations were detected between neuropathological (e.g., brain arteriolosclerosis) or genetic (e.g., APOE) variables and MVP density.

The evaluation should include detailed history of children and adolescents completed by detailed general and neurological examinations. Moreover, the possible role of psychological factors, life events and excessively stressful lifestyle in influencing recurrent headache need to be checked. The choice of laboratory tests rests on the differential diagnosis suggested by the history, the character and temporal pattern of the headache, and the physical and neurological examinations. Subjects who have any signs or symptoms of focal/progressive neurological disturbances should be investigated by neuroimaging techniques. The electroencephalogram and other neurophysiological examinations are of limited value in the routine evaluation of headaches. In a primary headache disorder, headache itself is the illness and headache is not attributed to any other disorder (e.g. migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic cephalgias). In secondary headache disorders, headache is the symptom of identifiable structural, metabolic or other abnormality. Red flags include the first or worst headache ever in the life, recent headache onset, increasing severity or frequency, occipital location, awakening from sleep because of headache, headache occurring exclusively in the morning associated with severe vomiting and headache associated with straining. Thus, the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary headaches rests mainly on clinical criteria. A thorough evaluation of headache in children and adolescents is necessary to make the correct diagnosis and initiate treatment, bearing in mind that children with headache are more likely to experience psychosocial adversity and to grow up with an excess of both headache and other physical and psychiatric symptoms and this creates an important healthcare problem for their future life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21359874/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Relevant literature was systematically reviewed and strength of evidence classified based on the American Academy of Neurology's criteria (Level A: established; Level B: probable; Level C: possible). An increased risk of falls is established among persons with diagnoses of stroke, dementia, and disorders of gait and balance (Level A) and probable among patients with Parkinson disease, peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity weakness or sensory loss, and substantial vision loss (Level B). A history of falling in the past year strongly predicts the likelihood of future falls (Level A). Screening measures have been developed to further assess risks of falls, including functional assessments that may be useful (Levels B and C). Several of these assess overlapping neurologic functions--i.e., gait, mobility, and balance--and there is insufficient evidence to assess whether they offer benefit beyond that provided by a standard neurologic examination. Patients with neurologic or general conditions associated with an increased risk of falling should be asked about recent falls and further examined for the presence of specific neurologic deficits that predict falls, which include gait and balance disorders; deficits of lower extremity strength, sensation, and coordination; and cognitive impairments.

We investigated how often a code stroke was initiated and the percentage of patients treated with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator, and draw attention to the resulting mismatch. From January 2010 to September 2011, we prospectively registered all consecutive code stroke patients. Patient characteristics, including demographic data, medical history, comorbidity conditions, treatments, and discharge diagnosis were collected, together with the exact time of onset (or last known normal time) and management. The eligibility of thrombolysis for each patient recorded originally on the chart was reviewed retrospectively on the basis of two sets of criteria, namely, the BNHI reimbursement criteria and the Taiwan Stroke Society (TSS) guideline. During the study period, code strokes were activated for 419 patients at an average of around 20 patients per month. About 57% of code strokes were initiated outside of office hours. Stroke was diagnosed in 377 (90%) patients and 304 (73%) patients had ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 42 (10%) patients according to the BNHI reimbursement criteria and 101 (24%) patients by the TSS guideline were eligible for IV thrombolytic therapy. Of all the code stroke patients, only 49 (12%) were actually treated. Before each additional patient was thrombolysed, about eight patients had been evaluated and excluded from treatment. The majority of code stroke patients were stroke patients; however, most of them could not be treated with thrombolytic therapy.

Though both are associated with right hemisphere cerebral dysfunction, notably stroke, each disorder had its own distinct literature. Anosognosia, as coined by Babinski in 1914, describes patients who seem to have no idea of their paralysis, despite general cognitive preservation. Certain patients seem more than unaware, with apparent resistance to awareness. More extreme, and qualitatively distinct, is denial of hemiplegia. Various interpretations of pathogenesis are still deliberated. As accounts of its captivating manifestations grew, anosognosia was established as a prominent symbol of neurological and psychic disturbance accompanying (right-hemisphere) stroke. Although reports of specific neglect-related symptomatology appeared earlier, not until nearly 2 decades after anosognosia's inaugural definition was neglect formally defined by Brain, paving a path spanning some years, to depict a class of disorder with heterogeneous variants. Disordered awareness of body and extrapersonal space with right parietal lesions, and other symptom variations, were gathered under the canopy of neglect. Viewed as a disorder of corporeal awareness, explanatory interpretations involve mechanisms of extinction and perceptual processing, disturbance of spatial attention, and others. Odd alterations involving apparent concern, attitudes, or belief characterize many right hemisphere conditions. Anosognosia and neglect are re-examined, from the perspective of unawareness, the nature of belief, and its baffling distortions. Conceptual parallels between these 2 distinct disorders emerge, as the major role of the right hemisphere in mental representation of self is highlighted by its most fascinating syndromes of altered awareness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927461/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

The reasons for this heterogeneity are being explored in several large-scale epidemiologic studies around the world. Much of the heterogeneity in stroke can be related to the prevalence of risk factors, but some populations have a higher stroke incidence than would be predicted from risk factor levels. Hypertension, including borderline hypertension, is probably the most important stroke risk factor based on degree of risk and prevalence. However, cardiac morbidity, cigarette smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, and high levels of alcohol consumption are also strongly related to stroke risk. High levels of blood cholesterol and homocysteine may also increase stroke risk. Mortality after stroke is highest within the first 30 days but remains elevated to a degree that depends on the presenting stroke syndrome, stroke subtype, and other co-morbidities. Lacunar strokes have the best short- and long-term prognoses. Strokes due to large-vessel atherosclerosis frequently worsen; these and cardioembolic strokes have the poorest long-term prognosis. The risk for recurrence is also highest within 30 days after a first stroke, depending on the type of infarct, history of hypertension, and blood glucose levels on admission. Predictors of late recurrence include cardiac disease, hypertension, and heavy alcohol use. Only about half of stroke survivors are independent 6 months after a stroke, and quality of life is decreased.

Stroke patients admitted to the Sheba Medical Center during the period March 2001 to June 2002 were included in a prospective study according to selection criteria. Data on demographics, risk factors, co-morbidities and stroke severity were collected. Indicators of process of care and outcome were assessed at hospital discharge and 30 days follow-up. Comparison between outcome variables by hospitalization ward was done using logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders. Of 616 acute stroke patients (mean age 70 years, 61% men, 84% ischemic stroke), 353 (57%) were admitted to general wards and 263 (43%) to the stroke unit. Diagnostic procedures were performed more often and the infection rate was lower in the setting of the stroke unit. Poor outcome (modified Rankin scale > or = 3 or death) was present less often in patients managed in the stroke unit both at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.8) and at 30 day follow-up (adjusted OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9).

This paper reviews primary sources pertaining to acute neurologic conditions described mostly in the 19th and 20th century. A review of monographs, treatises, textbooks, and peer-reviewed articles was conducted. The evolution of clinical signs and syndromes associated with dynamic intracranial pathologies was predicated on the idea that animal studies informed clinicians, who then linked clinical signs to these observations. A dominant theme is that innovative technologies could trace acute processes through all their various stages, affording a complete picture of the disease process. Just as clinical descriptors of central nervous system processes evolved, the presentation of acute neuromuscular respiratory failure became better defined. Once practices incorporated these acute clinical signs, textbooks cemented their \"gold standard\" status with relative impunity. The practise of acute neurology and neurocritical care must find out what, historically, others were seeking but could not find. Patterns of clinical presentation in acute neurology are sufficiently recognizable to guide practise decisions. Although, the currently well-documented clinical syndromes of acute neurologic conditions (at presentation and during deterioration) have been taught for generations, practitioners have noted that they lack consistency and predictability.

Most of the countries reported a mortality rate of 2-3 % majorly due to cardiorespiratory failures. Recent studies highlighted the neurological involvement playing a key role in cardiorespiratory failures and other symptoms such as headache, anosmia, and ageusia observed in Covid-19 patients. Studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 entry via Olfactory Epithelium (OE), and the expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) in addition to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. The virus can either travel via peripheral blood vessel causing endothelial dysfunction, triggering coagulation cascade and multiple organ dysfunction or reach the systemic circulation and take a different route to the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), disrupting the BBB causing neuroinflammation or neuronal excitotoxicity resulting in the development of encephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, and strokes. SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the brain stem is believed to be responsible for the cardiorespiratory failures observed in Covid-19 patients. Apart from viral invasion via hematogenous route, SARS-CoV-2 neural invasion via PNS nerve terminal, results in viral replication and retrograde transportation to soma leading to invasion of the CNS including the brain producing neurological manifestations of the disease either in the initial stages or during the course of the disease and even for a long period post-infection in many cases. The ACE2 receptors are expressed in the brain and glial cells and SARS-CoV-2 acts via neuronal as well as nonneuronal pathways.

Stroke prevention, therefore, remains the key route for reducing morbidity and mortality. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are the most important modifiable risk factors for stroke. Several recent landmark studies have shown that lipid lowering with statins can reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke, as well as coronary heart disease. In addition, clinical trials evaluating the effects of blood pressure lowering have shown that antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can reduce stroke risk. Accumulating evidence suggests certain antihypertensive agents such as CCBs might also prevent the formation and progression of carotid atheroma, independently of their blood-pressure-lowering effects. It follows that rigorous identification and targeting of high- risk or stroke-prone individuals for blood pressure and lipid-lowering interventions should be of practical importance to all physicians involved in the management of stroke.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12740554/", "source_file": "pubmed_neuro.jsonl"}

Conflicting evidence also exists regarding its effects on dry eye, macular degeneration, myopia/hyperopia, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and central serous retinopathy. Caffeine does not seem to be a risk factor for dry eye, although studies have shown that caffeine may offer protection against wet age-related macular degeneration, and the metabolite 7-methylxanthine could be a more promising treatment for myopia. Moreover, caffeine can potentially cause tremors and might hinder surgical performance, especially in less experienced surgeons. Recommendations from experts vary, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand how caffeine affects the eye.

It is estimated that over 2 billion people suffer from vision loss with common causative factors such as; age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and infections amongst others. The use of Orthodox procedures has only helped mitigate the pathology; however, it doesn't serve any substantial curative purpose. More recently, the incorporation of new therapies via ocular delivery of nanomaterials and stem cell intervention has helped to change tides in the treatment of various ophthalmic pathologies. This review provides an overview of the current trends and breakthroughs in ophthalmology via stem cell therapy, with emphasis on its types, mechanisms, applications, and benefits. Mesenchymal stem cells which can arise from embryonic or adult origin possess some immunomodulatory effects that contribute to the therapeutic relevance of the MSCs and the ability to evade rejection from the host. However, the major drawback has been uncontrolled growth which can result in unintended side effects. Moreso, religious and ethical issues concerning the employment of MSCs from embryonic origin have also hindered clinical progression with its use. The use of stem cell therapy in the treatment of eye pathologies which is still undergoing clinical trials has shown to be a more viable treatment approach in ophthalmology as it targets retinal degenerative diseases thereby offering novel pathways for vision restoration. And also serves as a revolutionary alternative for treating severe ocular diseases. Stem cell delivery techniques might be quite cumbersome as the eye is a very delicate organ. The therapeutic interventional technique employed is aimed to ensure the reduction or absence of undesired effects in the deposition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) being the stem cells. Techniques such as hydrogel-based injectables, which offer delivery of the APIs to the desired site of action without change in the physicochemical properties of the drug molecule, the scaffold delivery techniques, and the use of 3D bio-printing which can be used to develop scaffolds for retinal degeneration. The employment of artificial intelligence and machine learning in stem cell therapy has shown to be very fast and efficient in stem cell delivery and preventing likely human errors. Unlike conventional treatments that often focus on managing symptoms, stem cells have the unique ability to repair and regenerate damaged tissues, addressing the root causes of the diseases. However, limitations due to economic, regulatory, and ethical challenges have posed barriers to advancing stem cell therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120030/", "source_file": "pubmed_ophthalmology.jsonl"}

This is not a review nor meant to be comprehensive. Specific topics have been selected to illustrate the principles of important paradigm shifts that will influence the future of ophthalmic diagnostics. It is our impression that future evaluation of vision will go beyond visual acuity to assess ocular health in terms of psychophysical function. The definition of disease will incorporate genotype into what has historically been a phenotype-centric discipline. Non-invasive nanotechnologies will enable a paradigm shift from disease detection on a cellular level to a sub-cellular molecular level. Vision can be evaluated beyond visual acuity by measuring contrast sensitivity, color vision, and macular function, as these provide better insights into the impact of aging and disease. Distortions can be quantified and the psychophysical basis of vision can be better evaluated than in the past by designing tests that assess particular macular cell function(s). Advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of eye diseases will enable better characterization of ocular health and disease. Non-invasive nanotechnologies can assess molecular changes in the lens, vitreous, and macula that predate visible pathology. Oxygen metabolism and circulatory physiology are measurable indices of ocular health that can detect variations of physiology and early disease. This overview of paradigm shifts in ophthalmology suggests that the future will see significant improvements in ophthalmic diagnostics.

Ophthalmology cannot explain art, but vision is a tool for artists and its normal and abnormal characteristics may influence what an artist can do. The retina codes for contrast, and the impact of this is evident throughout art history from Asian brush painting, to Renaissance chiaroscuro, to Op Art. Art exists, and can portray day or night, only because of the way retina adjusts to light. Color processing is complex, but artists have exploited it to create shimmer (Seurat, Op Art), or to disconnect color from form (fauvists, expressionists, Andy Warhol). It is hazardous to diagnose eye disease from an artist's work, because artists have license to create as they wish. El Greco was not astigmatic; Monet was not myopic; Turner did not have cataracts. But when eye disease is documented, the effects can be analyzed. Color-blind artists limit their palette to ambers and blues, and avoid greens. Dense brown cataracts destroy color distinctions, and Monet's late canvases (before surgery) showed strange and intense uses of color. Degas had failing vision for 40 years, and his pastels grew coarser and coarser. He may have continued working because his blurred vision smoothed over the rough work. This paper can barely touch upon the complexity of either vision or art. However, it demonstrates some ways in which understanding vision and eye disease give insight into art, and thereby an appreciation of both art and ophthalmology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26563659/", "source_file": "pubmed_ophthalmology.jsonl"}

Visual restitution training is useful for the treatment of patients with stroke, head injury, or partial optic nerve damage, as long as the patient presents some residual vision.

It was not until the 1800s, however, that specific connections between the hypothalamus and the vision system were discovered. With a fuller elaboration of the autonomic nervous system in the early to mid 1900s, many more pathways were discovered. The more recently discovered retinohypothalamic tracts show the extent and influence of light stimulation on hypothalamic function and bodily processes. The hypothalamus maintains its myriad connections via neural pathways, such as with the pituitary and pineal glands; the chemical messengers of the peptides, cytokines, and neurotransmitters; and the nitric oxide mechanism. As a result of these connections, the hypothalamus has involvement in many degenerative diseases. A complete feedback mechanism between the eye and hypothalamus is established by the retinohypothalamic tracts and the ciliary nerves innervating the anterior pole of the eye and the retina. A discussion of hypothalamic-related vision disorders includes neurologic syndromes, the lacrimal system, the retina, and ocular inflammation. Tables and figures have been used to aid in the explanation of the many connections and chemicals controlled by the hypothalamus. The understanding of the functions of the hypothalamus will allow the clinician to gain better insight into the many pathologies associated between the vision system and the hypothalamus.

Originally believed to function merely in motility, the function of solitary non-motile (primary) cilia was long overlooked. Recent research has demonstrated that primary cilia function as signalling hubs that sense environmental cues and are pivotal for organ development and function, tissue hoemoestasis, and maintenance of human health. Cilia share a common anatomy and their diverse functional features are achieved by evolutionarily conserved functional modules, organized into sub-compartments. Defects in these functional modules are responsible for a rapidly growing list of human diseases collectively termed ciliopathies. Ocular pathogenesis is common in virtually all classes of syndromic ciliopathies, and disruptions in cilia genes have been found to be causative in a growing number of non-syndromic retinal dystrophies. This review will address what is currently known about cilia contribution to visual function. We will focus on the molecular and cellular functions of ciliary proteins and their role in the photoreceptor sensory cilia and their visual phenotypes. We also highlight other ciliated cell types in tissues of the eye (e.g. lens, RPE and Müller glia cells) discussing their possible contribution to disease progression. Progress in basic research on the cilia function in the eye is paving the way for therapeutic options for retinal ciliopathies.

Humans and animals cannot synthesize carotenoids de novo and must obtain them solely through dietary sources. Among the more than 750 carotenoids in nature, only lutein, zeaxanthin, meso-zeaxanthin, and their oxidative metabolites selectively accumulate in the foveal region of the retina where they are collectively referred to as the macular pigment (MP) of the macula lutea. MP serves an ocular protective role through its ability to filter phototoxic blue light radiation and also via its antioxidant activity. These properties have led to the hypothesis that carotenoids may protect against the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in the aged population >60 years old. Epidemiological studies have supported this by showing that patients with lower concentrations of serum carotenoids and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurements are at a higher risk of developing AMD. Conversely, nutritional supplementation and diets rich in lutein and zeaxanthin readily impact MP concentrations and reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD, and the AREDS2 supplement formulation containing 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin is the standard-of-care recommendation for individuals at risk for visual loss from advanced AMD.

In order to dissect the eye without spilling its contents, the eye was first boiled in egg white and then cut. The procedure was now repeated and showed that the ovoid lens after boiling had become spherical. - Leonardo described that light rays were refracted and reflected in the eye but his imperfect anatomy prevented a development of physiological optics. He was, however, the first to compare the eye with a pin-hole camera (camera obscura).

Prevailing ocular prostheses are acrylic shells with a static eye image rendered on the convex surface. A limited range of ocular prosthetic movement and lack of natural saccadic movements commonly causes the appearance of eye misalignment that may be disfiguring. Digital screens and computational systems may obviate current limitations in eye prosthetic motility and help prosthetic wearers feel less self-conscious about their appearance. We applied convoluted neural networks (CNNs) to track pupil location in various conditions. These algorithms were coupled to a microscreen digital prosthetic eye (DPE) prototype to assess the ability of the system to capture full ocular ductions and saccadic movements in a miniaturized, portable, and wearable system. The CNNs captured pupil location with high accuracy. Pupil location data were transmitted to a miniature screen ocular prosthetic prototype that displayed a dynamic contralateral eye image. The transmission achieved a full range of ocular ductions and with grossly undetectable latency. Lack of iris and sclera color and detail, as well as constraints in luminosity, dimensionality and image stability limited the real eye appearance. Yet, the digitally rendered eye moved in the same amplitude and velocity as the native, tracked eye. Real-time image processing using CNNs coupled to microcameras and a miniscreen DPE may offer improvements in amplitude and velocity of apparent prosthetic eye movement. These developments, along with ocular image precision, may offer a next-generation eye prosthesis.

Eyes were the most important organ in Egyptian thought, as they allowed perception of the real world. Their importance has been immortalised in the myth of the Eye of Horus that explains the role of either eye. One represents the moonlight, which disperses the darkness of the night, and the other represents the sunshine, which creates life, and both could also represents the power of human intellect. Blindness, in turn, congenital or disease-related, was considered a divine punishment. A man, thus handicapped, would sink in a state of uncertainty and darkness. To protect the eyes from blindness, people used drops and ointments, which were believed to chase away all kinds of insects and demons that threatened with a variety of eye infections. Egyptian eye doctors or physicians, carried a special kit that contained green chrysocolla and a black kohl makeup, highly appreciated as prophylaxis because they personified Osiris' humours or body fluids.

Emergency department practitioners are often the first to evaluate these patients and determine the next steps in their care, which can be a challenging task. The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of anterior segment pathology in the setting of the ED in hopes that this information will be useful in creating more effective management algorithms. A retrospective study based on electronic patient charts from the University of California Davis ED that included ophthalmology consults. We reviewed the charts for demographic data, as well as visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and diagnosis as determined by ED and ophthalmology personnel, respectively. The most common anterior segment diagnoses were uveitis, corneal abrasion, corneal ulcer, meibomian gland dysfunction/dry eyes/blepharitis/punctate epithelial erosions, and conjunctivitis/epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Emergency Department personnel measured the VA and IOP in 40.8% and 16.7% of patients, respectively. The ophthalmologist measured the VA and IOP in 78.4% and 95.1% of patients, respectively. The percentage agreement in VA measurement between ophthalmology and ED was 11.8%. The percentage agreement in IOP measurement between ophthalmology and ED was 0.86%. The percentage agreement in diagnosis between ophthalmology and ED was 49.4%. Most ocular conditions that present in the ED are nonurgent and can be treated in an outpatient setting. However, ED personnel are often unable to obtain the proper \"ocular vital signs\" (the VA and IOP) and diagnoses. Our findings suggest a need for clear interprofessional discussion in creating an algorithm for triage and the management of eye conditions in the ED to deliver effective care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568931/", "source_file": "pubmed_ophthalmology.jsonl"}

Building on our previous analysis of current progress towards key HReH indicators and cataract surgery rates (CSRs), we predicted future indicator achievement among 16 countries of sub-Saharan Africa by 2020. Surgical and HReH data were collected from national eye care programme coordinators on six practitioner cadres: ophthalmologists, cataract surgeons, ophthalmic clinical officers, ophthalmic nurses, optometrists and 'mid-level refractionists' and combined them with publicly available population data to calculate practitioner-to-population ratios and CSRs. Data on workforce entry and exit (2008 to 2010) was used to project practitioner population and CSR growth between 2011 and 2020 in relation to projected growth in the general population. Associations between indicator progress and the presence of a non-physician cataract surgeon cadre were also explored using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Spearman rank correlations. In our 16-country sample, practitioner per million population ratios are predicted to increase slightly for surgeons (ophthalmologists/cataract surgeons, from 3.1 in 2011 to 3.4 in 2020) and ophthalmic nurses/clinical officers (5.8 to 6.8) but remain low for refractionists (including optometrists, at 3.6 in 2011 and 2020). Among countries that have not already achieved target indicators, however, practitioner growth will be insufficient for any additional countries to reach the surgeon and refractionist targets by year 2020. Without further strategy change and investment, even after 2020, surgeon growth is only expected to sufficiently outpace general population growth to reach the target in one country. For nurses, two additional countries will achieve the target while one will fall below it. In 2011, high surgeon practitioner ratios were associated with high CSR, regardless of the type of surgeon employed. The cataract surgeon workforce is growing proportionately faster than the ophthalmologist. The HReH workforce is not growing fast enough to achieve global eye health targets in most of the sub-Saharan countries we surveyed by 2020. Countries seeking to make rapid progress to improve CSR could prioritise investment in training new cataract surgeons over ophthalmologists and improving surgical output efficiency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25128287/", "source_file": "pubmed_ophthalmology.jsonl"}

Al Haitam is born in city Basra and immigrated to Egypt during reign of Caliph Al Hakim. He is quoted as excellent astronomer, mathematician and doctor as well as one of the best commentators of the Galen and Aristotle's work. He is the first medical scholar who teaches that light \"does not originates from the eye but on opposite enters the eye\", and in that manner corrects the wrong opinion of the Greeks about the nature of vision. According to this scholar retina is the center of vision and the impressions that it receives are transferred to the brain by the optical nerve, in order that brain afterwards create visual image in the symmetrical relationship for both retinas. Al-Haitam was the most important researcher of optics in Islam. He was convinced that the adequate theory of vision must combine Euclid and Ptolemy \"mathematical\" approach and \"physical doctrine of the naturalists. The result of his reflections in the paper \"Optics\", supported by the experimental approach, is the new theory of vision, much richer and perfected than any before. He thought that light and color, two physical features that exist independently from the observed subject, in strait lines originates from the each point of visible object. Al Haitam concludes that what we perceive is actually the object which is on a certain distance from the eye and which have certain shape and size, and vision itself is the result of intervention by the visual material received by the brain and stored information's from previous experiences. Reception hypothesis (intromission) Al-Haitam exposed to mathematical testing, and then incorporated into already developed perception theory, which is still not completely explored by historians. In his experiments he used \"dark chambers\", trying to confirm the features of light, such as expansion in straight lines, reflexion and refraction of the light beams. Basic stand point which he supported was that the vision is the result of impression which light leaves on the sight sense, he supported it based on the experience that the eye \"retains an image\" or has pain when looking into bright light.

In addition to his private practice he was editor of several pseudomedical magazines. He also owned two proprietary ventures that he conducted on a mail order basis. One of these involved production and sale of the The Ideal Sight Restorer, a U-shaped device consisting of a rubber bulb at the base, from which on both sides arose an arm of rubber tubing capped by an ivory eye piece. The eye cups were applied to the closed eyelids and the intermittent suction produced by squeezing the rubber bulb was claimed to provide a form of ocular massage capable of curing serious eye diseases (eg. cataract and glaucoma), as well as doing away with the need for spectacles. Although his fraudulent activities and deceptive advertising practices were described on several occasions in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Tyrrell persisted in his enterprises until he died in 1918.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3543791/", "source_file": "pubmed_ophthalmology.jsonl"}

The visual acuity with the Fresnel membrane prism is significantly less than that with the conventional prism of the same power for all prism powers from 12 delta through 30 delata at distance and from 15 delta through 30 delta at near. 2. The difference in the visual acuity between base up and base down, and between base in and base out, is not significantly different for either the Fresnel membrane prism or for the conventional prism. 3. For both Fresnel membrane prism and the conventional prism, the visual acuity when looking straight ahead. 4. Using Fresnel membrane prisms of the same power from different lots, the visual acuity varied significantly. The 30 delta prism caused the widest range in visual acuity. 5. When normal subjects are fitted with the higher powers of the Fresnel membrane prism, fusion and stereopsis are disrupted to such an extent that the use of this device to restore or to improve binocular vision in cases with large-angle deviations is seriously questioned. 6. Moreover, the disruption of fusion and stereopsis is abrupt and severe and does not parallel the decrease in visual acuity. The severely reduced ability to maintain fusion may be related to the optical aberrations, which, in turn, may be due to the molding process and the polyvinyl chloride molding material. 7. Through the flexibility of the membrane prism is a definite advantage, because of its proclivity to reduce visual acuity and increase aberrations its prescription for adults often must be limited to only one eye. 8. For the same reasons in the young child with binocular vision problems, the membrane prism presently available should be prescribed over both eyes only in powers less than 20 delta. When the membrane prism is to be used as a partial occluder (over one eye only), any power can be used. 9. The new Fresnel \"hard\" prism reduces visual acuity minimally and rarely disrupts binocularity, thus increasing the potential for prismotherapy to establish binocularity. This prism is currently available only for use as a trial set. Since the cosmetic appearance of the Fresnel \"hard\" prism is similar to that of the Fresnel membrane prism and it is easier to maintain, it would be the prism of choice (over all other types) for bilateral prescriptions in the young patient with emmetropia. The manufacturer is urged to make these prisms available to fit a special round adjustable frame, such as that developed in Europe for use with the wafer prism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/754384/", "source_file": "pubmed_ophthalmology.jsonl"}

Keratometric measurements and two videokeratographs were gathered prospectively on 262 normal and abnormal corneas.

For physical therapy, moderate evidence was found for myofascial massage therapy versus ischemic compression on latent, or active, trigger points or low-level laser therapy in the short term. For several electrophysical modalities, moderate evidence was found in the short term (ultrasound vs placebo, ultrasound as single intervention vs other nonsurgical interventions, ultrasound vs corticosteroid injection plus a neutral wrist splint, local microwave hyperthermia vs placebo, iontophoresis vs phonophoresis, pulsed radiofrequency added to wrist splint, continuous vs pulsed vs placebo shortwave diathermy, and interferential current vs transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation vs a night-only wrist splint). In the midterm, moderate evidence was found in favor of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) added to a neutral wrist splint, in favor of ESWT versus ultrasound, or cryo-ultrasound, and in favor of ultrasound versus placebo. For all other interventions studied, only limited, conflicting, or no evidence was found. No RCTs investigating the long-term effects of physical therapy and electrophysical modalities were found.

TU uses sound waves to produce both thermal and nonthermal effects that aid in tissue healing, repair, and function. TENS uses different frequencies of electrical current to decrease pain and inflammation. NMES also uses an electrical current to stimulate muscle contraction to assist in normal neuromuscular function in postorthopedic and neurological injuries. LLLT uses light energy to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and stimulate healing at a cellular level. PMF uses magnetic field to stimulate normal cellular ion exchange and oxygen utilization and promote generalized healing of tissues. These modalities are discussed in detail covering mechanism of action, parameters, settings, and indications/contraindications of use in our small animals. Although these modalities are important in the physical rehabilitation of small animals, they need to be incorporated with a proper diagnosis, manual therapy, and home exercise program into a specific and individualized patient treatment protocol.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18198784/", "source_file": "pubmed_physical_therapy.jsonl"}

The purpose of this review was to update the current evidence regarding physical therapist care for patients with MSKD in EDs and to update current recommendations for these models of care. Systematic searches were conducted in 5 bibliographic databases. The studies selected presented quantitative data related to the care of patients with MSKD by physical therapists in an ED setting. Raters reviewed studies and used the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool to assess their methodological quality. Fifteen studies were included. Two studies, 1 of weak and 1 of strong quality, demonstrated that physical therapist care in EDs was as effective as or more effective than usual medical care for pain reduction, and 6 studies of varying quality reported that physical therapist care in EDs was as effective as usual care in EDs in reducing disability. Eight studies of varying quality reported that physical therapist care could significantly reduce waiting time in EDs. Four studies of varying quality reported that physical therapists ordered no more, or even fewer, medical images than physicians. In terms of health care costs, 2 studies of moderate to high quality found no significant differences in costs between physical therapist care and usual care in EDs. Finally, 6 studies of varying quality reported that patients were as satisfied or more satisfied with physical therapist care as with usual medical care in EDs. The roles of physical therapists in EDs vary depending on the setting, legislation, and training of providers. Only a limited number of high-quality studies were identified.

The scores of the researchers and first author were statistically compared. Settings and subjects : Forty stroke patients in four European rehabilitation centres. The scoring list consists of 49 subcategories, divided into 12 categories: mobilization; selective movements; lying (balance); sitting (balance); standing (balance); sensory and visual perceptual training and cognition; transfers; ambulatory activities; personal activities of daily living; domestic activities of daily living; leisure- and work-related activities; and miscellaneous. Comparing the frequency of occurrence of the categories resulted in intraclass correlation coefficients, indicating high reliability for eight categories, good for one, and fair for two. One category was not observed. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were high to very high for 24 subcategories and moderate for four. Twenty-one subcategories contained too few observations to enable calculation of Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Average point-to-point percentage of agreement in time of the treatment sessions equalled 76.6 +/- 16.2%. The list is a valid and reliable tool for describing the content of physiotherapy and occupational therapy for stroke patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17613566/", "source_file": "pubmed_physical_therapy.jsonl"}

The sample consisted of 300 patient records from the ATM service (Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Juiz de Fora) file. Three factors were analyzed: (1) Therapy, which were transcribed physical therapy modalities used; 2) If there were any guidelines or procedures for home exercises without the professionals presence; 3) the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) palpation pain rates, transferred to a pain level measurements table according to visual analog scale (VAS). The Chi-square test was applied for statistical analysis with a significance level p ≤ 0.05. All physiotherapy modalities used separately or mixed contributed to TMJ pain relief. Guidelines for physical therapy at home proved to be very useful to pain decreasing. It was concluded that the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary work in dentistry and physiotherapy treatments for TMD has been properly verified. It is essential to have an interdisciplinary treatment plan, where the physical therapy helps the pain relief and dentistry treats the disorders related to the stomatognathic system.

A summary of the efficacy of a range of physical treatments is provided in Table 1. The evidence-based primary care options are exercise, laser, massage, and spinal manipulation; however, the latter three have small or transient effects that limit their value as therapies for chronic LBP. In contrast, exercise produces large reductions in pain and disability, a feature that suggests that exercise should play a major role in the management of chronic LBP. Physical treatments, such as acupuncture, backschool, hydrotherapy, lumbar supports, magnets, TENS, traction, ultrasound, Pilates therapy, Feldenkrais therapy, Alexander technique, and craniosacral therapy are either of unknown value or ineffective and so should not be considered. Outside of primary care, multidisciplinary treatment or functional restoration is effective; however, the high cost probably means that these programs should be reserved for patients who do not respond to cheaper treatment options for chronic LBP. Although there are now effective treatment options for chronic LBP, it needs to be acknowledged that the problem of chronic LBP is far from solved. Though treatments can provide marked improvements in the patient's condition, the available evidence suggests that the typical chronic LBP patient is left with some residual pain and disability.

Current physiotherapies provide limited recovery. Orthoses substitute for ankle strength, but they provide no lasting therapeutic effect. Brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a novel rehabilitative approach that may generate permanent neurological improvements. This study explores the safety and feasibility of a foot-drop-targeted BCI-FES physiotherapy in chronic stroke survivors. Subjects (n = 9) operated an electroencephalogram-based BCI-FES system for foot dorsiflexion in 12 one-hour sessions over four weeks. Gait speed, dorsiflexion active range of motion (AROM), six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and Fugl-Meyer leg motor (FM-LM) scores were assessed before, during, and after therapy. The primary safety outcome measure was the proportion of subjects that deteriorated in gait speed by ≥0.16 m/s at one week or four weeks post-therapy. The secondary outcome measures were the proportion of subjects that experienced a clinically relevant decrease in dorsiflexion AROM (≥2.5°), 6MWD (≥20 %), and FM-LM score (≥10 %) at either post-therapy assessment. No subjects (0/9) experienced a clinically significant deterioration in gait speed, dorsiflexion AROM, 6MWT distance, or FM-LM score at either post-therapy assessment. Five subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥0.06 m/s) in gait speed, three subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥2.5°) in dorsiflexion AROM, five subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥10 %) in 6MWD, and three subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (≥10 %) in FM-LM. Five of the six subjects that exhibited a detectable increase in either post-therapy gait speed or 6MWD also exhibited significant (p < 0.01 using a Mann-Whitney U test) increases in electroencephalogram event-related synchronization/desynchronization. Additionally, two subjects experienced a clinically important increase (≥0.16 m/s) in gait speed, and four subjects experienced a clinically important increase (≥20 %) in 6MWD. Linear mixed models of gait speed, dorsiflexion AROM, 6MWD, and FM-LM scores suggest that BCI-FES therapy is associated with an increase in lower motor performance at a statistically, yet not clinically, significant level. BCI-FES therapy is safe. If it is shown to improve post-stroke gait function in future studies, it could provide a new gait rehabilitation option for severely impaired patients.

Electrophysical agents are utilised to bring about physiological effects, and it is these changes which bring about the therapeutic benefit rather than the modality itself. Clinical decision protocols employing the available evidence should enable the most appropriate modality to be employed for a particular patient. Indiscriminate use of electrotherapy is unlikely to yield significant benefit, however used at the right time, it has the potential to achieve beneficial effect.

The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using criteria based on generally accepted principles of interventional research. Twenty-four RCTs (22 treatment and two prevention) were identified; the methodological quality of the studies included was moderate and 11 RCTs were of sufficient quality to be included in further analysis. Based on levels-of-evidence criteria, there is strong evidence to suggest that PFM exercises are effective in reducing the symptoms of SUI. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of high-intensity vs a low-intensity regimen of PFM exercises. Despite significant effects of biofeedback after testing as an adjunct to PFM exercises, there is no evidence that PFM exercises with biofeedback are more effective than PFM exercises alone. There is little consistency (of stimulation types and parameters) in the studies of electrical stimulation, but when the results are combined there is strong evidence to suggest that electrostimulation is superior to sham electrostimulation, and limited evidence that there is no difference between electrostimulation and other physical therapies.

Within the physiotherapy market, firms participate in competitive bidding, prices are determined by the market, services are free at the point of use and firms are allowed to react to patient choice only by enhancing quality. Firm-level data (n = 854) regarding quality and price were analysed. Using 2SLS estimation techniques, we analysed the relationship between quality and competition, and price and competition. Our study found that competition has a negative (yet weak) effect on quality. Prices on the other hand are not affected by competition. The result is likely caused by imperfect information, because it seems that the Social Insurance Institution of Finland has provided too little information for patients to make adequate choices about proper service providers. We argue that by publishing quality information, it is possible to ease the decision-making of patients and influence the quality strategies of firms active in the physiotherapy market. Moreover, we found that competition appeared as an exogenous variable in this study.

Is it worth the risk? A comparison of risks versus benefits indicates that at present, the risks of cervical manipulation outweigh the benefits: manipulation has yet to be shown to be more effective for neck pain and headache than other interventions such as mobilisation, whereas the risks, although infrequent, are serious. This analysis is of particular concern because the conditions for which manipulation is indicated are benign and usually self-limiting. Because physiotherapists have legal and ethical obligations to the community to avoid foreseeable harm and provide optimum care, it may be prudent to determine who in our profession should perform cervical manipulation. That is, the profession could restrict the practice of cervical spine manipulation. Although all registered physiotherapists in Australia are entitled to perform cervical manipulation, few choose to use this intervention. Therefore, it might be feasible to encourage those practitioners who wish to use cervical manipulation to undertake formal education programs. Such a requirement could be embodied in a code of practice that discourages those without formal training from performing cervical manipulation. By taking such measures, we could ensure that our profession exercises wisdom in its monitoring and use of cervical manipulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12217065/", "source_file": "pubmed_physical_therapy.jsonl"}

Patients were manipulated on one to six occasions and this occurred predominantly in the latter half of the 12-treatment program. Cervical manipulation was used less frequently in the group who also received exercise.

This study also explored the PTs delivery of these BCTs beyond the present or absent dichotomy, using a third variable, partial delivery (i.e., attempted). Assessment of the intervention arm of the Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) cluster, randomized controlled feasibility trial, using quantitative methods. Eight PTs delivered six SOLAS classes each, of which 50% were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded by two raters using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 and an intervention-specific manual and assessed for the delivery (i.e., full, partial, or absent) of the 31 BCTs and their target behaviours. Fidelity was calculated as fully delivered BCTs listed as a percentage of those due to take place within each class. Physiotherapists delivered a mean 20.5 BCTs per class (68.3%; range = 64.9-72.4%). Of these, 17 BCTs were fully delivered in each class representing moderate fidelity to the protocol (56.8%; range = 53.5-59.3%). A further 3.5 BCTs per class (11.5%; range = 8.7-14.8%) were partially delivered. BCTs associated with 'goals and planning' were often poorly delivered. Delivering the SOLAS intervention BCTs with high fidelity was not feasible. The assessment of partial delivery of BCTs provided greater insight into the techniques that should be removed from the protocol or that may require further training. Complex interventions should consider a list of 'core' or mandatory BCTs alongside 'optional' BCTs, depending on the target behaviour, and the needs of individual participants. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? BCTs are the smallest active components of behavioural interventions, yet typically their effectiveness is determined through meta-analyses. Attempted delivery of BCTs is often unaccounted for yet may provide valuable insight into difficulty with delivery. There is a need to investigate BCT implementation beyond simple presence/absence to identify protocol refinements or required BCT training. What does this study add? BCT delivery was assessed in greater depth than previous research, including partial delivery. Highlights the need for appropriate training in BCTs that are difficult to deliver, particularly those associated with 'goals and planning' Highlights the need for intervention-specific criteria as to what constitutes 'high', 'moderate', and 'low' fidelity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888520/", "source_file": "pubmed_physical_therapy.jsonl"}

Quality sleep allows for improved cardiovascular health, mental health, cognition, memory consolidation, immunity, reproductive health, and hormone regulation. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders, or disrupted sleep from lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, or other medical issues can lead to significant morbidity and can contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The best treatment for long-term sleep improvement is proper sleep hygiene through behavior and sleep habit modification. Recommendations to improve sleep include achieving 7 to 9 h of sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep/wake schedule, a regular bedtime routine, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting a contemplative practice. In addition, avoiding many substances late in the day can help improve sleep. Caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and light exposure later in the day are associated with fragmented poor-quality sleep.

In this framework, the aim of this work was to link current understanding about insomnia mechanisms with current knowledge about mental health dysregulatory mechanisms. The focus of the present work was on mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, which represent important challenges in clinical practice. Literature searches were conducted on clinical, neurobiological, and therapeutic implications for insomnia comorbid with these mental disorders. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. Insomnia may play an important role as a risk factor, a comorbid condition and transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders including mood/anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Insomnia may also play a role as a marker of disrupted neuroplasticity contributing to dysregulation of different neurobiological mechanisms involved in these different mental conditions. In this framework, insomnia treatment may not only foster normal sleep processes but also the stress system, neuroinflammation and brain plasticity. Insomnia treatment may play an important preventive and neuroprotective role with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia being the treatment with important new evidence of efficacy for insomnia, psychopathology, and indices of disrupted neuroplasticity. On the other hand, pharmacological pathways for insomnia treatment in these mental conditions are still not well defined.

The introduction of polysomnography into psychiatric research confirmed a disturbance of sleep continuity in patients with depression, revealing not only a decrease in Slow Wave Sleep, but also a disinhibition of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, demonstrated as a shortening of REM latency, an increase of REM density, as well as total REM sleep time. Initial hopes that these abnormalities of REM sleep may serve as differential-diagnostic markers for subtypes of depression were not fulfilled. Almost all antidepressant agents suppress REM sleep and a time-and-dose-response relationship between total REM sleep suppression and therapeutic response to treatment seemed apparent. The so-called Cholinergic REM Induction Test revealed that REM sleep abnormalities can be mimicked by administration of cholinomimetic agents. Another important research avenue is the study of chrono-medical timing of sleep deprivation and light exposure for their positive effects on mood in depression. Present day research takes the view on insomnia, i.e., prolonged sleep latency, problems to maintain sleep, and early morning awakening, as a transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders, being most closely related to depression. Studying insomnia from different angles as a transdiagnostic phenotype has opened many new perspectives for research into mechanisms but also for clinical practice. Thus, the question is: can the early and adequate treatment of insomnia prevent depression?

Insomnia is influenced by the brain's regulation of sleep and wake, which are mutually exclusive events. Insomnia should be treated as a distinct condition, even when occurring with a comorbid diagnosis such as depression or anxiety. Clinicians should implement a multimodal approach to insomnia management, including nonpharmacologic interventions and pharmacologic therapy (when indicated). Pharmacologic agents that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon), low-dose doxepin (tricyclic antidepressant), ramelteon (melatonin receptor agonist), and dual orexin receptor agonists (DORAs, daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant). Unlike other pharmacologic agents, DORAs inhibit wakefulness rather than induce sedation. Additionally, these medications have no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal, and little to no abuse potential. Daridorexant is the newest DORA, has an ideal half-life of 8 hours, and has demonstrated continued efficacy over a 12-month period.

This review aims to summarize the status of metabolomic analyses-based knowledge on sleep disorders and to present knowledge in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. Overall, findings suggest that sleep-wake disorders lead to pronounced alterations in specific metabolic pathways, which might contribute to the association of sleep disorders with other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. These alterations are mainly related to changes in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. In insomnia, alterations in branched-chain amino acid and glucose metabolism were shown among studies. In obstructive sleep apnea, biomarkers related to lipid metabolism seem to be of special importance.

However, some recommendations claim that only hypnotics have been proven effective in the treatment of sleep initiation and maintenance disorders. The aim of this article is to compare the effect of hypnotics and trazodone on sleep, and to analyse the evidence for the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. Three studies investigated the effects of trazodone on sleep in primary insomnia, 5 studies on insomnia in the course of affective disorders and 6 studies on insomnia in other indications (PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol and opiate dependence, somatoform disorder, and insomnia during pregnancy). In the treatment of insomnia, trazodone is less effective than hypnotics in the treatment of sleep onset insomnia (i.e., disorders of falling asleep). For this indication it needs to be administered earlier than hypnotics, at least 1 hour before bedtime. It is, however, very effective in the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, especially in patients with comorbid mental disorders or patients treated with activating antidepressants. Hypnotics and trazodone have the opposite effect on deep sleep. Trazodone increases the duration of deep sleep, which is associated with better sleep quality as assessed by patients. In contrast, hypnotics decrease slow-wave activityin sleep EEG, which is the biomarker of deep sleep. The main mechanism through which trazodone promotes sleep is its antagonistic effect on 5-HT2 serotonin receptors, while hypnotics are agonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAA receptors, and other sedative antidepressants block H1 histamine receptors. This is associated with a low risk of weight gain, which is rare with trazodone treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994734/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\".

Qualitative analysis of the review showed some improvement mainly in subjective measures. Morning light exposure advanced sleep-wake rhythms and evening exposure led to a delay. No worsening was observed in objective nor subjective measures, except for TST in one study with evening exposure. A light dose-response may exist but the studies' heterogeneity and publication bias limit the interpretation. To conclude, light therapy shows some effectiveness for sleep maintenance in insomnia disorders, but further research is needed to refine the light parameters to be chosen according to the type of insomnia, in the hope of developing personalised therapeutics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37002704/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Brief and valid instruments are needed both for screening and outcome assessment. This study examined psychometric indices of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to detect cases of insomnia in a population-based sample and to evaluate treatment response in a clinical sample. Participants were 959 individuals selected from the community for an epidemiological study of insomnia (Community sample) and 183 individuals evaluated for insomnia treatment and 62 controls without insomnia (Clinical sample). They completed the ISI and several measures of sleep quality, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and quality of life; those in the Clinical sample also completed sleep diaries, polysomnography, and interviews to validate their insomnia/good sleep status and assess treatment response. In addition to standard psychometric indices of reliability and validity, item response theory analyses were computed to examine ISI item response patterns. Receiver operating curves were used to derive optimal cutoff scores for case identification and to quantify the minimally important changes in relation to global improvement ratings obtained by an independent assessor. ISI internal consistency was excellent for both samples (Cronbach α of 0.90 and 0.91). Item response analyses revealed adequate discriminatory capacity for 5 of the 7 items. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between total ISI score and measures of fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. A cutoff score of 10 was optimal (86.1% sensitivity and 87.7% specificity) for detecting insomnia cases in the community sample. In the clinical sample, a change score of -8.4 points (95% CI: -7.1, -9.4) was associated with moderate improvement as rated by an independent assessor after treatment. These findings provide further evidence that the ISI is a reliable and valid instrument to detect cases of insomnia in the population and is sensitive to treatment response in clinical patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21532953/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Alongside psychiatric care, interepisode bipolar disorder I participants with insomnia were randomly allocated to a bipolar disorder-specific modification of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI-BP; n = 30) or psychoeducation (PE; n = 28) as a comparison condition. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size estimates. During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. 42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures. The effects of treatment were well sustained through follow-up for most outcomes, although some decline on secondary sleep benefits was observed. CBTI-BP was associated with reduced risk of mood episode relapse and improved sleep and functioning on certain outcomes in bipolar disorder. Hence, sleep disturbance appears to be an important pathway contributing to bipolar disorder.

This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep.

Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception).

Insomnia is a strong candidate to join the list of risk factors for hypertension along with obstructive sleep apnea. In the meantime, chronic insomnia should become part of the routine assessment of patients with elevated BP and should be a source for referral, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment, rather than regarded as a symptom of the underlying medical disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779139/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Linear regression models, accounting for intraindividual correlation, were used to estimate associations between daytime napping and nighttime sleep parameters (duration, efficiency, quality, awakenings). Models were also stratified by trimester of pregnancy. Sixty-three percent of participants reported napping on at least 1 day. Among participants in the second trimester (65%), napping 15-59 minutes was associated with 6.3% greater self-reported sleep efficiency (95% confidence interval: 2.3, 10.2) and 0.5 units greater self-reported sleep quality (95% confidence interval: 0.0, 0.9) that night; napping 60+ minutes was associated with 0.6 hours shorter actigraphy-measured sleep duration (95% confidence interval: -1.0, -0.2). Napping was not associated with nighttime sleep overall or during the third trimester. Nighttime sleep parameters were not associated with napping duration the following day. Among pregnant individuals with insomnia in the second trimester, short napping duration was associated with higher self-reported sleep efficiency and quality; long napping duration was associated with shorter actigraphy-measured sleep duration. Additional research is needed to examine the interaction between nap duration and nap timing. In the future, these results may lead to more nuanced recommendations for daytime napping among pregnant individuals with insomnia disorder.

We present evidence that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is the most biologically severe phenotype of the disorder, as it is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal, activation of both limbs of the stress system, and a higher risk for hypertension, impaired heart rate variability, diabetes, neurocognitive impairment, and mortality. Also, it appears that objective short sleep duration is a biological marker of genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia. In contrast, insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep misperception but not with signs of activation of both limbs of the stress system or medical complications. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with unremitting course, whereas the latter is more likely to remit. We propose that short sleep duration in insomnia is a reliable marker of the biological severity and medical impact of the disorder. Objective measures of sleep obtained in the home environment of the patient would become part of the routine assessment of insomnia patients in a clinician's office setting.

Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep.

Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290199/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

The results of the studies summarized in this review show that emotional regulation can mediate the effect of insomnia on various psychiatric disorders. Insomnia can be a significant risk factor that should be targeted in various psychiatric disorders.

The low-frequency, high-amplitude slow waves that dominate the electroencephalogram (EEG) during SWS can be quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA). SWS and SWA are regulated very accurately in response to variations in the duration and intensity of wakefulness and sleep. SWA declines more or less independently of circadian phase during the course of a sleep episode, indicating that it is primarily under homeostatic rather than circadian control. An age-related decline in SWS and SWA is well established. In some studies, apprehension, depression and insomnia have been associated with reductions in SWS and SWA. Experimental reductions of SWS through SWS deprivation (without altering total sleep time or REM duration) have been reported to lead to an increase in daytime sleep propensity and reductions in performance. SWS and SWA are therefore thought to contribute to the recovery processes that occur during sleep. Most currently prescribed hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, suppress SWA.

In this study, we examined the association between insomnia with objective short sleep duration, also based on subjective sleep duration, with incident hypertension in the Sleep Heart Health Study. We analyzed data from 1,413 participants free of hypertension or sleep apnea at baseline from the Sleep Heart Health Study, with a median follow-up duration of 5.1 years. Insomnia symptoms were defined based on difficulty falling asleep, difficulty returning to sleep, early morning awakening, or sleeping pill use more than half the days in a month. Objective short sleep duration was defined as polysomnography-measured total sleep time < 6 hours. Incident hypertension was defined based on blood pressure measures and/or use of antihypertensive medications at follow-up. Individuals with insomnia who slept objectively < 6 hours had significantly higher odds of incident hypertension compared to normal sleepers who slept ≥ 6 hours (odds ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.09-3.65) or < 6 hours (odds ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-3.79) or individuals with insomnia who slept ≥ 6 hours (odds ratio = 2.79, 95% confidence interval = 1.24-6.30). Individuals with insomnia who slept ≥ 6 hours or normal sleepers who slept < 6 hours were not associated with increased risk of incident hypertension compared to normal sleepers who slept ≥ 6 hours. Finally, individuals with insomnia who self-reported sleeping < 6 hours were not associated with significantly increased odds of incident hypertension. These data further support that the insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype based on objective, but not subjective measures, is associated with increased risk of developing hypertension in adults.

The current review aims to synthesise the best available literature on the neurobiological mechanisms of sleep state misperception and the extent to which the existing literature supports this theory. Overall, findings suggest that cognitive and neurophysiological hyperarousal and dysfunctional sensory-gating mechanisms that insufficiently inhibit arousal may largely account for the phenomenon of sleep state misperception observed among patients with paradoxical insomnia. Most studies to date, however, have relied on comparing self-reports of sleep duration with polysomnography-derived sleep duration, limiting our ability to differentiate the effects of perception from retrospective-reporting bias. Therefore, more studies which use contemporaneous assessments of sleep-wake perception are required to directly test the hypothesis that subjective-objective discrepancies arise from altered perception of sleep states.

Sleep discrepancy variables were calculated by subtracting actigraphic sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset from respective self-reported estimates, pre- and post-treatment. Mean level and night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy were investigated. Baseline sleep discrepancies were compared between groups. Pre-post-treatment changes in Insomnia Severity Index score and sleep discrepancy variables were investigated within older adults with insomnia. Sleep discrepancy was significantly greater and more variable across nights in older adults with insomnia than controls, P ≤ 0.001 for all. Treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was associated with significant reduction in the Insomnia Severity Index score that correlated with changes in mean level and night-to-night variability in wake after sleep onset discrepancy, P < 0.001 for all.

Insomnia is a common, undertreated disorder. Nonpharmacologic management strategies (e.g., stimulus control, relaxation therapy, sleep hygiene) are therapeutic options that, compared with medication use, provide more sustained effects. The benzodiazepines and zolpidem are the most commonly prescribed hypnotic agents, but their use is associated with tolerance and central nervous system adverse effects. A new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, zaleplon, was very recently approved in the United States. Because of its short half-life, zaleplon will be useful in patients experiencing difficulty in falling asleep and in those who wake up at night and have trouble falling back to sleep. Antidepressants, antihistamines, and alternative medications are other treatment options. To avoid complications of therapy, hypnotic agents should be used at their lowest possible doses and for limited treatment durations. Pharmacotherapy is currently the most common treatment modality for insomnia, but long-term use of hypnotic agents can become complicated by drug tolerance, dependence, or rebound insomnia. Nonpharmacologic options--including combinations of behavioral interventions, sleep-restriction therapy, and patient education--provide longer-lasting benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10533351/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Unfortunately, reports on altered average HR or heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep in insomnia are equivocal. Here, we evaluated whether the objective quantification of insomnia improves by assessing state-related changes in cardiac measures. We recorded electrocardiography, posture, and actigraphy in 33 people without sleep complaints and 158 patients with mild to severe insomnia over 4 d in their home environment. At the microscale, we investigated whether HR changed with proximity to gross (body) and small (wrist) movements at nighttime. At the macroscale, we calculated day-night differences in HR and HRV measures. For both timescales, we tested whether outcome measures were related to insomnia diagnosis and severity. At the microscale, an increase in HR was often detectable already 60 s prior to as well as following a nocturnal chest, but not wrist, movement. This increase was slightly steeper in insomnia and was associated with insomnia severity, but future EEG recordings are necessary to elucidate whether these changes occur prior to or simultaneously with PSG-indicators of wakefulness. At the macroscale, we found an attenuated cardiac response to sleep in insomnia: patients consistently showed smaller day-night differences in HR and HRV.

The 30 studies which met the review inclusion criteria broadly addressed six domains of occupational functioning: absenteeism; workplace accidents; productivity; punctuality; job satisfaction and career progression. Collectively, study outcomes support the conclusions that insomnia symptoms: are consistently associated with excess absenteeism; elevate accident risk in the workplace; reduce subjectively experienced workplace productivity (at least in the shorter term); inhibit career progression; and can degrade job satisfaction. Study outcomes do not support the conclusion that people with insomnia are significantly less punctual than other workers.

Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co-morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37537965/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

This study aimed to determine which modifiable factors, beyond stress, were associated with acute insomnia during a major crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. A global online survey assessed sleep/circadian, stress, mental health, and lifestyle factors between April-May 2020. Logistic regression models analyzed data from 1319 participants (578 acute insomnia, 731 good sleepers), adjusted for demographic differences. Perceived stress was a significant predictor of acute insomnia during the pandemic (OR 1.23, 95% CI1.19-1.27). After adjusting for stress, individuals who altered their sleep-wake patterns (OR 3.36, CI 2.00-5.67) or increased technology use before bed (OR 3.13, CI 1.13-8.65) were at increased risk of acute insomnia. Other sleep factors associated with acute insomnia included changes in dreams/nightmares (OR 2.08, CI 1.32-3.27), increased sleep effort (OR 1.99, CI1.71-2.31) and cognitive pre-sleep arousal (OR 1.18, CI 1.11-1.24).

Sleep perception was calculated as self-reported total sleep time/objective total sleep time. The underestimation of sleep duration group was defined based on sleep perception less than the median of the overall sample (85%). Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess the severity of insomnia. The total scores of Insomnia Severity Index decreased significantly after CBT-I in both groups with and without underestimation of sleep duration. Compared to pretreatment, self-reported sleep efficiency increased and total wake time decreased after CBT-I, while the magnitude of changes in sleep efficiency (<i>d</i> = 1.40 vs <i>d</i>=0.81, interaction <i>P</i> = .016) and total wake time (<i>d</i> = -1.82 vs <i>d</i> = -0.85, interaction <i>P</i> < .001) were larger in the underestimation of sleep duration group .

Individuals underwent one-night PSG and full medical evaluation at baseline and a telephone interview at follow-up. PSG sleep duration was analyzed as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable: < 6 h sleep (short sleep duration) and ≥ 6 h sleep (longer sleep duration). The rates of insomnia persistence, partial remission, and full remission were 44.0%, 30.0%, and 26.0%, respectively. Objective short sleep duration significantly increased the odds of persistent insomnia as compared to normal sleep (OR = 3.19) and to fully remitted insomnia (OR = 4.92). Mental health problems at baseline were strongly associated with persistent insomnia as compared to normal sleep (OR = 9.67) and to a lesser degree compared to fully remitted insomnia (OR = 3.68). Smoking, caffeine, and alcohol consumption and sleep apnea did not predict persistent insomnia. Objective short sleep duration and mental health problems are the strongest predictors of persistent insomnia.

Resting-state microstate 3 (RS-MS3) duration is closely related to SN overactivation. However, whether RS-MS3 duration is a biomarker for SOI has not yet been reported in the literature. In addition, SN activity is also associated with efficiency. However, it is not clear whether there are individual differences in the neural mechanisms of SOI in different efficiency groups. Considering that RS-MS3 duration characterizes the stability and persistent activation of the SN in the resting state, the current study investigated the link between SOI measured by sleep latency of Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), efficiency measured by Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory (KAI), and RS-MS3 in a Chinese healthy (subclinical) student population, using electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis. We found that RS-MS3 duration was positively correlated with sleep latency and efficiency. The interaction between sleep latency and efficiency was significant. Simple slope analysis showed that high sleep latency was positively correlated with longer RS-MS3 duration in participants with higher efficiency scores. This correlation did not exist in participants with low efficiency scores. RS-MS3 duration may serve as a biomarker for SOI.

Insomnia is a disorder in which the sufferer has difficulty in falling or staying asleep. There are multifactorial causes involved in the aetiology of childhood insomnia. In order to understand and diagnose insomnia in childhood it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the genesis of sleeping and waking. We must also take the possible existence of other types of disorders into consideration. Insomnia appears as an imbalance between the systems that maintain the waking state and those that are in charge of activating sleep generating systems. In children, this imbalance depends on the state of functional immaturity peculiar to each age. Rather than a shortage of sleep, childhood insomnia takes the form of a lack of matching between the child s own rhythm or need to sleep and his or her family or social environment. Insomnia is most frequently caused by environmental, behavioural and psychological factors. A correct diagnosis of childhood insomnia has to be based on determining a procedure to differentiate it from parasomnias or motor disorders affecting waking and sleep. Identifying the causes of childhood insomnia, differentiating it from real insomnia and other sleep disorders, and resolving it are no simple matter because of the influence exerted by the environment and the child s behaviour on how he or she sleeps.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12599139/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Sleep hygiene improved several diary and questionnaire outcomes, however, yoga resulted in even greater improvements corresponding to medium-to-large between-group effect sizes. Total sleep time increased progressively across yoga treatment (<i>d</i> = 0.95, <i>P</i> = .002), concurrent with increased sleep efficiency (<i>d</i> = 1.36, <i>P</i> < .001) and decreased sleep onset latency (<i>d</i> = -1.16, <i>P</i> < .001), but without changes in pre-sleep arousal (<i>d</i> =-0.30, <i>P</i> = .59).

Globally, large surveys and tightly controlled sleep deprivation or manipulation experiments provide good evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between sleep and subclinical psychotic experiences. The evidence for cause-and-effect using a interventionist-causal model is more ambiguous; it would appear treating insomnia improves psychotic experiences in an insomnia cohort but not in a cohort with schizophrenia.

Given the latest discoveries about the brain's waste clearance system and its relationship to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, this review gives a brief overview on the molecular mechanisms behind sleep loss-related impairments. Recent evidence indicates that sleep plays a vital role in neuro-immuno-endocrine homeostasis. Sleep loss has been linked to elevated risks for cognitive and mood disorders, underscored by impaired synaptic transmission. The glymphatic system has been shown to be modulated by sleep and implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Interactions between sleep quality, the immune system, and neurodegenerative disease are complex and a challenge to distil. These interactions are frequently bidirectional, because of sleep's characterization as an early symptom and as a potential factor contributing to the development and progression of mood and cognitive disorders.

Temperament and sleep hygiene may be two such factors.

Correlations amongst the included measures were in the predicted direction: effortful control was negatively associated with the SHI composite, PSQI global scores, and ISI scores; extraversion was negatively related to PSQI global scores; and negative affect was positively associated with the SHI composite and ISI scores. In addition, the SHI composite mediated the association between effortful control and the PSQI global scores as well as the association between negative affect and PSQI global scores; similar patterns of mediation were found when considering ISI scores, although the direct effects differed.

Sleep and circadian rhythms recordings were subsequently obtained and measures of sleep quality were compared to assess efficacy of the treatments. Baseline and post-treatment sleep and circadian rhythms assessments took place in the Laboratory of Human Chronobiology, Department of Psychiatry, Cornell University Medical College.

All subjects were free of hypnotic medication, and all had experienced sleep disturbance for at least 1 year prior to entering the study. Exposure to bright light resulted in substantial changes in sleep quality. Waking time within sleep was reduced by an hour, and sleep efficiency improved from 77.5% to 90%, without altering time spent in bed. Increased sleep time was in the form of Stage 2 sleep, REM sleep, and slow wave sleep. The effects were remarkably consistent across subjects.

Lower delta and greater alpha, sigma, and beta NREM EEG activity were found in the patients with subjective insomnia but not those with objective insomnia, compared with the normal subjects. These results were robust to changes in the subtyping criteria. No effects were found for REM spectral indexes. Less delta non- REM EEG activity predicted greater deviation between subjective and PSG estimates of sleep time across all subjects. For the subjective insomnia subjects, diminished low-frequency and elevated higher frequency non- REM EEG activity was associated with their sleep complaints.

Thirty-one patients and 42 healthy volunteers were included in the insomnia and non-insomnia group, respectively. Participants recorded subjective assessments in sleep diaries, objective assessments with an actigraphy worn for 14 days, and self-assessments using questionnaires. Both groups had similar objective sleep ratings; however, insomnia group had significantly worse subjective ratings (total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and sleep onset latency). A significant correlation was found between subjective and objective total sleep time scores in non-insomnia group but not in insomnia group. Insomnia group had earlier bedtimes, significantly longer bedtimes, and impaired daytime functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale score); additionally, they underestimated their total sleep time, particularly with earlier bedtimes and longer laying durations.

Various diagnostic systems emphasize the chronic nature of insomnia and its impact on daily functioning, relying heavily on patient self-reporting due to limitations in objective measures such as polysomnography (PSG). Discrepancies between subjective experiences and objective PSG results highlight the need for more nuanced approaches, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis, which reveals distinct patterns of high-frequency activity in individuals with insomnia. This study explores EEG markers of insomnia by integrating subjective reports with objective physiological markers, specifically ORP (Odds-Ratio-Product) and spectral features, to address inconsistencies found in previous research and clinical settings. Qualitative and quantitative definitions of insomnia are contrasted to highlight differences in sleep architecture and EEG characteristics. The research aims to determine whether groups defined by weekly frequency and daily duration of symptoms have different distribution patterns and which physiological characteristics best distinguish insomnia patients from controls. Our findings suggest that ORP, as a dependent variable, captures the most significant differences in the independent variables across the model. Elevated beta power in insomnia patients indicates increased cortical arousal, supporting the perspective of insomnia as a hyperarousal disorder. Future research should focus on using ORP to enhance the understanding of sleep disturbances in insomnia.

Research has identified hyperarousal as a key factor, with both trait and state components. It has been shown that emotion dysregulation also plays a role in insomnia. Hence, the aim was to investigate how insomnia rumination is associated with both trait- and state-dependent arousal and emotion dysregulation in insomnia. Sixty-eight subjects with insomnia disorder (DSM-5) and 36 good sleepers were evaluated using: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Daytime Insomnia Symptom Response Scale (DISRS), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses and mediation analyses were performed. Subjects with insomnia (F 41, mean age 50.2 ± 10) presented higher scores than good sleepers (F 22, mean age 49.7 ± 14) in all the scales (ISI, DISRS, APS, PSAS, DERS; p < 0.0001). Insomnia rumination was directly correlated with trait (APS, B = 0.22, p < 0.0001) pre-sleep state arousal (PSAS cognitive B = 0.22, p < 0.0001, PSAS somatic B = 0.24, p < 0.0001) and emotion dysregulation (B = 0.5, p = 0.03). It mediated the association between trait and pre-sleep state hyperarousal (Z = 3.3, p = 0.0008), the bidirectional association between cognitive and somatic arousal (p = 0.02), and the association between trait hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation (Z = 2.3, p = 0.04). In insomnia, specific rumination is related to both trait predisposition to arousal and to state-dependent arousal. It is also related to emotion dyregulation. Insomnia-specific ruminative response style may modulate the complex association between trait- and state-dependent arousal factors and arousal and emotion regulation in insomnia. In this framework, a broad range of cognitive processes may be considered when dealing with subjects with insomnia: the use of rumination-oriented psychological strategies could be important.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28215272/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

We examined randomized controlled trial data to investigate the effect of OSA severity, and pretreatment daytime sleepiness on week-to-week changes in daytime sleepiness and sleep parameters during CBTi and no-treatment control. One hundred and forty-five patients with untreated physician-diagnosed OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥15) and psychologist-diagnosed insomnia (ICSD-3) were randomized to a 4-week CBTi program (n = 72) or no-treatment control (n = 73). The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and sleep diaries were completed during pretreatment, weekly CBTi sessions, and posttreatment. Effects of OSA severity, pretreatment daytime sleepiness, and intervention group on weekly changes in daytime sleepiness and sleep parameters were investigated.

There were no differences in changes in daytime sleepiness during treatment between CBTi and control groups or OSA-severity groups. Higher pretreatment ESS scores were associated with a greater ESS reduction during CBTi. CBTi appears to be a safe and effective treatment in the presence of comorbid moderate and severe OSA.

The aim of this study was to estimate meaningful within-patient change for sTST using clinical trial data. Data were from an open-label trial of zolpidem and pooled data from a phase III placebo-controlled trial of daridorexant. In both trials, adults with moderate to severe insomnia completed the SDQ daily. Meaningful change in sTST was estimated in an anchor-based analysis using outcome measures that were correlated with change in weekly average sTST (Spearman correlation coefficient ≥ 0.30): the Insomnia Severity Index, patient global assessments and impressions of severity and change in daytime and night-time symptoms (PGA-S, PGI-S, PGI-C), and clinician global impressions of severity and change in patients' daytime symptoms (CGI-S, CGI-C). Meaningful within-patient change estimates were 'triangulated' to identify a value where they converged. In the open-label trial (N = 114), subjects with a 1-point or 1-step improvement on the anchors had mean increases in sTST of 60.1-83.2 min at day 8 and 55.5-68.2 min at day 15. For subjects with a 2-point or 2-step improvement on the anchors, mean increases in sTST were 79.6-81.4 min at day 8 and 80.1-93.5 min at day 15.

Despite being recognized for a long time by the international community, it is still unclear whether this entity really exists, which are its features and boundaries. Much of the debate is fuelled by the lack of a consensus on its precise definition. To help filling some of the existing gaps, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, through which 19 different quantitative definitions were obtained. These definitions were then applied to two distinct datasets. The first consisted of 200 chronic primary insomnia patients, diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The second consisted of 200 age- and sex-matched healthy persons without insomnia. For each dataset, available data from the objective sleep parameters and their subjective estimation were imported and analysed in MATLAB. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of paradoxical insomnia ranged from 8 to 66%, while agreement between different definitions ranged from -0.19 to 0.9 (using Cohen's kappa coefficient). Based on the results garnered, necessary features for a quantitative definition of paradoxical insomnia were identified. Several open questions remain, such as whether there is a minimum number of hours a patient should sleep to fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia, and whether sleep latency can be used in the definition along with total sleep time. We conclude by advocating continued study of paradoxical insomnia and sleep state misperception and by providing specific directions for future research. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The current understanding of paradoxical insomnia and, more broadly, of sleep state misperception, is greatly hampered by the lack of agreement on a quantitative and evidence-base measure of the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep evaluation. The current study provides a critical analysis about the strength and the limitations of the available definitions, using both a data-driven and a theory-driven approach. The overarching goal is to motivate a rigorous discussion involving the main experts of the field, to build a consensus, and develop an evidence-based measure of sleep state misperception and/or of paradoxical insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30731262/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Following the recommendations of the PRISMA and MARS statement, a systematic literature search was carried out on the PubMed, Web of Science, CINHAL, and PsycINFO databases, with no restrictions on the language or publication date. For the meta-analysis, a random-effects model and the <i>Insomnia Severity Index</i> were used as outcome measures. To assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence, the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the GRADE method were used, respectively. Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review and 12 studies in the meta-analysis, making a total of 14 intervention groups with a sample of 827 workers. Cognitive behavioral therapy was the most widely used intervention. According to the estimated difference between the means, a moderate effect for the reduction of insomnia symptoms after the intervention (MD -2.08, CI 95%: [-2.68, -1.47]) and a non-significant degree of heterogeneity were obtained (<i>p</i> = 0.64; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). The quality of the evidence and the risk of bias were moderate. The results suggest that interventions on insomnia in the workplace are effective for improving workers' health, and that improvements in the quality of sleep and a decrease in the symptoms of insomnia are produced, thanks to an increase in weekly sleeping hours and a reduction in latency at sleep onset. As regards work, they also led to improvements in productivity, presenteeism, and job burnout.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32887475/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

The EEG power of the beta2 frequency band (18-29.75 Hz) was significantly lower in SOI than in SMI in the period preceding sleep onset. The alpha power was significantly higher for the SMI group compared to GS before sleep onset. Despite the lack of statistical significance, several differences in EEG dynamics were observed in SOI compared to two other groups: delta power increased slower after sleep onset; beta2 and 3 (18-29.75 and 30-39.75 Hz) power decrease less abruptly before sleep onset; beta1 (15-17.75 Hz) power increase through the whole SOP. The lower level of beta2 frequency band in SOI and the differences in dynamics in delta and beta bands may suggest that a mechanism other than hyperarousal participates in etiology of SOI.

Available models exist primarily in the psychological domain and derive from the demonstrated efficacy of behavioral treatment approaches to insomnia management. However, these models offer little specific prediction about the anatomic or physiological foundation of chronic primary insomnia. On the other hand, a growing body of data on the physiology of sleep supports a reasonably circumscribed overview of possible pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as the development of physiological models of insomnia to guide future research. As a pragmatic step, these models focus on primary insomnia, as opposed to comorbid insomnias, because the latter is by its nature a much more heterogeneous presentation, reflecting the effects of the distinct comorbid condition. Current understanding of the regulation of sleep and wakefulness in mammalian brain supports four broad candidate areas: 1) disruption of the sleep homeostat; 2) disruption of the circadian clock; 3) disruption of intrinsic systems responsible for the expression of sleep states; or 4) disruption (hyperactivity) of extrinsic systems capable of over-riding normal sleep-wake regulation. This review examines each of the four candidate pathophysiological mechanisms and the available data in support of each. While studies that directly test the viability of each model are not yet available, descriptive data on primary insomnia favor the involvement of dysfunctional extrinsic stress-response systems in the pathology of primary chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18346677/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is commonly used for evaluating sleep disturbance; however, this questionnaire is time-consuming owing to the large number of questions. As the usefulness of the Athens insomnia scale (AIS) in patients with CLD is not sufficiently known, the present study aimed to determine whether the AIS and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) could be used as simple alternative questionnaires for evaluating sleep disturbances in patients with CLD. Materials and Methods: A total of 117 patients with CLD were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy were excluded. All patients were examined using the AIS, PSQI, and ESS, and their responses to these questionnaires were statistically analyzed. Results: The number of patients diagnosed with sleep disturbance using the AIS, PSQI, and ESS were 39 (33.3%), 37 (31.6%), and 9 (7.7%), respectively. There was no correlation between PSQI and ESS scores (r = 0.011, p = 0.910); in contrast, the AIS scores showed a significant correlation with the PSQI scores (r = 0.689, p < 0.001). When the PSQI was considered as the standard for evaluating sleep disturbance, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AIS were 76.9%, 91.0%, 81.1%, and 88.8%, respectively. In the sleep medication group, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the AIS were 100%, 70%, 78.6%, and 100%, respectively.

The standard therapy recommended for sleep disorders is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Many of its interventions are based on a regular sleep and wake rhythm, which is difficult to apply for shift workers. We have therefore developed a new therapy manual specifically for shift workers (CBT-I-S), which should be more applicable to their needs. In particular, all interventions that require regularity have been removed, and instead, interventions that address factors that proved to be relevant to sleep in our preliminary study have been integrated. We now want to test this manual for its effectiveness. A randomised controlled trial with N = 142 will be conducted to compare two conditions: the newly developed therapy manual will be carried out in the experimental group, while cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia will be employed in the standard group. Both treatments will be conducted online via MS Teams in a group setting with seven sessions each. Data will be collected at three measurement points (pre, post, 6-month follow-up) and analysed using linear mixed models. The study will investigate whether the two treatments have led to significant improvements in total sleep time, sleep onset latency, subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in shift workers. It will also examine whether the new therapy manual is superior to standard therapy in shift workers and whether these effects are stable. We assume that interventions designed to address depressive mood, anxiety, worry, rumination, dysfunctional thought patterns and attitudes towards sleep will also improve sleep. If this is indeed the case, these interventions could replace previous ones that require regularity. This could significantly improve the treatment of insomnia in shift workers.

The complexity of sleep architecture varies between species but all share features which are comparable. In addition, sleep architecture is sensitive to changes in brain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, so cross-species sleep measurement can be combined with pharmacological manipulation to investigate the receptor mechanisms controlling sleep-wake regulation and sleep architecture in response to known and novel agents. Translational approaches such as these have improved our understanding of sleep circuitry and facilitated the development of new treatments for sleep disorders, particularly insomnia.

Two composite scores were computed, a behavioral schedule composite score (BCS) and insomnia symptom composite score (ICS). The Insomnia Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Morningness-Eveningness Composite Scale were administered at baseline and post-treatment. Results revealed that greater BCS scores were significantly associated with younger age, eveningness chronotype, and greater depression severity (p<0.001). Both depression severity and eveningness chronotype independently predicted variability in sleep schedules (p<0.001). Finally, CBTI resulted in reduced sleep variability for all sleep diary variables except bedtime. Post-treatment symptom reductions in depression severity were greater among those with high versus low baseline BCS scores (p<0.001). Results suggest that variability in sleep schedules predict reduction in insomnia and depressive severity following group CBTI.

Questions regarding sleep hygiene practices were administered at baseline, and the status of insomnia was assessed at baseline (T1) and at the 1-year follow-up (T2). Age, gender, mental ill-health, and pain were used as covariates in the analyses. Nicotine use, mental ill-health and pain were independently associated with an increased risk for concurrent insomnia at T1, while mental ill-health was the only risk factor for incident insomnia at T2. Relative to not reporting insomnia at the two time-points, nicotine use, light or noise disturbance, mental ill-health, and pain significantly increased the risk for persistent insomnia over 1 year. In comparison with those whose insomnia had remitted at the follow-up, reporting an irregular sleep schedule was a significant risk factor for persistent insomnia. Of the nine sleep hygiene practices examined in this study, only three were independently linked to concurrent and future insomnia, respectively; using nicotine late in the evening, light or noise disturbance, and having an irregular sleep schedule.

Thus, the relationship between periodic leg movements during sleep, sleep disruption and the complaint of patients is particularly complex. We investigated the macro- and micro-structure of sleep with and without leg movements in 10 PLMS patients complaining of insomnia to clarify whether periodic leg movements are responsible for sleep disruption. The total sleep time without periodic leg movements was significantly longer than sleep time with leg movements. Sleep time without leg movements was longer than sleep time with leg movements in stage 2, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Short lasting awakenings were significantly more frequent during periodic leg movements associated sleep whilst long lasting awakenings were equally frequent during sleep with and without periodic leg movements. The percentage of the four electroencephalogram (EEG) activities (delta, theta, alpha and spindles) did not show any significant difference between periodic leg movements associated and not associated with sleep stages and total sleep time.

Insomnia per se is a very frequent complaint and can be caused by environmental, medical, mental or psychosocial factors or the intake of drugs. Primary insomnia is an insomnia subtype characterized by the absence of a causative medical or psychiatric factor. From a pathophysiological point of view, persistent hyperarousal on autonomous, emotional, cognitive or neurobiological levels is thought to be the decisive factor for the development and persistence of chronic primary insomnia. This view is supported by studies confirming that patients with primary insomnia display heightened levels of fast frequencies of the sleep EEG, show increased production of cortisol and interleukin-6, and demonstrate increased metabolism in several brain areas during sleep (as measured by positron emission tomography). Furthermore, primary insomnia is coupled with cognitive deficits during waking and with impairments of nocturnal memory consolidation. Just recently, reductions in hippocampal volume size have been reported in patients suffering from primary insomnia. In the light of neurobiological theories of sleep-wake regulation, primary insomnia may be conceptualised as the final common pathway of the interaction of a genetic vulnerability to an imbalance between arousing and sleep-inducing brain centres (which is triggered by psychosocial and/or medical stressors) with perpetuating mechanisms such as maladaptive behaviours, learned sleep-preventing associations and cognitive factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473230/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Participants were Veterans with PTSD and comorbid insomnia (N = 40) participating in a clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia plus PE. SE was measured via nightly sleep diaries, fear extinction was operationalized as a reduction in peak distress between weekly imaginal exposures, and PTSD symptoms were assessed bi-weekly.

Results of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory showed that subjects in the IN group had more pathological personality profiles, and results of laboratory studies showed that these subjects had worse mood ratings, less subjective sleepiness, poorer memory performance, and longer midafternoon sleep latencies. Subjects in the IN group also rated their laboratory sleep as poorer in quality with more time awake after sleep onset and longer sleep latencies, but no differences in EEG sleep were observed. Poor nights of EEG sleep were associated with being male, increasing age, and a history of more time awake after sleep onset; among the laboratory tests, poor EEG sleep was associated with worse mood ratings, poorer memory performance, longer sleep latencies (as indicated by higher scores on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), higher sleep/wake ratios for metabolic parameters, lower ratings of sleep quality, and longer perceived sleep latencies.

Polysomnographic studies reveal that reductions in slow wave sleep are the most consistent altitude-induced changes in sleep structure identified by visual scoring. Quantitative spectral analyses of the sleep electroencephalogram have confirmed an altitude-related reduction in the low-frequency power (0.8-4.6 Hz). Although some studies suggest an increase in arousals from sleep at high altitude, this is not a consistent finding. Whether sleep instability at high altitude is triggered by periodic breathing or vice versa is still uncertain. Overnight changes in slow wave-derived encephalographic measures of neuronal synchronization in healthy subjects were less pronounced at moderately high (2,590 m) compared with low altitude (490 m), and this was associated with a decline in sleep-related memory consolidation. Correspondingly, exacerbation of breathing and sleep disturbances experienced by lowlanders with obstructive sleep apnea during a stay at 2,590 m was associated with poor performance in driving simulator tests. These findings suggest that altitude-related alterations in sleep may adversely affect daytime performance. Despite recent advances in our understanding of sleep at altitude, further research is required to better establish the role of gender and age in alterations of sleep at different altitudes, to determine the influence of acclimatization and of altitude-related illness, and to uncover the characteristics of sleep in highlanders that may serve as a study paradigm of sleep in patients exposed to chronic hypoxia due to cardiorespiratory disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26229000/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Sleep-wake state discrepancy occurs when there is an inconsistency between a person's subjective and objective sleep, and is a common phenomenon amongst patients with insomnia. Limited information is available on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in treating patients who experience significant sleep-wake state discrepancy in \"real-world\" samples. In the present study, all patients with insomnia received cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia through an outpatient insomnia program (N = 386; mean age = 51.96 years, SD = 15.62; 65.97% [N = 254] female). Prior to treatment, participants completed a polysomnography sleep study and sleep diary, which was used to calculate sleep-wake state discrepancy. At pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index and other questionnaires, and 1 week of sleep diaries from which sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset and other sleep variables were calculated. There were no differences in self-reported sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset or Insomnia Severity Index scores at post-treatment or 3-month follow-up between quintiles of sleep-wake state discrepancy. These results indicate that sleep-wake state discrepancy at pre-treatment does not predict treatment response to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. Future research could examine multi-night assessments of sleep-wake state discrepancy to determine whether variations in discrepancy may relate to pre-treatment insomnia severity and cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38246601/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Quetiapine has moderately sedative properties, and doses used in treatment of insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg. Results of clinical trials and observations in case studies have revealed possible beneficial effects of quetiapine on several subjective and objective sleep parameters. In most studies, significant improvements in sleep were found in areas of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep scores. However, some of these results may not be clinically significant. Also, quetiapine has been found to have adverse effects such as periodic leg movements, akathisia, and metabolic complications.

Although the efficacy of CBT-I in the treatment of chronic insomnia is well known, however there is little objective data on the effects of CBT-I on sleep architecture and sleep EEG power densities. The present study evaluated, first, subjective change in sleep quality and quantity, and secondly the modifications occurring in polysomnography and EEG power densities during sleep after 8 weeks of CBT-I. Nine free drug patients with psychophysiological insomnia, aged 33-62 years (mean age 47 +/- 9.7 years), seven female and two male participated in the study. Self-report questionnaires were administered 1 week before and 1 week after CBT-I, a sleep diary was completed each day 1 week before CBT-I, during CBT-I and 1 week after CBT-I. Subjects underwent two consecutive polysomnographic nights before and after CBT-I. Spectral analysis was performed the second night following 16 h of controlled wakefulness. After CBT-I, only scales assessing insomnia were significantly decreased, stages 2, REM sleep and SWS durations were significantly increased. Slow wave activity (SWA) was increased and the SWA decay shortened, beta and sigma activity were reduced. In conclusion CBT-I improves both subjective and objective sleep quality of sleep.

Lately, finer measures, such as event-related potentials, and especially the N1 and P2 components have been used to document arousal processes in individuals with insomnia. The objective of the present study was to further circumscribe arousal in Psy-I and Para-I using N1, P2 and the waking processing negativity (wPN). N1 and P2 were recorded in the evening, at sleep-onset and in early stage 2 sleep in 26 good sleepers, 26 Psy-I and 26 Para-I. An oddball paradigm was used and participants received the instruction to ignore all stimuli at all times. Three difference waves (wPNs) were computed to evaluate the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset, from sleep onset to sleep and from wakefulness to sleep. Results revealed that N1 was smaller during wakefulness and sleep onset for Psy-I, while it was larger for Para-I during these same times. P2 was smaller at sleep onset for Psy-I than for Para-I and GS, while P2 during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep was larger for Para-I than GS. WPNs revealed that Psy-I showed fewer changes in information processing, while Para-I showed larger changes between recording times. Psy-I appear to present an inability to inhibit information processing during sleep onset, while Para-I seem to present overall enhanced attentional processing that results in a greater need for inhibition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21708192/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

In practice, mental health professionals providing CBT-I lack consensus on whether or not to tolerate short naps during the CBT-I period for requesting patients. In this pilot study, we examined the effects of authorised napping on CBT-I efficiency in patients with insomnia (a napping group was compared with a matched non-napping group, n = 108). We report that napping enhanced early afternoon alertness and importantly did not affect CBT-I-mediated improvements in the Insomnia Severity Index and Beck Depression Inventory-2 and in self-reported sleep efficiency, latency, and wake after sleep onset (assessed by the sleep diaries).

The study comprised 16,401 participants without chronic spinal pain at baseline who were followed for ∼11 years. People were categorized into 'no insomnia symptoms', 'subthreshold insomnia', and 'insomnia'. Insomnia was defined according to the diagnostic classification system requiring both daytime and nighttime symptoms, and further categorized into subtypes based on nighttime symptoms (ie, sleep onset latency [SOL-insomnia], wake after sleep onset [WASO-insomnia], early morning awakening [EMA-insomnia], or combinations of these). Subthreshold insomnia comprised those with only daytime impairment or one or more nighttime symptoms. Chronic spinal pain was defined as pain in either 'neck', 'low back', or 'upper back', or a combination of these. In multivariable regression analysis using people without insomnia as reference, people with subthreshold insomnia or insomnia had relative risks (RRs) of chronic spinal pain of 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.38) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.34-1.68), respectively. The RRs for people with one nighttime symptom were 1.30 (95% CI 0.83-2.05) for WASO-insomnia, 1.32 (95% CI 1.06-1.65) for EMA-insomnia, and 1.70 (95% CI 1.32-2.18) for SOL-insomnia, respectively.

A total of 142 good sleeping controls, 126 chronic insomnia alone, and 24 comorbid insomnia/nightmare participants underwent four consecutive nights of 8-hour PSG recordings. Outcomes included sleep continuity, architecture, and REM-related parameters across nights one through four. Intraclass correlation coefficients with mixed-effect variances and repeated-measure analysis of covariance were used, respectively, to determine short-term stability as well as between-participants and time-by-group interaction effects. Wake after sleep onset and stage 1 showed \"poor stability\" in the comorbid insomnia/nightmare group compared to \"moderate stability\" in the good sleeping controls and chronic insomnia alone group. Significant between-group effects (all ps < .05) showed that the comorbid insomnia/nightmare group took longer to fall asleep and had a greater first-night-effect in stage 1 compared to good sleeping controls and chronic insomnia alone group; in addition, the comorbid insomnia/nightmare and insomnia alone groups slept shorter, with fewer awakenings and REM periods, compared to the good sleeping controls. Nightmares are associated with abnormal sleep above and beyond REM disruption, as sleep continuity was the primary aspect in which poor stability and group differences emerged. The greater inability to fall asleep and instability of sleep fragmentation in those with comorbid insomnia/nightmares compared to chronic insomnia alone may be attributed to the impact of presleep anticipatory anxiety and nightmare-related distress itself.

Causes of insomnia include: medical, psychiatric, and drug issues; circadian rhythm changes; sleep disorders; and psychosocial factors. The elderly frequently use sleeping aids. Risks associated with elderly patients' use of hypnotic drugs are attributable to concomitant comorbid conditions, use of multiple medications, altered pharmacokinetics, and increased central nervous system sensitivity to these drugs. Treatment options for insomnia include behavior modification and pharmacotherapy. The choice of hypnotics is based on matching the nature of the insomnia to the hypnotic agent. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are common hypnotics prescribed for insomnia in the elderly. The ideal agent has rapid onset, duration of action that lasts through the night but no residual daytime effects, and no adverse effects. The longer-acting agents have been shown to result in a higher risk of falls and hip fractures in the elderly. This relationship is not apparent with short-acting agents. Zaleplon, the newest benzodiazepine receptor agonist, has the shortest half-life of available agents. Studies have demonstrated that zaleplon is effective in improving sleep latency, duration, and sleep quality in the elderly. Zaleplon does not appear to cause rebound insomnia, residual sedation, or adversely affect psychomotor function.

Despite the availability of evidence-based treatments, the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning this disorder remain poorly understood. Recently, the investigation of the less than 1 Hz oscillations (commonly termed slow oscillations), a hallmark of slow wave sleep, has gained increased interest in research on insomnia. In this context, an intriguing perspective arises from the association between slow oscillations and metabolic waste clearance, an impaired process in individuals suffering from insomnia disorder. Indeed, the exploration of the relationships between cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and glymphatic system functions, which relate to brain metabolic clearance, and sleep slow oscillations may represent a promising avenue for future research in this field. This narrative review examines current knowledge about the intricate interplay among these mechanisms and their implications for insomnia disorder. Particular attention is given to the role of sleep slow oscillations in the clearance of metabolic waste during sleep, their coupling with cerebrospinal fluid oscillations, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying glymphatic function. The review emphasises the relevance of investigating sleep slow oscillations-related mechanisms in insomnia, intending to provide novel insights into the neurophysiological underpinnings of the disorder and contribute to more accurate diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of these mechanisms could pave the way for the development of innovative or adjunctive therapeutic strategies targeting sleep slow oscillations-related alterations in insomnia disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40243037/", "source_file": "pubmed_sleep.jsonl"}

Therefore, the current study employed a reaction-time task assessing biased expectations among a group with clinically significant insomnia symptoms (n = 30) and a low insomnia symptoms group (n = 40). The task involved the presentation of scenarios describing the consequences of poor sleep, and non-sleep related activities, which could be resolved in a benign or a negative manner. The results demonstrated that the high insomnia symptoms group were disproportionately fast to resolve sleep-related scenarios in line with negative outcomes, as compared to benign outcomes, relative to the low insomnia symptoms group. The two groups did not differ in their pattern of resolving non-sleep related scenarios.

Among beneficial outcomes, improvement of sleep efficacy, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset were the most frequently reported. In addition, participants significantly reduced sleep medication use. Some studies gave follow-up data which indicated that the CBT produced durable clinical changes in total sleep time and night-time wakefulness. These randomized controlled trial studies demonstrated that CBT was superior to any single-component treatment such as stimulus control, relaxation training, educational programmes, or other control conditions.

The current study tested objective sleepiness as an outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing SRT, CBT-I, and attention control in a sample of postmenopausal women in whom insomnia was diagnosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Single-site, randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 ± 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition insomnia disorder were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep education control (6 sessions); SRT (2 sessions with interim phone contact); and CBT-I (6 sessions). Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment and posttreatment. Risk of excessive sleepiness was evaluated using a symmetry analysis of sleepiness measured through the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). The odds ratios (ORs) of being excessively sleepy versus nonsleepy were not different than 1.0 for both SRT (OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [0.13-6.96]) and CBT-I (OR = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [0.09-4.46]), indicating that the odds of becoming excessively sleepy following treatment was not different from the odds of being nonsleepy. This suggests that excessive sleepiness is not of unique concern following SRT relative to CBT-I or sleep education. SRT appears to have a comparable risk profile for excessive sleepiness as CBT-I, and thus may be considered a safe alternative to CBT-I.

Treatment decisions are frequently made with little or no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and thus require evidence from other data sources. Clinical routine data reflect real-world treatment pathways. However, evidence for LUTS from routine data means that heterogeneous pathways need to be simultaneously analyzed for compiling evidence in the absence of RCTs. Statistical multi-state model approaches can provide a powerful framework for achieving this goal. More extensive statistical and methodological efforts in the area of similarity of small data are needed to enable the valid pooling of pathways towards joining evidence.

Specific etiologies are unknown; most cases are suspected by discovering hydronephrosis on prenatal ultrasonography. Congenital UTO can reduce nephron number and cause bladder dysfunction, which contribute to ongoing injury. Severe UTO can impair kidney growth in utero, and animal models of unilateral ureteral obstruction show that ischemia and oxidative stress cause proximal tubular cell death, with later development of interstitial fibrosis. Congenital obstructive nephropathy, therefore, results from combined developmental and obstructive kidney injury. Because of inadequacy of available biomarkers, criteria for surgical correction of upper tract obstruction are poorly established. Lower tract obstruction requires fetal or immediate postnatal intervention, and the rate of progression of CKD is highly variable. New biomarkers based on proteomics and determination of glomerular number by magnetic resonance imaging should improve future care. Angiotensin inhibitors have not been effective in slowing progression, although avoidance of nephrotoxins and timely treatment of hypertension are important. Because congenital UTO begins in fetal life, smooth transfer of care from perinatologist to pediatric and adult urology and nephrology teams should optimize quality of life and ultimate outcomes for these patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26088076/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

Hydronephrosis is common in pregnant women; symptomatic patients merit intervention similar to nonpregnant patients. The management of patients with an acute stone episode is similar to that for those with hydronephrosis. Patients with first stone episodes need evaluation for risk factors for stone formation, whereas patients with identified risk factors or recurrent stones need comprehensive metabolic workup.

This study aims to elucidate specific practice patterns for treatment of prenatal unilateral urinary tract dilation and to assess surgical intervention patterns for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. An online survey was distributed to 234 pediatric urologists through the Society of Pediatric Urology. The survey was composed of five clinical case scenarios addressing evaluation and management of unilateral urinary tract dilation. The response rate was 71% (n = 168). Circumcision status, gender, and grade were significant factors in recommending prophylactic antibiotics for newborn urinary tract dilation. Prophylactic antibiotic use in the uncircumcised male and female was twice that of a circumcised male for grade 3 (Table). This difference was minimized for grade 4. Use of VCUG was high for circumcised males with grade 3 or 4 (Table). The choice of minimally invasive surgery for ureteropelvic junction repair increased with age from 19% for a 5-month-old, 49% for a 2-year-old, and 85% for a 10-year-old. Notably, 44% of respondents would observe a 10-year-old with intermittent obstruction. Retrograde pyelography was recommended in conjunction with repair in 65% of respondents. Antegrade stent placement was the most common choice (38-47%) for urinary diversion after pyeloplasty. Regarding postoperative imaging, only 5% opted for routine renal scan whereas most would perform renal ultrasound alone. Practice patterns seen for use of prophylactic antibiotics are in agreement with the literature, which promotes selective use in those at highest risk for urinary tract infections. Interestingly, use of aggressive screening was not concordant with this literature. Several studies have indicated an increased usage of robotic pyeloplasty; however, results indicate that minimally invasive surgery is not preferred in those younger than 6 months. Study limitations include use of clinical case scenarios as opposed to actual clinical practice. Practice patterns for prophylactic antibiotic use for neonatal urinary tract dilation are dependent on gender, circumcision status, and grade. The use of minimally invasive surgery for ureteropelvic junction repair increased with patient age, with 50% preferring this modality at 2 years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28506597/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

Predicting renal recovery from obstructive uropathy, can be challenging and necessitates treatment, as in percutaneous nephrostomy (PNS) drainage. The choice of drainage method depends on patient-specific factors and local expertise. According to the data for the Republic of North Macedonia, in the register of the European Renal Association, in the last few years, there has been an increase in the percentage of patients with obstructive nephropathy from 7.6% to 8.9% who end up on a chronic hemodialysis program. Prompt relief from urinary tract obstruction is essential to preserve renal function and prevent complications. The aim of this study is to present our initial data analysis of recent experience in the use of nephrostomies as a method for temporary or long-term resolution of obstructive nephropathy, in terms of safety and success in preserving kidney function and reducing the number of patients on hemodialysis. This study analyzed the medical records of 24 patients with obstructive uropathy who underwent PNS placement. Data were collected for the type and degree of obstruction from the ultrasonographic examination. A pig tail nephrostomy was used, with a dilator, guided under ultrasound and controlled with contrast and fluoroscope. Obstructive nephropathy was defined as an elevation of the serum creatinine > 109 µmol/L, before the intervention. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to the formula CKD epi in ml/min. Each placement of the PNS was considered as an individual procedure and the data of 38 placed nephrostomies were analyzed. We compared the laboratory analyses from the day before (D0) PNS placement and on the seventh day (D7) after PNS placement. The reduction of values for red blood cells (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) baseline values from D0 to D7 and the need for transfusion after the procedure were defined as a complication-bleeding. The increase in total counts of the white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) from the baseline values from D0 to D7 were defined as a complication-infection. Standard statistical methods were used for data processing. Most patients, 17 (70%), had malignant disease as the cause of obstruction. Unilateral obstruction was more common, detected in 24 (63%) of procedures, with a high degree of hydronephrosis. Obstructive nephropathy, marked by elevated serum creatinine, was observed in 23 (60%) cases before PNS placement. Complications included bleeding and infection but did not result in any fatalities. When comparing the laboratory analysis before PNS placement (D0) and seven days later (D7), a statistically significant decrease in serum creatinine (225±161 vs. 162±145, p=0.005) and an increase in GFR (47±39 vs.59±34, p= 0.005) were observed. Percutaneous nephrostomy is a safe and effective treatment option for urinary tract obstruction, especially in patients with malignancies. Continuous monitoring is essential to assess long-term complications and the longevity of PNS functionality. This procedure offers a significant benefit in preserving renal function and minimizing the need for hemodialysis in these patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38575377/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

Eleven staff urologists and 9 urology learners performed cystoscopy on a series of pig bladders containing mock papillary and flat lesions. Each provided three sets of size estimates: two using only the cystoscope to assess intraobserver agreement and the third with the aid of a ureteral catheter as a visual reference. Similar estimates were made with a flexible ureteroscope on papillary lesions within an inorganic upper urinary tract model. Differences in mean estimates and the agreement between repeated estimates were assessed. The level of endoscopic training did not influence the mean error of estimation (MEE) for either cystoscopy or ureteroscopy regardless of lesion size and appearance. Staff and learners consistently underestimated lesion size with median errors of 34% and 43%, with excellent (median intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.97) and fair (median ICC of 0.56) reproducibility for cystoscopy and ureteroscopy, respectively. Use of the visual reference during cystoscopy did not improve the MEE. Urologists, regardless of their level of training, substantially underestimate lesion size by 34% to 43%. These findings are independent of lesion size and appearance, and the use of a visual reference during cystoscopy.

We performed a literature review by searching the MEDLINE database for articles published between 1996 and 2011, limiting the searches to the words: urinary tract endometriosis, bladderendometriosis, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Deep pelvic endometriosis usually involves the urinary system, with the bladder being affected in 85% of cases. The diagnosis has to be considered as a step-by-step procedure. Currently, the treatment is usually surgical, consisting of either transurethral resection or partial cystectomy, and eventually associated with hormonal therapy. The hormonal therapy alone counteracts only the stimulus of endometriotic tissue proliferation, with no effects on the scarring caused by this tissue. The overall recurrence rate is about 30% for combined therapies and about 35% for the hormonal treatment alone. The bladder is the most common affected site in urinary tract endometriosis. Most of the time, this condition is diagnosed because of the complaint of urinary symptoms during gynecologic follow-up procedures for a deep pelvic endometriosis: a close collaboration between the gynecologist and the urologist is advisable, especially in highly specialized centers.

Slow drainage demonstrated at Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renography does not necessarily mean obstruction. Obstruction is defined as resistance to urinary outflow with urinary stasis at the level of the pelvic-ureteric junction (PUJ) which, if left untreated, will damage the kidney. Unfortunately this definition is retrospective and not clinically helpful. Therefore, the identification of the kidney at risk of losing function in an asymptomatic patient is a major research goal. In the context of renovascular hypertension a DMSA scan can be useful before and after revascularisation procedures (angioplasty or surgery) to assess for gain in kidney function. Renal calculi are increasingly frequent in children. Whilst the vast majority of patients with renal stones do not need functional imaging, DMSA scans with SPECT and a low dose limited CT can be very helpful in the case of complex renal calculi. Congenital renal anomalies such as duplex kidneys, horseshoe kidneys, crossed-fused kidneys and multi-cystic dysplastic kidneys greatly benefit from functional imaging to identify regional parenchymal function, thus directing further management. Positron emission tomography (PET) is being actively tested in genito-urinary malignancies. Encouraging initial reports suggest that F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is more sensitive than CT in the assessment of lymph nodal metastases in patients with genito-urinary sarcomas; an increased sensitivity in comparison to isotope bone scans for skeletal metastatic disease has also been reported. Further evaluation is necessary, especially with the promising advent of PET/MRI scanners.

Endourological Society members were e-mailed a web-based survey about their prior experience with contrast-related ADRs and practices for contrast administration into the urinary tract among patients with known intravenous contrast allergies. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare management patterns between patients with established allergies and those without. An estimated 2300-2500 e-mails were reached, resulting in an estimated response rate of 6.3%-8%. Over 75% of respondents were fellowship trained. Average time in practice was 16 years, and respondents performed a mean of 6.7 urologic contrast studies per week. Among respondents, 32.6%, 14.7%, and 4.0% had treated at least 1 patient with a mild, moderate, or severe reaction, respectively. Contrast-related ADRs were most commonly associated with retrograde pyelogram (50%). For patients with known contrast allergies, 5.4% pursue additional work-up before administering contrast in the urinary tract. Pretreatment with antihistamine or steroids is used by 24.8% and 23.4%, respectively. When performing retrograde pyelograms for such patients, urologists are more likely to use dilute contrast (P = .003), but otherwise do not significantly alter technique. Contrast ADRs are encountered not infrequently among practicing urologists.

Urotrauma is rarely immediately life-threatening but can lead to serious complications and chronic functional limitations during treatment. Therefore early urological involvement is crucial for adequate interdisciplinary treatment. The most important facts for the clinical routine on the consultant urological management of urogenital injuries in blunt abdominal trauma are discussed according to the European \"EAU guidelines on Urological Trauma\" and the German \"S3 guidelines on Polytrauma/Treatment of Severely Injured Patients\" as well as the relevant literature. Urinary tract injuries can occur even with an initially inconspicuous status and always require explicit exclusion diagnostics by means of contrast medium tomography of the entire urinary tract and, if necessary, by means of urographic and endoscopic examinations. The most common urological intervention is catheterization of the urinary tract which is often required. Less common is urological surgery, which should be coordinated interdisciplinarily with visceral and trauma surgery. More than 90% of vitally threatening kidney injuries (usually up to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grades 4-5) are now treated by interventional radiology.

When bacteria enter the bladder or kidney and multiply in the urine, a URI can occur. The urethra is shorter in women than in men, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause infection. A comparison of the research differences between Urology and Nephrology (UN) authors regarding UTI pertaining to the 4 areas (i.e., Chronic Kidney Disease, Hemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, and Renal Transplantation [CHPR]) is thus necessary. We propose and verify 2 hypotheses: CHPR-related articles on UTI have equal journal impact factors (JIFs) in research achievements (RAs) and UN authors have similar research features (RFs). Based on keywords associated with UTI and CHPR in titles, subject areas, and abstracts since 2013, we obtained 1284 abstracts and their associated metadata (e.g., citations, authors, research institutes, departments, countries of origin) from the Web of Science core collection. There were 1030 corresponding and first (co-first) authors with hT-JIF-indices (i.e., JIF was computed using hT-index rather than citations as usual). The following 5 visualizations were used to present the author's RA: radar, Sankey, time-to-event, impact beam plot, and choropleth map. The forest plot was used to distinguish RFs by observing the proportional counts of keyword plus in Web of Science core collection between UN authors. It was observed that CHPR-related articles had unequal JIFs (χ2 = 13.08, P = .004, df = 3, n = 1030) and UN departments had different RFs (Q = 53.24, df = 29, P = .004). In terms of countries, institutes, departments, and authors, the United States (hT-JIF = 38.30), Mayo Clinic (12.9), Nephrology (19.14), and Diana Karpman (10.34) from Sweden had the highest hT-JIF index. With the aid of visualizations, the hT-JIF-index and keyword plus were demonstrated to assess RAs and distinguish RFs between UN authors.

Appropriate education and training of all practicing urologists is therefore just as indispensable as documentation and archiving of image data.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35258657/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

Bibliometric analyses have been performed across a range of biomedical disciplines. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of Irish urology and nephrology research and to analyse how this compares internationally. We performed a retrospective bibliometric analysis of the top 20 ranking journals in the field of \"Urology and Nephrology\" based on their 5 years impact factor, as obtained from the ISI Journal Citation Report database over the 15-year study period, 2000-2015. Utilising the Pubmed database, a search phrase was constructed using country of affiliation, year of publication and journal title. The abstracts of the Irish publications identified were analysed for their institution of origin, article theme and content. A total of 67,740 article abstracts were analysed over the 15 years study period. As anticipated, the USA accounted for the largest number of publications by a country [28,206 (41.64 % of all articles)]. Ireland contributed 347 articles in total (0.51 % of all articles); however, ranking according to population per million was 13th worldwide. Ireland's contribution to urology and nephrology research was highest in the BJUI-British Journal of Urology International [76 articles (21.90 % of Irish total)]. We believe this study to be the largest bibliometric analysis in the field of urology and nephrology internationally.

The objective of this study was to describe the variability in opinion between subspecialists in the diagnosis of a UTI in CIC-dependent children. A scenario-based survey was distributed to physicians in the divisions of urology, nephrology, and hospital medicine at a single free-standing children's hospital. Respondents rated their degree of confidence on whether a specific scenario represented UTI or colonization on an 11-point Likert Scale. Median responses were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test with pair-wise comparisons. Back/flank pain, abdominal pain, and vomiting were the most common symptoms that were suggestive of a UTI in a non-febrile child. There was no single symptom chosen that was the most suggestive of a UTI in CIC-dependent child. There was significant variability between specialists in the diagnosis of UTI in specific clinical scenarios on the survey.

Research activities related to bladder physiology, neurophysiology and neuropharmacology have increased in the last 10 years. Primarily a purely basic scientific field, neurourology now commences to become a clinically highly significant and useful research domain. This article offers insight into the latest developments in the diagnostic techniques of this exciting field. One of these is smooth muscle EMG of the urinary bladder that aims at distinguishing between signal pattern changes and subsequent evaluation of the different functional and electrophysiological states of smooth muscle cells in various pathologies or in pharmacological tests during urodynamic investigation. A second innovative method in geriatric patients is the measurement of the sensory input to the brain due to bladder distention.

In two cases (both postoperative after previous pyeloplasty), absence of obstruction was demonstrated and nephrostomy tubes were subsequently closed. In one case, this resulted in hydronephrosis that had to be treated with a new JJ stent.

The disease spectrum includes developmental and cystic diseases, involvement by systemic diseases, iatrogenic complications, ascending infections and urinary tract obstruction, and neoplastic diseases. The diagnosis of kidney disease is unique involving 2 subspecialties, urologic pathology and renal pathology. Both renal and urologic pathologists employ the renal biopsy as a diagnostic modality. However, urologic pathologists commonly have a generous specimen in the form of a nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy while a renal pathologist requires ancillary modalities of immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The 2 subspecialties differ in the disease spectrum they diagnose. This separation is not absolute as diseases of one subspecialty not infrequently appear in the diagnostic materials of the other. The presence of medical renal diseases in a nephrectomy specimen is well described and recommendations for reporting these findings have been formalized. However, urologic diseases appearing in a medical renal biopsy have received less attention. This review attempts to fill that gap by first reviewing the perirenal anatomy to illustrate why inadvertent biopsy of adjacent organs occurs and determine its incidence in renal biopsies followed by a discussion of gross anatomic features relevant to the microscopic domain of the medical renal biopsy.

Certainly, with emergence of obesity epidemic, we started to see an increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and nephrolithiasis. Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have shown that the incident stone risk increases with body mass index (BMI), and no further increase in risk is noticed when the BMI > 30 kg/m(2). Furthermore, metabolic syndrome and diabetes are also associated with an increase in the incidence of renal stones disease. The shared links between these metabolic disorders are insulin resistance. Furthermore, insulin resistance is thought to alter renal acid-base metabolism, resulting in a lower urine pH and increased risk of uric acid stone disease. Obesity is also associated with excess nutritional intake of lithogenic substances such as refined sugars, low fluid intake, calcium, oxalate, and purine-rich foods. Obesity is also associated with an increase in incidence of urinary tract infection. Recent reports suggested that renal stone disease carries risk of myocardial infarction, progression of CKD, and diabetes. Alarmingly, orlistat (obesity medication) and bariatric surgery are associated with hyperoxaluria and associated stone formation and even oxalate nephropathy. Certainly, the many health risks of obesity, including nephrolithiasis, will add more burden on urologists and nephrologists.

In addition, selected anatomy textbooks from the 15th to 17th centuries were searched to identify and compare descriptions, illustrations, and various expressions used by contemporary authors to designate the upper and lower parts of the urinary tract. The Ancient Greek words \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" appear early in Hippocratic and Aristotelian writings. However, both terms designated what we today call the urethra. It was only with increasing anatomical knowledge in Greek medical texts after the 1st century AD that definitions of these words evolved similar to those we employ today. Numerous synonyms were used which served as a basis for translation into Arabic and later Latin during the transfer of ancient knowledge to the cultures of the medieval period. When Greek original texts and their Arabic-Latin version were compared during the Renaissance, this led to terminological confusion which could only be gradually overcome. Around the year 1600, the use of the latinized terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" became generally accepted. The dissemination of these terms in modern national languages and the emergence of clinical derivatives complete this historical development. The history of the terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" is exemplary of the difficulties with which the development of a precise urologic terminology had to struggle.

These findings led to the elaboration of methods of destroying bacteria in the urethra before operation, improving the disinfection of cystoscopes, and preventing the entry of bacteria via the indwelling catheter. Application of these methods reduced the incidence of infection after prostatectomy from 83% to 6%, and after emergency bladder drainage for acute retention of urine from 73% to 10%. A smaller improvement followed the introduction of closed bladder drainage after gynaecological operations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13850096/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

It is accompanied by processes involving rapid energy transformations. The energy associated with shock waves has been harnessed and used for various applications in medical science. High-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy is the most successful application of shock waves, and has been used to disintegrate urolithiasis for 30 years. At lower energy levels, however, shock waves have enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, chemoattractant factors and recruitment of progenitor cells; shock waves have also improved tissue regeneration. Low-energy shock wave therapy has been used clinically with musculoskeletal disorders, ischemic cardiovascular disorders and erectile dysfunction, through the mechanisms of neovascularization, anti-inflammation and tissue regeneration. Furthermore, low-energy shock waves have been proposed to temporarily increase tissue permeability and facilitate intravesical drug delivery. The present review article provides information on the basics of shock wave physics, mechanisms of action on the biological system and potential applications in functional urology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28697536/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

A comprehensive review of the English literature until February 2009 using the PubMed database returned 42 relevant papers. Five methods of endoscopic management of the distal ureter were identified and compared to the open technique. There are no randomised studies. Successful completion of the endoscopic procedure was less (91%) for the ureteric stripping technique than for the other endoscopic modalities (99.8-100%). Recurrences were highest for laparoscopic extravesical ureteric stapling in conjunction with cystoscopic detachment of the ureter, although the numbers analysed were small. For the other endoscopic modalities, bladder recurrence, positive margins and retroperitoneal recurrence (20-37, 0-4 and 1-3%, respectively) in case series were similar compared with the open method (36, 5 and 3%, respectively). Current non-randomised evidence is open to selection bias and is insufficient to support or refute endoscopic management of the distal ureter as an alternative to open bladder cuff excision.

In this article, we briefly trace the course of nephrology's history to show a clear arc in its evolution-of increasing resolution in nephrological data-an arc that is converging with computational capabilities to enable precision nephrology. In general, precision medicine refers to tailoring treatment to the individual characteristics of patients. For an operational definition, this tailoring takes the form of an optimization, in which treatments are selected to maximize a patient's expected health with respect to all available data. Because modern health data are large and high resolution, this optimization process requires computational intervention, and it must be tuned to the contours of specific medical disciplines. An advantage of this operational definition for precision medicine is that it allows us to better understand what precision medicine means in the context of a specific medical discipline. The goal of this article was to demonstrate how to instantiate this definition of precision medicine for the field of nephrology. Correspondingly, the goal of precision nephrology was to answer two related questions: ( 1 ) How do we optimize kidney health with respect to all available data? and ( 2 ) How do we optimize general health with respect to kidney data?", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36951457/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

Results already published in the last ten years based on characterisation techniques present in laboratories or specific to large-scale instruments are presented. Their usefulness for the clinician is discussed. The presence and role of heavy metals in urinary stones through data collected through μX-ray fluorescence is debated. If these data suggest a simple substitution process of calcium, recent data suggest that weddellite is associated to a Zn-rich environment, partly favoured by an inflammation process. Investigation on the chemistry and the structure of unusual deposits in kidney biopsies show a great chemical diversity of ectopic calcifications. Such diversity shows that staining procedures to characterize such deposits are obsolete. Finally, several diseases which can be assessed through techniques specific to large-scale instruments and defined by the clinician are presented.

The management of urethral trauma remains controversial and depends largely on the assessment of whether the posterior urethra is partially or completely ruptured. There remain two schools of thought concerning early or late intervention but all are agreed that suprapubic diversion is essential and that a urethral catheter should not be passed blindly in the initial stages.

Nephrological and urological articles originating from ML, TW, and HK that were published in 61 journals from 1999-2008 were retrieved from the PubMed database. We recorded the numbers of total articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, case reports, impact factors (IF), citations, and articles published in the leading general-medicine journals. We used these data to compare the quantity and quality of publication output from the three regions. The total number of articles increased significantly from 1999 to 2008 in the three regions. The number of articles from ML has exceeded that from HK since 2004, and surpassed that from TW in 2008. Publications from TW had the highest accumulated IF, total citations of articles, and the most articles published in leading general-medicine journals. However, HK publications had the highest average IF. Although ML produced the largest quantity of articles, it exhibited the lowest quality among the three regions.

Under the Urology and Nephrology category in the Journal Citations Report Website, the top 17 Journals by JIF in 2011 were chosen for the study. All manuscripts' abstracts published from 2009-2010 were reviewed; each article was categorized based on its research design (Retrospective, Review, etc). T and correlation tests were performed for categorical and continuous variables respectively. The JIF was the dependent variable. All variables were then included in a multivariate model. 23,012 articles from seventeen journals were evaluated with a median of 1,048 (range=78-6,342) articles per journal. Journals with a society affiliation were associated with a higher JIF (p=0.05). Self-citations (rho=0.57, p=0.02), citations for citable articles (rho=0.73,p=0.001), citations to non-citable articles (rho=0.65,p=0.0046), and retrospective studies (rho=-0.51,p=0.03) showed a strong correlation. Slight modifications to include the non-citable articles in the denominator yield drastic changes in the JIF and the ranking of the journals.

It affects as many as 2-4 in 1000 live births, however there are no epidemiological studies available from India. Anatomical and neurogenic abnormalities of the urinary tract are known to occur in these patients. Scanty literature is available regarding the utility of radionuclide procedures in the evaluation of urinary tract in patients of MMC. The aim of this study was to evaluate urinary tract dysfunction and malformations in patients operated of MMC by diuretic renal dynamic scintigraphy (RDS) and direct radionuclide cystography (DRCG). In this retrospective analysis, 140 operated patients for MMC, mean age: 4.46, range: 1-18 years; 83 male and 57 female, referred to our department for evaluation of the upper renal tract, were studied. Neurogenic bladder (NB) was associated in 69 patients. The diagnosis of NB was based on clinical features like incontinence, expressibility of urine bladder and on urodynamic studies. RDS was performed after the intravenous administration of 10.36 MBq/kg of technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetate or 99mTc-L, L-ethylenedicysteine. All patients with hydronephrosis (HDN) or hydroureteronephrosis (HDUN) on RDS underwent DRCG using 11.1-18.5 MBq of 99mTc-sulphur colloid. Our results showed that: out of the 140 patients, 78 (56%) including 33 with NB, had normal renal scintigraphy. Six patients (4%) had congenital renal anomalies. Twenty patients (14%) revealed non-obstructive HDN and had no vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). Thirty-six patients (26%) with bilateral HDUN also had NB of which 19 (53%) had VUR. Fourteen (74%) of these patients with VUR had impaired renal function. In discussion, patients with MMC may present with disordered innervation of the detrussor muscle and external sphincter, which adversely affects the bladder function and potentially threatens the upper urinary tract. Patients of MMC with or without NB can be evaluated with RDS for congenital anomalies and initial assessment of renal function. Patients with NB and particularly those with HDUN can be evaluated with DRCG for the presence of VUR to prevent renal scarring and subsequent impairment of renal function. Long-term surveillance of the urinary tract is important in the management of these patients and this can be accomplished with RDS and DRCG. In conclusion, in our patients with MMC, the tests of RDS, and DRCG could differentiate those with normal or our abnormal renal anatomy and function while the major group of patients had bilateral HDUN and NB, and/or VUR or impaired renal function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17684585/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

We investigated the risk factors (RF) for delayed graft function (DGF) and patient and graft survival (SV). We analyzed retrospectively the characteristics and evolution of 1500 KT performed by INU until December 2014. The incidence of DGF and RF for patient and graft SV were analyzed in 4 eras, according to the year that KT was performed. The number of KT per year has progressively increased until reaching 40 KT per million population in 2006, with a decrease of the living donor KT (LDKT) rate. The age of the donors (D) and recipients (R) as well as the time on dialysis (TOD) have progressively increased over the different eras. Five hundred twenty-five R (35%) presented with DGF. The RF for DGF were the age of the R and the D, the TOD, the DDKT, and the warm ischemia time (WIT). In the DDKT group, the cold ischemia time and \"died of stroke\" were added factors. The death-censored graft SV at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 90%, 76%, 62%, and 49%, respectively. They improved as from era I, the patient SV being 92%, 83%, and 75% at 1, 5, and 10 years, in era I; 98%, 93%, and 86% in era II; 98%, 92%, and 83% in era III; and 95% and 90% at 1 and 5 years in era IV (P < .001). The graft SV over the same periods was 76%, 58%, and 40% in era I; 88%, 68%, and 52% in era II; 93%, 81%, and 70% in era III; and 93% and 85% at 1 and 5 years in era IV (P < .0001). The RF for patient SV were diabetes mellitus, era I, lower albuminemia, older age or TOD, and DGF. For kidney SV, the era, the age of the R, TOD, DGF, and D older than 60 years were RF associated with a worse evolution. In DDKT, the RF for the graft SV were the era, younger age of the R, and DGF. The group with the worst graft SV was the one made up of children and adolescents. Our results relating to patient and graft SV are acceptable and comparable to those mentioned on large records such as the OPNT/SRTR and the Collaborative Transplant Study. This has been the case, even though we have transplanted increasingly aged patients, with increasingly aged donors, or donors with associated pathology. The risk factors that we found both for DGF and SV have also been pointed out by other authors. The validity of some findings has the limitation of being from a retrospective analysis; hence, they should be corroborated by a prospective study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27110015/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

We recorded 486 cuff inflation cycles during 142 voids from 42 subjects recruited from urology out-patient's and prostate assessment clinics. Each inflation cycle was assessed independently by three experienced observers, a total of 1,458 ratings. According to our standard assessment procedure, the observers (i) indicated whether the inflation should be analyzed, (ii) estimated p(cuff,int) for those inflation cycles judged suitable for analysis, and (iii) discarded measurements that were clearly inconsistent with others from the same voiding cycle. Overall, 689 of the 1,458 ratings (45%) were excluded, with just 4% of all ratings discarded for inconsistency. For 385 of the 486 inflation cycles (79%) there was complete agreement that the cycle should or should not be analyzed. Thereafter, for the 262 inflation cycles analyzed by two or three observers, the overall SD error in measurements of p(cuff,int) was 4.6 cm H(2)O.

Summarized confidential responses were stratified by specialty, AHN grade, and laterality. A total of 88 of 139 responses were received (response rate, 63.3%; 95% confidence interval, 55.0%-71.0%): 46 nephrologists, 39 urologists, and 3 undisclosed. Only 17 of 88 (19.32%; 95% confidence interval, 12.4%-28.8%) reported following standardized AHN protocols. Concern surrounding the development of urinary tract infections was the main deciding factor for prescribing CAP (nephrology, 65.4%; urology, 71.4%). Almost a third of nephrologists (29.6%) recommend CAP for bilateral low-grade AHN compared with 11.4% of urologists (P = .02); in contrast, 73% of nephrologists and 38.2% of urologists (P = .02) offer CAP in the presence of isolated high-grade AHN. In regards to indications for voiding cystourethrogram, 31% of pediatric nephrologists would recommend this test for patients with unilateral low-grade AHN compared with 7.7% of urologists (P < .01), although almost all nephrologists (96.6%) and 69.2% of urologists (P = .02) would obtain this test for patients with unilateral high-grade isolated AHN. Our results show important practice variability between pediatric nephrologists and urologists in the management of children with AHN, which are partially explained by laterality and degree of dilation.

Alternatively to transit time measurement, simpler indices were proposed, such as time of maximum, normalized residual activity or renal output efficiency. Transit time has been mainly used in urinary obstruction, renal artery stenosis, or renovascular hypertension and renal transplant. Despite a large amount of published data on obstruction, only the value of normal transit is established. The value of delayed transit remains controversial, probably due to lack of a gold standard for obstruction.

However, Japan's contribution to urology and nephrology is not known. Seven journals in this field with the highest impact factors were selected to obtain relevant data. In June 2002, we searched the Medline database to obtain country affiliation details of articles published in the selected journals during 1991-2000. The proportion of articles with a higher grade of evidence (randomized controlled trials or clinical trials, cohort studies and case-control studies) were also generated and compared to the average values for all articles published in these journals. Of the total number of articles (22 232), Japan's share of research output for the selected journals in urology and nephrology was 6% (1335 articles) and it ranked second in the world following the USA (56.5%). The recent increase in the share was statistically significant for Japan, Austria, France, Germany, Spain and Turkey. The proportion of articles with a high grade of evidence was lower for articles originated in Japan than for the total number of articles. Japan's contribution to urology and nephrology research is within the range of its contribution to other biomedical fields.

We have analyzed the contents of chapters devoted to nephrology in that book of Prospero Alpini and the novelties of his message. Prospero Alpini (1563-1616) taught at the University of Padua (1594-1616), at the same time of Galileo Galilei, Santorio Santorio, and Girolamo Fabrizi dAcquapendente, when measurements (pulse, temperature, perspiration) were introduced into medicine. He was a travelling physician to whom we owe fundamental contributions to the use of urine to prognosticate life and death (De Praesagienda vita et morte aegrotantium libri septem, Venetiis, apud Haeredes Melchioris Sessae,1601). As prefect of the Botanical Garden - the first ever and a model in the world - he could turn the study of simples into cures(De Medicina Methodica Libri Tredecim. Patavi, apud Franciscum Bolzettam, 1611. Ex typographia Laurentij Pasquali, is anin foliovolume of XLVII + 424 pages, 54 lines per page), wherein Alpini aimed to rejuvenate antique medical Methodism. It is a testimony of the interest of medicine philosophers of the modern era for the corpuscular and atomic ideas (Nancy Siraisi). Methodists (2ndCentury BC) refused anatomy and physiology as unique guidelines to the interpretations of diseases and gave importance to the development of a pharmacological science and alternative medicine. The book begins with a 3 page letter to Francis Maria della Rovere Duke of Montefeltro, and a 2 page letter to the readers. We discuss the novelties of the chapters on renal colic (de dolorerenum), hematuria (de sanguinis profluvium), pyuria, anuria (de urina suppressa) and its cure, polyuria (de urina profluvio), renal abscesses, hydrops and its treatment by skin incisions. We also analyze the chapter on kidney and bladder stones (Book X, Chapter XVIII, pp. 354-356) - a masterpiece of scholarly teaching - encompassing localization of stones, their formation and shape, renal colic and its irradiation according to the site and gender, the best antalgic position to pass stones, the use of laxatives, cathartics, warm baths, the plants to be used, their preparation and quality, the waters to be drank and their quantity (up to 15 pounds a day), the removal of bladder stones without surgery (methods learned in Cairo and described in Aegyptyan Medicine), and lithotomy and its feasibility even in old people. De Medicina Methodicawas a modern monograph devoted to clinical medicine including urinary disease. The book reflected the polyhedral personality of the author, his experience as physician of the Republic of Venice at Cairo, and his capabilities as a director of the Botanical Garden of the University of Padua, a unique research centre in those times.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913897/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}

We prospectively collected data on a total of 270 patients (540 kidneys) who underwent CT-urography. We then constructed three-dimensional images of the renal pelvis and examined their morphologic classification. Forty-eight kidneys were excluded from this study because of severe hydronephrosis or large renal cysts. The remaining 492 kidneys were included. We systematically categorized each minor calix into five levels: top, upper, middle, lower, and bottom. The upper, middle, and lower calices were typically found in pairs: anterior and posterior. The most common total number of minor calices was eight (51%), followed by seven (30%). We also classified the form of the pelvis into type I: single pelvis (58%) and type II: divided pelvis (42%), according to the branch patterns of the renal pelvis. In type II, the renal pelvis is always bifurcated into the upper branch (top and upper) and lower branch (middle, lower, and bottom). Type I was subclassified into three types: type Ia (43%), the standard type; type Ib (4%), with a wide pelvis; and type Ic (11%), with a narrow pelvis. This anatomical classification can divide the renal pelvis into two major types (subdivided into four types) and name each minor calix. This simple classification enables to share common intrarenal information, thus leading to the development of concrete treatment strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29845879/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}
{"id": "31900706", "title": "Imaging protocols for renal multiparametric MRI and MR urography: results of a consensus conference from the French Society of Genitourinary Imaging.", "text": "To develop technical guidelines for magnetic resonance imaging aimed at characterising renal masses (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, mpMRI) and at imaging the bladder and upper urinary tract (magnetic resonance urography, MRU). The French Society of Genitourinary Imaging organised a Delphi consensus conference with a two-round Delphi survey followed by a face-to-face meeting. Two separate questionnaires were issued for renal mpMRI and for MRU. Consensus was strictly defined using a priori criteria. Forty-two expert uroradiologists completed both survey rounds with no attrition between the rounds. Fifty-six of 84 (67%) statements of the mpMRI questionnaire and 44/71 (62%) statements of the MRU questionnaire reached final consensus. For mpMRI, there was consensus that no injection of furosemide was needed and that the imaging protocol should include T2-weighted imaging, dual chemical shift imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value, 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and fat-saturated single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic) contrast-enhanced imaging; late imaging (more than 10 min after injection) was judged optional. For MRU, the patients should void their bladder before the examination. The protocol must include T2-weighted imaging, anatomical fast T1/T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value, 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and fat-saturated single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, excretory) contrast-enhanced imaging. An intravenous injection of furosemide is mandatory before the injection of contrast medium. Heavily T2-weighted cholangiopancreatography-like imaging was judged optional. This expert-based consensus conference provides recommendations to standardise magnetic resonance imaging of kidneys, ureter and bladder. • Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) aims at characterising renal masses; magnetic resonance urography (MRU) aims at imaging the urinary bladder and the collecting systems. • For mpMRI, no injection of furosemide is needed. • For MRU, an intravenous injection of furosemide is mandatory before the injection of contrast medium; heavily T2-weighted cholangiopancreatography-like imaging is optional.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31900706/", "source_file": "pubmed_urology.jsonl"}
