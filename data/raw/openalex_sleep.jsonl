Evidence from methodologically strong cohort studies indicates that undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, with or without symptoms, is independently associated with increased likelihood of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and diminished quality of life. Strategies to decrease the high prevalence and associated morbidity of obstructive sleep apnea are critically needed. The reduction or elimination of risk factors through public health initiatives with clinical support holds promise. Potentially modifiable risk factors considered in this review include overweight and obesity, alcohol, smoking, nasal congestion, and estrogen depletion in menopause. Data suggest that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with all these factors, but at present the only intervention strategy supported with adequate evidence is weight loss. A focus on weight control is especially important given the expanding epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States. Primary care providers will be central to clinical approaches for addressing the burden and the development of cost-effective case-finding strategies and feasible treatment for mild obstructive sleep apnea warrants high priority.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.2109080", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124052130", "source": "openalex"}

The goals of the task force were (1) to clarify and simplify the current scoring rules, (2) to review evidence for new monitoring technologies relevant to the scoring rules, and (3) to strive for greater concordance between adult and pediatric rules. The task force reviewed the evidence cited by the AASM systematic review of the reliability and validity of scoring respiratory events published in 2007 and relevant studies that have appeared in the literature since that publication. Given the limitations of the published evidence, a consensus process was used to formulate the majority of the task force recommendations concerning revisions.The task force made recommendations concerning recommended and alternative sensors for the detection of apnea and hypopnea to be used during diagnostic and positive airway pressure (PAP) titration polysomnography. An alternative sensor is used if the recommended sensor fails or the signal is inaccurate. The PAP device flow signal is the recommended sensor for the detection of apnea, hypopnea, and respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) during PAP titration studies. Appropriate filter settings for recording (display) of the nasal pressure signal to facilitate visualization of inspiratory flattening are also specified. The respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals to be used as alternative sensors for apnea and hypopnea detection are specified. The task force reached consensus on use of the same sensors for adult and pediatric patients except for the following: (1) the end-tidal PCO(2) signal can be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection in children only, and (2) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) belts can be used to monitor respiratory effort (thoracoabdominal belts) and as an alternative sensor for detection of apnea and hypopnea (PVDFsum) only in adults.The task force recommends the following changes to the 2007 respiratory scoring rules. Apnea in adults is scored when there is a drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative apnea sensor, for ≥ 10 seconds. Hypopnea in adults is scored when the peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for ≥ 10 seconds in association with either ≥ 3% arterial oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Scoring a hypopnea as either obstructive or central is now listed as optional, and the recommended scoring rules are presented. In children an apnea is scored when peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor; and the event meets duration and respiratory effort criteria for an obstructive, mixed, or central apnea. A central apnea is scored in children when the event meets criteria for an apnea, there is an absence of inspiratory effort throughout the event, and at least one of the following is met: (1) the event is ≥ 20 seconds in duration, (2) the event is associated with an arousal or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation, (3) (infants under 1 year of age only) the event is associated with a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute for at least 5 seconds or less than 60 beats per minute for 15 seconds. A hypopnea is scored in children when the peak signal excursions drop is ≥ 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for ≥ the duration of 2 breaths in association with either ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal. In children and adults, surrogates of the arterial PCO(2) are the end-tidal PCO(2) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (diagnostic study) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (titration study). For adults, sleep hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 55 mm Hg for ≥ 10 minutes or there is an increase in the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) ≥ 10 mm Hg (in comparison to an awake supine value) to a value exceeding 50 mm Hg for ≥ 10 minutes. For pediatric patients hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 50 mm Hg for > 25% of total sleep time. In adults Cheyne-Stokes breathing is scored when both of the following are met: (1) there are episodes of ≥ 3 consecutive central apneas and/or central hypopneas separated by a crescendo and decrescendo change in breathing amplitude with a cycle length of at least 40 seconds (typically 45 to 90 seconds), and (2) there are five or more central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour associated with the crescendo/decrescendo breathing pattern recorded over a minimum of 2 hours of monitoring.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.2172", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1545241942", "source": "openalex"}

Participants were invited for repeat studies at 4-year intervals. The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was modeled as a function of age, sex, and body mass index, and estimates were extrapolated to US body mass index distributions estimated using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The current prevalence estimates of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index, measured as events/hour, ≥15) are 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7, 12) among 30-49-year-old men; 17% (95% CI: 15, 21) among 50-70-year-old men; 3% (95% CI: 2, 4) among 30-49-year-old women; and 9% (95% CI: 7, 11) among 50-70 year-old women.

Cognitive functions particularly affected by sleep loss include psychomotor and cognitive speed, vigilant and executive attention, working memory, and higher cognitive abilities. Chronic sleep-restriction experiments—which model the kind of sleep loss experienced by many individuals with sleep fragmentation and premature sleep curtailment due to disorders and lifestyle—demonstrate that cognitive deficits accumulate to severe levels over time without full awareness by the affected individual. Functional neuroimaging has revealed that frequent and progressively longer cognitive lapses, which are a hallmark of sleep deprivation, involve distributed changes in brain regions including frontal and parietal control areas, secondary sensory processing areas, and thalamic areas. There are robust differences among individuals in the degree of their cognitive vulnerability to sleep loss that may involve differences in prefrontal and parietal cortices, and that may have a basis in genes regulating sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythms. Thus, cognitive deficits believed to be a function of the severity of clinical sleep disturbance may be a product of genetic alleles associated with differential cognitive vulnerability to sleep loss.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0029-1237117", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159662907", "source": "openalex"}

Measurements: Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). Results: Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI. For example, being in the high-risk group predicted an RDI greater than 5 with a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.77, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a likelihood ratio of 3.79.

Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/26.3.342", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1277966809", "source": "openalex"}

In the presence of an anatomically compromised, collapsible airway, the sleep-induced loss of compensatory tonic input to the upper airway dilator muscle motor neurons leads to collapse of the pharyngeal airway. In turn, the ability of the sleeping subject to compensate for this airway obstruction will determine the degree of cycling of these events. Several of the classic neurotransmitters and a growing list of neuromodulators have now been identified that contribute to neurochemical regulation of pharyngeal motor neuron activity and airway patency. Limited progress has been made in developing pharmacotherapies with acceptable specificity for the treatment of sleep-induced airway obstruction. We review three types of major long-term sequelae to severe OSA that have been assessed in humans through use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment and in animal models via long-term intermittent hypoxemia (IH): 1) cardiovascular. The evidence is strongest to support daytime systemic hypertension as a consequence of severe OSA, with less conclusive effects on pulmonary hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. The underlying mechanisms mediating hypertension include enhanced chemoreceptor sensitivity causing excessive daytime sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, combined with overproduction of superoxide ion and inflammatory effects on resistance vessels. 2) Insulin sensitivity and homeostasis of glucose regulation are negatively impacted by both intermittent hypoxemia and sleep disruption, but whether these influences of OSA are sufficient, independent of obesity, to contribute significantly to the “metabolic syndrome” remains unsettled. 3) Neurocognitive effects include daytime sleepiness and impaired memory and concentration. These effects reflect hypoxic-induced “neural injury.” We discuss future research into understanding the pathophysiology of sleep apnea as a basis for uncovering newer forms of treatment of both the ventilatory disorder and its multiple sequelae.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00043.2008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042592767", "source": "openalex"}

Its effect on nocturnal sleep quality and ensuing daytime fatigue and sleepiness are widely acknowledged. Increasingly, obstructive sleep apnea is also being recognized as an independent risk factor for several clinical consequences, including systemic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and abnormal glucose metabolism. Estimates of disease prevalence are in the range of 3% to 7%, with certain subgroups of the population bearing higher risk. Factors that increase vulnerability for the disorder include age, male sex, obesity, family history, menopause, craniofacial abnormalities, and certain health behaviors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Despite the numerous advancements in our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of the disorder, a majority of those affected remain undiagnosed. Simple queries of the patient or bed-partner for the symptoms and signs of the disorder, namely, loud snoring, observed apneas, and daytime sleepiness, would help identify those in need of further diagnostic evaluation.

Eight men lived in an environment free of time cues for 33-36 d and were scheduled to a 28 hr rest-activity cycle so that sleep episodes (9.33 hr each) occurred at all phases of the endogenous circadian cycle and variations in wakefulness preceding sleep were minimized. The crest of the robust circadian rhythm of REM sleep, which was observed throughout the sleep episode, was positioned shortly after the minimum of the core body temperature rhythm. Furthermore, a sleep-dependent increase of REM sleep was present, which, interacting with the circadian modulation, resulted in highest values of REM sleep when the end of scheduled sleep episodes coincided with habitual wake-time. Slow-wave activity decreased and sleep spindle activity increased in the course of all sleep episodes. Slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep exhibited a low amplitude circadian modulation which did not parallel the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. Sleep spindle activity showed a marked endogenous circadian rhythm; its crest coincident with the beginning of the habitual sleep episode. Analyses of the (nonadditive) interaction of the circadian and sleep-dependent components of sleep propensity and sleep structure revealed that the phase relation between the sleep-wake cycle and the circadian pacemaker during entrainment promotes the consolidation of sleep and wakefulness and facilitates the transitions between these vigilance states.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.15-05-03526.1995", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1537142000", "source": "openalex"}

A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as \"good practice statements\", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation.Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA.

Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput. Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnet.2004.828953", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159013099", "source": "openalex"}

An association between short habitual sleep time and increased body mass index (BMI) has been reported in large population samples. The potential role of metabolic hormones in this association is unknown. Methods and Findings Study participants were 1,024 volunteers from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, a population-based longitudinal study of sleep disorders. Participants underwent nocturnal polysomnography and reported on their sleep habits through questionnaires and sleep diaries. Following polysomnography, morning, fasted blood samples were evaluated for serum leptin and ghrelin (two key opposing hormones in appetite regulation), adiponectin, insulin, glucose, and lipid profile. Relationships among these measures, BMI, and sleep duration (habitual and immediately prior to blood sampling) were examined using multiple variable regressions with control for confounding factors. A U-shaped curvilinear association between sleep duration and BMI was observed. In persons sleeping less than 8 h (74.4% of the sample), increased BMI was proportional to decreased sleep. Short sleep was associated with low leptin (p for slope = 0.01), with a predicted 15.5% lower leptin for habitual sleep of 5 h versus 8 h, and high ghrelin (p for slope = 0.008), with a predicted 14.9% higher ghrelin for nocturnal (polysomnographic) sleep of 5 h versus 8 h, independent of BMI. Conclusion Participants with short sleep had reduced leptin and elevated ghrelin.

Microsleeps, sleep attacks, and lapses in cognition increase with sleep loss as a function of state instability. Sleep deprivation studies repeatedly show a variable (negative) impact on mood, cognitive performance, and motor function due to an increasing sleep propensity and destabilization of the wake state. Specific neurocognitive domains including executive attention, working memory, and divergent higher cognitive functions are particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. In humans, functional metabolic and neurophysiological studies demonstrate that neural systems involved in executive function (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are more susceptible to sleep deprivation in some individuals than others. Recent chronic partial sleep deprivation experiments, which more closely replicate sleep loss in society, demonstrate that profound neurocognitive deficits accumulate over time in the face of subjective adaptation to the sensation of sleepiness. Sleep deprivation associated with disease-related sleep fragmentation (i.e., sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome) also results in neurocognitive performance decrements similar to those seen in sleep restriction studies. Performance deficits associated with sleep disorders are often viewed as a simple function of disease severity; however, recent experiments suggest that individual vulnerability to sleep loss may play a more critical role than previously thought.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2005-867080", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4235765131", "source": "openalex"}

Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00032.2011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2000693195", "source": "openalex"}

This practice guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS, that is, OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting. METHODS: Of 3166 articles from 1999–2010, 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II–IV. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The following recommendations are made. (1) All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. (2) Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. (3) Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (4) High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. (5) Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. (6) Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. (7) Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. (8) Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-1671", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2106512780", "source": "openalex"}

When necessary, authors were contacted. Criteria for inclusion were: report of duration of sleep as exposure, BMI as continuous outcome and prevalence of obesity as categorical outcome, number of participants, age, and gender. Results were pooled using a random effect model. Sensitivity analysis was performed, heterogeneity and publication bias were also checked. Results are expressed as pooled odds ratios (OR [95% confidence intervals, CIs]) and as pooled regression coefficients (β 95% CIs). Of 696 studies identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria (19 in children and 26 in adults) and 30 (12 and 18, respectively) were pooled in the meta-analysis for a total of 36 population samples. They included 634,511 participants (30,002 children and 604,509 adults) from around the world. Age ranged from 2 to 102 years and included boys, girls, men and women. In children the pooled OR for short duration of sleep and obesity was 1.89 (1.46 to 2.43; P < 0.0001). In adults the pooled OR was 1.55 (1.43 to 1.68; P < 0.0001). There was no evidence of publication bias. In adults, the pooled β for short sleep duration was −0.35 (−0.57 to −0.12) unit change in BMI per hour of sleep change.

The extent to which self reports of sleep duration are similar to objective measures and whether individual characteristics influence the degree of similarity are not known. Methods: Eligible participants at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study were invited to participate in a 2003–2005 ancillary sleep study; 82% (n = 669) agreed. Sleep measurements collected in 2 waves included 3 days each of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and questions about usual sleep duration. We estimate the average difference and correlation between subjectively and objectively measured sleep by using errors-in-variables regression models. Results: Average measured sleep was 6 hours, whereas the average from subjective reports was 6.8 hours. Subjective reports increased on average by 34 minutes for each additional hour of measured sleep. Overall, the correlation between reported and measured sleep duration was 0.47. Our model suggests that persons sleeping 5 hours over-reported their sleep duration by 1.2 hours, and those sleeping 7 hours over-reported by 0.4 hours. The correlations and average differences between self-reports and measured sleep varied by health, sociodemographic, and sleep characteristics.

Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.20.1.185", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137303544", "source": "openalex"}

This paper reviews recent research on the effects of chronic sleep restriction on neurobehavioral and physiological functioning and discusses implications for health and lifestyle. Restricting sleep below an individual's optimal time in bed (TIB) can cause a range of neurobehavioral deficits, including lapses of attention, slowed working memory, reduced cognitive throughput, depressed mood, and perseveration of thought. Neurobehavioral deficits accumulate across days of partial sleep loss to levels equivalent to those found after 1 to 3 nights of total sleep loss. Recent experiments reveal that following days of chronic restriction of sleep duration below 7 hours per night, significant daytime cognitive dysfunction accumulates to levels comparable to that found after severe acute total sleep deprivation. Additionally, individual variability in neurobehavioral responses to sleep restriction appears to be stable, suggesting a trait-like (possibly genetic) differential vulnerability or compensatory changes in the neurobiological systems involved in cognition. A causal role for reduced sleep duration in adverse health outcomes remains unclear, but laboratory studies of healthy adults subjected to sleep restriction have found adverse effects on endocrine functions, metabolic and inflammatory responses, suggesting that sleep restriction produces physiological consequences that may be unhealthy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.26918", "url": "https://openalex.org/W84689042", "source": "openalex"}

Sixty‐six normal volunteers spent either 3 ( n = 18), 5 ( n = 16), 7 ( n = 16), or 9 h ( n = 16) daily time in bed (TIB) for 7 days (restriction/augmentation) followed by 3 days with 8 h daily TIB (recovery). In the 3‐h group, speed (mean and fastest 10% of responses) on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) declined, and PVT lapses (reaction times greater than 500 ms) increased steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction. In the 7‐ and 5‐h groups speed initially declined, then appeared to stabilize at a reduced level; lapses were increased only in the 5‐h group. In the 9‐h group, speed and lapses remained at baseline levels. During recovery, PVT speed in the 7‐ and 5‐h groups (and lapses in the 5‐h group) remained at the stable, but reduced levels seen during the last days of the experimental phase, with no evidence of recovery. Speed and lapses in the 3‐h group recovered rapidly following the first night of recovery sleep; however, recovery was incomplete with speed and lapses stabilizing at a level comparable with the 7‐ and 5‐h groups. Performance in the 9‐h group remained at baseline levels during the recovery phase. These results suggest that the brain adapts to chronic sleep restriction. In mild to moderate sleep restriction this adaptation is sufficient to stabilize performance, although at a reduced level. These adaptive changes are hypothesized to restrict brain operational capacity and to persist for several days after normal sleep duration is restored, delaying recovery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2003.00337.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094761105", "source": "openalex"}

Priority was given to large prospective cohort studies and to randomized controlled trials.We identified 154 original investigations and reviews of sleep-related breathing disorders. Data from these studies were examined for relevance and extracted by one of the authors.Approximately 1 in 5 adults has at least mild OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [ie, the number of apneic and hypopneic events per hour], 5-15), and 1 in 15 adults has at least moderate OSA (apnea-hypopnea index, 15-30). Repetitive apneic events disrupt the normal physiologic interactions between sleep and the cardiovascular system. Such sleep fragmentation, as well as abnormalities evident in patients with OSA (eg, increased sympathetic activation, vascular endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, inflammation, increased platelet aggregability, metabolic dysregulation), may be implicated in the initiation and progression of cardiac and vascular disease. Persuasive data implicate OSA in the development of hypertension, and OSA also may contribute to cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps also to cerebrovascular disease and stroke.Obstructive sleep apnea is common, readily diagnosed, and usually treatable. It frequently coexists undiagnosed in patients with cardiovascular disease, activates disease mechanisms known to elicit cardiac and vascular damage, and may be implicated in progression of cardiovascular disease and resistance to conventional therapeutic strategies. In the absence of definitive evidence from large-scale trials and a better understanding of potential cost-effectiveness, the likely benefits of diagnosis and treatment of OSA are presently best appraised on an individualized patient basis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.290.14.1906", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009948616", "source": "openalex"}

When polysomnography is not available, actigraphy is indicated to estimate total sleep time in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In patients with insomnia and hypersomnia, there is evidence to support the use of actigraphy in the characterization of circadian rhythms and sleep patterns/disturbances. In assessing response to therapy, actigraphy has proven useful as an outcome measure in patients with circadian rhythm disorders and insomnia. In older adults (including older nursing home residents), in whom traditional sleep monitoring can be difficult, actigraphy is indicated for characterizing sleep and circadian patterns and to document treatment responses. Similarly, in normal infants and children, as well as special pediatric populations, actigraphy has proven useful for delineating sleep patterns and documenting treatment responses. Recent research utilizing actigraphy in the assessment and management of sleep disorders has allowed the development of evidence-based recommendations for the use of actigraphy in the clinical setting.

The cumulative long-term effects of sleep deprivation and sleep disorders have been associated with a wide range of deleterious health consequences including an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, depression, heart attack, and stroke. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Sleep Medicine and Research concluded that although clinical activities and scientific opportunities in the field are expanding, awareness among the general public and health care professionals is low, given the magnitude of the burden. The available human resources and capacity are insufficient to further develop the science and to diagnose and treat individuals with sleep disorders. Therefore, the current situation necessitates a larger and more interdisciplinary workforce. Traditional scientific and medical disciplines need to be attracted into the somnology and sleep medicine field. Renewed and revitalized commitments to the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), academic health centers, private foundations, and professional societies are essential to ensure appropriate public and professional awareness, education and training, basic and clinical research, and patient care.

It has been estimated that 90% of patients with depression complain about sleep quality. Since the first reports of short rapid eye movement (REM) latency in depressed patients and of the effect of sleep deprivation on depression in the 1970s, numerous sleep studies have provided extensive observations and theoretical hypotheses concerning the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this review is to summarize knowledge regarding the relationships between sleep and depression. Data Sources and Selection: MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches of the literature published in English or French between 1964 and 2005 that examined the relationships between sleep disturbance and depression were conducted. Search terms used were depression, depressive disorder, affective disorder, mood disorders, seasonal affective disorder, sleep, sleep disorders, insomnia, REM, polysomnography, sleep deprivation, electroencephalography, PET, SPECT, and fMRI. Data Synthesis: Two hundred five papers were identified and selected and then integrated into the following categories: sleep architecture, antidepressive therapies, age- and gender-associated differences, functional imaging results, and sleep-related hypotheses explaining the pathophysiology of depression. Conclusion: Numerous studies provide findings indicating the remarkable relationship between sleep alterations and depression. Although the existing hypotheses are not likely to explain all aspects of the sleep alterations in depression, each may be worth being maintained for refinements of pathophysiologic models of depression as new data accumulate. Further research taking into account the heterogeneity of depressive disorder and linking the different areas of research is needed to develop more comprehensive theoretical models and new therapies for depression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v66n1008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134977136", "source": "openalex"}

The scale was distributed to the mothers of 1304 children (1157 controls, mean age 9.8y; 147 sleep disorder subjects, mean age 9.2y, composed of four clinical groups: Insomnia 39 subjects, Hypersomnia 12 subjects, Respiratory disturbances during sleep 25 subjects and Parasomnias 71 subjects). The internal consistency was high in controls (0.79) and remained at a satisfactory level in sleep disorder subjects (0.71); the test/retest reliability was adequate for the total (r = 0.71) and single item scores. The factor analysis (variance explained 44.21%) yielded six factors which represented the most common areas of sleep disorders in childhood and adolescence. Enuresis was the only item with a factor loading lower than 0.40 and with a low inter‐item correlation and was therefore eliminated, resulting in a final scale of 26 items. The re‐evaluation of the sample, using the factor scores, supported the validity and the discriminating capacity of the scales between controls and the four clinical groups. The correlation between factor scores corroborated the hypothesis that childhood sleep disturbances are not independent entities nor do they cluster into different groupings related to each other. The SDSC appears to be a useful tool in evaluating the sleep disturbances of school‐age children in clinical and non‐clinical populations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1996.00251.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964895339", "source": "openalex"}

Why is this so? To investigate whether changes in cortical information transmission play a role, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography and asked how the activation of one cortical area (the premotor area) is transmitted to the rest of the brain. During quiet wakefulness, an initial response (∼15 milliseconds) at the stimulation site was followed by a sequence of waves that moved to connected cortical areas several centimeters away. During non–rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response was stronger but was rapidly extinguished and did not propagate beyond the stimulation site. Thus, the fading of consciousness during certain stages of sleep may be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1117256", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978476682", "source": "openalex"}

Additional references were identified by reviewing bibliographies and contacting experts in the field. Studies reporting the association between sleep duration and at least one measure of weight were included.Thirty-six publications (31 cross-sectional, 5 prospective, and 0 experimental) were identified. Findings in both cross-sectional and cohort studies of children suggested short sleep duration is strongly and consistently associated with concurrent and future obesity. Results from adult cross-sectional analyses were more mixed with 17 of 23 studies supporting an independent association between short sleep duration and increased weight. In contrast, all three longitudinal studies in adults found a positive association between short sleep duration and future weight. This relationship appeared to wane with age.Short sleep duration appears independently associated with weight gain, particularly in younger age groups.

It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.12371", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2236052756", "source": "openalex"}

The thresholds show a circadian rhythm controlled by a single circadian pacemaker. Time constants of the S process were derived from rates of change of electroencephalographic (EEG) power density during regular sleep and during recovery from sleep deprivation. The waveform of the circadian threshold fluctuations was derived from spontaneous wake-up times after partial sleep deprivation. The model allows computer simulations of the main phenomena of human sleep timing, such as 1) internal desynchronization in the absence of time cues, 2) sleep fragmentation during continuous bed rest, and 3) circadian phase dependence of sleep duration during isolation from time cues, recovery from sleep deprivation, and shift work.

Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens.

Compared to those without sleep-disordered breathing (AHI: <5 events/h), the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in those with mild (AHI: 5.0-14.9 events/h), moderate (AHI: 15.0-29.9 events/h), and severe (AHI: >or=30.0 events/h) sleep-disordered breathing were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-1.08), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.97-1.42), and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.14-1.86), respectively. Stratified analyses by sex and age showed that the increased risk of death associated with severe sleep-disordered breathing was statistically significant in men aged 40-70 y (hazard ratio: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.31-3.33). Measures of sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia, but not sleep fragmentation, were independently associated with all-cause mortality. Coronary artery disease-related mortality associated with sleep-disordered breathing showed a pattern of association similar to all-cause mortality.Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with all-cause mortality and specifically that due to coronary artery disease, particularly in men aged 40-70 y with severe sleep-disordered breathing.

Many of the clinical characteristics of pediatric OSA, and the determinants of its epidemiology, differ from those of adult OSA. We systematically reviewed studies on the epidemiology of conditions considered part of a pediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) continuum, ranging from primary snoring to OSA. We highlight a number of methodologic challenges, including widely variable methodologies for collection of questionnaire data about symptomatology, definitions of habitual snoring, criteria for advancing to further diagnostic testing, and objective diagnostic criteria for SDB or OSA. In the face of these limitations, estimated population prevalences are as follows: parent-reported \"always\" snoring, 1.5 to 6%; parent-reported apneic events during sleep, 0.2 to 4%; SDB by varying constellations of parent-reported symptoms on questionnaire, 4 to 11%; OSA diagnosed by varying criteria on diagnostic studies, 1 to 4%. Overall prevalence of parent-reported snoring by any definition in meta-analysis was 7.45% (95% confidence interval, 5.75-9.61). A reasonable preponderance of evidence now suggests that SDB is more common among boys than girls, and among children who are heavier than others, with emerging data to suggest a higher prevalence among African Americans. Less convincing data exist to prove differences in prevalence based on age. We conclude by outlining specific future research needs in the epidemiology of pediatric SDB.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1513/pats.200708-135mg", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964800288", "source": "openalex"}

Investigations of the normal sleep–wake cycle showed that immune parameters like numbers of undifferentiated naïve T cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines exhibit peaks during early nocturnal sleep whereas circulating numbers of immune cells with immediate effector functions, like cytotoxic natural killer cells, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine activity peak during daytime wakefulness. Although it is difficult to entirely dissect the influence of sleep from that of the circadian rhythm, comparisons of the effects of nocturnal sleep with those of 24-h periods of wakefulness suggest that sleep facilitates the extravasation of T cells and their possible redistribution to lymph nodes. Moreover, such studies revealed a selectively enhancing influence of sleep on cytokines promoting the interaction between antigen presenting cells and T helper cells, like interleukin-12. Sleep on the night after experimental vaccinations against hepatitis A produced a strong and persistent increase in the number of antigen-specific Th cells and antibody titres. Together these findings indicate a specific role of sleep in the formation of immunological memory. This role appears to be associated in particular with the stage of slow wave sleep and the accompanying pro-inflammatory endocrine milieu that is hallmarked by high growth hormone and prolactin levels and low cortisol and catecholamine concentrations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116205810", "source": "openalex"}

This paper describes the work of the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force, including methodology, a literature review and the rationale behind the new rules. Reliability studies of R & K scoring were reviewed; reliability was low for stage one and moderate for slow wave sleep. Evidence indicated that K complexes and slow waves are expressed maximal frontally, spindles centrally and alpha rhythm over the occipital region. Three derivations of EEG, two of electro-oculography, and one of chin EMG were recommended. Scoring by 30-second epochs was retained. New terminology for sleep stages was proposed. Attenuation of alpha rhythm was determined to be the most valid electrophysiological marker of sleep onset. Alternative measures were proposed for non-alpha generating subjects. K complexes associated with arousals were determined to be insufficient alone to define the new stage N2. No evidence was found to justify dividing slow wave sleep into two stages. No reasons were found to alter the current slow wave amplitude criteria at any age. The phenomena of REM sleep were defined. The rules for defining onset and termination of REM sleep periods were simplified. Movement time was eliminated and major body movements defined. Studies are needed to test the reliability of the new rules.

Linear plots were obtained in 10 of 13 subjects when the systolic pressures of successive pulses during the pressure rise were plotted against the pulse intervals which began the next beat. The relationship was disturbed by movement or arousal, and was better when pulse intervals falling in inspiration were discarded.

Prolonged short sleep durations could lead to hypertension through extended exposure to raised 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate, elevated sympathetic nervous system activity, and increased salt retention. Such forces could lead to structural adaptations and the entrainment of the cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium. Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular disease, but we are not aware of any published prospective population studies that have shown a link between short sleep duration and the incidence of hypertension in subjects without apparent sleep disorders. We assessed whether short sleep duration would increase the risk for hypertension incidence by conducting longitudinal analyses of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( n =4810) using Cox proportional hazards models and controlling for covariates. Hypertension incidence ( n =647) was determined by physician diagnosis, hospital record, or cause of death over the 8- to 10-year follow-up period between 1982 and 1992. Sleep durations of ≤5 hours per night were associated with a significantly increased risk of hypertension (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.79) in subjects between the ages of 32 and 59 years, and controlling for the potential confounding variables only partially attenuated this relationship. The increased risk continued to be significant after controlling for obesity and diabetes, which was consistent with the hypothesis that these variables would act as partial mediators.

Problems with sleep are widely prevalent and include deficits in quantity and quality of sleep; sleep problems that impact the continuity of sleep are collectively referred to as sleep disruptions. Numerous factors contribute to sleep disruption, ranging from lifestyle and environmental factors to sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Sleep disruptions have substantial adverse short- and long-term health consequences. A literature search was conducted to provide a nonsystematic review of these health consequences (this review was designed to be nonsystematic to better focus on the topics of interest due to the myriad parameters affected by sleep). Sleep disruption is associated with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, metabolic effects, changes in circadian rhythms, and proinflammatory responses. In otherwise healthy adults, short-term consequences of sleep disruption include increased stress responsivity, somatic pain, reduced quality of life, emotional distress and mood disorders, and cognitive, memory, and performance deficits. For adolescents, psychosocial health, school performance, and risk-taking behaviors are impacted by sleep disruption. Behavioral problems and cognitive functioning are associated with sleep disruption in children. Long-term consequences of sleep disruption in otherwise healthy individuals include hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, weight-related issues, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and colorectal cancer. All-cause mortality is also increased in men with sleep disturbances. For those with underlying medical conditions, sleep disruption may diminish the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents and may worsen the severity of common gastrointestinal disorders. As a result of the potential consequences of sleep disruption, health care professionals should be cognizant of how managing underlying medical conditions may help to optimize sleep continuity and consider prescribing interventions that minimize sleep disruption.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/nss.s134864", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2615609848", "source": "openalex"}

It is postulated that recurrent episodes of occlusion of upper airways during sleep result in pathophysiological changes that may predispose to vascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, and we postulate that OSA represents a stress that promotes insulin resistance, hence atherogenesis. This study investigated the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and insulin resistance, indicated by fasting serum insulin level and insulin resistance index based on the homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA-IR). A total of 270 consecutive subjects (197 male) who were referred for polysomnography and who did not have known diabetes mellitus were included, and 185 were documented to have OSA defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) ⩾ 5. OSA subjects were more insulin resistant, as indicated by higher levels of fasting serum insulin (p = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (p < 0.001); they were also older and more obese. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that obesity was the major determinant of insulin resistance but sleep-disordered breathing parameters (AHI and minimum oxygen saturation) were also independent determinants of insulin resistance (fasting insulin: AHI, p = 0.02, minimum O2, p = 0.041; HOMA-IR: AHI, p = 0.044, minimum O2, p = 0.022); this association between OSA and insulin resistance was seen in both obese and nonobese subjects. Each additional apnea or hypopnea per sleep hour increased the fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR by about 0.5%. Further analysis of the relationship of insulin resistance and hypertension confirmed that insulin resistance was a significant factor for hypertension in this cohort. Our findings suggest that OSA is independently associated with insulin resistance, and its role in the atherogenic potential of sleep disordered breathing is worthy of further exploration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.165.5.2103001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037464054", "source": "openalex"}

(2) Discharge anticipated S-WC stages as well as phasic cortical activity, such as spindles, during slow wave sleep. (3) Discharge decreased within active waking during grooming and sweet water consumption. (4) Bursts of impulses accompanied spontaneous or sensory-evoked interruptions of sleep, grooming, consumption, or other such ongoing behavior. (5) These characteristic discharge properties were topographically homogeneous for recordings throughout the NE-LC. (6) Phasic robust activity was synchronized markedly among neurons in multiple unit populations.

It is shown here that, like mammalian sleep, rest in Drosophila is characterized by an increased arousal threshold and is homeostatically regulated independently of the circadian clock. As in mammals, rest is abundant in young flies, is reduced in older flies, and is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics. Several molecular markers modulated by sleep and waking in mammals are modulated by rest and activity in Drosophila , including cytochrome oxidase C, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP, and enzymes implicated in the catabolism of monoamines. Flies lacking one such enzyme, arylalkylamine N -acetyltransferase, show increased rest after rest deprivation. These results implicate the catabolism of monoamines in the regulation of sleep and waking in the fly and suggest that Drosophila may serve as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.287.5459.1834", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056213320", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects slept in the laboratory, and sleep and waking were monitored by staff and actigraphy. Three times each day (1000, 1600, and 2200 hours) subjects were assessed for subjective sleepiness (SSS) and mood (POMS) and were evaluated on a brief performance battery that included psychomotor vigilance (PVT), probed memory (PRM), and serial-addition testing, Once each day they completed a series of visual analog scales (VAS) and reported sleepiness and somatic and cognitive/emotional problems. Sleep restriction resulted in statistically robust cumulative effects on waking functions. SSS ratings, subscale scores for fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance from the POMS and VAS ratings of mental exhaustion and stress were evaluated across days of restricted sleep (p = 0.009 to p = 0.0001). PVT performance parameters, including the frequency and duration of lapses, were also significantly increased by restriction (p = 0.018 to p = 0.0001). Significant time-of-day effects were evident in SSS and PVT data, but time-of-day did not interact with the effects of sleep restriction across days. The temporal profiles of cumulative changes in neurobehavioral measures of alertness as a function of sleep restriction were generally consistent. Subjective changes tended to precede performance changes by 1 day, but overall changes in both classes of measure were greatest during the first 2 days (P1, P2) and last 2 days (P6, P7) of sleep restriction. Data from subsets of subjects also showed: 1) that significant decreases in the MSLT occurred during sleep restriction, 2) that the elevated sleepiness and performance deficits continued beyond day 7 of restriction, and 3) that recovery from these deficits appeared to require two full nights of sleep. The cumulative increase in performance lapses across days of sleep restriction correlated closely with MSLT results (r = -0.95) from an earlier comparable experiment by Carskadon and Dement (1). These findings suggest that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt had a dynamic and escalating analog in cumulative daytime sleepiness and that asymptotic or steady-state sleepiness was not achieved in response to sleep restriction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.4.267", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1855097856", "source": "openalex"}

Children were screened for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at home using a detailed parental questionnaire and a single night recording of pulse oximetry and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide. If SAGEA was diagnosed, parents were encouraged to seek medical intervention for SAGEA. School grades of all participating children for the school year preceding and after the overnight study were obtained. Results. SAGEA was identified in 54 children (18.1%). Of these, 24 underwent surgical tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (TR), whereas in the remaining 30 children, parents elected not to seek any therapeutic intervention (NT). Overall mean grades during the second grade increased from 2.43 ± 0.17 (SEM) to 2.87 ± 0.19 in TR, although no significant changes occurred in NT (2.44 ± 0.13 to 2.46 ± 0.15). Similarly, no academic improvements occurred in children without SAGEA. Conclusions. SAGEA is frequently present in poorly performing first-grade students in whom it adversely affects learning performance.

Data were collected by questionnaire, clinical examinations, and in-home polysomnography. Sleep-disordered breathing status was based on the average number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour of sleep (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]). We used multiple logistic regression modeling to estimate cross-sectional associations of selected participant characteristics with SDB defined by an AHI of 15 or greater.Male sex, age, body mass index, neck girth, snoring, and repeated breathing pause frequency were independent, significant correlates of an AHI of 15 or greater. People reporting habitual snoring, loud snoring, and frequent breathing pauses were 3 to 4 times more likely to have an AHI of 15 or greater vs an AHI less than 15, but there were weaker associations for other factors with an AHI of 15 or greater. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for an AHI of 15 or greater vs an AHI less than 15 were 1.6 and 1.5, respectively, for 1-SD increments in body mass index and neck girth. As age increased, the magnitude of associations for SDB and body habitus, snoring, and breathing pauses decreased.A significant proportion of occult SDB in the general population would be missed if screening or case finding were based solely on increased body habitus or male sex.

Immune system activation alters sleep, and sleep in turn affects the innate and adaptive arm of our body’s defense system. Stimulation of the immune system by microbial challenges triggers an inflammatory response, which, depending on its magnitude and time course, can induce an increase in sleep duration and intensity, but also a disruption of sleep. Enhancement of sleep during an infection is assumed to feedback to the immune system to promote host defense. Indeed, sleep affects various immune parameters, is associated with a reduced infection risk, and can improve infection outcome and vaccination responses. The induction of a hormonal constellation that supports immune functions is one likely mechanism underlying the immune-supporting effects of sleep. In the absence of an infectious challenge, sleep appears to promote inflammatory homeostasis through effects on several inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. This notion is supported by findings that prolonged sleep deficiency (e.g., short sleep duration, sleep disturbance) can lead to chronic, systemic low-grade inflammation and is associated with various diseases that have an inflammatory component, like diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration. Here, we review available data on this regulatory sleep-immune crosstalk, point out methodological challenges, and suggest questions open for future research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00010.2018", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2927147597", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this study was to determine whether decreased sleep duration (from self-reports) is associated with an increased risk of coronary events. <h3>Methods</h3> We studied a cohort of 71 617 US female health professionals (aged 45-65 years), without reported coronary heart disease (CHD) at baseline, who were enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Subjects were mailed a questionnaire in 1986 asking about daily sleep duration. Subjects were followed up until June 30, 1996, for the occurrence of CHD-related events.

These deficits have been attributed in large part to failures of vigilant attention, which many theorists believe forms the bedrock of the other more complex components of cognition. One of the leading paradigms used as an assay of vigilant attention is the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), a high signal‐load reaction‐time test that is extremely sensitive to sleep deprivation. Over the last twenty years, four dominant findings have emerged from the use of this paradigm. First, sleep deprivation results in an overall slowing of responses. Second, sleep deprivation increases the propensity of individuals to lapse for lengthy periods (&gt;500 ms), as well as make errors of commission. Third, sleep deprivation enhances the time‐on‐task effect within each test bout. Finally, PVT results during extended periods of wakefulness reveal the presence of interacting circadian and homeostatic sleep drives.

A total of 493 subjects from the Zurich Longitudinal Studies were followed using structured sleep-related questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after birth and then at annual intervals until 16 years of age. Gaussian percentiles for ages 3 months to 16 years were calculated for total sleep duration (time in bed) and nighttime and daytime sleep duration. The mean sleep duration for ages 1 to 16 years was estimated by generalized additive models based on the loess smoother; a cohort effect also had to be included. The standard deviation (SD) was estimated from the loess smoothed absolute residuals from the mean curve. For ages 3, 6, and 9 months, an alternative approach with a simple model linear in age was used. For age 1 month, empirical percentiles were calculated.Results. Total sleep duration decreased from an average of 14.2 hours (SD: 1.9 hours) at 6 months of age to an average of 8.1 hours (SD: 0.8 hours) at 16 years of age. The variance showed the same declining trend: the interquartile range at 6 months after birth was 2.5 hours, whereas at 16 years of age, it was only 1.0 hours. Total sleep duration decreased across the studied cohorts (1974–1993) because of increasingly later bedtime but unchanged wake time across decades. Consolidation of nocturnal sleep occurred during the first 12 months after birth with a decreasing trend of daytime sleep.

Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can mitigate these risks, effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment.

Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group, cohort design, we surgically implanted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy. The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour, with a score of ≥15 indicating moderate-to-severe apnea) and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by ≥4 percentage points from baseline). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. Consecutive participants with a response were included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal trial. The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was 54.5 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4.

Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group (25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour, P<0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2%.

This technical report describes the procedures involved in developing recommendations on the management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).METHODS:. The literature from 1999 through 2011 was evaluated.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:. A total of 3166 titles were reviewed, of which 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II through IV. The prevalence of OSAS ranged from 0% to 5.7%, with obesity being an independent risk factor. OSAS was associated with cardiovascular, growth, and neurobehavioral abnormalities and possibly inflammation. Most diagnostic screening tests had low sensitivity and specificity. Treatment of OSAS resulted in improvements in behavior and attention and likely improvement in cognitive abilities. Primary treatment is adenotonsillectomy (AT). Data were insufficient to recommend specific surgical techniques; however, children undergoing partial tonsillectomy should be monitored for possible recurrence of OSAS. Although OSAS improved postoperatively, the proportion of patients who had residual OSAS ranged from 13% to 29% in low-risk populations to 73% when obese children were included and stricter polysomnographic criteria were used. Nevertheless, OSAS may improve after AT even in obese children, thus supporting surgery as a reasonable initial treatment. A significant number of obese patients required intubation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) postoperatively, which reinforces the need for inpatient observation. CPAP was effective in the treatment of OSAS, but adherence is a major barrier. For this reason, CPAP is not recommended as first-line therapy for OSAS when AT is an option. Intranasal steroids may ameliorate mild OSAS, but follow-up is needed. Data were insufficient to recommend rapid maxillary expansion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-1672", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4243260104", "source": "openalex"}

This review will consider recent and emerging findings implicating sleep and specific sleep-stage physiologies in the modulation, regulation, and even preparation of cognitive and emotional brain processes. First, evidence for the role of sleep in memory processing will be discussed, principally focusing on declarative memory. Second, at a neural level several mechanistic models of sleep-dependent plasticity underlying these effects will be reviewed, with a synthesis of these features offered that may explain the ordered structure of sleep, and the orderly evolution of memory stages. Third, accumulating evidence for the role of sleep in associative memory processing will be discussed, suggesting that the long-term goal of sleep may not be the strengthening of individual memory items, but, instead, their abstracted assimilation into a schema of generalized knowledge. Fourth, the newly emerging benefit of sleep in regulating emotional brain reactivity will be considered. Finally, and building on this latter topic, a novel hypothesis and framework of sleep-dependent affective brain processing will be proposed, culminating in testable predictions and translational implications for mood disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059110708", "source": "openalex"}

We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.85.5.1969", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1853766545", "source": "openalex"}

The prevalence increased with time and OSA was reported in 37% of men and in 50% of women in studies from 2008 and 2013 respectively. OSA is more prevalent in men than in women and increases with age and obesity. Smoking and alcohol consumption are also suggested as risk factors, but the results are conflicting. Excessive daytime sleepiness is suggested as the most important symptom of OSA, but only a fraction of subjects with AHI >5 report daytime sleepiness and one study did not find any relationship between daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea in women. Stroke and hypertension and coronary artery disease are associated with sleep apnea. Cross-sectional studies indicate an association between OSA and diabetes mellitus. Patients younger than 70 years run an increased risk of early death if they suffer from OSA. It is concluded that OSA is highly prevalent in the population. It is related to age and obesity. Only a part of subjects with OSA in the population have symptoms of daytime sleepiness. The prevalence of OSA has increased in epidemiological studies over time. Differences and the increase in prevalence of sleep apnea are probably due to different diagnostic equipment, definitions, study design and characteristics of included subjects including effects of the obesity epidemic.

The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of the surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, to provide the basis for the American Sleep Disorders Association's practice parameters on this subject and to share our findings of metanalysis of previously published studies regarding uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. We searched MEDLINE from January 1966 through April 1993, with an update in February 1995, to provide a review of the application of surgical modifications of the upper airway to treat adults with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Operations to treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome include nasal septal reconstruction; uvulopalatopharyngoplasty; uvulopalatopharyngoglossoplasty; laser midline glossectomy; lingualplasty; inferior sagittal mandibular osteotomy and genioglossal advancement, with hyoid myotomy and suspension (the entire process is referred to as GAHM); maxillomandibular osteotomy and advancement, and tracheotomy. Papers included in metanalysis provided preoperative and postoperative polysomnographic data on at least nine patients treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for their obstructive sleep apnea. Analysis of the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty papers revealed that this procedure is, at best, effective in treating less than 50% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The site of pharyngeal narrowing or collapse, although identified by different and unvalidated methods, has a marked effect on the probability of success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Patients who achieve a favorable response with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty tend to have less severe obstructive sleep apnea than those who do not. For patients who demonstrate retrolingual narrowing or collapse, other surgical modifications have been described, such as lingualplasty, GAHM, and maxillomandibular osteotomy and advancement.

Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Scopus databases, and reference lists of eligible studies.

Syntheses of longitudinal studies suggested insomnia and sleep quality were bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and depression/anxiety, respectively. Childhood sleep problems significantly predicted higher levels of depression and a combined depression/anxiety variable, but not vice-versa. A one-way relationship was found where anxiety predicted excessive daytime sleepiness, but excessive daytime sleepiness was not associated with depression. Definitive conclusions regarding bidirectionality cannot be made for most sleep disturbances due to the small number and heterogeneity of cohort samples used across studies.

The objective of this study was to assess the relation of obstructive sleep apnea to incident coronary heart disease and heart failure in a general community sample of adult men and women. Methods and Results— A total of 1927 men and 2495 women ≥40 years of age and free of coronary heart disease and heart failure at the time of baseline polysomnography were followed up for a median of 8.7 years in this prospective longitudinal epidemiological study. After adjustment for multiple risk factors, obstructive sleep apnea was a significant predictor of incident coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, revascularization procedure, or coronary heart disease death) only in men ≤70 years of age (adjusted hazard ratio 1.10 [95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.21] per 10-unit increase in apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) but not in older men or in women of any age. Among men 40 to 70 years old, those with AHI ≥30 were 68% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with AHI &lt;5.

Independent measures were age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity status, and the respiratory disturbance index.Lighter sleep was found in men relative to women and in American Indians and blacks relative to other ethnic groups. Increasing age was associated with impaired sleep in men, with less consistent associations in women. Notably, women had, on average, 106% more slow wave sleep. Sleep-disordered breathing was associated with poorer sleep; however, these associations were generally smaller than associations with sex, ethnicity, and age.

Saliva cortisol concentrations were determined before and after the retention intervals to determine pituitary-adrenal secretory activity. Sleep was determined somnopolygraphically. Sleep generally enhanced recall when compared with the effects of corresponding retention intervals of wakefulness. The benefit from sleep on recall depended on the phase of sleep and on the type of memory: Recall of paired-associate lists improved more during early sleep, and recall of mirror-tracing skills improved more during late sleep. The effects may reflect different influences of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep since time in SWS was 5 times longer during the early than late sleep retention interval, and time in REM sleep was twice as long during late than early sleep (p < 0.005).

Evidence shows that the effect of shift work on sleep mainly concerns acute sleep loss in connection with night shifts and early morning shifts. A link also exists between shift work and accidents, type 2 diabetes (relative risk range 1.09-1.40), weight gain, coronary heart disease (relative risk 1.23), stroke (relative risk 1.05), and cancer (relative risk range 1.01-1.32), although the original studies showed mixed results. The relations of shift work to cardiometabolic diseases and accidents mimic those with insufficient sleep. Laboratory studies indicate that cardiometabolic stress and cognitive impairments are increased by shift work, as well as by sleep loss.

The present study aims to investigate the ability of the two most commonly employed methods, actigraphy and sleep logs, to identify circadian sleep/wake disorders and measure changes in sleep patterns over time. In addition, the study assesses whether sleep measured by both methods shows the same relationship with an established circadian phase marker, urinary 6‐sulphatoxymelatonin. A total of 49 registered blind subjects with different types of circadian rhythms were studied daily for at least four weeks. Grouped analysis of all study days for all subjects was performed for all sleep parameters (1062–1150 days data per sleep parameter). Good correlations were observed when comparing the measurement of sleep timing and duration (sleep onset, sleep offset, night sleep duration, day‐time nap duration). However, the methods were poorly correlated in their assessment of transitions between sleep and wake states (sleep latency, number and duration of night awakenings, number of day‐time naps). There were also large and inconsistent differences in the measurement of the absolute sleep parameters. Overall, actigraphs recorded a shorter sleep latency, advanced onset time, increased number and duration of night awakenings, delayed offset, increased night sleep duration and increased number and duration of naps compared with the subjective sleep logs. Despite this, there was good agreement between the methods for measuring changes in sleep patterns over time.

However, these studies either used surrogate markers of sleep-disordered breathing or could not, due to cross-sectional design, address the temporal relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and stroke.Objectives: To determine whether sleep-disordered breathing increases the risk for stroke.Methods: We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses on 1,475 and 1,189 subjects, respectively, from the general population. Sleep-disordered breathing was defined by the apnea–hypopnea index (frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep) obtained by attended polysomnography. The protocol, including polysomnography, risk factors for stroke, and a history of physician-diagnosed stroke, was repeated at 4-yr intervals.Measurements and Main Results: In the cross-sectional analysis, subjects with an apnea–hypopnea index of 20 or greater had increased odds for stroke (odds ratio, 4.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–14.24; p = 0.02) compared with those without sleep-disordered breathing (apnea–hypopnea index, <5) after adjustment for known confounding factors. In the prospective analysis, sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea–hypopnea index of 20 or greater was associated with an increased risk of suffering a first-ever stroke over the next 4 yr (unadjusted odds ratio, 4.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–14.15; p = 0.02).

This descriptive study examined a variety of common sleep behaviors in a group of 494 elementary school children, grades kindergarten through fourth, using a battery of sleep questionnaires that included parent, teacher, and self-report surveys. The prevalence of parent-defined sleep problems ranged from 3.7% (Sleep-Disordered Breathing) to 15.1% (Bedtime Resistance), with 37% of the overall sample described as having significant sleep problems in at least one sleep domain. Younger children were more likely than older children to have sleep problems noted by parents (particularly bedtime struggles and night wakings), as well as by teacher and self-report. Children tended to identify more sleep problems by self-report, particularly sleep-onset delay and night wakings, than did their parents. Overall, approximately 10% of the sample was identified by all three measures as having significant problems with daytime sleepiness. The results of this study emphasize the importance of screening for sleep disorders in this age group in the clinical setting. The need for consensus regarding the use of sleep screening instruments and the definition of “problem” sleep in school-aged children is also discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004703-200002000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132324962", "source": "openalex"}

These novel guidelines for children and youth aged 5–17 years respect the natural and intuitive integration of movement behaviours across the whole day (24-h period). The development process was guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and systematic reviews of evidence informing the guidelines were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Four systematic reviews (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, integrated behaviours) examining the relationships between and among movement behaviours and several health indicators were completed and interpreted by expert consensus. Complementary compositional analyses were performed using Canadian Health Measures Survey data to examine the relationships between movement behaviours and health indicators. A stakeholder survey was employed (n = 590) and 28 focus groups/stakeholder interviews (n = 104) were completed to gather feedback on draft guidelines. Following an introductory preamble, the guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for a healthy day (24 h), comprising a combination of sleep, sedentary behaviours, light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity physical activity. Proactive dissemination, promotion, implementation, and evaluation plans have been prepared in an effort to optimize uptake and activation of the new guidelines. Future research should consider the integrated relationships among movement behaviours, and similar integrated guidelines for other age groups should be developed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-0151", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2435437921", "source": "openalex"}

Methods In total, 319 university students (203 females and 116 males; mean age = 20.5 ± 2.45) were included in the study. Participants were divided into the following three groups: a smartphone non-user group ( n = 71, 22.3%), a low smartphone use group ( n = 121, 37.9%), and a high smartphone use group ( n = 127, 39.8%). All participants were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory; moreover, participants other than those in the smartphone non-user group were also assessed with the Smartphone Addiction Scale. Results The findings revealed that the Smartphone Addiction Scale scores of females were significantly higher than those of males. Depression, anxiety, and daytime dysfunction scores were higher in the high smartphone use group than in the low smartphone use group. Positive correlations were found between the Smartphone Addiction Scale scores and depression levels, anxiety levels, and some sleep quality scores.

Although sleep exerts marked modulatory effects on glucose metabolism, and molecular mechanisms for the interaction between sleeping and feeding have been documented, the potential impact of recurrent sleep curtailment on the risk for diabetes and obesity has only recently been investigated. In laboratory studies of healthy young adults submitted to recurrent partial sleep restriction, marked alterations in glucose metabolism including decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity have been demonstrated. The neuroendocrine regulation of appetite was also affected as the levels of the anorexigenic hormone leptin were decreased, whereas the levels of the orexigenic factor ghrelin were increased. Importantly, these neuroendocrine abnormalities were correlated with increased hunger and appetite, which may lead to overeating and weight gain. Consistent with these laboratory findings, a growing body of epidemiological evidence supports an association between short sleep duration and the risk for obesity and diabetes. Chronic sleep loss may also be the consequence of pathological conditions such as sleep-disordered breathing. In this increasingly prevalent syndrome, a feedforward cascade of negative events generated by sleep loss, sleep fragmentation, and hypoxia are likely to exacerbate the severity of metabolic disturbances.

Subjects were monitored polysomnographically and PET images were acquired throughout the course of a single night. Stage-specific contrasts were performed using statistical parametric mapping. Data were analysed in repeated measures fashion, examining within-subject differences between stages [pre-sleep wakefulness-SWS (n = 20 subjects); SWS-post-sleep wakefulness (n = 14); SWS-REM sleep (n = 7); pre-sleep wakefulness-REM sleep (n = 8); REM sleep-post-sleep wakefulness (n = 7); pre-sleep wakefulness-post-sleep wakefulness (n = 20)]. State dependent changes in the activity of centrencephalic regions, including the brainstem, thalamus and basal forebrain (profound deactivations during SWS and reactivations during REM sleep) are consistent with the idea that these areas are constituents of brain systems which mediate arousal. Shifts in the level of activity of the striatum suggested that the basal ganglia might be more integrally involved in the orchestration of the sleep-wake cycle than previously thought. State-dependent changes in the activity of limbic and paralimbic areas, including the insula, cingulate and mesial temporal cortices, paralleled those observed in centrencephalic structures during both REM sleep and SWS. A functional dissociation between activity in higher order, heteromodal association cortices in the frontal and parietal lobes and unimodal sensory areas of the occipital and temporal lobes appeared to be characteristic of both SWS and REM sleep. SWS was associated with selective deactivation of the heteromodal association areas, while activity in primary and secondary sensory cortices was preserved. SWS may not, as previously thought, represent a generalized decrease in neuronal activity. On the other hand, REM sleep was characterized by selective activation of certain post-rolandic sensory cortices, while activity in the frontoparietal association cortices remained depressed. REM sleep may be characterized by activation of widespread areas of the brain, including the centrencephalic, paralimbic and unimodal sensory regions, with the specific exclusion of areas which normally participate in the highest order analysis and integration of neural information. Deactivation of the heteromodal association areas (the orbital, dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices) constitutes the single feature common to both non-REM and REM sleep states, and may be a defining characteristic of sleep itself. The stages of sleep could also be distinguished by characteristic differences in the relationships between the basal ganglia, thalamic nuclei and neocortical regions of interest.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/120.7.1173", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094500507", "source": "openalex"}

OSA is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In many patients, OSA can be diagnosed with home sleep apnea testing, which has a sensitivity of approximately 80%. Effective treatments include weight loss and exercise, positive airway pressure, oral appliances that hold the jaw forward during sleep, and surgical modification of the pharyngeal soft tissues or facial skeleton to enlarge the upper airway.

Treatment with positive airway pressure lowers blood pressure, especially in patients with resistant hypertension; however, randomized clinical trials of OSA treatment have not demonstrated significant benefit on rates of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> OSA is common and the prevalence is increasing with the increased prevalence of obesity. Daytime sleepiness is among the most common symptoms, but many patients with OSA are asymptomatic. Patients with OSA who are asymptomatic, or whose symptoms are minimally bothersome and pose no apparent risk to driving safety, can be treated with behavioral measures, such as weight loss and exercise. Interventions such as positive airway pressure are recommended for those with excessive sleepiness and resistant hypertension. Managing asymptomatic OSA to reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events is not currently supported by high-quality evidence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.3514", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3015537361", "source": "openalex"}

What are the consequences of staying awake on brain cells, and why is sleep needed? Surprisingly, we do not know whether the firing of cortical neurons is affected by how long an animal has been awake or asleep. Here, we found that after sustained wakefulness cortical neurons fire at higher frequencies in all behavioral states. During early NREM sleep after sustained wakefulness, periods of population activity (ON) are short, frequent, and associated with synchronous firing, while periods of neuronal silence are long and frequent. After sustained sleep, firing rates and synchrony decrease, while the duration of ON periods increases. Changes in firing patterns in NREM sleep correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep homeostasis. Thus, the systematic increase of firing during wakefulness is counterbalanced by staying asleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2009.08.024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086238474", "source": "openalex"}

To obtain objective evidence of the patterns of CPAP use, information was gathered from two urban sites on 35 OSAS patients who were prescribed CPAP for a total of 3,743 days. Patients were given CPAP machines that contained a microprocessor and monitor that measured actual pressure at the mask for every minute of each 24-h day for an average of 106 days per patient. They were not aware of the monitor inside the CPAP machines. Monitor output was compared with patients' diagnostic status, pretreatment clinical and demographic characteristics, and follow-up self-reports of CPAP use, problems, side effects, and aspects of daytime fatigue and sleepiness. Patients attempted to use CPAP an average of 66 ± 37% of the days monitored. When CPAP was used, the mean duration of use was 4.88 ± 1.97 h. However, patients' reports of the duration of CPAP use overestimated actual use by 69 ± 110 min (p < 0.002). Both frequency and duration of CPAP use in the first month reliably predicted use in the third month (p < 0.0001). Although the majority (60%) of patients claimed to use CPAP nightly, only 16 of 35 (46%) met criteria for regular use, defined by at least 4 h of CPAP administered on 70% of the days monitored. Relative to less regular users, these 16 patients had more years of education (p = 0.05), and were more likely to work in professional occupations. At pretreatment they tended to report more episodes of daytime sleepiness (p = 0.062) and less ability to perform tasks (p = 0.069), and at follow-up after CPAP use they reported greater satisfaction with CPAP (p = 0.025) and an improved level of daytime energy (p = 0.046). The most frequently cited problems with CPAP were “inconvenience” (54%) and “stuffy nose” (46%), although the complaint that the mask caused “claustrophobia” was the only problem identified significantly more often by the 19 patients who used CPAP less regularly (p < 0.02). Surprisingly, only 2 of the 35 patients studied used CPAP for at least 7 h on ⩾ 70% of days, suggesting that frequent, long-duration, quality sleep is a relatively rare occurrence in OSAS patients treated with CPAP. We conclude that actual CPAP use by OSAS patients falls short of the therapeutic goal of providing quality sleep all night, every night, and that patients' self-reports are rather poor estimates of actual use within and between nights. Efforts to enhance CPAP use are needed, especially early in treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/147.4.887", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056722705", "source": "openalex"}

Portable Monitoring Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.", "text": "Based on a review of literature and consensus, the Portable Monitoring Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) makes the following recommendations: unattended portable monitoring (PM) for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be performed only in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Clinical sleep evaluations using PM must be supervised by a practitioner with board certification in sleep medicine or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination. PM may be used as an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA. PM is not appropriate for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant comorbid medical conditions that may degrade the accuracy of PM. PM is not appropriate for the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having comorbid sleep disorders. PM is not appropriate for general screening of asymptomatic populations. PM may be indicated for the diagnosis of OSA in patients for whom in-laboratory PSG is not possible by virtue of immobility, safety, or critical illness. PM may also be indicated to monitor the response to non-CPAP treatments for sleep apnea. At a minimum, PM must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation. The airflow, effort, and oximetric biosensors conventionally used for in-laboratory PSG should be used in PM. The Task Force recommends that PM testing be performed under the auspices of an AASM-accredited comprehensive sleep medicine program with written policies and procedures. An experienced sleep technologist/technician must apply the sensors or directly educate patients in sensor application. The PM device must allow for display of raw data with the capability of manual scoring or editing of automated scoring by a qualified sleep technician/technologist. A board certified sleep specialist, or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination, must review the raw data from PM using scoring criteria consistent with current published AASM standards. Under the conditions specified above, PM may be used for unattended studies in the patient's home. Afollow-up visit to review test results should be performed for all patients undergoing PM. Negative or technically inadequate PM tests in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA should prompt in-laboratory polysomnography.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W9033544", "source": "openalex"}

It is a valuable tool for research purposes. The aim of this study was to validate a Brazilian Portuguese version of the PSQI.The Brazilian Portuguese version (PSQI-BR) was developed according to the following steps: (a) translation, (b) back-translation, (c) comparison between translation and back-translation performed by a group of experts, and (d) pretest in bilingual individuals. Between January 2006 and September 2007, the PSQI-BR was applied to a group of consecutive patients who were submitted to overnight polysomnography with clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) or insomnia. As in the original article, a group of patients with depression and a control group were included. The depression group was composed of patients from the Mood Disorders Unit of the Psychiatry Department of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Brazil. The control group was composed of subjects with a history of normal sleep habits, without noticed snoring.A total of 83 patients and 21 controls completed the questionnaire and were submitted to overnight polysomnography. The seven-component scores of the PSQI-BR had an overall reliability coefficient (Cronbach's α) of 0.82, indicating a high degree of internal consistency. The groups included 43 patients with OSAS, 21 with insomnia, 19 with depression and 21 controls. The mean (±SD) PSQI-BR score was 8.1±4.0 for patients with OSAS, 12.8±3.7 for insomnia patients, 14.5±3.7 for those with depression and 2.5±2.0 for control subjects. The one-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in PSQI-BR scores across the four diagnostic groups (p<0.001). Post hoc tests between paired groups showed that scores for OSAS, depression and insomnia were significantly higher than for controls (p<0.05). PSQI-BR scores for insomnia did not differ from those obtained for depression (p>0.05), but both were higher than for OSAS (p<0.05).The results of the present study demonstrate that the PSQI-BR is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of sleep quality and equivalent to its original version when applied to individuals who speak the Brazilian Portuguese language. Despite relevant influences of language and cultural background, no major cultural adaptations were necessary during the validation process.

To assess the effects of modest sleep restriction from 8 to 6 h/night for 1 wk, 25 young, healthy, normal sleepers (12 men and 13 women) were studied for 12 consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. After 1 wk of sleep restriction, although subjects' nighttime sleep was deeper, subjects were significantly sleepier (multiple sleep latency test) and performed worse in four primary variables of psychomotor vigilance test (both P < 0.01). Furthermore, 24-h secretion of IL-6 was increased by 0.8 +/- 0.3 pg/ml (P < 0.05) in both sexes, whereas TNFalpha was increased only in men. Also, the peak cortisol secretion was lower after sleep restriction than at baseline, and this difference was stronger in men (55.18 +/- 24.83 nmol/liter; P < 0.05) than in women (35.87 +/- 24.83 nmol/liter; P < 0.16).

Many aspects of these changes result from altered psychosocial and life‐style circumstances that accompany adolescence. The maturation of biological processes regulating sleep/wake systems, however, may be strongly related to the sleep timing and amount during adolescence—either as “compelling” or “permissive” factors. The two‐process model of sleep regulation posits a fundamental sleep‐wake homeostatic process (process S) working in concert with the circadian biological timing system (process C) as the primary intrinsic regulatory factors. How do these systems change during adolescence? We present data from adolescent participants examining EEG markers of sleep homeostasis to evaluate whether process S shows maturational changes permissive of altered sleep patterns across puberty. Our data indicate that certain aspects of the homeostatic system are unchanged from late childhood to young adulthood, while other features change in a manner that is permissive of later bedtimes in older adolescents. We also show alterations of the circadian timing system indicating a possible circadian substrate for later adolescent sleep timing. The circadian parameters we have assessed include phase, period, melatonin secretory pattern, light sensitivity, and phase relationships, all of which show evidence of changes during pubertal development with potential to alter sleep patterns substantially. However the changes are mediated—whether through process S, process C, or by a combination—many adolescents have too little sleep at the wrong circadian phase. This pattern is associated with increased risks for excessive sleepiness, difficulty with mood regulation, impaired academic performance, learning difficulties, school tardiness and absenteeism, and accidents and injuries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1308.032", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2085288552", "source": "openalex"}

PSG variables of sleep continuity, depth, and architecture, as well as rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep were considered. Calculations were performed with the \"Comprehensive Meta-Analysis\" and \"R\" software. Using random effects modeling, for each disorder and each variable, a separate meta-analysis was conducted if at least 3 studies were available for calculation of effect sizes as standardized means (Hedges' g). Sources of variability, that is, sex, age, and mental disorders comorbidity, were evaluated in subgroup analyses. Sleep alterations were evidenced in all disorders, with the exception of ADHD and seasonal affective disorders. Sleep continuity problems were observed in most mental disorders. Sleep depth and REM pressure alterations were associated with affective, anxiety, autism and schizophrenia disorders. Comorbidity was associated with enhanced REM sleep pressure and more inhibition of sleep depth. No sleep parameter was exclusively altered in 1 condition; however, no 2 conditions shared the same PSG profile. Sleep continuity disturbances imply a transdiagnostic imbalance in the arousal system likely representing a basic dimension of mental health.

From rodent studies it has been assumed that the SCN promote neither wake nor sleep but gate the homeostatic sleep-promoting process. Yet in humans sleep tendency is lowest during the later waking hours of the day, and sleep duration can be predicted because of the precise circadian timing of waking. Thus in primates, the SCN could assure sleep-wake cycle consolidation by actively promoting or facilitating wakefulness. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the sleep-wake and sleep-stage patterns of intact and SCN-lesioned (SCNx) squirrel monkeys maintained in constant light. This diurnal primate has consolidated sleep and wake patterns more similar to man than rodents. Sleep-wake, sleep stages, brain temperature, and drinking circadian rhythms were eliminated, and total sleep time was significantly increased (4.0 hr, P < 0.01) in SCNx monkeys. However, total times in deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; e.g., delta sleep) and REM sleep were not significantly affected by SCN lesions. Increased total sleep time was associated with a reduction in subjective day wake consolidation, as evidenced by substantially shorter wake bout lengths in SCNx monkeys (15 +/- 6 min) as compared to intact monkeys (223 +/- 10 min; P < 0.0001, ANOVA).

The present chapter reviews epidemiologic studies in adults and children and laboratory studies in young adults indicating that sleep restriction results in metabolic and endocrine alterations, including decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, increased evening concentrations of cortisol, increased levels of ghrelin, decreased levels of leptin and increased hunger and appetite. Altogether, the evidence points to a possible role of decreased sleep duration in the current epidemic of obesity.

We assessed the cross-sectional relation of usual sleep time to diabetes mellitus (DM) and IGT among participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study, a community-based prospective study of the cardiovascular consequences of sleep-disordered breathing.Participants were 722 men and 764 women, aged 53 to 93 years. Usual sleep time was obtained by standardized questionnaire. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a serum glucose level of 126 mg/dL or more (> or =7.0 mmol/L) fasting or 200 mg/dL or more (> or =11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours following standard oral glucose challenge or medication use for DM. Impaired glucose tolerance was defined as a 2-hour postchallenge glucose level of 140 mg/dL or more (> or =7.8 mmol/L) and less than 200 mg/dL. The relation of sleep time to DM and IGT was examined using categorical logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, race, body habitus, and apnea-hypopnea index.The median sleep time was 7 hours per night, with 27.1% of subjects sleeping 6 hours or less per night. Compared with those sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night, subjects sleeping 5 hours or less and 6 hours per night had adjusted odds ratios for DM of 2.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.57-4.02) and 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.39), respectively. Adjusted odds ratios for IGT were 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-2.15) and 1.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.18), respectively. Subjects sleeping 9 hours or more per night also had increased odds ratios for DM and IGT. These associations persisted when subjects with insomnia symptoms were excluded.A sleep duration of 6 hours or less or 9 hours or more is associated with increased prevalence of DM and IGT. Because this effect was present in subjects without insomnia, voluntary sleep restriction may contribute to the large public health burden of DM.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.8.863", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125983326", "source": "openalex"}

The onset of sleep apnea peaks in middle age, and its morbid and mortal sequelae include complications from accidents and cardiovascular events. The pathophysiology of sleep apnea remains obscure. The purpose of this study was to test three separate, albeit closely related, hypotheses. 1) Does sleep apnea contribute to the previously reported changes of plasma cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and leptin levels independently of obesity? 2) Among obese patients, is it generalized or visceral obesity that predisposes to sleep apnea? 3) Is apnea a factor independent from obesity in the development of insulin resistance? Obese middle-aged men with sleep apnea were first compared with nonapneic age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched obese and age-matched lean men. All subjects were monitored in the sleep laboratory for 4 consecutive nights. We obtained simultaneous indexes of sleep, sleep stages, and sleep apnea, including apnea/hypopnea index and percent minimum oxygen saturation. The sleep apneic men had higher plasma concentrations of the adipose tissue-derived hormone, leptin, and of the inflammatory, fatigue-causing, and insulin resistance-producing cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 than nonapneic obese men, who had intermediate values, or lean men, who had the lowest values. Because these findings suggested that sleep apneics might have a higher degree of insulin resistance than the BMI-matched controls, we studied groups of sleep-apneic obese and age- and BMI-matched nonapneic controls in whom we obtained computed tomographic scan measures of total, sc, and visceral abdominal fat, and additional biochemical indexes of insulin resistance, including fasting plasma glucose and insulin. The sleep apnea patients had a significantly greater amount of visceral fat compared to obese controls (&amp;lt;0.05) and indexes of sleep disordered breathing were positively correlated with visceral fat, but not with BMI or total or sc fat. Furthermore, the biochemical data confirmed a higher degree of insulin resistance in the group of apneics than in BMI-matched nonapneic controls. We conclude that there is a strong independent association among sleep apnea, visceral obesity, insulin resistance and hypercytokinemia, which may contribute to the pathological manifestations and somatic sequelae of this condition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.85.3.6484", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084292135", "source": "openalex"}

Concurrently, other causes of sudden unexpected infant death that occur during sleep (sleep-related deaths), including suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment, and ill-defined or unspecified causes of death have increased in incidence, particularly since the AAP published its last statement on SIDS in 2005. It has become increasingly important to address these other causes of sleep-related infant death. Many of the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for SIDS and suffocation are strikingly similar. The AAP, therefore, is expanding its recommendations from focusing only on SIDS to focusing on a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths, including SIDS. The recommendations described in this policy statement include supine positioning, use of a firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, room-sharing without bed-sharing, routine immunizations, consideration of using a pacifier, and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The rationale for these recommendations is discussed in detail in the accompanying \"Technical Report--SIDS and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths: Expansion of Recommendations for a Safe Infant Sleeping Environment,\" which is included in this issue of Pediatrics (www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/128/5/e1341).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-2284", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1912186666", "source": "openalex"}

Design A community-based survey of women's health and menopausal symptoms was conducted between November 1995 and October 1997 at each of the seven US sites participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. A multiethnic sample of 12,603 Caucasian, African American, Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic women aged 40 to 55 years was categorized into six groups: premenopausal, early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, naturally postmenopausal, surgically postmenopausal, and postmenopausal receiving hormone replacement therapy. The women were asked whether they had experienced difficulty sleeping in the past 2 weeks. Results Difficulty sleeping was reported by 38%. Age-adjusted rates were highest in the late perimenopausal (45.4%) and surgically postmenopausal (47.6%) groups. Among ethnic groups, rates ranged from 28% in Japanese women to 40% in Caucasian women. In the multivariate analysis, menopausal status was significantly associated with difficulty sleeping. Ethnicity, vasomotor and psychological symptoms, self-perceived health and health behaviors, arthritis, and education also were significantly associated with difficulty sleeping. Conclusions These results suggest that stage of the menopausal transition, independent of other potential explanatory factors, is associated with self-reported sleep difficulty.

Blood pressure was measured on the night polysomnography was performed.Blood pressure increased linearly with increasing apnea-hypopnea index (P = .003 for systolic, P = .01 for diastolic, adjusted for confounding factors). The magnitude of the linear association increased with decreasing obesity. At a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 kg/m2, an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 (vs 0) was associated with blood pressure increases of 3.6 mm Hg for systolic (95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.0) and 1.8 mm Hg for diastolic (95% confidence interval, 0.3-3.3). The odds ratio for hypertension associated with an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 (vs 0) was 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.4).There is a dose-response relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and blood pressure, independent of known confounding factors.

Despite this wealth of information, there has been disagreement on how these data should be interpreted, arising in part because the relative magnitude of effect sizes in these domains is not known. To address this question, we conducted a meta-analysis to discover the effects of short-term SD on both speed and accuracy measures in 6 cognitive categories: simple attention, complex attention, working memory, processing speed, short-term memory, and reasoning. Seventy articles containing 147 cognitive tests were found that met inclusion criteria for this study. Effect sizes ranged from small and nonsignificant (reasoning accuracy: g = -0.125, 95% CI [-0.27, 0.02]) to large (lapses in simple attention: g = -0.776, 95% CI [-0.96, -0.60], p < .001). Across cognitive domains, significant differences were observed for both speed and accuracy; however, there were no differences between speed and accuracy measures within each cognitive domain. Of several moderators tested, only time awake was a significant predictor of between-studies variability, and only for accuracy measures, suggesting that heterogeneity in test characteristics may account for a significant amount of the remaining between-studies variance. The theoretical implications of these findings for the study of SD and cognition are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0018883", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056151297", "source": "openalex"}

These practice parameters were developed to guide the sleep clinician on appropriate clinical use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). These recommendations replace those published in 1992 in a position paper produced by the American Sleep Disorders Association. A Task Force of content experts was appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to perform a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and grade the evidence regarding the clinical use of the MSLT and the MWT. Practice parameters were developed based on this review and in most cases evidence based methods were used to support recommendations. When data were insufficient or inconclusive, the collective opinion of experts was used to support recommendations. These recommendations were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The MSLT is indicated as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected narcolepsy and may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia. The MSLT is not routinely indicated in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or in assessment of change following treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The MSLT is not routinely indicated for evaluation of sleepiness in medical and neurological disorders (other than narcolepsy), insomnia, or circadian rhythm disorders. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. For this reason, the sleep clinician should not rely solely on mean sleep latency as a single indicator of impairment or risk for accidents, but should also rely on clinical judgment. Assessment should involve integration of findings from the clinical history, compliance with treatment, and, in some cases, objective testing using the MWT. These practice parameters also include recommendations for the MSLT and MWT protocols, a discussion of the normative data available for both tests, and a description of issues that need further study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/28.1.113", "url": "https://openalex.org/W183461293", "source": "openalex"}

Yet, the specific role of sleep in brain maturation is a complete mystery. In this article, the developmental psychobiology of sleep regulation is conceptualized within the context of close links to the control of arousal, affect, and attention. The interactions among these systems are considered from an ontogenetic and evolutionary biological perspective. A model is proposed for the development of sleep and arousal regulation with the following major tenets: 1. Sleep and vigilance represent opponent processes in a larger system of arousal regulation. 2. The regulation of sleep, arousal, affect, and attention overlap in physiological, neuroanatomical, clinical, and developmental domains. 3. Complex interactions among these regulatory systems are modulated and integrated in regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). 4. Changes at the level of PFC underlie maturational shifts in the relative balance across these regulatory systems (such as decreases in the depth/length of sleep and increased capacity for vigilance and attention), which occur with normal development. 5. The effects of sleep deprivation (including alterations in attention, emotions, and goal-directed behaviors) also involve changes at the level of PFC integration across regulatory systems. This model is then discussed in the context of developmental pathology in the control of affect and attention, with an emphasis on sleep changes in depression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579400006945", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017128901", "source": "openalex"}

Measurements included polysomnography, a multiple sleep latency test, an oral glucose tolerance test, determination of body fat by hydrodensitometry, and fasting insulin and lipids. The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, depending on the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff, ranged from 40 to 60%.

The Epworth sleepiness scale was also satisfactorily completed by 103 of the patients with Parkinson's disease.PDSS scores in the Parkinson group were significantly different from the healthy controls. Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease had impaired scores compared with early/moderate disease. Individual items of the scale showed good discriminatory power between Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. Relevant items of the PDSS correlated with excessive daytime sleepiness. The scale showed robust test-retest reliability.This appears to be the first description of a simple bedside screening instrument for evaluation of sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease. A combination of subitems may help identify specific aspects of sleep disturbance, which in turn may help target treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.73.6.629", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099944633", "source": "openalex"}

Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.159.3819.1070", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1972216570", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating SWS. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858406292647", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2168645178", "source": "openalex"}

We hypothesized that treatment of obstructive sleep apnea by continuous positive airway pressure in patients with heart failure would improve left ventricular systolic function.Twenty-four patients with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (45 percent or less) and obstructive sleep apnea who were receiving optimal medical treatment for heart failure underwent polysomnography. On the following morning, their blood pressure and heart rate were measured by digital photoplethysmography, and left ventricular dimensions and left ventricular ejection fraction were assessed by echocardiography. The subjects were then randomly assigned to receive medical therapy either alone (12 patients) or with the addition of continuous positive airway pressure (12 patients) for one month. The assessment protocol was then repeated.In the control group of patients who received only medical therapy, there were no significant changes in the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, daytime blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular end-systolic dimension, or left ventricular ejection fraction during the study. In contrast, continuous positive airway pressure markedly reduced obstructive sleep apnea, reduced the daytime systolic blood pressure from a mean (+/-SE) of 126+/-6 mm Hg to 116+/-5 mm Hg (P=0.02), reduced the heart rate from 68+/-3 to 64+/-3 beats per minute (P=0.007), reduced the left ventricular end-systolic dimension from 54.5+/-1.8 to 51.7+/-1.2 mm (P=0.009), and improved the left ventricular ejection fraction from 25.0+/-2.8 to 33.8+/-2.4 percent (P<0.001).In medically treated patients with heart failure, treatment of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea by continuous positive airway pressure reduces systolic blood pressure and improves left ventricular systolic function.

The transition from midlife to late life (age 71-83 years) involved no further significant decrease in slow wave sleep but an increase in time awake of 28 minutes per decade at the expense of decreases in both light non-REM sleep (−24 minutes per decade; P&lt;.001) and REM sleep (−10 minutes per decade; P&lt;.001). The decline in slow wave sleep from early adulthood to midlife was paralleled by a major decline in GH secretion (−372 µg per decade; P&lt;.001). From midlife to late life, GH secretion further declined at a slower rate (−43 µg per decade; P&lt;.02). Independently of age, the amount of GH secretion was significantly associated with slow wave sleep (P&lt;.001). Increasing age was associated with an elevation of evening cortisol levels (+19.3 nmol/L per decade; P&lt;.001) that became significant only after age 50 years, when sleep became more fragmented and REM sleep declined. A trend for an association between lower amounts of REM sleep and higher evening cortisol concentrations independent of age was detected (P&lt;.10).ConclusionsIn men, age-related changes in slow wave sleep and REM sleep occur with markedly different chronologies and are each associated with specific hormonal alterations.

The terminology relating to RBD, and mechanisms underlying REM sleep without atonia and RBD based on data in cat and rat are presented. Neuroimaging data from the few published human cases with RBD associated with structural lesions in the brainstem are presented, in which the dorsal midbrain and pons are implicated. Pharmacological manipulations which alter RBD frequency and severity are reviewed, and the data from human neuropathological studies are presented. An anatomic framework and new schema for the pathophysiology of RBD are proposed based on recent data in rat regarding the putative flip-flop switch for REM sleep control. The structure in man analogous to the subcoeruleus region in cat and sublaterodorsal nucleus in rat is proposed as the nucleus (and its associated efferent and afferent pathways) crucial to RBD pathophysiology. The association of RBD with neurological disease (‘secondary RBD’) is presented, with emphasis on RBD associated with neurodegenerative disease, particularly the synucleinopathies. The hypothesized pathophysiology of RBD is presented in relation to the Braak staging system for Parkinson's disease, in which the topography and temporal sequence of synuclein pathology in the brain could explain the evolution of parkinsonism and/or dementia well after the onset of RBD. These data suggest that many patients with ‘idiopathic’ RBD are actually exhibiting an early clinical manifestation of an evolving neurodegenerative disorder. Such patients may be appropriate for future drug therapies that affect synuclein pathophysiology, in which the development of parkinsonism and/or dementia could be delayed or prevented. We suggest that additional clinicopathological studies be performed in patients with dementia or parkinsonism, with and without RBD, as well as in patients with idiopathic RBD, to further elucidate the pathophysiology and also characterize the clinical and pathophysiological relevance of RBD in neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, longitudinal studies in patients with idiopathic RBD are warranted to characterize the natural history of such patients and prepare for future therapeutic trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awm056", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107251479", "source": "openalex"}

Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health.

Risk factors for CSA were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 3.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39 to 8.84), atrial fibrillation (OR 4.13; 95% CI 1.53 to 11. 14), age > 60 yr (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.35 to 4.15), and hypocapnia (PCO(2 )< 38 mm Hg during wakefulness) (OR 4.33; 95% CI 2.50 to 7. 52). Risk factors for OSA differed by gender: in men, only body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with OSA (OR for a BMI > 35 kg/m(2), 6.10; 95% CI 2.86 to 13.00); whereas, in women, age was the only important risk factor (OR for age > 60 yr, 6.04; 95% CI 1.75 to 20.0).

Deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), is thought to be the most \"restorative\" sleep stage, but beneficial effects of SWS for physical well being have not been demonstrated. The initiation of SWS coincides with hormonal changes that affect glucose regulation, suggesting that SWS may be important for normal glucose tolerance. If this were so, selective suppression of SWS should adversely affect glucose homeostasis and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that, in young healthy adults, all-night selective suppression of SWS, without any change in total sleep time, results in marked decreases in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensatory increase in insulin release, leading to reduced glucose tolerance and increased diabetes risk. SWS suppression reduced delta spectral power, the dominant EEG frequency range in SWS, and left other EEG frequency bands unchanged. Importantly, the magnitude of the decrease in insulin sensitivity was strongly correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in SWS. These findings demonstrate a clear role for SWS in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that reduced sleep quality with low levels of SWS, as occurs in aging and in many obese individuals, may contribute to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0706446105", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983338067", "source": "openalex"}

Orexin in the Regulation of Feeding and Wakefulness", "text": "▪ Abstract Orexin-A and orexin-B are neuropeptides originally identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein–coupled receptors. Orexin neuropeptides (also known as hypocretins) are produced by a small group of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic and perifornical areas, a region classically implicated in the control of mammalian feeding behavior. Orexin neurons project throughout the central nervous system (CNS) to nuclei known to be important in the control of feeding, sleep-wakefulness, neuroendocrine homeostasis, and autonomic regulation. orexin mRNA expression is upregulated by fasting and insulin-induced hypoglycemia. C-fos expression in orexin neurons, an indicator of neuronal activation, is positively correlated with wakefulness and negatively correlated with rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep states. Intracerebroventricular administration of orexins has been shown to significantly increase food consumption, wakefulness, and locomotor activity in rodent models. Conversely, an orexin receptor antagonist inhibits food consumption. Targeted disruption of the orexin gene in mice produces a syndrome remarkably similar to human and canine narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other pathological manifestations of the intrusion of REM sleep-related features into wakefulness. Furthermore, orexin knockout mice are hypophagic compared with weight and age-matched littermates, suggesting a role in modulating energy metabolism. These findings suggest that the orexin neuropeptide system plays a significant role in feeding and sleep-wakefulness regulation, possibly by coordinating the complex behavioral and physiologic responses of these complementary homeostatic functions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.429", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150132984", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and methods Adults with drug-resistant hypertension, defined as a clinic blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mmHg, while taking a sensible combination of three or more antihypertensive drugs, titrated to maximally recommended doses. Each of the 41 participants completed an overnight polysomnographic study and all but two had a 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurement. Results Prevalence of OSA, defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index of ≥ 10 obstructive events per hour of sleep, was 83% in the 24 men and 17 women studied. Patients were generally late middle-aged (57.2 ± 1.6 years, mean ± SE), predominantly white (85%), obese (body mass index, 34.0 ± 0.9 kg/m2) and taking a mean of 3.6 ± 0.1 different antihypertensive medications daily. OSA was more prevalent in men than in women (96 versus 65%, P = 0.014) and more severe (mean apnoea–hypopnoea index of 32.2 ± 4.5 versus 14.0 ± 3.1 events/h, P = 0.004). There was no gender difference in body mass index or age. Women with OSA were significantly older and had a higher systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, wider pulse pressure and slower heart rate than women without OSA. Conclusions The extraordinarily high prevalence of OSA in these patients supports its potential role in the pathogenesis of drug-resistant hypertension, and justifies the undertaking of a randomized controlled trial to corroborate this hypothesis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004872-200112000-00022", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2058153849", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical observations and population studies throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia have consistently shown a graded increase in the prevalence of SDB as body mass index, neck girth, or other measures of body habitus increases. Clinical studies of weight loss and longitudinal population studies provide strong support for a causal association. The role of excess body weight, a modifiable risk factor, with SDB raises many questions relevant to clinical practice and public health. The topic takes on added importance with the alarming rate of weight gain in children as well as adults in industrialized nations. Among adults ages 30-69 yr, averaging over the estimated United States 2003 age, sex, and BMI distributions, we estimate that approximately 17% of adults have mild or worse SDB (apnea-hypopnea index > or = 5) and that 41% of those adults have SDB \"attributable\" to having a body mass index of > or =25 kg/m(2). Similarly, we estimate that approximately 5.7% of adults have moderate or worse SDB (apnea-hypopnea index > or = 15) and that 58% of those adults have SDB attributable to excess weight. Clearly, if the expanding epidemic of obesity seen in the United States continues, the prevalence of SDB will almost certainly increase, along with the proportion of SDB attributable to obesity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00587.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016258977", "source": "openalex"}

The main symptom is daytime sleepiness and it has been suggested it is linked to premature death, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and road traffic accidents.The main treatment for sleep apnoea is with the use of continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which requires a flow generator and mask. These are used at night to prevent apnoea, hypoxia and sleep disturbance. The objective was to assess the effects of CPAP in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in adults.We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and reference lists of articles. We consulted experts in the field. Searches were current to July 2005.We included randomised trials comparing nocturnal CPAP with an inactive control or oral appliances in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea (an apnoea and hypopnoea index greater than five per hour). Trials had a minimum intervention period of two weeks.Trial quality was assessed and two review authors extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Parallel and crossover group trials were analysed separately.Thirty-six trials involving 1718 people met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was mixed. Compared with control, CPAP showed significant improvements in objective and subjective sleepiness and several quality of life, cognitive function and depression measures (parallel-group studies: Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) -3.83 units, 95% CI -4.57 to -3.09; crossover studies: ESS -1.84 units, 95% CI -2.57 to -1.11). Twenty-four hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower with CPAP compared with control (parallel-group trials). Compared with oral appliances, CPAP significantly reduced the apnoea and hypopnoea index (crossover studies: -7.97 events/hr, 95% CI -9.56 to -6.38) and improved sleep efficiency (crossover studies: 2.31%, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.6) and minimum oxygen saturation (4.14%, 95% CI 3.25 to 5.03). Responders to both treatments expressed a strong preference for the oral appliance. However, participants were more likely to withdraw on OA than on CPAP therapy.CPAP is effective in reducing symptoms of sleepiness and improving quality of life measures in people with moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It is more effective than oral appliances in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain people tend to prefer oral appliances to CPAP where both are effective. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of controlling OSA. Short-term data indicate that CPAP leads to lower blood pressure than in controls. Long-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in short-term clinical trials persist.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001106.pub2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126776837", "source": "openalex"}

They next examine how sleep and wakefulness are regulated by mutual inhibition between sleep-and arousal-promoting circuitry and how this interaction functions analogously to an electronic “flip-flop” switch that ensures behavioral state stability. The authors then discuss the role of circadian and homeostatic processes in the consolidation of sleep, including the physiologic basis of homeostatic sleep drive (i.e., wake-dependent increase in sleep propensity) and the role of the SCN in the circadian regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Finally, they describe the hypothalamic circuitry for the integration of photic and nonphotic environmental time cues and how this integration allows organisms to sculpt patterns of rest-activity and sleep-wake cycles that are optimally adaptive.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730406294627", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019685634", "source": "openalex"}

Cross-sectional studies have linked sleep-disordered breathing to poor cognition; however, it remains unclear whether sleep-disordered breathing precedes cognitive impairment in older adults.<h3>Objectives</h3>To determine the prospective relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and cognitive impairment and to investigate potential mechanisms of this association.<h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3>Prospective sleep and cognition study of 298 women without dementia (mean [SD] age: 82.3 [3.2] years) who had overnight polysomnography measured between January 2002 and April 2004 in a substudy of the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Sleep-disordered breathing was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 or more events per hour of sleep. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of sleep-disordered breathing with risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, adjusting for age, race, body mass index, education level, smoking status, presence of diabetes, presence of hypertension, medication use (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics), and baseline cognitive scores. Measures of hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and sleep duration were investigated as underlying mechanisms for this relationship.<h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3>Adjudicated cognitive status (normal, dementia, or mild cognitive impairment) based on data collected between November 2006 and September 2008.<h3>Results</h3>Compared with the 193 women without sleep-disordered breathing, the 105 women (35.2%) with sleep-disordered breathing were more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia (31.1% [n = 60] vs 44.8% [n = 47]; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.08). Elevated oxygen desaturation index (≥15 events/hour) and high percentage of sleep time (&gt;7%) in apnea or hypopnea (both measures of disordered breathing) were associated with risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia (AOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.04-2.83] and AOR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.10-3.78], respectively).

There is evidence that the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6 are involved in physiological sleep regulation and that their administration to humans is associated with sleepiness and fatigue. To explore whether plasma levels of TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 are elevated in patients with EDS, we measured morning plasma levels of TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in 12 sleep apneics, 11 narcoleptics, 8 idiopathic hypersomniacs, and 10 normal controls. TNF alpha was significantly elevated in sleep apneics and narcoleptics compared to that in normal controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Plasma IL-1beta concentrations were not different between sleep disorder patients and controls, whereas IL-6 was markedly and significantly elevated in sleep apneics compared to that in normal controls (P = 0.028). The primary factor influencing TNF alpha values was the degree of nocturnal sleep disturbance, whereas the primary determinant for IL-6 levels was the body mass index. Our findings suggest that TNF alpha and IL-6 might play a significant role in mediating sleepiness and fatigue in disorders of EDS in humans.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.82.5.3950", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975319022", "source": "openalex"}

As a part of an epidemiological survey on sleep in a representative sample of Italian high‐school students, a total of 6631 adolescents, aged 14.1–18.6 years, completed the School Sleep Habits Survey, a comprehensive questionnaire including items regarding sleep, sleepiness, substance use, anxiety and depressed mood, use of sleeping pills, school attendance and a morningness/eveningness scale. The sample consisted of 742 evening‐types (315 males and 427 females; mean age 17.1 years) and 1005 morning‐types (451 males and 554 females; mean age 16.8 years). No significant sex differences were found for morningness/eveningness score. Eveningness was associated with later bedtime and wake‐up time, especially on weekends, shorter time in bed during the week, longer weekend time in bed, irregular sleep–wake schedule, subjective poor sleep. Moreover, evening types used to nap more frequently during school days, complained of daytime sleepiness, referred more attention problems, poor school achievement, more injuries and were more emotionally upset than the other chronotype. They referred also greater caffeine‐containing beverages and substances to promote sleep consumption. Our results suggest that circadian preference might be related not only to sleep pattern, but also to other adolescent behaviours.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2002.00302.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975135107", "source": "openalex"}

There is no evidence for prolonged or delayed effects of sleep loss on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We evaluated the effects of acute partial or total sleep deprivation on the nighttime and daytime profile of cortisol levels. Plasma cortisol profiles were determined during a 32-hour period (from 1800 hours on day 1 until 0200 hours on day 3) in normal young men submitted to three different protocols: normal sleep schedule (2300-0700 hours), partial sleep deprivation (0400-0800 hours), and total sleep deprivation. Alterations in cortisol levels could only be demonstrated in the evening following the night of sleep deprivation. After normal sleep, plasma cortisol levels over the 1800-2300-hour period were similar on days 1 and 2. After partial and total sleep deprivation, plasma cortisol levels over the 1800-2300-hour period were higher on day 2 than on day 1 (37 and 45% increases, p = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively), and the onset of the quiescent period of cortisol secretion was delayed by at least 1 hour. We conclude that even partial acute sleep loss delays the recovery of the HPA from early morning circadian stimulation and is thus likely to involve an alteration in negative glucocorticoid feedback regulation. Sleep loss could thus affect the resiliency of the stress response and may accelerate the development of metabolic and cognitive consequences of glucocorticoid excess.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.10.865", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1685892534", "source": "openalex"}

Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from EEG epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel EEGs (F4-EOG(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards (AASM and R&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score (MASS: 86.2%-81.7, Sleep-EDF: 82.0%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods (MASS: 85.9%-80.5, Sleep-EDF: 78.9%-73.7) on both datasets.

Nine healthy male volunteers (age 26–43 years) were randomly assigned in this double blind and crossover study to undergo either REM sleep or SWS interruption. Periods of 6 consecutive laboratory nights separated by at least 2 weeks were designed as follows: N1 Adaptation night; N2 Baseline night; N3 Total sleep deprivation (40 h); N4 and N5 SWS or REM sleep interruption; N6 Recovery. Sleep was recorded and scored using standard methods. Tolerance thresholds to mechanical and thermal pain were assessed using an electronic pressure dolorimeter and a thermode operating on a Peltier principle. Relative to baseline levels, TSD decreased significantly mechanical pain thresholds (−8%). Both REM sleep and SWS interruption tended to decrease mechanical pain thresholds. Recovery sleep, after SWS interruption produced a significant increase in mechanical pain thresholds (+ 15%). Recovery sleep after REM sleep interruption did not significantly increase mechanical pain thresholds. No significant differences in thermal pain thresholds were detected between and within periods. In conclusion this experimental study in healthy adult volunteers has demonstrated an hyperalgesic effect related to 40 h TSD and an analgesic effect related to SWS recovery. The analgesic effect of SWS recovery is apparently greater than the analgesia induced by level I (World Health Organization) analgesic compounds in mechanical pain experiments in healthy volunteers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00240.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020207011", "source": "openalex"}

Central sleep apnea, in its various forms, is generally the product of an unstable ventilatory control system (high loop gain) with increased controller gain (high hypercapnic responsiveness) generally being the cause. High plant gain can contribute under certain circumstances (hypercapnic patients). On the other hand, obstructive sleep apnea can develop as the result of a variety of physiologic characteristics. The combinations of these may vary considerably between patients. Most obstructive apnea patients have an anatomically small upper airway with augmented pharyngeal dilator muscle activation maintaining airway patency awake, but not asleep. However, individual variability in several phenotypic characteristics may ultimately determine who develops apnea and how severe the apnea will be. These include: (1) upper airway anatomy, (2) the ability of upper airway dilator muscles to respond to rising intrapharyngeal negative pressure and increasing Co(2) during sleep, (3) arousal threshold in response to respiratory stimulation, and (4) loop gain (ventilatory control instability). As a result, patients may respond to different therapeutic approaches based on the predominant abnormality leading to the sleep-disordered breathing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200412-1631so", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104274405", "source": "openalex"}

The present study tests the hypothesis that circulating levels of leptin, a hormone that signals energy balance to the brain, are influenced by sleep duration. We also analyzed associations between leptin and sympathovagal balance, cortisol, TSH, glucose, and insulin under different bedtime conditions. Twenty-four-hour hormonal and glucose profiles were sampled at frequent intervals, and sympathovagal balance was estimated from heart rate variability in 11 subjects studied after 6 d of 4-h bedtimes (mean ± sem of sleep duration during last 2 d: 3 h and 49 ± 2 min) and after 6 d of 12-h bedtimes (sleep: 9 h and 03 ± 15 min). A study with 8-h bedtimes was performed 1 yr later (sleep: 6 h and 52 ± 10 min). Caloric intake and activity levels were carefully controlled in all studies. Mean levels, maximal levels, and rhythm amplitude of leptin were decreased (−19%, −26%, and −20%, respectively) during sleep restriction compared with sleep extension. The decrease in leptin levels was concomitant with an elevation of sympathovagal balance. The effects of sleep duration on leptin were quantitatively associated with alterations of the cortisol and TSH profiles and were accompanied by an elevation of postbreakfast homeostasis model assessment values. Measures of perceived stress were not increased during sleep restriction. During the study with 8-h bedtimes, hormonal and metabolic parameters were intermediate between those observed with 4-h and 12-h bedtimes.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2038569871", "title": "The nature of arousal in sleep", "text": "Summary The role of arousals in sleep is gaining interest among both basic researchers and clinicians. In the last 20 years increasing evidence shows that arousals are deeply involved in the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. The nature of arousals in sleep is still a matter of debate. According to the conceptual framework of the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria, arousals are a marker of sleep disruption representing a detrimental and harmful feature for sleep. In contrast, our view indicates arousals as elements weaved into the texture of sleep taking part in the regulation of the sleep process. In addition, the concept of micro‐arousal (MA) has been extended, incorporating, besides the classical low‐voltage fast‐rhythm electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals, high‐amplitude EEG bursts, be they like delta‐like or K‐complexes, which reflects a special kind of arousal process, mobilizing parallely antiarousal swings. In physiologic conditions, the slow and fast MA are not randomly scattered but appear structurally distributed within sleep representing state‐specific arousal responses. MA preceded by slow waves occurs more frequently across the descending part of sleep cycles and in the first cycles, while the traditional fast type of arousals across the ascending slope of cycles prevails during the last third of sleep. The uniform arousal characteristics of these two types of MAs is supported by the finding that different MAs are associated with an increasing magnitude of vegetative activation ranging hierarchically from the weaker slow EEG types (coupled with mild autonomic activation) to the stronger rapid EEG types (coupled with a vigorous autonomic activation). Finally, it has been ascertained that MA are not isolated events but are basically endowed with a periodic nature expressed in non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep by the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). Understanding the role of arousals and CAP and the relationship between physiologic and pathologic MA can shed light on the adaptive properties of the sleeping brain and provide insight into the pathomechanisms of sleep disturbances. Functional significance of arousal in sleep, and particularly in NREM sleep, is to ensure the reversibility of sleep, without which it would be identical to coma. Arousals may connect the sleeper with the surrounding world maintaining the selection of relevant incoming information and adapting the organism to the dangers and demands of the outer world. In this dynamic perspective, ongoing phasic events carry on the one hand arousal influences and on the other elements of information processing. The other function of arousals is tailoring the more or less stereotyped endogenously determined sleep process driven by chemical influences according to internal and external demands. In this perspective, arousals shape the individual course of night sleep as a variation of the sleep program.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2004.00388.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038569871", "source": "openalex"}

Use of light-emitting devices immediately before bedtime also increases alertness at that time, which may lead users to delay bedtime at home.

To learn how orexin neurons maintain wakefulness, we recorded neurons in head-fixed rats across the sleep-waking cycle and then labeled them with Neurobiotin to identify them by immunohistochemistry. We show that identified orexin neurons discharge during active waking, when postural muscle tone is high in association with movement, decrease discharge during quiet waking in absence of movement, and virtually cease firing during sleep, when postural muscle tone is low or absent. During PS, they remain relatively silent in association with postural muscle atonia and most often despite phasic muscular twitches. They increase firing before the end of PS and thereby herald by several seconds the return of waking and muscle tone.

There are three major oscillations during NREM sleep. Spindles are generated within the thalamus, due to thalamic reticular (RE) neurons that impose rhythmic inhibitory sequences onto TC neurons, but the widespread synchronization of this rhythm is governed by corticothalamic projections. There are two types of delta activity: clock-like waves generated in TC neurons by the interplay between two hyperpolarization-activated inward currents; and cortical waves that survive extensive thalamectomy. The hallmark of NREM sleep activity is the slow oscillation, generated intracortically, which has the virtue of grouping the other types of sleep activities, thus leading to a coalescence of different rhythms that can only be observed in intact-brain animals and humans. Far from being epiphenomena, with no functional role, NREM sleep oscillations, particularly spindles and their experimental model augmenting responses, produce synaptic plasticity in target cortical neurons and resonant activity in corticothalamic loops, as in \"memory\" processes. Upon brain arousal, spindles are blocked by inhibition of RE neurons, the spindles' pacemakers; clock-like delta rhythm is obliterated by depolarization of TC neurons; and the cortically generated slow oscillation is abolished by selective erasure of its hyperpolarizing components. Fast (beta and gamma) oscillations are roduced by the depolarizing effects of mesopontine cholinergic neurons acting on TC neurons and nucleus basalis neurons acting on cortical neurons.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2741/1043", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2041578883", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term relationship between sleep duration and the incidence of clinical diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A cohort of men from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study without diabetes at baseline (1987–1989) were followed until 2004 for the development of diabetes. Average number of hours of sleep per night was grouped into the following categories: ≤5, 6, 7, 8, and &amp;gt;8 h. Incidence rates and relative risks (RRs) were calculated for the development of diabetes in each sleep duration category. Those reporting 7 h of sleep per night served as the reference group. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression. RESULTS—Men reporting short sleep duration (≤5 and 6 h of sleep per night) were twice as likely to develop diabetes, and men reporting long sleep duration (&amp;gt;8 h of sleep per night) were more than three times as likely to develop diabetes over the period of follow-up. Elevated risks remained essentially unchanged after adjustment for age, hypertension, smoking status, self-rated health status, education, and waist circumference (RR 1.95 [95% CI 0.95–4.01] for ≤5 h and 3.12 [1.53–6.37] for &amp;gt;8 h). RRs were altered considerably for the two extreme sleep groups when adjusted for testosterone (1.51 [0.71–3.19] for ≤5 h and 2.81 [1.34–5.90] for &amp;gt;8 h), suggesting that the effects of sleep on diabetes could be mediated via changes in endogenous testosterone levels.

Hypopnea definitions based on decreases in thoracoabdominal movement yielded hypopnea frequencies that were significantly closer to desaturation and arousal frequencies than hypopnea definitions based on flow reduction. The best hypopnea definition was that of a 50% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement lasting for 10 s. This was validated in 33 normal subjects, all of whom had fewer than 11 hypopneas/h, and fewer than 14 apneas plus hypopneas/h of sleep.

There is a need for uniform methods: we need to know the prevalence and incidence of sleep disorders, judged using the same criteria, and also the severity of each problem, i.e. how often a problem or a symptom happens/occurs. In 1988 the Scandinavian Sleep Research Society formed a task group for developing a standardized questionnaire that could be used as a basis for questionnaires used in the Nordic countries. In this article we describe the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ). The main change compared to many previous questionnaires is the five-point scale (scale from 1 to 5) stressing on how many nights/days per week something happens. The basic scale is: 1, 'never or less than once per month'; 2, 'less than once per week'; 3, 'on 1-2 nights per week'; 4, 'on 3-5 nights per week'; and 5, 'every night or almost every night'. For questions about specific rare events the first category may be divided into 'never' and 'less than once per month'.

Laboratory tests have shown that adolescents do not have a decreased need for sleep but probably need more sleep than prepubertally. A number of factors affect the development of adolescent sleep patterns. Puberty itself imposes a burden of increased daytime sleepiness with no change in nocturnal sleep. Parental involvement in setting bedtimes wanes, though they become increasingly involved in waking teenagers in the mornings. Curfews and school schedules also affect adolescent sleep patterns, seen most commonly as imposing earlier rise times as the school day begins earlier during the adolescent years. Part-time employment has a significant impact on the sleep patterns of teenagers: those who work more than 20 h each week sleep less, go to bed later, are more sleepy, and drink more caffeine and alcohol. Development of circadian rhythms may also play a role in the phase delay teenagers commonly experience. The primary conclusion is that many adolescents do not get enough sleep. The consequences of the chronic pattern of insufficient sleep are daytime sleepiness, vulnerability to catastrophic accidents, mood and behavior problems, increased vulnerability to drugs and alcohol, and development of major disorders of the sleep/wake cycle. Educational programs hold the promise of improving teenagers' sleep patterns through informing youngsters, parents, and pediatricians about proper sleep hygiene and the risks of poor sleep habits.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2418128782", "source": "openalex"}

Independent of whether placed during daytime or nighttime, sleep after practice enhanced speed of sequence performance on average by 33.5% and reduced error rate by 30.1% as compared with corresponding intervals of wakefulness. The effect of sleep after learning proved to be stable when retesting was postponed for another night, to exclude effects of sleep loss and to assure that all subjects had sufficient sleep before retrieval testing. Also, the consolidating effect of sleep was specific for the motor sequence learned. It did not generalize to a similar sequence containing identical movement segments in a different order.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2067944500", "title": "System consolidation of memory during sleep", "text": "Over the past two decades, research has accumulated compelling evidence that sleep supports the formation of long-term memory. The standard two-stage memory model that has been originally elaborated for declarative memory assumes that new memories are transiently encoded into a temporary store (represented by the hippocampus in the declarative memory system) before they are gradually transferred into a long-term store (mainly represented by the neocortex), or are forgotten. Based on this model, we propose that sleep, as an offline mode of brain processing, serves the 'active system consolidation' of memory, i.e. the process in which newly encoded memory representations become redistributed to other neuron networks serving as long-term store. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS) rather than rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The concept of active system consolidation during sleep implicates that (a) memories are reactivated during sleep to be consolidated, (b) the consolidation process during sleep is selective inasmuch as it does not enhance every memory, and (c) memories, when transferred to the long-term store undergo qualitative changes. Experimental evidence for these three central implications is provided: It has been shown that reactivation of memories during SWS plays a causal role for consolidation, that sleep and specifically SWS consolidates preferentially memories with relevance for future plans, and that sleep produces qualitative changes in memory representations such that the extraction of explicit and conscious knowledge from implicitly learned materials is facilitated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-011-0335-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067944500", "source": "openalex"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Using baseline data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), we related diabetes to 1) the respiratory disturbance index (RDI; number of apneas plus hypopneas per h of sleep); 2) obstructive apnea index (OAI; ≥3 apneas/h of sleep associated with obstruction of the upper airway); 3) percent of sleep time &amp;lt; 90% O2 saturation; 4) central apnea index (CAI; ≥3 apneas [without respiratory effort]/h sleep); 5) occurrence of a periodic breathing (Cheyne Stokes) pattern; and 6) sleep stages. Initial analyses excluding persons with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) were repeated including these participants. RESULTS—Of the 5,874 participants included in this report, 692 (11.8%) reported diabetes or were taking oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin and 1,002 had prevalent CVD. Among the 4,872 persons without CVD, 470 (9.6%) had diabetes. Diabetic participants had worse CVD risk factor profiles than their nondiabetic counterparts, including higher BMI, waist and neck circumferences, triglycerides, higher prevalence of hypertension, and lower HDL cholesterol (P &amp;lt; 0.001, all). Descriptive analyses indicated differences between diabetic and nondiabetic participants in RDI, sleep stages, sleep time &amp;lt;90% O2 saturation, CAI, and periodic breathing (P &amp;lt; 0.05, all). However, multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for age, sex, BMI, race, and neck circumference eliminated these differences for all sleep measures except percent time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (19.0% among diabetic vs. 20.1% among nondiabetic subjects, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and prevalence of periodic breathing (odds ratio [OR] for diabetic subjects versus nondiabetic subjects 1.80, 95% CI 1.02–3.15). Additionally, adjusted analyses showed diabetes was associated with nonstatistically significant elevations in the odds of an increased central breathing index (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.80–2.55). Addition to the analysis of the 1,002 persons with prevalent CVD (including 222 people with diabetes) did not materially change these results. CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest that diabetes is associated with periodic breathing, a respiratory abnormality associated with abnormalities in the central control of ventilation. Some sleep disturbances may result from diabetes through the deleterious effects of diabetes on central control of respiration. The high prevalence of SDB in diabetes, although largely explained by obesity and other confounders, suggests the presence of a potentially treatable risk factor for CVD in the diabetic population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.26.3.702", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088456053", "source": "openalex"}

Using standardized techniques, individuals were assessed for the presence of insomnia and excessive sleepiness, based on DSM-IV and ICSD criteria. Those individuals with either insomnia or excessive sleepiness and who were currently working rotating or night schedules were classified as having shift work sleep disorder.

Individuals who met criteria for shift work sleep disorder had significantly higher rates of ulcers (odds ratio = 4.18, 95% confidence interval = 2.00–8.72), sleepiness-related accidents, absenteeism, depression, and missed family and social activities more frequently compared to those shift workers who did not meet criteria (P < .05). Importantly, in most cases, the morbidity associated with shift work sleep disorder was significantly greater than that experienced by day workers with identical symptoms. These findings suggest that individuals with shift work sleep disorder are at risk for significant behavioral and health-related morbidity associated with their sleep-wake symptomatology. Further, it suggests that the prevalence of shift work sleep disorder is approximately 10% of the night and rotating shift work population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/27.8.1453", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1630205487", "source": "openalex"}

For this purpose, we validated a 10-item patient self-rating questionnaire (maximum total score 13 points) covering the clinical features of RBD. The RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) was applied to 54 patients with polysomnographically confirmed RBD (29 men; mean age 53.7 +/- 15.8 years), 160 control subjects (81 men; mean age 50.8 +/- 15.5 years) in whom RBD was excluded by history and polysomnography (PSG, control group 1) and 133 unselected healthy subjects (58 men; mean age 46.9 +/- 12.3 years; no PSG, control group 2).

In this review, we highlight the treatment of sleep disturbance before, during and after depression, which probably plays an important role in improving outcomes and preventing the recurrence of depression. In clinical practice, pharmacological therapies, including hypnotics and antidepressants, and non‐pharmacological therapies are typically applied.

In the healthy subjects stage 4 deprivation was accompanied by the temporary appearance of muscoloskeletal and mood symptoms comparable to the symptoms seen chronically in the patients.

Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources.

The current meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the size of the association generally as well as between more specific relationships.Data Sources: Electronic databases for years 1966-2011 were searched to identify candidate studies using PubMed search terms suicide and sleep or sleep initiation/maintenance disorders or dreams or nightmares or sleep disorders/psychology or sleep disorders/epidemiology as well as Ovid search terms suicide and sleep or insomnia or nightmares. The search was supplemented by cross-referencing from identified articles and reviews.Study Selection: Original studies reporting both sleep disturbance and suicide outcomes were identified with 39 of 98 studies (40%) comprising 147,753 subjects selected for inclusion.Data Extraction: Data were extracted by multiple independent observers and verified by a study author. The meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. The size of associations was calculated for all types of sleep disturbances and suicide outcomes combined and for more specific categories including nightmares, insomnia, and insomnia subtypes and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Moderator effects were evaluated.Results: Overall, sleep disturbance was significantly associated with an increased relative risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide ranging from 1.95 (95% CI, 1.41-2.69) to a relative risk of 2.95 (95% CI, 2.48-3.50) in unadjusted studies. Associations were smaller, but remained highly significant among adjusted studies. Depression did not moderate the association between sleep and suicide variables.Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports an association between sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Sleep disturbances in general, as well as insomnia and nightmares individually, appear to represent a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behavior. This proposition is further bolstered by the result that depression did not show risk moderation.J Clin Psychiatry 2012;73(9):e1160-e1167© Copyright 2012 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Submitted: December 7, 2011; accepted April 30, 2012 (doi:10.4088/JCP.11r07586).Corresponding author: Wilfred R.

Prolonged wakefulness can be due to acute total sleep deprivation (SD) or to chronic partial sleep restriction. Although the latter is more common in everyday life, the effects of total SD have been examined more thoroughly. Both total and partial SD induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. First and foremost, total SD impairs attention and working memory, but it also affects other functions, such as long-term memory and decision-making. Partial SD is found to influence attention, especially vigilance. Studies on its effects on more demanding cognitive functions are lacking. Coping with SD depends on several factors, especially aging and gender. Also interindividual differences in responses are substantial.

The overall aim of this study was to investigate whether there are associations between psychosocial aspects of mobile phone use and mental health symptoms in a prospective cohort of young adults. The study group consisted of young adults 20-24 years old (n = 4156), who responded to a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Mobile phone exposure variables included frequency of use, but also more qualitative variables: demands on availability, perceived stressfulness of accessibility, being awakened at night by the mobile phone, and personal overuse of the mobile phone. Mental health outcomes included current stress, sleep disorders, and symptoms of depression. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated for cross-sectional and prospective associations between exposure variables and mental health outcomes for men and women separately. There were cross-sectional associations between high compared to low mobile phone use and stress, sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression for the men and women. When excluding respondents reporting mental health symptoms at baseline, high mobile phone use was associated with sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression for the men and symptoms of depression for the women at 1-year follow-up. All qualitative variables had cross-sectional associations with mental health outcomes. In prospective analysis, overuse was associated with stress and sleep disturbances for women, and high accessibility stress was associated with stress, sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression for both men and women. High frequency of mobile phone use at baseline was a risk factor for mental health outcomes at 1-year follow-up among the young adults. The risk for reporting mental health symptoms at follow-up was greatest among those who had perceived accessibility via mobile phones to be stressful. Public health prevention strategies focusing on attitudes could include information and advice, helping young adults to set limits for their own and others' accessibility.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-66", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117971251", "source": "openalex"}

The effects of sleep loss on the cellular and genomic mechanisms that contribute to inflammatory cytokine activity are not known.In 30 healthy adults, monocyte intracellular proinflammatory cytokine production was repeatedly assessed during the day across 3 baseline periods and after partial sleep deprivation (awake from 11 pm to 3 am). We analyzed the impact of sleep loss on transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes and used DNA microarray analyses to characterize candidate transcription-control pathways that might mediate the effects of sleep loss on leukocyte gene expression.In the morning after a night of sleep loss, monocyte production of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha was significantly greater compared with morning levels following uninterrupted sleep. In addition, sleep loss induced a more than 3-fold increase in transcription of interleukin 6 messenger RNA and a 2-fold increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha messenger RNA. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that the inflammatory response was mediated by the nuclear factor kappaB inflammatory signaling system as well as through classic hormone and growth factor response pathways.Sleep loss induces a functional alteration of the monocyte proinflammatory cytokine response. A modest amount of sleep loss also alters molecular processes that drive cellular immune activation and induce inflammatory cytokines; mapping the dynamics of sleep loss on molecular signaling pathways has implications for understanding the role of sleep in altering immune cell physiologic characteristics. Interventions that target sleep might constitute new strategies to constrain inflammation with effects on inflammatory disease risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.166.16.1756", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148230248", "source": "openalex"}

Five thousand six parents completed a web‐based online questionnaire about their children, aged from birth to 36 months. The questionnaire included items pertaining to sleep patterns, sleep environment, sleep‐related parental interventions, sleep position, and demographic information. The results reflected clear sleep‐related developmental changes including a decrease in daytime sleep and total sleep time, as well as consolidation of sleep during the night, which was manifested in a decrease in night wakings and nocturnal wakefulness. Sleep ecology and parental behaviors significantly explained a portion of the variance in the child’s sleep patterns. Parental interventions that encourage independence and self‐soothing were associated with extended and more consolidated sleep, especially in comparison to more active interactions that were associated with shorter and more fragmented sleep. These findings provide parents and professionals reference data for assessing sleep in young children. Furthermore, the results provide information on specific ecological factors that are associated with increased risk for sleep problems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00699.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006982597", "source": "openalex"}

In particular, the effect of time within the sleep period, independent of sleep stage, has not been investigated. Further, the influence of sleep on central sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is uncertain because results using the major method applicable to humans, the low frequency (LF) component of heart rate variability (HRV), have been contradictory, and because the method itself is open to criticism. Sleep and cardiac activity were measured in 14 young healthy subjects on three nights. Data was analysed in 2‐min epochs. All epochs meeting specified criteria were identified, beginning 2 h before, until 7 h after, sleep onset. Epoch values were allocated to 30‐min bins and during sleep were also classified into stage 2, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The measures of cardiac activity were heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), high frequency (HF) and LF components of HRV and pre‐ejection period (PEP). During non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep autonomic balance shifted from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance, although this appeared to be more because of a shift in parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity. Autonomic balance during REM was in general similar to wakefulness. For BP and the HF and LF components the change occurred abruptly at sleep onset and was then constant over time within each stage of sleep, indicating that any change in autonomic balance over the sleep period is a consequence of the changing distribution of sleep stages. Two variables, HR and PEP, did show time effects reflecting a circadian influence over HR and perhaps time asleep affecting PEP. While both the LF component and PEP showed changes consistent with reduced sympathetic tone during sleep, their pattern of change over time differed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00263.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077247546", "source": "openalex"}

The endogenous melatonin rhythm exhibits a close association with the endogenous circadian component of the sleep propensity rhythm. This has led to the idea that melatonin is an internal sleep ‘facilitator’ in humans, and therefore useful in the treatment of insomnia and the readjustment of circadian rhythms. There is evidence that administration of melatonin is able: (i) to induce sleep when the homeostatic drive to sleep is insufficient; (ii) to inhibit the drive for wakefulness emanating from the circadian pacemaker; and (iii) induce phase shifts in the circadian clock such that the circadian phase of increased sleep propensity occurs at a new, desired time. Therefore, exogenous melatonin can act as soporific agent, a chronohypnotic, and/or a chronobiotic. We describe the role of melatonin in the regulation of sleep, and the use of exogenous melatonin to treat sleep or circadian rhythm disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2826.2003.00989.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114144327", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep patterns and sleep problems in children are not only influenced by a large number of biological and psychologic factors but also by cultural and social factors. Little is known about similarities and differences in sleep patterns and sleep problems among children across countries. We attempted to compare sleep patterns and sleep problems among schoolchildren from 2 countries with distinctive cultural contexts: the United States and China. Methods. The data come from 2 cross-sectional surveys in 3 elementary schools of Jinan City, People's Republic of China, and 3 elementary schools from a suburban school district in southeastern New England, United States. The Chinese sample consisted of 517 elementary school children (grades 1 to 5), and the US sample consisted of 494 elementary school children (grades kindergarten through 4). We used the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) to assess children's sleep patterns and sleep problems as reported by parents. Parents of the Chinese sample completed a Chinese version of the CSHQ. Results. For children in both the US and Chinese samples, reported bedtime was delayed and sleep duration decreased with increasing age. Compared with the US children (grades 1–4), Chinese children went to bed approximately half an hour later (9:02 vs 8:27 pm) and woke up half an hour earlier (6:28 vs 6:55 am), resulting in an average sleep duration that was 1 hour less (9.25 vs 10.15 hours). Chinese children were rated significantly higher than the US children on almost all CSHQ scales, indicating more sleep problems in Chinese children. Common sleep problems observed for all children were difficulty falling asleep, having a fear of sleeping in the dark, sleep talking, restless sleep, teeth grinding during sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Shorter daily sleep duration was associated with difficulty falling asleep, struggling at bedtime, and trouble sleeping away for the US children, and with going to bed at different times and having a fear of sleeping alone for Chinese children. Short sleep duration was a main predictor of daytime sleepiness for Chinese children, whereas restless sleep and snoring predicted daytime sleepiness for the US children. Conclusions. As reported by parents, children in China went to bed later and woke up earlier and their sleep duration was 1 hour shorter than the US children. Chinese children were reported to have more sleep problems than their US counterparts. Daytime sleepiness was determined by sleep duration only for those who slept insufficiently.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1966782702", "title": "Is Sleep Duration Associated With Childhood Obesity? A Systematic Review and Meta‐analysis", "text": "Obesity is a major public health epidemic worldwide in children and adults (1,2,3,4,5,6). The prevalence and severity of childhood obesity is dramatically increasing with a corresponding increase in the prevalence of obesity-related morbidities particularly those involving obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic and cardiovascular sequelae (7). Prevention of childhood obesity is an urgent issue for public health, in particular, in many industrialized countries and some transition societies. Nutrition and physical activity (PA) have been the major research focus on obesity prevention (8,9,10,11). However, most published findings of such interventions suggested little success in preventing childhood obesity (6,12), although some that focused on dietary or/and PA approaches have showed some desirable impact on BMI status (13). Other risk factors, such as sleep, may be related to obesity, although sleep behavior has received much less attention than dietary intake and PA (14,15). Sleep, like PA and diet, plays an important role in the growth, maturation, and health of children and adolescents by allowing for the diurnal rhythm of hormones related to growth, maturation, and energy homeostasis (16). A number of biological mechanisms have been proposed to link sleep duration and obesity (17). For example, one theory posits that children with short sleep have low caloric intake and expenditure, given that sleep deprivation often leads to changes in the structure of sleep stage and results in fatigue, daytime sleepiness, somatic and cognitive problems, and low activity levels (18,19). Previous studies indicate that sleep deprivation results in changes in levels of several hormones including leptin, ghrelin, insulin, cortisol, and growth hormone (20,21,22). These hormonal changes may contribute to energy imbalance and then lead to overweight or obesity. Recently, there is increasing epidemiological evidence suggesting a link between sleep duration and obesity in children (18,23,24,25,26), adolescents (27), and adults (28,29,30). In adults, some studies indicate a negative association between sleep duration and obesity/BMI in men and a U-shaped relation between sleep duration and BMI in women (29). Several epidemiological studies have examined the association between short sleep duration and obesity in children and adolescents (18,23,24,25,26,27,31,32,33,34,35,36,37), but the reported findings are inconsistent (18,32,35,37). A recent review summarized 13 studies that examined the association between short sleep duration and obesity among children and adolescents, and recommended more sleep to prevent obesity (17). However, the review suffered from several limitations including misclassification of the design of some studies and included a study with adults as the primary age group (28). Several related previous studies were not included. Furthermore, new studies have been reported since the publication of the review. A major gap in the related literature is that to our knowledge, no meta-analyses have been conducted to examine the overall association quantitatively and to test the possible differences by population groups such as age and gender. This study aimed to assess epidemiologic evidence systematically on the relation between sleep duration and childhood obesity. We first performed a systematic review of all related studies and then conducted a meta-analysis based on cohort studies and cross-sectional studies in the general pediatric population. Systematic search. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of the PubMed database using related MeSH keywords for papers published between January 1980 and May 2007. We first conducted the search using “sleep AND obesity AND child.” The resulting number was 51, 10 of which were included in the systematic review. Further search with MeSH keywords: “sleep AND overweight AND child” yielded 42 papers from which few additional studies were selected. We also searched with “sleep AND obesity” and found 54 references, and found 46 references using “sleep AND overweight.” Furthermore, we tried searching “paediatric” or “pediatric” as an MeSH keyword, but no matching references were found. Then, we checked articles using the “related article” option of PubMed. In addition, studies identified in the course of reading or brought to our attention by colleagues and experts consulted were checked. These yielded a total of 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria and were included in our systematic review; of which 11 (2 cohort studies and 9 cross-sectional studies) reported odds ratio (OR), relative risk or hazard ratio, and were included in our meta-analysis. Study eligibility criteria and data extraction Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (i) Observational studies, including cohort, randomized trial, cross-sectional, and case–control studies. Only those with a measure of OR (or relative risk or hazard ratio) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were included in our meta-analysis; (ii) Enrolled children aged from 0 to 18 years; (iii) Included >100 subjects; and (iv) Had a measure of overweight/obesity using BMI. We chose to restrict our meta-analysis to those studies with sample size >100 subjects considering the studies' statistical power in detecting an association and the representativeness of their findings. Note that only one study with 60 children aged 10–16 years from a hospital-based pediatric weight-management clinic and 22 healthy controls was excluded, which found that the overweight children had shorter sleep time than their non-overweight counterparts (38). All the other studies were excluded because they did not meet our other inclusion criteria. Multiple studies based on the same cohort with different age group were also included. In our present review, 2 cross-sectional studies (age group: 3–4 and 6–7 years) based on the Toyama Cohort Study were included (18,24). Using a standardized data extraction form, we extracted and tabulated related data. Information extracted included first author's name, year of publication, country of data collection, study design, and sample characteristics. A dataset based on this data extraction was created using a spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft, 2003). Classification of outcome and exposure There are different standards to define childhood overweight and obesity in different population groups. Most of the studies followed the International Obesity Task Force's recommended age- and sex-specific BMI cutoff points (39) which were linked to adult cutoff points: overweight and obesity (equal to adult criterion, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) (18,24,31,33,35,37). Studies conducted in the United States used the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Growth Chart 85th and 95th percentile to define overweight or obesity, respectively (27,32,40). All of included studies reported measured BMI. As there are age-related shifts in children's sleep needs and the circadian timing of sleep, particularly as children grow older (40,41,42), in our meta-analysis we used different recommended sleep duration for different age groups based on previous research in which ideal sleep time or sleep requirement time was provided (Table 1). The standardized sleep duration reference was defined as ≥11 h for children aged <5 years (24,34). For children between 5 and 10 years of age, the sleep duration reference was treated as ≥10 h (18,43,44). As previous studies indicate that sleep time in kindergarten children is similar to that in elementary schoolchildren (43), thus we used one reference value for the 5- to 10-year-old. The corresponding figure was ≥9 h for children aged ≥10 years (40,42,45,46). In our meta-analysis, we considered children's sleep duration as a multi-level exposure variable classified as less than the recommended sleep time contrasted with the recommended level of sleep duration (e.g., <9 h for children aged ≥10 years). Data analysis In our meta-analysis, OR/relative risk/hazard ratio was used as the primary measure of the association between sleep duration and overweight/obesity. First, on the basis of each study's own reference group of sleep duration, we pooled the ORs for short sleep duration group. For example, a study might report two ORs for sleep duration of <9 h and 9–10 h when ≥10 h of sleep duration is treated as a reference group. Using the detailed information from that study, we pooled the ORs of <9 h and 9–10 h, and used the pooled OR to determine the risk for <10 h of sleep. Next, we created a database by assigning ORs extracted from each study to their corresponding (or matched) sleep duration categories according to the ranges or averages of the reported sleep duration categories. If one study used shorter sleep duration as a reference instead of the standardized sleep duration, we chose the suitable sleep duration group as reference and recalculated the OR and 95% CI. We applied fixed- and random-effects models to estimate the pooled ORs and 95% CI of overweight/obesity for each sleep duration category compared with reference group. The pooled OR was obtained by averaging the natural logarithm of ORs, weighted by the inverse of their respective variances (47). DerSimonian and Laird's method was used in the random-effects model to further incorporate between-study variability (48). If heterogeneity was significant (P < 0.05), we used the random-effects models; otherwise, results from fixed-effects models were reported. In stratified meta-analyses, we examined potential sources of heterogeneity, including gender, study design, age group (<10 years vs. ≥10 years), BMI status (combined overweight/obesity vs. obesity), and sleep duration measure. We further conducted trend test between the three sleep duration categories. We used a non-parametric graphical method to assess linear trend in the Loge(OR) point estimates, followed by a bivariate linear regression analysis in which sleep category was entered as an ordinal variable predicting Loge(OR). The P value of the regression coefficient was presented and a significant P value reflected a linear trend. Furthermore, treating sleep duration as a continuous variable, we estimated the OR and 95% CI associated with a 1 h increase in sleep using weighted meta-regression. The regression was weighted by the inverse variance of the Loge(OR) for each category, and we used the average of each sleep duration category. In addition, we assessed publication bias using the Begg's funnel plots. The ORs were plotted on a logarithmic scale against their corresponding s.e. for each study (49,50). We also assessed publication bias by two formal tests, the Begg-adjusted rank correlation test, and the Egger's regression asymmetry test. Our meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) (51). Statistical significance was set at type I error of P ≤ 0.05. Systematic review. Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics and findings of 17 eligible observational studies, including 3 cohort studies, 12 cross-sectional studies, and 2 case–control studies. Of these studies, 6 were conducted in the United States, 5 were from Europe (France, Germany, Portugal, UK), 4 from Asia (Japan, China: Hong Kong, Taiwan), and 2 from other (Australia and Canada). The number of subjects included in these studies varied considerably, ranging from 150 to 8,941, though most were over 1,000. Despite the common use of self-reported questionnaire to assess sleep duration, one of our selected studies used wrist actigraphy (27), while another used both self-reported questionnaire and time-diary as measures of sleep duration (40). Several important studies presented in Table 2 are worth highlighting as they provide strong evidence of the association between short sleep duration and childhood obesity. A prospective cohort study of 7,758 children aged 3 years at baseline conducted in the UK found that short sleep duration (<10.5 h) at age three was associated with obesity at age seven (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.89) (34). Early life shortness of sleep seems to be associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity. Sekine et al. found a clear dose–response relationship between sleep and obesity in Japanese children aged 6–7 years (18,24). Compared with sleep durations of 10 h or more, the adjusted OR was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.08, 2.14) for 9–10 h of sleep, 1.89 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.73) for 8–9 h, and 2.87 (95% CI: 1.61, 5.05) for <8 h of sleep, after adjustment for age, gender, PA, screen time, parental obesity, and other lifestyle factors (18). This association was stronger in boys than in girls. Gender difference seems to exist in the association between sleep duration and childhood obesity. Data on 6,324 Australian children aged 7–15 years found an inverse relationship between sleep and overweight in boys, but not in girls (37). For boys reporting ≤8 h of sleep, they had 3.1 times greater odds of overweight than those reporting ≥10 h of sleep (37). Another cohort study based on a nationally representative sample of 2,281 children aged 3–12 years at baseline in the United States found that young children aged 3–8 years with shorter sleep duration were more likely to be overweight after 5 years of follow-up (52). However, no similar results were found in children aged 8–13 years (52). In general, studies of children aged <10 years found an inverse association between sleep duration and overweight/obesity on the basis of parental report of sleep duration (18,23,24,25,26,33,34,35,40,53). Findings from studies in adolescents are somewhat inconsistent. In fact, although most studies of adolescents gave significant results in the expected direction (15,27,31,32,36), some reported no association among girls (32,37). Meta-analysis. Figure 1 shows the ORs and 95% CIs from each individual study and the pooled random-effects estimate of OR and 95% CI for the association between each study's own short sleep duration and overweight/obesity. The pooled OR and 95% CI, using each study's specific criterion for short sleep duration, was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.98) for total general pediatric population. : The association between short sleep duration and risk for overweight/obesity: Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Shorter vs. longer sleep duration (based on individual study's criteria); Test for heterogeneity: Q = 174.9, P < 0.001; pooled OR and 95% CI were based on random-effects model. Our analysis assessing the dose–response relationship between sleep duration and obesity was reported in Figure 2 and Table 3. Overall, our findings did not show a clear dose–response relationship, though it existed in some groups. Compared with children having recommended sleep duration, those with much shorter sleep duration had significantly higher risk of overweight/obesity (OR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.10). The shortest sleep duration had much higher risk of overweight/obesity (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.15, 3.20). A marginally significant dose–response relationship was found in the association between sleep duration categories and overweight/obesity (trend test: P = 0.087), and among young children aged <10 years (trend test: P = 0.094). We also tested the differences by gender, BMI status, and age group (Table 3). The association between shorter vs. longer sleep duration (based on individual studies' own criteria) and overweight/obesity was stronger in boys than in girls (OR = 2.50 (1.88, 3.34) vs. 1.24 (1.07, 1.45), P < 0.001), but we found no significant differences by age group or BMI status measurement (i.e., combined overweight/obesity vs. obesity). Finally, we treated sleep duration as a continuous variable through meta-regression analysis. For each 1 h unit increase in sleep duration, the pooled OR for overweight/obesity was 0.91 (0.84, 1.00), P = 0.044. : Test the dose–response association between different short sleep duration categories and overweight/obesity: Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). (a) Shorter vs. suggested sleep duration. Test for heterogeneity: Q = 3,043.8, P < 0.001; pooled OR and 95% CI were based on random-effects model. (b) Much shorter vs. suggested sleep duration. Test for heterogeneity: Q = 231.4, P < 0.001; pooled OR and 95% CI were based on random-effects model. (c) Shortest vs. suggested sleep duration. Test for heterogeneity: Q = 10.8, P = 0.028; pooled OR and 95% CI were based on random-effects model. See Table 1 for the age-specific cut points of the sleep duration categories; Pooled OR and 95% CI were based on random-effects model when tests for heterogeneity were significant (P < 0.05), and based on fixed-effects models when the tests were insignificant (P ≥ 0.05). Our analysis shows no publication bias. The Begg's funnel plot (Figure 3) revealed slightly more data points below the horizontal line, but neither Begg's adjusted rank correlation test nor Egger's regression asymmetry test was significant (P = 0.139 and P = 0.903, respectively). : Assessment of publication bias: funnel plot regarding odds ratio (OR) on a log scale on its s.e. Horizontal lines indicate the random-effects pooled estimates of ORs and 95% CIs; sloping lines represent the expected 95% CIs for a given s.e., assuming heterogeneity between studies. Neither the Begg's adjusted rank correlation tests nor the Egger's regression asymmetry test is significant (P = 0.139, P = 0.903, respectively). Sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly prevalent in both adults and children (54). The decline in sleep duration has paralleled a dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity (54). Our meta-analysis, based on previous epidemiologic studies in the general pediatric populations in different countries, provides strong evidence to help quantify the relationship between sleep duration and overweight/obesity in children and adolescents. First, we found that children with shorter sleep duration had a 58% (pooled OR = 1.58 (1.26, 1.98)) higher risk for overweight or obesity, and children with shortest sleep duration had an even higher risk (92%) when compared with children having longer sleep duration. For each hour increase in sleep, the risk of overweight/obesity was reduced on average by 9% (pooled OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.00). Second, our meta-analysis indicates that a significant linear dose–response relationship can be found only in young children (<10-year-old) or for combined overweight and obesity, but not for children as a whole group. For example, a large cross-sectional study of 8,274 children aged 6–7 years in Japan reported a clear dose–response relationship between short sleep duration and childhood obesity, using the International Obesity Task Force criterion of overweight/obesity (18). Third, our meta-analysis supports a significant gender difference in the association between sleep and obesity, as boys had a stronger inverse association than girls (OR = 2.50 vs. 1.24), although findings of previous studies are inconsistent. In the Toyama Birth Cohort Study of 8,274 children aged 6–7 years, the association between sleep duration and overweight and obesity was stronger in boys than in girls (18), the adjusted OR with 9–10 h of sleep was 2.28 vs. 1.49 when compared with ≥10 h of sleep; for 8–9 h, were 3.45 vs. 1.89 and 5.49 vs. 2.87 for <8 h, respectively. Data of 4,486 adolescents from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health indicated that every hour increase in sleep was associated with a 10% reduction in risk of overweight in boys, but no effect in girls (32). Similarly, another study of 6,324 Australian children aged 7–15 years found an inverse relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity in boys, but not in girls (37). Most other related studies did not report a gender difference. The explanation for the apparent gender difference remains unclear. Some researchers thought that from an evolutionary perspective, girls may be more resilient to environmental stressors and need greater sleep deprivation to be affected than boys (37,55). Further studies are needed to clarify the gender difference. All the studies included in our meta-analysis used questionnaires as the main tool to assess sleep duration, although various measures of sleep duration were used in other studies we reviewed. Sleep logs or time-diaries ask participants to record the exact time when they turn off the lights to try to fall asleep and when they wake up in the morning. Wrist actigraphy has not been used extensively in larger population-based studies as it is relatively expensive. A study of high school students compared results from questionnaires with both sleep log and actigraphy. Moderate correlations were found between self-reported questionnaire and sleep logs (r = 0.61) and between self-report questionnaire and actigraphy (r = 0.53) for weeknights (56). Studies in younger children aged 3–10 all used parental report of sleep duration, a measure whose validity has not been well established (18,23,24,25,26,34,35). Validation of self-reported questionnaires used to assess sleep duration was conducted in at least one study using a nationally representative sample of 1,546 adolescents. The two measures of sleep were not strongly correlated and self-reported sleep duration revealed a stronger association with obesity (40). It is possible that the 24-h diary is not representative of usual sleep behavior, while questionnaire may have higher construct validity. In general, previous research shows that long sleep duration is associated with lower risk of childhood obesity, which is consistent with the findings of our meta-analysis. For example, a cohort study of 150 US children from birth to 9.5 years of age reported that children's sleep time at age 3–4 years was negatively related to overweight at age 9.5 years old (26). Another cohort study of 2,281 US children aged 3–12 years found that compared to children with 9–10 h of sleep, those with longer sleep (≥11 h) at baseline had lower risk for overweight at the 5-year follow-up (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.74–0.95) (52). A case–control study in Hong Kong also indicated that children with sleep ≥11 h were less likely to be overweight (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.11–0.87) compared to those with sleep <9 h (53). Sleep deprivation may influence the development of obesity through several possible biological pathways including increased sympathetic activity, elevated cortisol and ghrelin levels, decreased leptin and growth hormone, and/or impaired glucose tolerance (15,20,22). Hormonal changes may contribute to selection of calorie-dense food, excessive food intake, changes in energy expenditure, and insulin resistance (17). Other potential mechanisms are effects of sleep deprivation on basal metabolic rate, thermic effect of food and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (17). Laboratory studies in adults have revealed a potential mechanism for the association between sleep deprivation and weight gain (20,21,57). Findings of our meta-analysis based on epidemiologic evidence provide more supportive data on the proposed biological mechanism. Our meta-analysis has some limitations, which are common to these types of studies, such as potential selection bias and failure to adjust for some potential confounders. Differences in study population, assessment of covariates and exposure variables, and classification of overweight/obesity may result in heterogeneity across studies and thus affect the pooled estimates. Owing to the fact that no intervention studies have been available, our meta-analysis was conducted mainly based on cross-sectional studies and could not prove causality. Nevertheless, the bias from individual studies usually tends to be relatively small and not substantially influence the overall estimates in a meta-analysis as more studies being included. These cohort studies included in our systematic review and meta-analysis show a clear relationship between short sleep duration in early life and increased risk of obesity in childhood. In addition, it is likely that there are considerable measurement errors in quantifying sleep duration using the survey instruments in these epidemiological studies, as well as difficulties modeling sleep duration needs across age. Our meta-analysis established a dose–response relationship based on previous studies which included populations with various ages and sleep needs. Sleep duration needs may vary non-linearly across childhood and much information may have been lost in the original study analyses which did not consider the complex non-linear age associations as well as other potential confounders. In turn, these may affect our findings. As the observed associations were remarkably consistent across most of reviewed studies, the likelihood that these findings are solely due to selective publication seems unlikely. Furthermore, most selected studies lacked mental health status such as depression as a potential confounder, which is well known to affect sleep (58). Most had fairly crude measurements of socioeconomic status and PA, and in addition to depression, other behavioral factors may influence both sleep and body weight. The validity of self- or proxy-reported sleep duration questionnaire, a primary measure of sleep used in epidemiologic studies, needs to be assessed. Further longitudinal studies are needed to determine the causality. Laboratory research is necessary to confirm the biological mechanisms in pediatric population. In conclusion, our meta-analysis shows a clear association between short sleep duration and increased risk of childhood obesity based on previous studies conducted in diverse populations. Sleep may be an important factor to consider in the prevention of childhood obesity. The prevalence of childhood obesity may be decreased by increasing sleep duration, independent of other risk factors for childhood obesity. Our findings have some important public health implications for fighting the growing childhood obesity epidemic. A combination of strategies targeting both earlier bedtime and later wake time to increase sleep duration may help prevent childhood obesity. Desirable sleep behaviors may represent an important and relatively low-cost strategy to reduce childhood obesity. Future randomized intervention trials are needed to test the effectiveness of sleep extension for obesity prevention among children and adolescents. In addition to healthy diet and adequate PA, sleep should be considered in future comprehensive childhood obesity intervention studies. The authors declared no conflict of interest.

Since spectral analysis is suited for the identification of cyclical variations and detrended fluctuation analysis can analyze the scaling behavior and detect long-range correlations, we compared the results of both complementary techniques in 14 healthy subjects, 33 patients with moderate, and 31 patients with severe sleep apnea. The spectral parameters VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF confirmed increasing parasympathetic activity from wakefulness and REM over light sleep to deep sleep, which is reduced in patients with sleep apnea. Discriminance analysis was used on a person and sleep stage basis to determine the best method for the separation of sleep stages and sleep apnea severity. Using spectral parameters 69.7% of the apnea severity assignments and 54.6% of the sleep stage assignments were correct, while using scaling analysis these numbers increased to 74.4% and 85.0%, respectively.

However, the potential behavioral impact of undiagnosed sleep disorders is not known. We sought to determine whether children with higher levels of inattention and hyperactivity more frequently have symptoms of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). We surveyed parents of 2–18-year-old patients at a child psychiatry clinic (n = 70) and a general pediatrics clinic (n = 73) to assess the children's behavior, snoring, complaints of restless legs at night, and daytime sleepiness. A validated pediatric sleep questionnaire provided the explanatory variables, and a scale for inattention and hyperactivity, derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), provided the dependent variable. Habitual snoring was more frequent (33%) among children who carried a diagnosis of ADHD than among the other children at the psychiatry or general pediatric clinics (11 and 9%, respectively, chi-square test, p = 0.01). Snoring scores, derived from six snoring- and SRBD-related question items, were associated with higher levels of inattention and hyperactivity. The complaint of restless legs and a composite score for daytime sleepiness showed some evidence, though less consistent, of an association with inattention and hyperactivity. The association of snoring with inattention and hyperactivity suggests that SRBDs and perhaps other sleep disorders could be a cause of inattention and hyperactivity in some children. If a causal effect is present, our data suggest that 81% of habitually snoring children who have ADHD—25% of all children with ADHD—could have their ADHD eliminated if their habitual snoring and any associated SRBD were effectively treated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.12.1185", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1774217388", "source": "openalex"}

Sleeping <7 hours per night is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, stroke, frequent mental distress, and all-cause mortality (2-4). Insufficient sleep impairs cognitive performance, which can increase the likelihood of motor vehicle and other transportation accidents, industrial accidents, medical errors, and loss of work productivity that could affect the wider community (5). CDC analyzed data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to determine the prevalence of a healthy sleep duration (≥ 7 hours) among 444,306 adult respondents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. A total of 65.2% of respondents reported a healthy sleep duration; the age-adjusted prevalence of healthy sleep was lower among non-Hispanic blacks, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and multiracial respondents, compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and Asians. State-based estimates of healthy sleep duration prevalence ranged from 56.1% in Hawaii to 71.6% in South Dakota. Geographic clustering of the lowest prevalence of healthy sleep duration was observed in the southeastern United States and in states along the Appalachian Mountains, and the highest prevalence was observed in the Great Plains states. More than one third of U.S. respondents reported typically sleeping <7 hours in a 24-hour period, suggesting an ongoing need for public awareness and public education about sleep health; worksite shift policies that ensure healthy sleep duration for shift workers, particularly medical professionals, emergency response personnel, and transportation industry personnel; and opportunities for health care providers to discuss the importance of healthy sleep duration with patients and address reasons for poor sleep health.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6506a1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2281809314", "source": "openalex"}

This article examines whether sleep duration and efficiency in the weeks preceding viral exposure are associated with cold susceptibility. <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 153 healthy men and women (age range, 21-55 years) volunteered to participate in the study. For 14 consecutive days, they reported their sleep duration and sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed actually asleep) for the previous night and whether they felt rested. Average scores for each sleep variable were calculated over the 14-day baseline. Subsequently, participants were quarantined, administered nasal drops containing a rhinovirus, and monitored for the development of a clinical cold (infection in the presence of objective signs of illness) on the day before and for 5 days after exposure. <h3>Results</h3> There was a graded association with average sleep duration: participants with less than 7 hours of sleep were 2.94 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-7.30) more likely to develop a cold than those with 8 hours or more of sleep. The association with sleep efficiency was also graded: participants with less than 92% efficiency were 5.50 times (95% CI, 2.08-14.48) more likely to develop a cold than those with 98% or more efficiency. These relationships could not be explained by differences in prechallenge virus-specific antibody titers, demographics, season of the year, body mass, socioeconomic status, psychological variables, or health practices. The percentage of days feeling rested was not associated with colds. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration in the weeks preceding exposure to a rhinovirus were associated with lower resistance to illness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2008.505", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097663158", "source": "openalex"}

Our design used exact matching on sex and ethnicity, frequency matching on age, and statistical control for craniofacial size and visceral neck fat. The data support our a priori hypotheses that the volume of the soft tissue structures surrounding the upper airway is enlarged in patients with sleep apnea and that this enlargement is a significant risk factor for sleep apnea. After covariate adjustments the volume of the lateral pharyngeal walls (p < 0.0001), tongue (p < 0.0001), and total soft tissue (p < 0.0001) was significantly larger in subjects with sleep apnea than in normal subjects. These data also demonstrated, after covariate adjustments, significantly increased risk of sleep apnea the larger the volume of the tongue, lateral pharyngeal walls, and total soft tissue: (1) total lateral pharyngeal wall (odds ratio [OR], 6.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62–17.14); (2) total tongue (OR, 4.66; 95% CI, 2.31–10.95); and (3) total soft tissue (OR, 6.95; 95% CI, 3.08–19.11). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis the volume of the tongue and lateral walls was shown to independently increase the risk of sleep apnea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200208-866oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155589957", "source": "openalex"}

Each subject underwent a laboratory-adaptation session before entering the sleep-deprivation phase of the study.A total of 21 healthy adults (aged 21-38 years) completed the experiment.Subjects came to the laboratory 3 times at intervals of at least 2 weeks. During each laboratory session, they underwent neurobehavioral testing every 2 hours during 36 hours of total sleep deprivation, which was preceded by baseline sleep and followed by recovery sleep. In the week prior to each sleep-deprivation session and on the baseline night in the laboratory, subjects were required to either restrict their sleep to 6 hours per day (prior sleep restriction condition) or to extend their time in bed to 12 hours per day (prior sleep extension condition), so as to experimentally manipulate sleep history (in randomized counterbalanced order).There was strong evidence that interindividual differences in neurobehavioral deficits during sleep deprivation were systematic and trait-like. The magnitude of interindividual variability was substantial relative to the magnitude of the effect of prior sleep restriction (which on average involved a reduction of 4.1 hours sleep per day, compared to prior sleep extension, for 7 days). Overall, interindividual differences were not explained by subjects' baseline functioning or a variety of other potential predictors. Interindividual variability clustered on 3 distinct neurobehavioral dimensions: self-evaluation of sleepiness, fatigue, and mood; cognitive processing capability; and behavioral alertness as measured by sustained attention performance.Neurobehavioral deficits from sleep loss varied significantly among individuals and were stable within individuals. Interindividual differences in neurobehavioral responses to sleep deprivation were not merely a consequence of variations in sleep history. Rather, they involved trait-like differential vulnerability to impairment from sleep loss, for which neurobiologic correlates have yet to be discovered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/27.3.423", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1568045382", "source": "openalex"}

Two undisturbed recovery nights followed disruption nights. On disruption nights, subjects were awakened with an audiometer and signaled the awakening by subjective rating of sleep state or button push response. The disruption procedure resulted in severely fragmented sleep with only very small amounts of slow-wave and REM sleep. Total sleep time was reduced by approximately 1 h on each night. Arousal threshold increased 56 dB across the disruption nights. Following disruption, subjects performed more poorly and rated themselves sleepier than on baseline. The level of decline was similar to that seen after periods of total sleep loss of 40-64 h. Recovery sleep was also similar to that seen after total sleep loss. It was concluded that periodic disruption of sleep, perhaps by destroying sleep continuity, quickly results in impaired function. These data may help explain function loss in severe sleep apneics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/8.1.11", "url": "https://openalex.org/W37777227", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2016235882", "title": "Sleep in Elite Athletes and Nutritional Interventions to Enhance Sleep", "text": "Sleep has numerous important physiological and cognitive functions that may be particularly important to elite athletes. Recent evidence, as well as anecdotal information, suggests that athletes may experience a reduced quality and/or quantity of sleep. Sleep deprivation can have significant effects on athletic performance, especially submaximal, prolonged exercise. Compromised sleep may also influence learning, memory, cognition, pain perception, immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, changes in glucose metabolism and neuroendocrine function as a result of chronic, partial sleep deprivation may result in alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, appetite, food intake and protein synthesis. These factors can ultimately have a negative influence on an athlete's nutritional, metabolic and endocrine status and hence potentially reduce athletic performance. Research has identified a number of neurotransmitters associated with the sleep–wake cycle. These include serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone, cholinergic, galanin, noradrenaline, and histamine. Therefore, nutritional interventions that may act on these neurotransmitters in the brain may also influence sleep. Carbohydrate, tryptophan, valerian, melatonin and other nutritional interventions have been investigated as possible sleep inducers and represent promising potential interventions. In this review, the factors influencing sleep quality and quantity in athletic populations are examined and the potential impact of nutritional interventions is considered. While there is some research investigating the effects of nutritional interventions on sleep, future research may highlight the importance of nutritional and dietary interventions to enhance sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-014-0147-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016235882", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, we compared the driving records of 29 patients with obstructive sleep apnea with those of 35 subjects without sleep apnea. The patients with sleep apnea had a sevenfold greater rate of automobile accidents than did the subjects without apnea (p < 0.01). The percentage of persons with one or more accidents was also greater in the patients with apnea than in the control subjects without apnea (31% versus 6%, p < 0.01). The percentage of persons having one or more accidents in which they were at fault was also greater in the patients with apnea than in the control subjects (24% versus 3%, p < 0.02). The automobile accident rate of the patients with sleep apnea was 2.6 times the accident rate of all licensed drivers in the state of Virginia (p < 0.02). In addition, 24% of patients with sleep apnea reported falling asleep at least once per week while driving. We conclude that patients with obstructive sleep apnea have a significantly higher frequency of auto accidents than do subjects without apnea.

The sample was further divided into adolescents (13-18 years, N = 171), young adults (19-29 years, N = 293), middle-aged adults (30-45 years, N = 469), and older adults (46-64 years, N = 565) to contrast different generations' technology use. Participants answered a 47-item semi-structured survey, including questions about their sleep habits, and the presence and use of technology in the hour before bed in the past 2 weeks.Nine of 10 Americans reported using a technological device in the hour before bed (e.g., TVs the most popular; 60%). However, those under 30 years of age were more likely to use cell phones (72% of adolescents, 67% of young adults) than those over 30 years (36% of middle-aged, and 16% of older adults). Young adults' sleep patterns were significantly later than other age groups on both weekdays and weekend nights. Unlike passive technological devices (e.g., TV, mp3 music players), the more interactive technological devices (i.e., computers/laptops, cell phones, video game consoles) used in the hour before bed, the more likely difficulties falling asleep (β = 9.4, p < 0.0001) and unrefreshing sleep (β = 6.4, p < 0.04) were reported.Technology use near bedtime is extremely prevalent in the United States.

Design: A cross-sectional study of blood pressure during wakefulness and sleep among participants with and without sleep-disordered breathing. Setting: Community-based study. Participants: 147 men and women, aged 30 to 60 years, selected from Wisconsin State employees enrolled in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, an ongoing, prospective, epidemiologic study of sleep-disordered breathing. Measurements: Sleep and medical history interview, nocturnal polysomnography, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in all participants. Results: Mean blood pressures were significantly higher among participants with sleep apnea (≥ 5 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) compared with those without (131/80 ±1.7/1.1 mm Hg compared with 122/75 ±1.9/1.2 mm Hg during wakefulness and 113/66 ±1.8/1.1 mm Hg compared with 104/62 ±2/1.3 mm Hg during sleep, respectively; P < 0.05). The variability of the blood pressure during sleep was significantly greater in participants with sleep apnea or a history of snoring compared with those without (P < 0.05). After controlling for obesity, age, and sex, sleep apnea was significantly associated with hypertension in a dose-response fashion, with odds ratios ranging from 2.0 for 5 apneic or hypopneic episodes per hour of sleep to 5.0 for 25 apneic or hypopneic episodes.

The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between self-reported sleep quality and sleep hygiene in Italian and American adolescents and to assess whether sleep-hygiene practices mediate the relationship between culture and sleep quality. Methods. Two nonprobability samples were collected from public schools in Rome, Italy, and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Students completed the following self-report measures: Adolescent Sleep-Wake Scale, Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale, Pubertal Developmental Scale, and Morningness/Eveningness Scale. Results. The final sample included 776 Italian and 572 American adolescents 12 to 17 years old. Italian adolescents reported much better sleep hygiene and substantially better sleep quality than American adolescents. A moderate-to-strong linear relationship was found between sleep hygiene and sleep quality in both samples. Separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed on both samples. Demographic and individual characteristics explained a significant proportion of the variance in sleep quality (Italians: 18%; Americans: 25%), and the addition of sleep-hygiene domains explained significantly more variance in sleep quality (Italians: 17%; Americans: 16%). A final hierarchical multiple regression analysis with both samples combined showed that culture (Italy versus United States) only explained 0.8% of the variance in sleep quality after controlling for sleep hygiene and all other variables. Conclusions. Cross-cultural differences in sleep quality, for the most part, were due to differences in sleep-hygiene practices. Sleep hygiene is an important predictor of sleep quality in Italian and American adolescents, thus supporting the implementation and evaluation of educational programs on good sleep-hygiene practices.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2004-0815h", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010981202", "source": "openalex"}

Insufficient sleep is a pervasive and prominent problem in the modern 24-h society. A considerable body of evidence suggests that insufficient sleep causes hosts of adverse medical and mental dysfunctions. An extensive literature search was done in all the major databases for \"insufficient sleep\" and \"public health implications\" in this review. Globally, insufficient sleep is prevalent across various age groups, considered to be a public health epidemic that is often unrecognized, under-reported, and that has rather high economic costs. This paper addresses a brief overview on insufficient sleep, causes, and consequences, and how it adds to the existing burden of diseases. Insufficient sleep leads to the derailment of body systems, leading to increased incidences of cardiovascular morbidity, increased chances of diabetes mellitus, obesity, derailment of cognitive functions, vehicular accidents, and increased accidents at workplaces. The increased usage of smart phones and electronic devices is worsening the epidemic. Adolescents with insufficient sleep are likely to be overweight and may suffer from depressive symptoms. The paper concludes by emphasizing sleep quality assessments as an important early risk indicator, thereby reducing the incidence of a wide spectrum of morbidities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare7010001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2904772173", "source": "openalex"}

To investigate variability in performance as a function of sleep deprivation, n = 13 subjects were tested every 2 hours on a 10-minute, sustained-attention, psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) throughout 88 hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD condition), and compared to a control group of n = 15 subjects who were permitted a 2-hour nap every 12 hours (NAP condition) throughout the 88-hour period. PVT reaction time means and standard deviations increased markedly among subjects and within each individual subject in the TSD condition relative to the NAP condition. TSD subjects also had increasingly greater performance variability as a function of time on task after 18 hours of wakefulness. During sleep deprivation, variability in PVT performance reflected a combination of normal timely responses, errors of omission (i.e., lapses), and errors of commission (i.e., responding when no stimulus was present). Errors of omission and errors of commission were highly intercorrelated across deprivation in the TSD condition (r = 0.85, p = 0.0001), suggesting that performance instability is more likely to include compensatory effort than a lack of motivation. The marked increases in PVT performance variability as sleep loss continued supports the \"state instability\" hypothesis, which posits that performance during sleep deprivation is increasingly variable due to the influence of sleep initiating mechanisms on the endogenous capacity to maintain attention and alertness, thereby creating an unstable state that fluctuates within seconds and that cannot be characterized as either fully awake or asleep.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1586038694", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2100034063", "title": "Vehicle accidents related to sleep: a review.", "text": "Falling asleep while driving accounts for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents under monotonous driving conditions. Many of these accidents are related to work--for example, drivers of lorries, goods vehicles, and company cars. Time of day (circadian) effects are profound, with sleepiness being particularly evident during night shift work, and driving home afterwards. Circadian factors are as important in determining driver sleepiness as is the duration of the drive, but only duration of the drive is built into legislation protecting professional drivers. Older drivers are also vulnerable to sleepiness in the mid-afternoon. Possible pathological causes of driver sleepiness are discussed, but there is little evidence that this factor contributes greatly to the accident statistics. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning. Drivers falling asleep are unlikely to recollect having done so, but will be aware of the precursory state of increasing sleepiness; probably reaching a state of fighting off sleep before an accident. Self awareness of sleepiness is a better method for alerting the driver than automatic sleepiness detectors in the vehicle. None of these have been proved to be reliable and most have shortcomings. Putative counter measures to sleepiness, adopted during continued driving (cold air, use of car radio) are only effective for a short time. The only safe counter measure to driver sleepiness, particularly when the driver reaches the stage of fighting sleep, is to stop driving, and--for example, take a 30 minute break encompassing a short (&lt; 15 minute) nap or coffee (about 150 mg caffeine), which are very effective particularly if taken together. Exercise is of little use. CONCLUSIONS: More education of employers and employees is needed about planning journeys, the dangers of driving while sleepy, and driving at vulnerable times of the day.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/oem.56.5.289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100034063", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of the present study is to characterize reciprocal relationships between sleep and work. Specifically, we examined how sleep impacts work performance and how work affects sleep in individuals not at-risk for a sleep disorder; assessed work performance outcomes for individuals at-risk for sleep disorders, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS); and characterized work performance impairments in shift workers (SW) at-risk for shift work sleep disorders relative to SW and day workers. One-thousand Americans who work 30 h per week or more were asked questions about employment, work performance and sleep in the National Sleep Foundation's 2008 Sleep in America telephone poll. Long work hours were associated with shorter sleep times, and shorter sleep times were associated with more work impairments. Thirty-seven percent of respondents were classified as at-risk for any sleep disorder. These individuals had more negative work outcomes as compared with those not at-risk for a sleep disorder. Presenteeism was a significant problem for individuals with insomnia symptoms, OSA and RLS as compared with respondents not at-risk.

Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets", "text": "Rationale: The pathophysiologic causes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) likely vary among patients but have not been well characterized.Objectives: To define carefully the proportion of key anatomic and nonanatomic contributions in a relatively large cohort of patients with OSA and control subjects to identify pathophysiologic targets for future novel therapies for OSA.Methods: Seventy-five men and women with and without OSA aged 20–65 years were studied on three separate nights. Initially, the apnea-hypopnea index was determined by polysomnography followed by determination of anatomic (passive critical closing pressure of the upper airway [Pcrit]) and nonanatomic (genioglossus muscle responsiveness, arousal threshold, and respiratory control stability; loop gain) contributions to OSA.Measurements and Main Results: Pathophysiologic traits varied substantially among participants. A total of 36% of patients with OSA had minimal genioglossus muscle responsiveness during sleep, 37% had a low arousal threshold, and 36% had high loop gain. A total of 28% had multiple nonanatomic features. Although overall the upper airway was more collapsible in patients with OSA (Pcrit, 0.3 [−1.5 to 1.9] vs. −6.2 [−12.4 to −3.6] cm H2O; P <0.01), 19% had a relatively noncollapsible upper airway similar to many of the control subjects (Pcrit, −2 to −5 cm H2O). In these patients, loop gain was almost twice as high as patients with a Pcrit greater than −2 cm H2O (−5.9 [−8.8 to −4.5] vs. −3.2 [−4.8 to −2.4] dimensionless; P = 0.01). A three-point scale for weighting the relative contribution of the traits is proposed. It suggests that nonanatomic features play an important role in 56% of patients with OSA.Conclusions: This study confirms that OSA is a heterogeneous disorder. Although Pcrit-anatomy is an important determinant, abnormalities in nonanatomic traits are also present in most patients with OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201303-0448oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148687419", "source": "openalex"}

Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into 3 categories: ≥ 6 h sleep (top 50% of the sample); 5-6 h (approximately the third quartile of the sample); and ≤ 5 h (approximately the bottom quartile of the sample). Hypertension was defined based either on blood pressure measures or treatment. We controlled for age, race, sex, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, depression, sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and sampling weight. Compared to the normal sleeping and >6 h sleep duration group, the highest risk of hypertension was in insomnia with <5 h sleep duration group (OR [95% CI] 5.1 [2.2, 11.8]), and the second highest in insomnia who slept 5-6 hours (OR 3.5 [1.6, 7.9] P < 0.01). The risk for hypertension was significantly higher, but of lesser magnitude, in poor sleepers with short sleep duration. Insomnia with short sleep duration is associated with increased risk of hypertension, to a degree comparable to that of other common sleep disorders, e.g., SDB. Objective sleep duration may predict the severity of chronic insomnia a prevalent condition whose medical impact has been apparently underestimated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/32.4.491", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1770765878", "source": "openalex"}

We present the technique of sleep nasendoscopy which allows direct visualization of the site or sites of obstruction in a sleeping patient. Our study has shown that there are patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in whom the only site of pharyngeal obstruction is at the velopharynx. These patients should do well with the relatively simple procedure of UVPP. This is not true for many other OSAS patients in whom we found that obstruction was multisegmental.

Both these complaints are related to RLS. The prevalence of RLS-related symptoms increased linearly with age. Tooth grinding, a symptom related to sleep bruxism, was reported by 8% of the subjects; in contrast to RLS-related symptoms, the prevalence of tooth grinding decreased linearly with age. RLS-related symptoms were reported more frequently in Eastern provinces than in Ontario and Western Canada, and more frequently in Roman Catholic and French-speaking responders.

We suggest that neocortico-hippocampal transfer of information and the modification process in neocortical circuitries by the hippocampal output take place in a temporally discontinuous manner associated with theta/gamma oscillations. On the other hand, transfer of the stored representations to neocortical areas is carried by discrete quanta of cooperative neuronal bursts (called sharp wave bursts) initiated in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep. The spatio-temporal participation of principal cells in sharp waves is determined by experience-induced changes in the CA3 recurrent collateral matrix. The co-operative, converging pre-synaptic activity can induce localized fast spikes and associated calcium influx in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, a necessary condition for the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, the subcortical effects of hippocampal sharp wave bursts may be critical in the release of various hormones which, in turn, may affect synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that sleep patterns in the limbic system are essential for the preservation of experience-induced synaptic modifications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.7.s1.3.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141252299", "source": "openalex"}

It is a major cause of sleep disruption. Periodic limb movements in sleep are detectable in most patients with RLS and represent an objective physiological metric.To search for sequence variants contributing to RLS, we performed a genomewide association study and two replication studies. To minimize phenotypic heterogeneity, we focused on patients with RLS who had objectively documented periodic limb movements in sleep. We measured serum ferritin levels, since iron depletion has been associated with the pathogenesis of RLS.In an Icelandic discovery sample of patients with RLS and periodic limb movements in sleep, we observed a genomewide significant association with a common variant in an intron of BTBD9 on chromosome 6p21.2 (odds ratio, 1.8; P=2x10(-9)). This association was replicated in a second Icelandic sample (odds ratio, 1.8; P=4x10(-4)) and a U.S. sample (odds ratio, 1.5; P=4x10(-3)). With this variant, the population attributable risk of RLS with periodic limb movements was approximately 50%. An association between the variant and periodic limb movements in sleep without RLS (and the absence of such an association for RLS without periodic limb movements) suggests that we have identified a genetic determinant of periodic limb movements in sleep (odds ratio, 1.9; P=1x10(-17)). Serum ferritin levels were decreased by 13% per allele of the at-risk variant (95% confidence interval, 5 to 20; P=0.002).We have discovered a variant associated with susceptibility to periodic limb movements in sleep.

Method In 2002–03, 47 interns in the internal medicine resident program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine completed the following instruments at baseline and at year end: sleep quantities, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory–Short Form, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey. The prevalences of acute and chronic sleep deprivation, subjective sleepiness, burnout, empathy, and depression at the beginning of the year were compared to prevalences at the end of internship. Associations between sleep deprivation and mood, empathy, or burnout were explored. Results The prevalence of chronic sleep deprivation, depression, burnout, and empathy increased from baseline to year end. Specifically, the prevalence of \"high\" scores changed for chronic sleep deprivation (9% to 43%, p = .0001). The prevalence of moderate depression increased from 4.3% to 29.8% (p = .0002). Only 4.3% reported a high level of burnout initially compared with 55.3% at year end (p < .0001).

Polysomnographic recordings from 18 bruxers and 18 asymptomatic subjects, selected according to American Sleep Disorders Association criteria, were analyzed (1) to discriminate sleep bruxism from other orofacial motor activities and (2) to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of research criteria. Clinical observations and reports revealed that all 18 bruxers reported frequent tooth-grinding during sleep. Tooth wear was noted in 16 out of 18 bruxers and jaw discomfort reported by six of them. These findings were present in none of the controls. The analysis of polysomnographic data showed that the asymptomatic subjects presented a mean of 1.7 +/- 0.3 bruxism episodes per hour of sleep (sustained or repetitive bursting activity in jaw closer muscles), while bruxers had a significantly higher level of activity: 5.4 +/- 0.6. Controls exhibited 4.6 +/- 0.3 bruxism bursts per episode and 6.2 (from 0 to 23) bruxism bursts per hour of sleep, whereas bruxers showed, respectively, 7.0 +/- 0.7 and 36.1 (5.8 to 108). Bruxism-like episodes with at least two grinding sounds were noted in 14 of the 18 bruxers and in one control. The two groups exhibited no difference in any of the sleep parameters.

Of the senses, vision makes a particular demand of the PFC, and this is reflected by the frontal eye fields.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.162.3.413", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986964933", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep apnea is due to recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that are caused by elevations in upper airway collapsibility during sleep. Collapsibility can be increased by underlying anatomic alterations and/or disturbances in upper airway neuromuscular control, both of which play key roles in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. Obesity and particularly central adiposity are potent risk factors for sleep apnea. They can increase pharyngeal collapsibility through mechanical effects on pharyngeal soft tissues and lung volume, and through central nervous system-acting signaling proteins (adipokines) that may affect airway neuromuscular control. Specific molecular signaling pathways encode differences in the distribution and metabolic activity of adipose tissue. These differences can produce alterations in the mechanical and neural control of upper airway collapsibility, which determine sleep apnea susceptibility. Although weight loss reduces upper airway collapsibility during sleep, it is not known whether its effects are mediated primarily by improvement in upper airway mechanical properties or neuromuscular control. A variety of behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical approaches to weight loss may be of benefit to patients with sleep apnea, through distinct effects on the mass and activity of regional adipose stores. Examining responses to specific weight loss strategies will provide critical insight into mechanisms linking obesity and sleep apnea, and will help to elucidate the humoral and molecular predictors of weight loss responses.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1513/pats.200708-137mg", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984921150", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep may not be the only answer to the obesity pandemic, but its effect should be considered seriously, as even small changes in the energy balance are beneficial. Good sleep could be part of the obesity prevention approach. We are currently facing a major obesity pandemic. Most alarming is the accelerated increase in overweight and obesity in children, with childhood obesity tracking into adulthood. Although there is a strong genetic contribution to obesity, the current pandemic has been driven by environmental factors. Unfortunately, interventions aiming to alter food selection (eg, less fat and sugar) and calorie intake (eg, smaller portions) and to increase physical activity have not been able to result in long-term weight loss and maintenance. These approaches are confounded by the fact that only an insignificant daily energy surplus could result in obesity over time. Although changes in the basic balance between energy intake (food calories) and expenditure (physical activity) are obviously responsible for the current obesity pandemic, our understanding of the factors that alter this balance remains incomplete. Intriguingly, sleep may be a factor that alters both sides of the energy balance equation. The precise physiological functions of sleep are unknown, but the contribution of sleep to physical and psychological health, and its social and economic significance, is increasingly recognised.1 Sleep research has mainly concentrated on the cognitive consequences of sleep loss, on the basis of the belief that sleep is for the brain alone. Recently, however, there has been a shift in interest in the consequences of sleep loss for other organs and several physiological systems. Also, more laboratory studies on sleep are now concentrating on investigating the health and performance effects of chronic partial sleep restriction, which is truer of real life, rather than acute total sleep deprivation.

Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that OSA is accompanied by alterations in cardiovascular variability, even in the absence of overt cardiovascular disease.Spectral analysis of variability of muscle sympathetic nerve activity, RR interval, and blood pressure were obtained during undisturbed supine rest in 15 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA, 18 patients with mild OSA, and 16 healthy control subjects in whom sleep disordered breathing was excluded by complete overnight polysomnography. Patients with OSA were newly diagnosed, never treated for OSA, and free of any other known diseases. Patients with moderate-to-severe OSA had shorter RR intervals (793+/-27 ms) and increased sympathetic burst frequency (49+/-4 bursts/min) compared with control subjects (947+/-42 ms; 24+/-3 bursts/min; P=0.008 and P<0.001, respectively). In these patients, total variance of RR was reduced (P=0.01) and spectral analysis of RR variability showed an increase in low frequency normalized units, a decrease in high frequency normalized units, and an increase in the ratio of low to high frequency (all P<0.05). Even though blood pressure was similar to that of the control subjects, blood pressure variance in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA was more than double the variance in control subjects (P=0.01). Patients with mild OSA also had a reduction in RR variance (P=0.02) in the absence of any significant difference in absolute RR interval. For all patients with OSA, linear regression showed a positive correlation (r=0.40; P=0.02) between sleep apnea severity and blood pressure variance.Cardiovascular variability is altered in patients with OSA. This alteration is evident even in the absence of hypertension, heart failure, or other disease states and may be linked to the severity of OSA.

This trend for shorter sleep duration has developed over the same time period as the dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to indicate that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity and diabetes. Laboratory studies in healthy volunteers have shown that experimental sleep restriction is associated with an adverse impact on glucose homeostasis. Insulin sensitivity decreases rapidly and markedly without adequate compensation in beta cell function, resulting in an elevated risk of diabetes. Prospective epidemiologic studies in both children and adults are consistent with a causative role of short sleep in the increased risk of diabetes. Sleep curtailment is also associated with a dysregulation of the neuroendocrine control of appetite, with a reduction of the satiety factor, leptin, and an increase in the hunger‐promoting hormone, ghrelin. Thus, sleep loss may alter the ability of leptin and ghrelin to accurately signal caloric need, acting in concert to produce an internal misperception of insufficient energy availability. The adverse impact of sleep deprivation on appetite regulation is likely to be driven by increased activity in neuronal populations expressing the excitatory peptides orexins that promote both waking and feeding. Consistent with the laboratory evidence, multiple epidemiologic studies have shown an association between short sleep and higher body mass index after controlling for a variety of possible confounders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1417.033", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070373962", "source": "openalex"}

No difference was found between morning‐better and ‐worse groups with respect to age, duration or stage of PD; antiparkinsonian medications utilized, and predominant motor symptoms. However, the morning‐same group had a shorter duration of PD and less severe disease and required fewer dopaminergic medications. Sleep disorders were seen with equal frequency in the morning‐better and ‐worse groups. Our results suggest that sleep does not have a direct effect on morning motor function. Alterations in morning motor symptomatology probably represent a manifestation of motor fluctuations. Sleep fragmentation and spontaneous daytime dozing occurred much more frequently in PD patients than controls.

The primary purposes of the present study were to survey the prevalence of sleep problems in school-aged children and to examine these associations with parental perception of sleep problems, medical history, and childhood psychopathology. Methods. Sleep and medical history questionnaires and the Child Behavior Checklist were administered to the parents of 472 children between ages 4 and 12 years receiving routine pediatric care from urban, rural, and suburban pediatric practices. Results. Although sleep problems were reported for 10.8% of the sample during the past 6 months, less than one half of the parents who identified sleep problems reported that they had discussed sleep with their child's pediatrician. The best predictor of current sleep problems was a history of sleep problems before age 2 years. Sleep problems such as snoring, tiredness during the day, and taking excessive time to fall asleep were very common, occurring at least 1 night per week in over 20% of the total sample. Factor analysis of the sleep problems questionnaire resulted in 5 sleep problem factors that accounted for 58.7% of the variance. Specific sleep problem factors include: parasomnias, enuresis/gags, tiredness, noisy sleep, and insomnia. Sleep problem factor scores were differentially associated with medical history variables and measures of childhood psychopathology. Children rated highly on parasomnias were more likely to have frequent falls and to display pica. Parasomnias and noisy sleep were inversely associated with socioeconomic status (SES). Children from lower SES families were rated higher on these factors than children from higher SES families. Enuresis/gags was the only sleep problem factor associated with age. Younger children scored higher on this factor. Duration of naps was highly correlated with age and with bed times during the week and weekends. As expected, younger children were more likely to nap for longer periods and to have earlier bed times. In addition, higher tiredness factor scores were associated with napping and with later bed times during the week and weekend. Boys were much more likely than were girls to have higher scores on enuresis/gags, and higher enuresis/gags scores were associated with an increased prevalence of trauma and falls. Bed times were not associated with any other sleep problem factor score. Children rated highly on tiredness were more likely to have a history of hospitalizations. Tiredness factor scores were strongly associated with the sleep practice of sharing a bed but not with sharing a room. Sharing a room was not associated with any sleep problem factor score. High scores on noisy sleep were associated with allergies, falls frequently, and with sharing a bed. Children with high scores on the insomnias were also more likely to display an increased prevalence of allergies. Conclusions. Parental perception of global sleep problems was surprisingly common in school-aged children receiving routine pediatric care. Parental reports of their children's sleep problems may be a red flag for specific sleep problems and psychiatric, social, or medical problems. Sleep problems should be queried about during pediatric visits for school-aged children.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.107.4.e60", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2098591565", "source": "openalex"}

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also common, affecting an estimated 15 million Americans, with a prevalence that is probably also rising as a consequence of increasing obesity. Epidemiologic data support a link between obesity and hypertension as well as between OSA and hypertension. For example, untreated OSA predisposes to an increased risk of new hypertension, and treatment of OSA lowers blood pressure, even during the daytime. Possible mechanisms whereby OSA may contribute to hypertension in obese individuals include sympathetic activation, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance, elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, oxidative and inflammatory stress, endothelial dysfunction, impaired baroreflex function, and perhaps by effects on renal function. The coexistence of OSA and obesity may have more widespread implications for cardiovascular control and dysfunction in obese individuals and may contribute to some of the clustering of abnormalities broadly defined as the metabolic syndrome. From the clinical and therapeutic perspectives, the presence of resistant hypertension and the absence of a nocturnal decrease in blood pressure in obese individuals should prompt the clinician to consider the diagnosis of OSA, especially if clinical symptoms suggestive of OSA (such as poor sleep quality, witnessed apnea, excessive daytime somnolence, and so forth) are also present.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.hyp.0000101686.98973.a3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155424615", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were entered into this study. Polysomnographic evaluations were performed within approximately 2 to 5 weeks after each patient’s stroke. Results Obstructive sleep apnea was found in 10 of 13 men with stroke (77%) and in only 3 of 13 male subjects without stroke (23%) ( P =.0169). Seven of 11 women with stroke (64%) had obstructive sleep apnea, while only 2 of 14 female subjects without stroke (14%) had obstructive sleep apnea ( P =.0168). For men with stroke, the mean apnea/hypopnea index (±SE) was 21.5±4.2 events per hour, while for male subjects without stroke it was 4.8±1.8 events per hour ( P =.0014).

Recent findings Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine–Levin syndrome are more common in men. Summary Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture.

Stanford Sleepiness Scales showed an immediate increase in daytime sleepiness that reached a plateau after 4 days. An analog sleepiness rating scale showed increased sleepiness after 2 restricted nights and leveled off after the fourth restricted night. The multiple sleep latency tests showed no effect of sleep restriction until the second day, followed by a progressive increase in sleepiness that persisted through the seventh sleep restriction day. During the recovery period, daytime sleepiness returned to basal values on all three measures following one full night of sleep; with a daytime nap, no further cumulative effects of sleep restriction were seen.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb02921.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084682807", "source": "openalex"}

The authors derived the maximum-likelihood estimator of the feedback gain and applied it to quantify sleep depth. The estimator computes the fraction (0%-100%) of the current slow wave which continues in the near future (0.02 s later) EEG. Therefore, this percentage was dubbed slow-wave microconfinuity (SW%). It is not affected by anatomical parameters such as skull thickness, which can considerably bias the commonly used slow-wave power (SWP). In the authors' study, both of the estimators SW% and SWP were monitored throughout two nights in 22 subjects. Each subject took temazepam (a benzodiazepine) on one of the two nights, Both estimators detected the effects of age, temazepam, and time of night on sleep. Females were found to have twice the SWP of males, but no gender effect on SW% was found. This confirms earlier reports that gender affects SWP but not sleep depth. Subjectively assessed differences in sleep quality between the nights were correlated to differences in SW%, not in SWP. These results demonstrate that slow-wave microcontinuity, being based on a physiological model of sleep, reflects sleep depth more closely than SWP does.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/10.867928", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144691514", "source": "openalex"}

This knowledge, in the final analysis, always depends upon the subjective report of the dreamer, but becomes relatively objective if such reports can be significantly related to some physiological phenomena which in turn can be measured by physical techniques. Such a relationship was reported by Aserinsky and Kleitman (1) who observed periods of rapid, conjugate eye movements during sleep and found a high incidence of dream recall in Ss awakened during these periods and a low incidence when awakened at other times. The occurrence of these characteristic eye movements and their relation to dreaming were confirmed in both normal Ss and schizophrenics (4), and they were shown to appear at regular intervals in relation to a cyclic change in the depth of sleep during the night as measured by the EEC (5). This paper represents the results of a rigorous testing of the relation between eye movements and dreaming.

A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as \"good practice statements\" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure: (1) Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing. (2) Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation and during treatment of OSA.The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians using PAP to treat OSA in adults. A STRONG (ie, \"We recommend…\") recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A CONDITIONAL recommendation (ie, \"We suggest…\") reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific care must be made by the treating clinician and the patient, taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the patient, available treatment options, and resources. (1) We recommend that clinicians use PAP, compared to no therapy, to treat OSA in adults with excessive sleepiness.

On the other hand, surveillance kind of applications require guaranteed k-coverage of the protected region at all times. As a result, determining the appropriate number of sensors to deploy that achieves both goals simultaneously becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we consider three kinds of deployments for a sensor network on a unit square - a √n x √n grid, random uniform (for all n points), and Poisson (with density n). In all three deployments, each sensor is active with probability p, independently from the others. Then, we claim that the critical value of the function npπr2/log(np) is 1 for the event of k-coverage of every point. We also provide an upper bound on the window of this phase transition. Although the conditions for the three deployments are similar, we obtain sharper bounds for the random deployments than the grid deployment, which occurs due to the boundary condition. In this paper, we also provide corrections to previously published results for the grid deployment model.

As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation, and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which NREMS alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthesize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles 1) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete EEG events, 2) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness, and 3) enable a selective reactivation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects NREMS as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative, and -psychiatric conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00042.2018", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2994264552", "source": "openalex"}

Complaints of disrupted sleep are very common in patients suffering from depression, and they are listed among diagnostic criteria for this disorder. Moreover, midnocturnal insomnia is the most frequent residual symptom of depression. Thus, all antidepressants should normalize sleep. However, at least in short-term treatment, many antidepressants with so-called activating effects (e.g. fluoxetine, venlafaxine) may disrupt sleep, while others with sedative properties (e.g., doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone) rapidly improve sleep, but may cause problems in long-term treatment due to oversedation.For sleep-promoting action, the best effects can frequently be achieved with a very low dose, administered early enough before bedtime and importantly, always as a part of more complex interventions based on the cognitive-behavioral protocol to treat insomnia (CBT-I). For successful treatment of depression, it is necessary to understand the effects of antidepressants on sleep. Each physician should also be aware that some antidepressants may worsen or induce primary sleep disorders like restless legs syndrome, sleep bruxism, REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, and sleep apnea, which may result from an antidepressant-induced weight gain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-017-0816-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2742814779", "source": "openalex"}

This study examines the relationship of race/ethnicity, socio-economic status (SES) and other factors upon sleep quality. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 9,714 randomly selected subjects was used to explore sleep quality obtained by self-report, in relation to socioeconomic factors including poverty, employment status, and education level. The primary outcome was poor sleep quality. Data were collected by the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation. Results Significant differences were observed in the outcome for race/ethnicity (African-American and Latino versus White: unadjusted OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.05 and OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98, respectively) and income (below poverty threshold, unadjusted OR = 2.84, 95%CI 2.41-3.35). In multivariable modeling, health indicators significantly influenced sleep quality most prominently in poor individuals. After adjusting for socioeconomic factors (education, employment) and health indicators, the association of income and poor sleep quality diminished, but still persisted in poor Whites while it was no longer significant in poor African-Americans (adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.47-2.58 versus OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.87-1.54, respectively). Post-college education (adjusted OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.71) protected against poor sleep. Conclusions A \"sleep disparity\" exists in the study population: poor sleep quality is strongly associated with poverty and race. Factors such as employment, education and health status, amongst others, significantly mediated this effect only in poor subjects, suggesting a differential vulnerability to these factors in poor relative to non-poor individuals in the context of sleep quality. Consideration of this could help optimize targeted interventions in certain groups and subsequently reduce the adverse societal effects of poor sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-475", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017490739", "source": "openalex"}

Although it was previously assumed that this was due to its relation with obesity, recent data suggest that OSA is independently associated with the cardiovascular risk factors that comprise metabolic syndrome, including hypertension, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidaemia. However, as previous studies have only considered these variables individually, it has not been possible to determine the overall association of OSA with this syndrome.We recruited 61 male subjects with OSA and 43 controls.

Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. Subjects with OSA were more obese, had higher BP and fasting insulin, were more insulin resistant, had lower HDL cholesterol, and an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome (87% vs. 35%, p<0.0001). In order to determine whether these associations were independent of obesity and other known covariates, a regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption was performed. This demonstrated that OSA was independently associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations, decreased HDL cholesterol, increased cholesterol:HDL ratio, and a trend towards higher HOMA values. Metabolic syndrome was 9.1 (95% confidence interval 2.6, 31.2: p<0.0001) times more likely to be present in subjects with OSA.OSA is independently associated with an increase in the cardiovascular risk factors that comprise the metabolic syndrome and its overall prevalence.

As in mammals, sleep in the fruit fly is a reversible state of reduced responsiveness to the external world and has been defined using an array of behavioral, pharmacologic, molecular, and electrophysiologic criteria. A central feature of mammalian sleep is its homeostatic regulation by the amount of previous wakefulness. Dissecting the mechanisms of homeostatic regulation is likely to provide key insights into the functions of sleep. Thus, it is important to establish to what extent sleep homeostasis is similar between mammals and flies. This study was designed to determine whether in flies, as in mammals, (1) sleep rebound is dependent on prior time awake; (2) sleep deprivation affects the intensity, in addition to the duration, of sleep rebound; (3) sleep loss impairs vigilance and performance; (4) the sleep homeostatic response is conserved among different wild-type lines, and between female and male flies of the same line. Motor activity of individual flies was recorded at 1-minute intervals using the infrared Drosophila Activity Monitoring System during 2 baseline days; during 6,12, and 24 hours of sleep deprivation; and during 2 days of recovery. Sleep was defined as any period of uninterrupted behavioral immobility lasting > 5 minutes. Sleep continuity was measured by calculating the number of brief awakenings, the number and duration of sleep episodes, and a sleep continuity score.

In wild-type CS flies, as in mammals, the amount of sleep recovered after sleep deprivation was dependent on prior time awake. Relative to baseline sleep, recovery sleep in CS flies was less fragmented, with longer sleep episodes, and was associated with a higher arousal threshold. Sleep deprivation in CS flies also reduced performance. Sleep duration and continuity increased after 24 hour of sleep deprivation in all the other wild-type lines tested. The sleep homeostatic response in fruit flies is a stable phenotype and shares most of, if not all, the major features of mammalian sleep homeostasis, thus supporting the use of Drosophila as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep mechanisms and functions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/27.4.628", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1745005559", "source": "openalex"}

We propose that ATP, released during neurotransmission, acting via purine P2 receptors on glia releases IL1 and TNF. This mechanism may provide the means by which the brain keeps track of prior usage history. IL1 and TNF in turn act on neurons to change their intrinsic properties and thereby change input-output properties (i.e. state shift) of the local network involved.

In the second phase of this study, 741 men and 1000 women, previously interviewed, were selected based on the presence of risk factors for SDB (snoring, daytime sleepiness, obesity, hypertension, and, for women, menopause). Each subject selected for the second phase of the study provided a comprehensive history, underwent a physical examination, and was evaluated for 1 night in the sleep laboratory. In terms of severity of SDB, 4 groups were identified: moderate or severe (obstructive apnea/hypopnea index ≥15.0), mild (snoring and an obstructive apnea/hypopnea index of 0.1-14.9), snoring, and no SDB, the control group. <h3>Results</h3> Sleep-disordered breathing was independently associated with hypertension when potential confounders were controlled for in the logistic regression analysis. The strength of this association decreased with age and was proportional to the severity of SDB. In the best-fitted model, neither sex nor menopause changed the relationship between hypertension and SDB. <h3>Conclusions</h3> In the results of this study, SDB, even snoring, was independently associated with hypertension in both men and women. This relationship was strongest in young subjects, especially those of normal weight, a finding that is consistent with previous findings that SDB is more severe in young individuals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.160.15.2289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118855061", "source": "openalex"}

We investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of this association in a translational study.In a novel in vitro model of IHR, we used HeLa cells transfected with reporter constructs and DNA binding assays for the master transcriptional regulators of the inflammatory and adaptive pathways (NFkappaB and HIF-1, respectively) to investigate underlying transcriptional events initiated by repeated cell exposure to IHR. Furthermore, we prospectively studied 19 male OSAS patients (median apnea-hypopnea frequency, 48.5 episodes per hour; interquartile range [IQR], 28.5 to 72.9) and 17 matched normal control subjects. Circulating levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the adaptive factor erythropoietin were assayed in all subjects at baseline and again after 6 weeks of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in patients. Full blood count was measured as part of a detailed baseline evaluation. HeLa cells exposed to IHR demonstrated selective activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB (P<0.001 by ANOVA), whereas the adaptive regulator HIF-1 was not activated, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assays and DNA binding studies. Circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were higher in OSAS patients (2.56 pg/mL; IQR, 2.01 to 3.42 pg/mL) than in control subjects (1.25 pg/mL; IQR, 0.94 to 1.87; P<0.001) but normalized with continuous positive airway pressure therapy (1.24 pg/mL; IQR, 0.78 to 2.35 pg/mL; P=0.002). In contrast, erythropoietin levels were similar throughout. Furthermore, circulating neutrophil levels were higher in OSAS patients than in control subjects, whereas the hematocrit was unaltered.These data demonstrate selective activation of inflammatory over adaptive pathways in IHR and OSAS, which may be an important molecular mechanism of cardiovascular disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.105.556746", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160507976", "source": "openalex"}

An activation pattern common to both spindle types involved the thalami, paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate and insular cortices), and superior temporal gyri. No thalamic difference was detected in the direct comparison between slow and fast spindles although some thalamic areas were preferentially activated in relation to either spindle type. Beyond the common activation pattern, the increases in cortical activity differed significantly between the two spindle types. Slow spindles were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, fast spindles recruited a set of cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing, as well as the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus. The recruitment of partially segregated cortical networks for slow and fast spindles further supports the existence of two spindle types during human non-rapid eye movement sleep, with potentially different functional significance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0703084104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151583242", "source": "openalex"}

However, two different theoretical models have been proposed to account for this finding: (1) a one-generator model, in which mentation is generated by a single set of processes regardless of physiological differences between REM and NREM sleep; and (2) a two-generator model, in which qualitatively different generators produce cognitive activity in the two states. First, research is reviewed demonstrating conclusively that mentation can occur in NREM sleep; global estimates show an average mentation recall rate of about 50% from NREM sleep – a value that has increased substantially over the years. Second, nine different types of research on REM and NREM cognitive activity are examined for evidence supporting or refuting the two models. The evidence largely, but not completely, favors the two-generator model. Finally, in a preliminary attempt to reconcile the two models, an alternative model is proposed that assumes the existence of covert REM sleep processes during NREM sleep.

To date, only 7% (2/29) of patients have developed any other neurologic disorder. At the time of RBD diagnosis, data from the RBD group with eventual Parkinson9s disease (n equals 11) and the current idiopathic RBD group (n equals 16) were indistinguishable, with two exceptions: the RBD-Parkinson9s disease group had a significantly elevated hourly index of periodic limb movements of non-REM sleep and an elevated REM sleep percentage. RBD was fully or substantially controlled with nightly clonazepam treatment in 89% (24/27) of patients in both groups. Thus, RBD can be the heralding manifestation of Parkinson9s disease in a substantial subgroup of older male RBD patients. However, a number of presumed Parkinson9s disease patients may eventually be diagnosed with multiple system atrophy (straitonigral degeneration subtype). Our findings indicate the importance of serial neurologic evaluations after RBD is diagnosed and implicate the pedunculopontine nucleus as a likely site of pathology in combined RBD-Parkinson9s disease, based on experimental and theoretical considerations rather than on autopsy data. <b>NEUROLOGY 1996;46: </b> 388-393", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.46.2.388", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991354131", "source": "openalex"}

The sample comprised 913 employed adults enrolled in an ongoing study of the natural history of sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing status was determined by overnight in-laboratory polysomnography and motor vehicle accident (MVA) history was obtained from a statewide data base of all traffic violations and accidents from 1988 to 1993. Men with five or more apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep [apnea-plus-hypopnea index (AHI) >5], compared to those without sleep-disordered breathing, were significantly more likely to have at least one accident in 5 years (adjusted odds ratio = 3.4 for habitual snorers, 4.2 for AHI 5–15, and 3.4 for AHI >15). Men and women combined with AHI >15 (vs. no sleep-disordered breathing) were significantly more likely to have multiple accidents in 5 years (odds ratio = 7.3). These results, free of clinic selection bias, indicate that unrecognized sleep-disordered breathing in the general population is linked to motor vehicle accident occurrence.

Polysomnography and spirometry results from 5,954 participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study were analyzed. OAD was defined by a FEV1/FVC value less than 70%. Assessment of SAH prevalence in OAD was performed using thresholds of respiratory disturbance index (RDI) greater than 10 and greater than 15.

In Part One, I describe the frequency of accidents in the United States and explain a method for estimating the economic cost of these of accidents. Accidents are the fourth leading cause of mortality in the United States, and motor-vehicle accidents represent 51% of total deaths caused by accidents. The method used for calculating the cost of accidents is called \"the human capital approach\". It is based on the principle that \"one person produces a sum of output during his/her life-time, which can be approximated by his/her earnings\". It is necessary to understand that this estimate of human value is not intended to reduce human beings to a sum of earnings during his/her lifetime. It does, however, serve as a useful indicator in making decisions regarding public health policy for the country. The results of the total cost of accidents and the relative costs for work-related, home-based and public accidents in 1988 are discussed. In Part Two, I explore the role sleepiness plays in contributing to the total number of accidents. The difficulty of researching this subject is compounded by the fact that reports of rates of accidents related to sleepiness differ significantly from author to author. This is true both for drivers with sleep disorders and those without. We have calculated two different rates for estimating the number of motor-vehicle accidents caused by sleepiness. The first is based on the percentage of total accidents and fatal accidents that occur during the hours of maximum sleepiness 2:00 to 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m., 41.6% of total and 36.1% of fatal accidents, respectively. The second rate was simply the percentage of total accidents that occur at night (54%). Other categories of accidents explored are work-related, home-based and public accidents. If we assume that the rate of accidents due to sleepiness for falls and air transportation is the same as that for motor-vehicle accidents, then we can apply this rate to falls and air transportation accidents in cases of work-related, home-based and public accidents. Finally, I estimate the cost of accidents related to sleepiness in each category, for accidents occurring in 1988. The total cost of accidents related to sleepiness in 1988 is estimated to be between $43.15 billion and $56.02 billion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/17.1.84", "url": "https://openalex.org/W193715454", "source": "openalex"}

A total of 409 sleep disorder patients were studied with all-night polysomnogram recording, and 53 (13%) had PMS.

The prevalence and magnitude of PMS were not statistically greater in patients with insomniac disorders than in those with syndromes of excessive daytime sleepiness or other sleep-wake disorders. The results suggest that although PMS is responsible for disturbed sleep in relatively few patients, chronic sleep-wake disturbance is associated with PMS and may lead to the development of these movements.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.410080413", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051115357", "source": "openalex"}

We studied 16 adults in a 14- to 15-d-long inpatient study and quantified effects of 5 d of insufficient sleep, equivalent to a work week, on energy expenditure and energy intake compared with adequate sleep. We found that insufficient sleep increased total daily energy expenditure by ∼5%; however, energy intake--especially at night after dinner--was in excess of energy needed to maintain energy balance. Insufficient sleep led to 0.82 ± 0.47 kg (±SD) weight gain despite changes in hunger and satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin, and peptide YY, which signaled excess energy stores. Insufficient sleep delayed circadian melatonin phase and also led to an earlier circadian phase of wake time. Sex differences showed women, not men, maintained weight during adequate sleep, whereas insufficient sleep reduced dietary restraint and led to weight gain in women. Our findings suggest that increased food intake during insufficient sleep is a physiological adaptation to provide energy needed to sustain additional wakefulness; yet when food is easily accessible, intake surpasses that needed. We also found that transitioning from an insufficient to adequate/recovery sleep schedule decreased energy intake, especially of fats and carbohydrates, and led to -0.03 ± 0.50 kg weight loss. These findings provide evidence that sleep plays a key role in energy metabolism. Importantly, they demonstrate physiological and behavioral mechanisms by which insufficient sleep may contribute to overweight and obesity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216951110", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099096099", "source": "openalex"}

The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. The guideline contains the following recommendations for the diagnosis of OSAS: 1) all children should be screened for snoring; 2) complex high-risk patients should be referred to a specialist; 3) patients with cardiorespiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation; 4) diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating between primary snoring and OSAS, the gold standard being polysomnography; 5) adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for most children, and continuous positive airway pressure is an option for those who are not candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery; 6) high-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively; 7) patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional treatment is required. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the evaluation of children with OSAS. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for diagnostic decision-making.

If this analogy is relevant to the pathophysiology of depressive illness, advancing the time of sleep and awakening should temporarily compensate for the abnormal timing of depressed patients' circadian rhythms. Four of seven manic-depressive patients studied longitudinally spontaneously advanced their times of awakening (activity onset) as they emerged from the depressive phase of their illness. In a phase-shift experiment, a depressed manic-depressive woman was twice brought out of depression for 2 weeks by advancing her sleep period so that she went to sleep and arose 6 hours earlier than usual. The antidepressant effect of the procedure was temporary and similar in duration to circadian desynchronization induced by jet lag in healthy subjects. This result supports the hypothesis that abnormalities of sleep patterns in some types of depression are due to abnormal internal phase relationships of circadian rhythms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.227056", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2052024880", "source": "openalex"}

A group analysis on 11 good sleepers (8 with steady slow wave sleep, SWS) showed a significant negative correlation between the occurrence of SWS and rCBF in dorsal pons and mesencephalon, thalami, basal ganglia, basal forebrain/hypothalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and, on the right side, in a region that follows the medial aspect of the temporal lobe. Given the known decrease in global cerebral blood flow levels during SWS, these negative correlations suggest that rCBF is decreased significantly more in these cerebral areas than in the rest of the brain. The marked rCBF decreases in the pons, mesencephalon, thalamic nuclei, and basal forebrain reflect their close implication in the generation of SWS rhythms. The influence of these rhythms on the telencephalon usually are thought to be global and homogeneous. In contrast, our results show that rCBF is decreased more in some cortical areas (especially in orbitofrontal cortex) than in the rest of the cortex. We hypothesize that cellular processes taking place during SWS might be modulated differently in these regions. Given the functions of the ventromedial frontal areas, we surmise that SWS might be particularly critical for the adaptation of behavior to environmental pressures. This hypothesis is supported indirectly by results of sleep deprivation experiments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.17-08-02807.1997", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100484765", "source": "openalex"}

We induced OSA in four dogs by intermittent airway occlusion during nocturnal sleep. Daytime and nighttime BP were measured before, during, and after a 1-3-mo long period of OSA. OSA resulted in acute transient increases in nighttime BP to a maximum of 13.0+/-2.0 mmHg (mean+/-SEM), and eventually produced sustained daytime hypertension to a maximum of 15.7+/-4.3 mmHg. In a subsequent protocol, recurrent arousal from sleep without airway occlusion did not result in daytime hypertension.

The present review revisits this influential hypothesis in light of clinical and experimental findings that have since accumulated. Polysomnographic studies conducted in adults with PTSD have yielded mixed findings regarding REM sleep disturbances, and they generally suggest modest and nonspecific sleep disruptions. Prospective and treatment studies have provided more robust evidence for the relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric outcomes and symptoms. Experimental animal and human studies that have probed the relationship between REM sleep and fear responses, as well as studies focused more broadly on sleep-dependent affective and memory processes, also provide strong support for the hypothesis that sleep plays an important role in PTSD-relevant processes. Overall, the literature suggests that disturbed REM or non-REM sleep can contribute to maladaptive stress and trauma responses and may constitute a modifiable risk factor for poor psychiatric outcomes. Clinicians need to consider that the chronic sleep disruption associated with nightmares may affect the efficacy of first-line PTSD treatments, but targeted sleep treatments may accelerate recovery from PTSD. The field is ripe for prospective and longitudinal studies in high-risk groups to clarify how changes in sleep physiology and neurobiology contribute to increased risk of poor psychiatric outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12040432", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102756647", "source": "openalex"}

During a 6-h period prior to night 3, either the left or the right hand was vibrated intermittently (20 min on-8 min off), while prior to night 5 the same treatment was applied to the contralateral hand. The sleep EEG was recorded from frontal, central, parietal and occipital derivations and subjected to spectral analysis. The interhemispheric asymmetry index (IAI) was calculated for spectral power in nonREM sleep in the frequency range 0.25-25.0 Hz for 0.5-Hz or 1-Hz bins. In the first hour of sleep following right-hand stimulation, the IAI of the central derivation was increased relative to baseline, which corresponds to a shift of power towards the left hemisphere. This effect was most prominent in the delta range, was limited to the first hour of sleep and was restricted to the central derivation situated over the somatosensory cortex.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of sleep timing in dietary patterns and BMI. Participants included 52 (25 females) volunteers who completed 7 days of wrist actigraphy and food logs. Fifty-six percent were \"normal sleepers\" (midpoint of <5:30 AM) and 44% were \"late sleepers\" (midpoint of sleep ≥5:30 AM). Late sleepers had shorter sleep duration, later sleep onset and sleep offset and meal times. Late sleepers consumed more calories at dinner and after 8:00 PM, had higher fast food, full-calorie soda and lower fruit and vegetable consumption. Higher BMI was associated with shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, caloric consumption after 8:00 PM, and fast food meals. In multivariate models, sleep timing was independently associated with calories consumed after 8:00 PM and fruit and vegetable consumption but did not predict BMI after controlling for sleep duration. Calories consumed after 8:00 PM predicted BMI after controlling for sleep timing and duration. These findings indicate that caloric intake after 8:00 PM may increase the risk of obesity, independent of sleep timing and duration. Future studies should investigate the biological and social mechanisms linking timing of sleep and feeding in order to develop novel time-based interventions for weight management.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.100", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059241370", "source": "openalex"}

In healthy subjects, experimental sleep restriction caused insulin resistance (IR) and increased evening cortisol and sympathetic activation. Increased obesity in subjects reporting short sleep duration leads to speculation that, during recent decades, decreased sleeping time in the general population may have contributed to the increasing prevalence of obesity. Causal inference is difficult due to lack of control for confounders and inconsistent evidence of temporal sequence. In the general population, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with glucose intolerance. OSA severity is also associated with the degree of IR. However, OSA at baseline does not seem to significantly predict the development of diabetes. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is higher in patients with OSA than in obese subjects without OSA. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure seems to improve glucose metabolism both in diabetic and nondiabetic OSA but mainly in nonobese subjects. The relative role of obesity and OSA in the pathogenesis of metabolic alterations is still unclear and is intensively studied in clinical and experimental models.

Many of the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths are strikingly similar. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths. Recommendations for a safe sleep environment include supine positioning, use of a firm sleep surface, room-sharing without bed-sharing, and avoidance of soft bedding and overheating. Additional recommendations for SIDS risk reduction include avoidance of exposure to smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs; breastfeeding; routine immunization; and use of a pacifier.

We also investigated its risk factors and evaluated the significance of the most commonly asked questions that best correlated with the presence of OSAHS. In the first phase, 658 subjects (94%) returned completed questionnaires regarding their sleep habits and associated medical conditions. In the second phase, 250 of these underwent an overnight home sleep study. The estimated prevalence of SDB (apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or more) was 19.5%, and that of OSAHS (SDB with daytime hypersomnolence) was 7.5%. Multiple stepwise logistic regression determined body mass index, neck girth, and history of diabetes mellitus as the principal covariates of SDB. The presence of snoring, nocturnal choking, unrefreshing sleep, recurrent awakening from sleep, daytime hypersomnolence, and daytime fatigue was each statistically significant for identifying patients with OSAHS. The higher prevalence of OSAHS in urban Indian men is striking and may have major public health implications in a developing country.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200302-265oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2033770922", "source": "openalex"}

Systolic and diastolic BP were measured every 15 min via an appropriately sized arm cuff, using an automated system. This was tolerated by the children without inducing arousals from sleep. Children with OSAS had a significantly higher diastolic BP than those with PS (p < 0.001 for sleep and p < 0.005 for wakefulness). There was no significant difference in systolic BP between the two groups. Multiple linear regression showed that blood pressure could be predicted by apnea index, body mass index, and age. Blood pressure during sleep was lower than during wakefulness (p < 0.001 for diastole and p < 0.01 for systole), but did not differ significantly between rapid eye movement (REM) and non–REM sleep.

Thus, sleep loss evokes a proportional increase in delta power, and excess sleep a decrease. Therefore, delta power is thought to reflect SWS need and its underlying homeostatically regulated recovery process. The neurophysiological substrate of this process is unknown and forward genetics might help elucidate the nature of what is depleted during wakefulness and recovered during SWS. We applied a mathematical method that quantifies the relationship between the sleep–wake distribution and delta power to sleep data of six inbred mouse strains. The results demonstrated that the rate at which SWS need accumulated varied greatly with genotype. This conclusion was confirmed in a “dose–response” study of sleep loss and changes in delta power; delta power strongly depended on both the duration of prior wakefulness and genotype. We followed the segregation of the rebound of delta power after sleep deprivation in 25 BXD recombinant inbred strains by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. One “significant” QTL was identified on chromosome 13 that accounted for 49% of the genetic variance in this trait. Interestingly, the rate at which SWS need decreases did not vary with genotype in any of the 31 inbred strains studied.

Our structured search revealed 141 articles for systematic scrutiny, of which 87 were suitable for inclusion in the evidence base, including 15 Level I to II randomized controlled trials and 5 of these trials with placebo-controlled treatment. The efficacy of OAs was established for controlling OSA in some but not all patients with success (defined as no more than 10 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) achieved in an average of 52% of treated patients. Effects on sleepiness and quality of life were also demonstrated, but improvements in other neurocognitive outcomes were not consistent. The mechanism of OA therapy is related to opening of the upper airway as demonstrated by imaging and physiologic monitoring. Treatment adherence is variable with patients reporting using the appliance a median of 77% of nights at 1 year. Minor adverse effects were frequent whereas major adverse effects were uncommon. Minor tooth movement and small changes in the occlusion developed in some patients after prolonged use, but the long-term dental significance of this is uncertain. In comparison to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), OAs are less efficacious in reducing the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), but OAs appear to be used more (at least by self report), and in many studies were preferred over CPAP when the treatments were compared. OAs have also been compared favorably to surgical modification of the upper airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, UPPP). Comparisons between OAs of different designs have produced variable findings. The literature of OA therapy for OSA now provides better evidence for the efficacy of this treatment modality and considerable guidance regarding the frequency of adverse effects and the indications for use in comparison to CPAP and UPPP.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/29.2.244", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158367419", "source": "openalex"}

All subjects were free of hypertension or other CVD, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, psychiatric disorder, alcohol dependency, as well as malignancy at baseline. Data were collected via the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register covering a 7-year period before December 31, 1998, as well as questionnaires. Effectiveness of OSA treatment initiated during the period as well as age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at baseline, and smoking habits were controlled. The incidence of at least one CVD was observed in 22 of 60 (36.7%) cases with OSA (overnight oxygen desaturations of 30 or more) compared with in 8 of 122 (6.6%) subjects without OSA (p < 0.001). In a multiple logistic regression model, significant predictors of CVD incidence were OSA at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-13.6) and age (OR 23.4; 95% CI, 2.7-197.5) after adjustment for BMI, SBP, and DBP at baseline.

Because of high levels of heterogeneity across studies, narrative syntheses were employed. A total of 141 articles (110 unique samples), including 592 215 unique participants from 40 different countries, met inclusion criteria. Overall, longer sleep duration was associated with lower adiposity indicators, better emotional regulation, better academic achievement, and better quality of life/well-being. The evidence was mixed and/or limited for the association between sleep duration and cognition, harms/injuries, and cardiometabolic biomarkers. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high across study designs and health indicators. In conclusion, we confirmed previous investigations showing that shorter sleep duration is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes. However, the available evidence relies heavily on cross-sectional studies using self-reported sleep.

Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.12710", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2803304487", "source": "openalex"}

These evidence-based practice parameters are an update to the Practice Parameters for the Use of Actigraphy in the Clinical Assessment of Sleep Disorders, published in 1995. These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the role of actigraphy, which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of actigraphy. Actigraphy is reliable and valid for detecting sleep in normal, healthy populations, but less reliable for detecting disturbed sleep. Although actigraphy is not indicated for the routine diagnosis, assessment, or management of any of the sleep disorders, it may serve as a useful adjunct to routine clinical evaluation of insomnia, circadian-rhythm disorders, and excessive sleepiness, and may be helpful in the assessment of specific aspects of some disorders, such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder. The assessment of daytime sleepiness, the demonstration of multiday human-rest activity patterns, and the estimation of sleep-wake patterns are potential uses of actigraphy in clinical situations where other techniques cannot provide similar information (e.g., psychiatric ward patients). Superiority of actigraphy placement on different parts of the body is not currently established. Actigraphy may be useful in characterizing and monitoring circadian rhythm patterns or disturbances in certain special populations (e.g., children, demented individuals), and appears useful as an outcome measure in certain applications and populations. Although actigraphy may be a useful adjunct to portable sleep apnea testing, the use of actigraphy alone in the detection of sleep apnea is not currently established. Specific technical recommendations are discussed, such as using concomitant completion of a sleep log for artifact rejection and timing of lights out and on; conducting actigraphy studies for a minimum of three consecutive 24-hour periods; requiring raw data inspection; permitting some preprocessing of movement counts; stating that epoch lengths up to 1 minute are usually sufficient, except for circadian rhythm assessment; requiring interpretation to be performed manually by visual inspection; and allowing automatic scoring in addition to manual scoring methods.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/26.3.337", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100582107", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: This was a prospective, cohort study of healthy nulliparous women, recruited between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation, who completed a baseline sleep survey at enrollment with follow-up in the third trimester. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Disordered Breathing, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, National Institutes of Health/International Restless Legs Syndrome Question Set, Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Differences in sleep characteristics between the baseline and third trimester were compared using the paired t test or McNemar test for continuous or categorical data, respectively. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine women completed both baseline and follow-up sleep surveys. The mean gestational age was 13.8 (±3.8) and 30.0 (±2.2) weeks at the first and second surveys, respectively. Compared with the baseline assessment, mean sleep duration was significantly shorter (7.4 [±1.2] hours compared with 7.0 [±1.3] hours, P<.001), and the proportion of patients who reported frequent snoring (at least three nights per week) was significantly greater (11% compared with 16.4%, P=.03) in the third trimester. The percentage of patients who met diagnostic criteria for restless leg syndrome increased from 17.5% at recruitment to 31.2% in the third trimester (P=.001). Overall poor sleep quality, as defined by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score greater than 5, became significantly more common as pregnancy progressed (39.0% compared with 53.5%, P=.001).

This information is, however, incomplete. Methods: We retrospectively examined video‐EEG monitoring reports from our comprehensive epilepsy center. We recorded seizure type, site of onset (for partial seizures), sleep state at onset, and whether partial seizures secondarily generalized. Seizures arising from sleep were then reviewed to determine sleep state. Results: We analyzed 1,116 seizures in 188 patients. Thirty‐five percent of complex partial seizures (CPSs) starting during sleep underwent secondary generalization compared with 18% in wakefulness (p &lt; 0.0001). Frontal lobe CPSs secondarily generalized at equal rates during sleep (22%) and wakefulness (20%), but temporal lobe CPSs generalized much more frequently during sleep (45%) than in wakefulness (19%; p &lt; 0,0001). Frontal lobe seizures were more likely to occur during sleep (37%) than were temporal lobe seizures (26%; p = 0.0068). CPSs were more frequent in stages 1 and 2 and occurred rarely during REM. Seizures starting during slow‐wave sleep were significantly longer than seizures starting during wakefulness or stage 2 sleep. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) were rare between midnight and 6 a.m. and never occurred during sleep. Conclusions: Sleep has a pronounced effect on secondary generalization of partial seizures, especially those of temporal lobe origin. Frontal lobe seizures occur more often during sleep than do temporal lobe seizures, and occurrence during sleep helps to distinguish PNESs from CPSs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01077.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2092844406", "source": "openalex"}

The present study examined the learning‐dependent changes in sleep, including Stage 2 sleep spindles. Following an intense period of simple motor procedural learning, the duration of Stage 2 sleep and spindle density increased. There were no changes observed in the duration of any other stage of sleep or in the density of rapid eye movements.

We analyzed polysomnographic studies from 20 children with OSAS and 10 control subjects. Sleep architecture was similar between the groups. Of obstructive apneas 55% occurred during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The apnea index, apnea duration, and degree of desaturation were greater during REM than non-REM sleep. OSAS data from the first and third periods of the night (periods A and C) were compared. Both the overall and the REM apnea index increased between periods A and C (11 to 25/h, p < 0.02; and 24 to 51/h, p < 0.01, respectively). There was no difference in SaO2 over time. Spontaneous arousals, but not respiratory-related arousals, were more frequent during non-REM than REM sleep; these did not change from periods A to C. We conclude that children with OSAS have normal sleep stage distribution. OSAS is predominantly a REM phenomenon in children. Obstructive apnea worsens over the course of the night, independent of the changing amounts of REM sleep.

As a first step in this direction, the authors employed high-density EEG to explore whether sleep rhythms differ between schizophrenia subjects, healthy individuals, and a psychiatric control group with a history of depression. Method: Healthy comparison subjects (N=17), medicated schizophrenia patients (N=18), and subjects with a history of depression (N=15) were recruited. Subjects were recorded during the first sleep episode of the night with a 256-electrode high-density EEG. Recordings were analyzed for changes in EEG power spectra, power topography, and sleep-specific cortical oscillations. Results: The authors found that the schizophrenia group had a significant reduction in centroparietal EEG power, from 13.75 to 15.00 Hz, in relation to both the comparison and depression groups. No significant difference in EEG power between the comparison and depression groups was identified. The authors also found a decrease in sleep spindle number, amplitude, duration, and integrated spindle activity in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, integrated spindle activity had an effect size corresponding to 93.0% or 90.2% separation of the schizophrenia from the comparison or depression group. Conclusions: Sleep spindles are generated by the thalamic reticular nucleus in conjunction with specific thalamic nuclei and are modulated by corticothalamic and thalamocortical connections. The deficit in sleep spindles in schizophrenia subjects may reflect dysfunction in thalamic-reticular and thalamocortical mechanisms and could represent a biological marker of illness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.2007.164.3.483", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077633827", "source": "openalex"}

Because there are no controlled studies showing a substantial effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy on hypertension in OSA, the impact of treatment on cardiovascular sequelae has been questioned altogether. Therefore, we studied the effect of nCPAP on arterial hypertension in patients with OSA.Sixty consecutive patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomly assigned to either effective or subtherapeutic nCPAP for 9 weeks on average. Nocturnal polysomnography and continuous noninvasive blood pressure recording for 19 hours was performed before and with treatment. Thirty two patients, 16 in each group, completed the study. Apneas and hypopneas were reduced by approximately 95% and 50% in the therapeutic and subtherapeutic groups, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 9.9+/-11.4 mm Hg with effective nCPAP treatment, whereas no relevant change occurred with subtherapeutic nCPAP (P=0.01). Mean, diastolic, and systolic blood pressures all decreased significantly by approximately 10 mm Hg, both at night and during the day.Effective nCPAP treatment in patients with moderate to severe OSA leads to a substantial reduction in both day and night arterial blood pressure. The fact that a 50% reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index did not result in a decrease in blood pressure emphasizes the importance of highly effective treatment.

Clinically meaningful effects of melatonin treatment have been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials in humans, particularly in disorders associated with diminished or misaligned melatonin rhythms, for example, circadian rhythm-related sleep disorders, jet lag and shift work, insomnia in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, poor (non-restorative) sleep quality, non-dipping nocturnal blood pressure (nocturnal hypertension) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diminished production of melatonin at the very early stages of AD, the role of melatonin in the restorative value of sleep (perceived sleep quality) and its sleep-anticipating effects resulting in attenuated activation of certain brain networks are gaining a new perspective as the role of poor sleep quality in the build-up of β amyloid, particularly in the precuneus, is unravelled. As a result of the recently discovered relationship between circadian clock, sleep and neurodegeneration, new prospects of using melatonin for early intervention, to promote healthy physical and mental ageing, are of prime interest in view of the emerging link to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.

The 21 publications selected for this review describe 320 patients treated with oral appliances for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. The appliances modify the upper airway by changing the posture of the mandible and tongue. Despite considerable variation in the design of these appliances, the clinical effects are remarkably consistent. Snoring is improved and often eliminated in almost all patients who use oral appliances. Obstructive sleep apnea improves in the majority of patients; the mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in this group of patients was reduced from 47 to 19. Approximately half of treated patients achieved an AHI of < 10; however, as many as 40% of those treated were left with significantly elevated AHIs. Improvement in sleep quality and sleepiness reflects the effect on breathing. Limited follow-up data indicate that oral discomfort is a common but tolerable side effect, that dental and mandibular complications appear to be uncommon and that long-term compliance varies from 50% to 100% of patients. Comparison of the risk and benefit of oral appliance therapy with the other available treatments suggests that oral appliances present a useful alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), especially for patients with simple snoring and patients with obstructive sleep apnea who cannot tolerate CPAP therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/18.6.501", "url": "https://openalex.org/W185591369", "source": "openalex"}

Relatively recent changes to our environments, such as the introduction of artificial lighting, can disorganize the circadian system, from the level of the molecular clocks that regulate the timing of cellular activities to the level of synchronization between our daily cycles of behavior and the solar day. Sleep/wake cycles are intertwined with the circadian system, and global trends indicate that these, too, are increasingly subject to disruption. A large proportion of the world's population is at increased risk of environmentally driven circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, and a minority of individuals are also genetically predisposed to circadian misalignment and sleep disorders. The consequences of disruption to the circadian system and sleep are profound and include myriad metabolic ramifications, some of which may be compounded by adverse effects on dietary choices. If not addressed, the deleterious effects of such disruption will continue to cause widespread health problems; therefore, implementation of the numerous behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions that can help restore circadian system alignment and enhance sleep will be important.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/er.2016-1083", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2536709198", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects underwent annual evaluation for AD with 19 neuropsychological tests. Over a follow-up period of up to 6 years (mean 3.3 years), 97 individuals developed AD. In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for age, sex, and education, a higher level of sleep fragmentation was associated with an increased risk of AD (HR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.03-1.44, P = 0.02 per 1SD increase in sleep fragmentation). An individual with high sleep fragmentation (90th percentile) had a 1.5-fold risk of developing AD as compared with someone with low sleep fragmentation (10th percentile). The association of sleep fragmentation with incident AD did not vary along demographic lines and was unchanged after controlling for potential confounders including total daily rest time, chronic medical conditions, and the use of common medications which can affect sleep. In a linear mixed effect analysis, a 0.01 unit increase in sleep fragmentation was associated with a 22% increase in the annual rate of cognitive decline relative to the average rate of decline in the cohort (Estimate = -0.016, SE = 0.007, P = 0.03).Sleep fragmentation in older adults is associated with incident AD and the rate of cognitive decline.Lim ASP; Kowgier M; Yu L; Buchman AS; Bennett DA.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether quantifying the severity of sleep apnoea by the 'hypoxic burden' would predict mortality among adults aged 40 and older. The samples were derived from two cohort studies: The Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men (MrOS), which included 2743 men, age 76.3 ± 5.5 years; and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), which included 5111 middle-aged and older adults (52.8% women), age: 63.7 ± 10.9 years. The outcomes were all-cause and Cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality. The hypoxic burden was determined by measuring the respiratory event-associated area under the desaturation curve from pre-event baseline. Cox models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios for hypoxic burden. Unlike the AHI, the hypoxic burden strongly predicted CVD mortality and all-cause mortality (only in MrOS). Individuals in the MrOS study with hypoxic burden in the highest two quintiles had hazard ratios of 1.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–2.62] and 2.73 (95% CI 1.71–4.36), respectively. Similarly, the group in the SHHS with hypoxic burden in the highest quintile had a hazard ratio of 1.96 (95% CI 1.11–3.43). The 'hypoxic burden', an easily derived signal from overnight sleep study, predicts CVD mortality across populations. The findings suggest that not only the frequency but the depth and duration of sleep related upper airway obstructions, are important disease characterizing features.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy624", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2898815338", "source": "openalex"}

The latter is an inflammatory cytokine, which causes sickness manifestations, including somnolence and fatigue, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In this study, we examined: 1) the relation between serial measurements of plasma IL-6 and quantity and depth of sleep, evaluated by polysomnography; and 2) the effects of sleep deprivation on the nyctohemeral pattern of IL-6 secretion. Eight healthy young male volunteers were sampled for 24 h twice, at the baseline state, after a normal night's sleep and after total overnight sleep deprivation. At the baseline state, IL-6 was secreted in a biphasic circadian pattern with two nadirs at 0800 and 2100 and two zeniths at 1900 and 0500 (P < 0.01). The baseline amount of sleep correlated negatively with the overall daytime secretion of the cytokine (P < 0.05). Also, depth of sleep at baseline correlated negatively with the postdeprivation increase of daytime secretion of IL-6 (P < 0.05). Sleep deprivation changed the temporal pattern of circadian IL-6 secretion but not the overall amount. Indeed, during the post-deprivation period, the mean daytime (0800-2200 h) levels of IL-6 were significantly higher (P < 0.05), whereas the nighttime (2200-0600 h) levels were lower than the predeprivation values. Thus, sleep-deprived subjects had daytime oversecretion and nighttime under-secretion of IL-6; the former might be responsible for their daylong somnolence and fatigue, the latter for the better quality (depth) of their sleep. These data suggest that a good night's sleep is associated with decreased daytime secretion of IL-6 and a good sense of well-being and that good sleep is associated with decreased exposure of tissues to the proinflammatory and potentially detrimental actions of IL-6. Sleep deprivation increases daytime IL-6 and causes somnolence and fatigue during the next day, whereas postdeprivation decreases nighttime IL-6 and is associated with deeper sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.84.8.5894", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155954337", "source": "openalex"}

Although sleep disturbances are typical features of depression, such symptoms sometimes appear prior to an episode of depression. The bidirectional associations between sleep disturbance (especially insomnia) and depression increase the difficulty of differentiating cause-and-effect relationships between them. Longitudinal studies have consistently identified insomnia as a risk factor for the development of a new-onset or recurrent depression, and this association has been identified in young, middle-aged, and older adults. Studies have also observed that the combination of insomnia and depression influences the trajectory of depression, increasing episode severity and duration as well as relapse rates. Fortunately, recent studies have demonstrated that both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia may favorably reduce and possibly prevent depression.

The patients were seen at the Mayo Sleep Disorders Center between January 1, 1991 and July 31, 1995. Eighty-one patients (87%) were male. The mean age of RBD onset was 60.9 years (range 36-84 years) and the mean age at presentation was 64.4 years (37-85 years). Thirty-two per cent of patients had injured themselves and 64% had assaulted their spouses. Subdural haematomas occurred in two patients. Dream content was altered and involved defence of the sleeper against attack in 87%. The frequency of nocturnal events decreased with time in seven untreated patients with neurodegenerative disease. MRI or CT head scans were performed in 56% of patients. Although four scans showed brainstem pathology, all of these patients had apparently unrelated neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with RBD. Neurological disorders were present in 57% of patients; Parkinson's disease, dementia without parkinsonism and multiple system atrophy accounted for all but 14% of these. RBD developed before parkinsonism in 52% of the patients with Parkinson's disease. Five of the 14 patients with multiple system atrophy were female, and thus the strong male predominance in RBD is less evident in this condition. Psychiatric disorders, drug use or drug withdrawal were rarely causally related to RBD. Clonazepam treatment of RBD was completely or partially successful in 87% of the patients who used the drug. We conclude that RBD is a well-defined condition and that descriptions from different centres are fairly consistent. It is commonest in elderly males and may result in serious morbidity to patients and bed partners. There is a strong relationship to neurodegenerative disease, especially Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia, and neurologists should explore the possibility of RBD in patients with these conditions. RBD symptoms may be the first manifestations of these disorders and careful follow-up is needed. Neuroimaging is unlikely to reveal underlying disorders not suspected clinically. We confirm the effectiveness of clonazepam, but note that attention to the safety of the bed environment may be sufficient for patients with contraindications to the drug.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/123.2.331", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2057134922", "source": "openalex"}

Due to the extensive nature of the disorders covered, the review was written in two sections. The first review paper, in addition to providing a general introduction to circadian biology, addresses “exogenous” circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including shift work disorder (SWD) and jet lag disorder (JLD). The second review paper addresses the “endogenous” circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD), delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), irregular sleep-wake rhythm (ISWR), and the non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome (nonentrained type) or freerunning disorder (FRD). These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the AASM to present recommendations for the assessment and treatment of CRSDs based on the two accompanying comprehensive reviews. The main diagnostic tools considered include sleep logs, actigraphy, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), circadian phase markers, and polysomnography. Use of a sleep log or diary is indicated in the assessment of patients with a suspected circadian rhythm sleep disorder (Guideline). Actigraphy is indicated to assist in evaluation of patients suspected of circadian rhythm disorders (strength of recommendation varies from “Option” to “Guideline,” depending on the suspected CRSD). Polysomnography is not routinely indicated for the diagnosis of CRSDs, but may be indicated to rule out another primary sleep disorder (Standard). There is insufficient evidence to justify the use of MEQ for the routine clinical evaluation of CRSDs (Option). Circadian phase markers are useful to determine circadian phase and confirm the diagnosis of FRD in sighted and unsighted patients but there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use in the diagnosis of SWD, JLD, ASPD, DSPD, or ISWR (Option). Additionally, actigraphy is useful as an outcome measure in evaluating the response to treatment for CRSDs (Guideline). A range of therapeutic interventions were considered including planned sleep schedules, timed light exposure, timed melatonin doses, hypnotics, stimulants, and alerting agents. Planned or prescribed sleep schedules are indicated in SWD (Standard) and in JLD, DSPD, ASPD, ISWR (excluding elderly-demented/nursing home residents), and FRD (Option). Specifically dosed and timed light exposure is indicated for each of the circadian disorders with variable success (Option). Timed melatonin administration is indicated for JLD (Standard); SWD, DSPD, and FRD in unsighted persons (Guideline); and for ASPD, FRD in sighted individuals, and for ISWR in children with moderate to severe psychomotor retardation (Option). Hypnotic medications may be indicated to promote or improve daytime sleep among night shift workers (Guideline) and to treat jet lag-induced insomnia (Option). Stimulants may be indicated to improve alertness in JLD and SWD (Option) but may have risks that must be weighed prior to use. Modafinil may be indicated to improve alertness during the night shift for patients with SWD (Guideline).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/30.11.1445", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1480559618", "source": "openalex"}

Given that adolescents often experience shortened sleep on school nights, we sought to better understand the effect of experimentally induced chronic sleep restriction on adolescents’ mood and mood regulation. Methods Fifty healthy adolescents, ages 14–17, completed a 3‐week sleep manipulation protocol involving a baseline week, followed by a sleep restriction ( SR ) condition (6.5 hr in bed per night for five nights) and healthy sleep duration ( HS ) condition (10 hr in bed per night for five nights). The study used a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover experimental design. Participants’ sleep was monitored at home via self‐report and actigraphy. At the end of each condition, participants and their parents completed questionnaires of mood and mood regulation. To assess for expectancy effects, we also analyzed parent and teen ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, which prior research suggests is not sensitive to SR in adolescents. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests compared questionnaire outcomes across the two conditions. Results Participants averaged 2.5 more hours of sleep per night during HS relative to SR . Compared with HS , adolescents rated themselves as significantly more tense/anxious, angry/hostile, confused, and fatigued, and as less vigorous (p = .001–.01) during SR . Parents and adolescents also reported greater oppositionality/irritability and poorer emotional regulation during SR compared with HS ( p &lt; .05). There were no cross‐condition differences in depression or hyperactivity/impulsivity ( p &gt; .05).

Groups were formed based on patient's average nocturnal sleep patterns, including short, normal, and long sleep groups, and were compared on headache variables.Sleep complaints were common and associated with headache in a sizeable proportion of patients. Over half of migraineurs reported difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep at least occasionally. Many in this sample reported chronically shortened sleep patterns similar to that observed in persons with insomnia, with 38% of patients sleeping on average 6 hours per night. Migraines were triggered by sleep disturbance in 50% of patients. \"Awakening headaches\" or headaches awakening them from sleep were reported by 71% of patients. Interestingly, sleep was also a common palliative agent for headache; 85% of migraineurs indicated that they chose to sleep or rest because of headache and 75% were forced to sleep or rest because of headache. Patients with chronic migraine reported shorter nightly sleep times than those with episodic migraine, and were more likely to exhibit trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, sleep triggering headache, and choosing to sleep because of headache. Short sleepers (ie, average sleep period 6 hours) exhibited significantly more frequent and more severe headaches than individuals who slept longer and were more likely to exhibit morning headaches on awakening.These data support earlier research and anecdotal observations of a substantial sleep/migraine relationship, and implicate sleep disturbance in specific headache patterns and severity. The short sleep group, who routinely slept 6 hours per night, exhibited the more severe headache patterns and more sleep-related headache. Sleep complaints occurred with greater frequency among chronic than episodic migraineurs. Future research may identify possible mediating factors such as primary sleep and mood disorders. Prospective studies are needed to determine if normalizing sleep times in the short sleeps would impact headache threshold.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-4610.2005.05159.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006774907", "source": "openalex"}

Here we explore whether rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and aspects of its unique neurophysiology, underlie these convergent influences on memory. Using a nap paradigm, we measured the consolidation of neutral and negative emotional memories, and the association with REM-sleep electrophysiology. Subjects that napped showed a consolidation benefit for emotional but not neutral memories. The No-Nap control group showed no evidence of a consolidation benefit for either memory type. Within the Nap group, the extent of emotional memory facilitation was significantly correlated with the amount of REM sleep and also with right-dominant prefrontal theta power during REM. Together, these data support the role of REM-sleep neurobiology in the consolidation of emotional human memories, findings that have direct translational implications for affective psychiatric and mood disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhn155", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139705940", "source": "openalex"}

Approximately 34% and 17% of middle-aged men and women, respectively, meet the diagnostic criteria for OSA. Sleep disturbances are common and underdiagnosed among middle-aged and older adults, and the prevalence varies by race/ethnicity, sex, and obesity status. OSA prevalence is as high as 40% to 80% in patients with hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Despite its high prevalence in patients with heart disease and the vulnerability of cardiac patients to OSA-related stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, OSA is often underrecognized and undertreated in cardiovascular practice. We recommend screening for OSA in patients with resistant/poorly controlled hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and recurrent atrial fibrillation after either cardioversion or ablation. In patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing or excessive daytime sleepiness, a formal sleep assessment is reasonable. In patients with tachy-brady syndrome or ventricular tachycardia or survivors of sudden cardiac death in whom sleep apnea is suspected after a comprehensive sleep assessment, evaluation for sleep apnea should be considered. After stroke, clinical equipoise exists with respect to screening and treatment. Patients with nocturnally occurring angina, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or appropriate shocks from implanted cardioverter-defibrillators may be especially likely to have comorbid sleep apnea. All patients with OSA should be considered for treatment, including behavioral modifications and weight loss as indicated. Continuous positive airway pressure should be offered to patients with severe OSA, whereas oral appliances can be considered for those with mild to moderate OSA or for continuous positive airway pressure-intolerant patients.

Patients and controls showed no significant differences in conventional sleep variables, but bruxers showed a significantly higher number of the transient arousals characterized by EEG desynchronization.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that patients with heart failure have less sleepiness and sleep less compared with subjects without heart failure for a given severity of OSA.Sleepiness assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and sleep structure measured with polysomnography were compared among 155 consecutive patients with heart failure and from a random community sample (n = 1139) according to categories of the apnea-hypopnea index (<5, no OSA; 5-14, mild OSA; and > or =15, moderate to severe OSA).Compared with the community sample, for any given severity of OSA, patients with heart failure had lower mean +/- SE Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (7.1 +/- 0.4 vs 8.3 +/- 0.2 [P = .005]; 6.7 +/- 0.7 vs 9.2 +/- 0.3 [P < .001]; and 7.8 +/- 0.7 vs 9.8 +/- 0.4 [P = .01]), indicating less sleepiness despite sleeping less (total sleep time mean +/- SE [in minutes]: 306 +/- 7 vs 384 +/- 2, 295 +/- 19 vs 384 +/- 5, and 285 +/- 13 vs 359 +/- 7 for no, mild, and moderate to severe OSA, respectively; P < .001 for all comparisons).Patients with heart failure have less subjective daytime sleepiness compared with individuals from a community sample, despite significantly reduced sleep time, whether or not they have OSA.

Methods c-Fos expression in sleep-promoting brain nuclei was assessed in rats using immunohistochemistry and hybridization. Next, the authors perturbed these pathways using (1) discrete lesions induced by ibotenic acid, (2) local and systemic administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABA ) receptor antagonist gabazine, or (3) alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist atipamezole in rats, and (4) genetic mutation of the alpha -adrenoceptor in mice. Results Dexmedetomidine induced a qualitatively similar pattern of c-Fos expression in rats as seen during normal NREM sleep, a decrease in the locus ceruleus (LC) and tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and an increase in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). These changes were attenuated by atipamezole and were not seen in mice lacking functional alpha2a-adrenoceptors, which do not show a sedative response to dexmedetomidine. Bilateral VLPO lesions attenuated the sedative response to dexmedetomidine, and the dose-response curve to dexmedetomidine was shifted right by gabazine administered systemically or directly into the TMN. VLPO lesions and gabazine pretreatment altered c-Fos expression in the TMN but in not the LC after dexmedetomidine administration, indicating a hierarchical sequence of changes. Conclusions The authors propose that endogenous sleep pathways are causally involved in dexmedetomidine-induced sedation; dexmedetomidine's sedative mechanism involves inhibition of the LC, which disinhibits VLPO firing. The increased release of GABA at the terminals of the VLPO inhibits TMN firing, which is required for the sedative response.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200302000-00024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017573472", "source": "openalex"}

A mounting body of evidence suggests that dreaming and REM sleep are dissociable states, and that dreaming is controlled by forebrain mechanisms. Recent neuropsychological, radiological, and pharmacological findings suggest that the cholinergic brain stem mechanisms that control the REM state can only generate the psychological phenomena of dreaming through the mediation of a second, probably dopaminergic, forebrain mechanism. The latter mechanism (and thus dreaming itself) can also be activated by a variety of nonREM triggers. Dreaming can be manipulated by dopamine agonists and antagonists with no concomitant change in REM frequency, duration, and density. Dreaming can also be induced by focal forebrain stimulation and by complex partial (forebrain) seizures during nonREM sleep, when the involvement of brainstem REM mechanisms is precluded. Likewise, dreaming is obliterated by focal lesions along a specific (probably dopaminergic) forebrain pathway, and these lesions do not have any appreciable effects on REM frequency, duration, and density. These findings suggest that the forebrain mechanism in question is the final common path to dreaming and that the brainstem oscillator that controls the REM state is just one of the many arousal triggers that can activate this forebrain mechanism. The “REM-on” mechanism (like its various NREM equivalents) therefore stands outside the dream process itself, which is mediated by an independent, forebrain “dream-on” mechanism.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x00003988", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2029173584", "source": "openalex"}

As people age, they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep. Older people spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep than in deep sleep. As the circadian mechanism in older people becomes less efficient, their sleep schedule is shifted forward. Even when they manage to obtain 7 or 8 h sleep, they wake up early, as they have gone to sleep quite early. The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher among older adults. Loud snoring, which is more common in the elderly, can be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea, which puts a person at risk for cardiovascular diseases, headaches, memory loss, and depression.

RESULTS IVGTT-derived insulin sensitivity was reduced by (means ± SD) 20 ± 24% after sleep restriction (P = 0.001), without significant alterations in the insulin secretory response. Similarly, insulin sensitivity assessed by clamp was reduced by 11 ± 5.5% (P &amp;lt; 0.04) after sleep restriction. Glucose tolerance and the disposition index were reduced by sleep restriction. These outcomes were not affected by modafinil treatment. Changes in insulin sensitivity did not correlate with changes in salivary cortisol (increase of 51 ± 8% with sleep restriction, P &amp;lt; 0.02), urinary catecholamines, or slow wave sleep. CONCLUSIONS Sleep restriction (5 h/night) for 1 week significantly reduces insulin sensitivity, raising concerns about effects of chronic insufficient sleep on disease processes associated with insulin resistance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2337/db09-0699", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162026342", "source": "openalex"}

Most recently, sleep has been implicated in the continued development of motor-skill learning following initial acquisition. However, the temporal evolution of motor learning before and after sleep, the effects of different training regimens, and the long-term development of motor learning across multiple nights of sleep remain unknown. Here, we report data for subjects trained and retested on a sequential finger-tapping task across multiple days. The findings demonstrate firstly that following initial training, small practice-dependent improvements are possible before, but not following the large practice-independent gains that develop across a night of sleep. Secondly, doubling the quantity of initial training does not alter the amount of subsequent sleep-dependent learning that develops overnight. Thirdly, the amount of sleep-dependent learning does not correlate with the amount of practice-dependent learning achieved during training, suggesting the existence of two discrete motor-learning processes. Finally, whereas the majority of sleep-dependent motor-skill learning develops during the first night of sleep following training, additional nights of sleep still offer continued improvements.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.58503", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086009184", "source": "openalex"}

We postulate that during wakefulness, increased pharyngeal dilator muscle activity in apnea patients compensates for diminished airway size thus maintaining patency. We studied the waking genioglossus (GG) electromyogram (EMG) activity in 11 OSA patients and 14 age-matched controls to determine if GG activity is higher in the awake state in apnea patients than controls. To make this determination, we developed a reproducible methodology whereby true maximal GG EMG could be defined and thus basal activity quantitated as a percentage of this maximal value. Therefore, direct comparisons of basal activity between individuals was possible. We observed apnea patients to have significantly greater basal genioglossal activity compared to controls (40.6 +/- 5.6% vs. 12.7 +/- 1.7% of maximum). This difference persisted when size-matched subsets were compared. This augmented GG activity in apnea patients could be reduced with positive airway pressure. We speculate that this neuromuscular compensation present during wakefulness in apnea patients may be lost during sleep leading to airway collapse.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci115751", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139404323", "source": "openalex"}

Seven patients presented with paranoia and paranoid delusions. Overnight sleep recordings and standard multiple daytime sleep latency test were performed. The results were compared to those of 10 similar patients with PD not experiencing hallucinations. <b><i>Results:</i></b> RBD was detected in all 10 patients with hallucinations and in six without.

In the latter protocol, the contribution of a sleep/wake dependent process and a circadian process to alertness and performance were separated by folding the data at either the period of the sleep/wake cycle or at the period of the endogenous circadian body temperature rhythm. This analysis revealed that prior wakefulness within a range of 0-18 h significantly reduced alertness and performance and that the circadian rhythm of core body temperature paralleled the circadian rhythm of alertness and performance. During the first 16 h of the constant routine protocol, which coincided with the subjects' habitual period of wakefulness, alertness and performance remained at a stable level.

We hypothesized that OSA affects functional and structural properties of large arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis progression.Twelve healthy volunteers, 15 patients with mild to moderate OSA, and 15 with severe OSA matched for age, sex, and body mass index were studied by using (1) full standard overnight polysomnography; (2) carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity with a noninvasive automatic device; and (3) a high-definition echo-tracking device to measure intima-media thickness, diameter, and distensibility.

This provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly observe prodromal neurodegenerative states, and potentially intervene with neuroprotective therapy. For future neuroprotective trials, it is essential to accurately estimate phenoconversion rate and identify potential predictors of phenoconversion. This study assessed the neurodegenerative disease risk and predictors of neurodegeneration in a large multicentre cohort of iRBD. We combined prospective follow-up data from 24 centres of the International RBD Study Group. At baseline, patients with polysomnographically-confirmed iRBD without parkinsonism or dementia underwent sleep, motor, cognitive, autonomic and special sensory testing. Patients were then prospectively followed, during which risk of dementia and parkinsonsim were assessed. The risk of dementia and parkinsonism was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Predictors of phenoconversion were assessed with Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for age, sex, and centre. Sample size estimates for disease-modifying trials were calculated using a time-to-event analysis. Overall, 1280 patients were recruited. The average age was 66.3 ± 8.4 and 82.5% were male. Average follow-up was 4.6 years (range = 1-19 years). The overall conversion rate from iRBD to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome was 6.3% per year, with 73.5% converting after 12-year follow-up. The rate of phenoconversion was significantly increased with abnormal quantitative motor testing [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.16], objective motor examination (HR = 3.03), olfactory deficit (HR = 2.62), mild cognitive impairment (HR = 1.91-2.37), erectile dysfunction (HR = 2.13), motor symptoms (HR = 2.11), an abnormal DAT scan (HR = 1.98), colour vision abnormalities (HR = 1.69), constipation (HR = 1.67), REM atonia loss (HR = 1.54), and age (HR = 1.54).

Sleep quality was expressed as two variables, total sleep time and sleep disturbance time obtained by 24-hour wrist actigraphy. Percent body fat and body mass index (BMI) were used together to define obesity. The potential influence of demographic and behavioral confounders were considered in models that described the relation of sleep to obesity occurrence.

Underdeveloped structures or pre-existing damage in brain areas may also contribute to the genesis of the syndrome. Brain morphology in 21 patients with OSA and in 21 control subjects was assessed using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional brain images were obtained with voxels of approximately 1 mm3. Images were spatially normalized and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. For each segment, regional volumetric differences were determined relative to age, handedness, and group (patients with OSA versus control subjects), using voxel-based morphometry, with OSA effects weighted by disease severity. A significant age effect on total gray matter was found in control subjects but not in patients with OSA. Diminished regional and often unilateral gray matter loss was apparent in multiple sites of the brain in patients with OSA, including the frontal and parietal cortex, temporal lobe, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Unilateral loss in well-perfused structures suggests onset of neural deficits early in the OSA syndrome. The gray matter loss occurs within sites involved in motor regulation of the upper airway as well as in areas contributing to cognitive function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200201-050oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2015667309", "source": "openalex"}

All night oximetry was then performed at home and the tracing analysed for the number of dips in SaO2 of more than 4%. Subjects with more than five dips of 4% SaO2 or more per hour were invited for sleep laboratory polysomnography. Seventeen per cent of the men admitted to snoring \"often.\" Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.2%), cigarette consumption (r2 = 3.4%), and nasal stuffiness (r2 = 2%) as the only significant independent predictors of snoring. Together these account for at least a sixfold variation in the likelihood of being an \"often\" snorer. Forty six subjects (5%) had greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates of over five an hour and 31 of these had full sleep studies. Three subjects had clinically obvious and severe symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea, giving a prevalence of three per 1001 men (0.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.9%). Eighteen men had obstructive sleep apnoea only when supine and in 10 the cause of the SaO2 dipping on the original home tracing was not elucidated. The greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates correlated with the history of snoring. Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.9%), alcohol consumption (r2 = 3.7%), age (r2 = 1%) and obesity (r2 = 1%) as the only significant independent predictors of the rate of overnight hypoxic dipping. This study shows that snoring in this randomly selected population correlates best with neck size, smoking, and nasal stuffiness.

Adipose tissue was detected with magnetic resonance imaging using T1-weighted spin echo sequences. The volume of adipose tissue adjacent to the upper airway was determined by measuring the volume of all pixels in the intensity range of adipose tissue within the region bounded by the ramus of the mandible, the spine, the anterior border of the soft palate, and the hard palate.

Both patients who lost weight and had fewer apneas and hypopneas had a marked decrease in the pharyngeal adipose tissue volume.

To test this hypothesis, 17 normal subjects were scanned for quantifiable brain activity changes during 85 h of sleep deprivation using positron emission tomography (PET) and 18 Fluorine‐2‐deoxyglucose ( 18 FDG), a marker for regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu) and neuronal synaptic activity. Subjects were scanned prior to and at 24‐h intervals during the sleep deprivation period, for a total of four scans per subject. During each 30 min 18 FDG uptake, subjects performed a sleep deprivation‐sensitive Serial Addition/Subtraction task. Polysomnographic monitoring confirmed that subjects were awake. Twenty‐four hours of sleep deprivation, reported here, resulted in a significant decrease in global CMRglu, and significant decreases in absolute regional CMRglu in several cortical and subcortical structures. No areas of the brain evidenced a significant increase in absolute regional CMRglu. Significant decreases in relative regional CMRglu, reflecting regional brain reductions greater than the global decrease, occurred predominantly in the thalamus and prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Alertness and cognitive performance declined in association with these brain deactivations. This study provides evidence that short‐term sleep deprivation produces global decreases in brain activity, with larger reductions in activity in the distributed cortico‐thalamic network mediating attention and higher‐order cognitive processes, and is complementary to studies demonstrating deactivation of these cortical regions during NREM and REM sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2000.00225.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2041316075", "source": "openalex"}

It is posited that these GFs are produced in response to neural activity and affect input‐output relationships within the neural circuits where they are produced, thereby inducing a local state shift. These GFs also influence synaptic efficacy. All the GFs currently identified as sleep regulatory substances are also implicated in synaptic plasticity. Among these substances, the most extensively studied for their role in sleep regulation are interleukin‐1β (IL‐1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF). Injection of IL‐1 or TNF enhances non‐rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS). Inhibition of either IL‐1 or TNF inhibits spontaneous sleep and the sleep rebound that occurs after sleep deprivation. Stimulation of the endogenous production of IL‐1 and TNF enhances NREMS. Brain levels of IL‐1 and TNF correlate with sleep propensity; for example, after sleep deprivation, their levels increase. IL‐1 and TNF are part of a complex biochemical cascade regulating sleep. Downstream events include nitric oxide, growth hormone releasing hormone, nerve growth factor, nuclear factor kappa B, and possibly adenosine and prostaglandins. Endogenous substances moderating the effects of IL‐1 and TNF include anti‐inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐4, IL‐10, and IL‐13. Clinical conditions altering IL‐1 or TNF activity are associated with changes in sleep, for example, infectious disease and sleep apnea.

This investigation examines current and former cigarette smoking as potential risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing. <h3>Methods:</h3> Data were from 811 adults enrolled in the University of Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Madison. The Sleep Cohort Study is a longitudinal, epidemiologic study that uses nocturnal polysomnography to investigate sleep-disordered breathing and other disorders of sleep. The presence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing was quantified by the frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. <h3>Results:</h3> Logistic regression analyses were used to control for potential confounding factors. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a significantly greater risk of snoring (odds ratio, 2.29) and of moderate or worse sleep-disordered breathing (odds ratio, 4.44). Heavy smokers (≥40 cigarettes per day) had the greatest risk of mild sleep-disordered breathing (odds ratio, 6.74) and of moderate or worse sleep-disordered breathing (odds ratio, 40.47). Former smoking was unrelated to snoring and sleep-disordered breathing after adjustment for confounders. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Current cigarette smokers are at greater risk for sleep-disordered breathing than are never smokers. Heavy smokers have the greatest risk while former smokers are not at increased risk for sleep-disordered breathing.

The discussion attempts to integrate the functional neuroimaging data into the body of knowledge already acquired on sleep in animals and humans using various other techniques (intracellular recordings, in situ neurophysiology, lesional and pharmacological trials, scalp EEG recordings, behavioural or psychological description). The published PET data describe a very reproducible functional neuroanatomy in sleep. The core characteristics of this ‘canonical’ sleep may be summarized as follows. In slow‐wave sleep, most deactivated areas are located in the dorsal pons and mesencephalon, cerebellum, thalami, basal ganglia, basal forebrain/hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and in the mesial aspect of the temporal lobe. During rapid‐eye movement sleep, significant activations were found in the pontine tegmentum, thalamic nuclei, limbic areas (amygdaloid complexes, hippocampal formation, anterior cingulate cortex) and in the posterior cortices (temporo‐occipital areas). In contrast, the dorso‐lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, were the least active brain regions.

Anatomy of pharynx in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and in normal subjects. J. Appl. Physiol. 82(4): 1319–1326, 1997.—Anatomic abnormalities of the pharynx are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but their contribution has never been conclusively proven. The present study tested this anatomic hypothesis by comparing the mechanics of the paralyzed pharynx in OSA patients and in normal subjects. According to evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) by nocturnal oximetry, subjects were divided into three groups: normal group ( n = 17), SDB-1 ( n = 18), and SDB-2 ( n = 22). The static pressure-area relationship of the passive pharynx was quantified under general anesthesia with complete paralysis. Age and body mass index were matched among the three groups. The site of the primary closure was the velopharynx in 49 subjects and the oropharynx in only 8 subjects. Distribution of the location of the primary closure did not differ among the groups. Closing pressure (Pc) of the velopharynx for SDB-1 and SDB-2 groups (0.90 ± 1.34 and 2.78 ± 2.78 cmH 2 O, respectively) was significantly higher than that for the normal group (−3.77 ± 3.44 cmH 2 O; P &lt; 0.01). Maximal velopharyngeal area for the normal group (2.10 ± 0.85 cm 2 ) was significantly greater than for SDB-1 and SDB-2 groups (1.15 ± 0.46 and 1.06 ± 0.75 cm 2 , respectively). The shape of the pressure-area curve for the velopharynx differed between normal subjects and patients with SDB, being steeper in slope near Pc in patients with SDB. Multivariate analysis of mechanical parameters and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) revealed that velopharyngeal Pc was the only variable highly correlated with ODI. Velopharyngeal Pc was associated with oropharyngeal Pc, suggesting mechanical interdependence of these segments. We conclude that the passive pharynx is more narrow and collapsible in sleep-apneic patients than in matched controls and that velopharyngeal Pc is the principal correlate of the frequency of nocturnal desaturations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1997.82.4.1319", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162645075", "source": "openalex"}

To investigate the relationship between specific television-viewing habits and both sleep habits and sleep disturbances in school children. Methods. The parents of 495 children in grades kindergarten through fourth grade in three public elementary schools completed two retrospective survey questionnaires, one assessing their children's sleep behaviors and the other examining television-viewing habits of both the child and the family. Sleep domains assessed included bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, anxiety around sleep, parasomnias, night wakings, and daytime sleepiness. Teachers from all three schools also completed daytime sleepiness questionnaires (N = 402) for the sample. Results. Most of the television-viewing practices examined in this study were associated with at least one type of sleep disturbance. Despite overall close monitoring of television-viewing habits, one quarter of the parents reported the presence of a television set in the child's bedroom. The television-viewing habits associated most significantly with sleep disturbance were increased daily television viewing amounts and increased television viewing at bedtime, especially in the context of having a television set in the child's bedroom. The sleep domains that appeared to be affected most consistently by television were bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, and anxiety around sleep, followed by shortened sleep duration. The parent's threshold for defining “problem sleep behavior” in their child was also important in determining the significance of the association between sleep disturbance and television-viewing habits. Conclusion. Health care practitioners should be aware of the potential negative impact of television viewing at bedtime. Parents should be questioned about their children's television-viewing habits as part of general screening for sleep disturbances and as part of anticipatory guidance in regards to healthy sleep habits in children. In particular, the presence of a television set in the child's bedroom may be a relatively underrecognized, but important, contributor to sleep problems in school children.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.104.3.e27", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124379122", "source": "openalex"}

Polysomnographic assessment of sleep in response to stress during a first night in the laboratory and subsequent physiologic arousal. One hundred and four individuals (46% men, mean age = 40.4 ± 12.9 years) drawn from a population-based sample. Individuals were exposed to a first night in the laboratory. Participants completed a Likert-scale questionnaire, consisting of 27 items, that assesses sleep disturbance in response to commonly experienced stressful situations. Factor analytic techniques identified a single 9-item factor that was representative of the construct of “stress-related” vulnerability to sleep disturbance. Reliability of the resulting 9-item scale was high (Cronbach's α = .83). Individuals with higher scores on this scale, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST; median split), had a lower sleep efficiency (P = .001), as well as an increased latency to stage 1 sleep (P = .001) and persistent sleep (P = .002) on the first night of nocturnal polysomnography. Moreover, these high-scoring individuals showed increased arousal as evidenced by an elevated sleep latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test compared to individuals with low FIRST scores. Importantly, after controlling for current and past insomnia, the differences between individuals scoring high and low on the FIRST in terms of nocturnal sleep and daytime arousal remained significant. Other stages of sleep (stage 2, slow-wave, and rapid eye movement sleep) were not different between the groups. These results showing a relationship between FIRST scores and nocturnal polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test scores have 3 potential implications: (1) the data demonstrate a characteristic that relates to vulnerability to stress-related sleep disturbance as manifested by a first night in the laboratory; (2) the elevated latencies on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test in these individuals, despite significantly disturbed sleep, support the notion of physiologic hyperarousal in these individuals and suggests they may be predisposed to developing chronic primary insomnia; and (3) the vulnerability identified may underlie vulnerability to transient sleep disturbance associated with other sleep-disruptive factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/27.2.285", "url": "https://openalex.org/W142672915", "source": "openalex"}

A random subset of this cohort (n = 1,741) was further evaluated for one night in the sleep laboratory.The main measure was a complaint of EDS.The final logistic regression model indicated depression was the most significant risk factor for EDS followed by body mass index, age, typical sleep duration, diabetes, smoking, and finally sleep apnea. The strength of the association with EDS decreased with increasing age, whereas the association of depression with EDS was stronger in the young. EDS is more prevalent in the young (<30 yr), suggesting the presence of unmet sleep needs and depression, and in the very old (>75 yr), suggesting increasing medical illness and health problems. EDS was associated with a reduced report of typical sleep duration without any association with objective polysomnographic measures.It appears that the presence of EDS is more strongly associated with depression and metabolic factors than with sleep-disordered breathing or sleep disruption per se.

Patients presenting to cardiology clinics have a high prevalence of obstructive and central sleep apnea associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Multiple mechanisms have been identified by which sleep disturbances adversely affect cardiovascular structure and function. Epidemiological research indicates that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with increases in the incidence and progression of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. Central sleep apnea associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration predicts incident heart failure and atrial fibrillation; among patients with heart failure, it strongly predicts mortality. Thus, a strong literature provides the mechanistic and empirical bases for considering obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration as potentially modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Data from small trials provide evidence that treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure improves not only patient-reported outcomes such as sleepiness, quality of life, and mood but also intermediate cardiovascular end points such as blood pressure, cardiac ejection fraction, vascular parameters, and arrhythmias. However, data from large-scale randomized controlled trials do not currently support a role for positive pressure therapies for reducing cardiovascular mortality. The results of 2 recent large randomized controlled trials, published in 2015 and 2016, raise questions about the effectiveness of pressure therapies in reducing clinical end points, although 1 trial supported the beneficial effect of continuous positive airway pressure on quality of life, mood, and work absenteeism. This review provides a contextual framework for interpreting the results of recent studies, key clinical messages, and suggestions for future sleep and cardiovascular research, which include further consideration of individual risk factors, use of existing and new multimodality therapies that also address adherence, and implementation of trials that are sufficiently powered to target end points and to support subgroup analyses. These goals may best be addressed through strengthening collaboration among the cardiology, sleep medicine, and clinical trial communities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.117.029400", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768054782", "source": "openalex"}

Here we summarize a series of our own studies in humans supporting a beneficial influence of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on declarative memory formation, and try to identify some mechanisms that might underlie this influence. Specifically, these experiments show that declarative memory benefits mainly from sleep periods dominated by SWS, whereas there is no consistent benefit of this memory from periods rich in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A main mechanism of declarative memory formation is believed to be the reactivation of newly acquired memory representations in hippocampal networks that stimulates a transfer and integration of these representations into neocortical neuronal networks. Consistent with this model, spindle activity and slow oscillation-related EEG coherence increase during early sleep after intense declarative learning in humans, signs that together point toward a neocortical reprocessing of the learned material. In addition, sleep seems to provide an optimal milieu for declarative memory reprocessing and consolidation by reducing cholinergic activation and the cortisol feedback to the hippocampus during SWS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.80504", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116888545", "source": "openalex"}

It has been hypothesized that age-related changes in the human circadian pacemaker, as well as sleep homeostatic mechanisms, contribute to the hallmarks of age-related changes in sleep, that is, earlier wake time and reduced sleep consolidation. Assessments of circadian parameters in healthy young (∼20–30 years old) and older people (∼65–75 years old)—in the absence of the confounding effects of sleep, changes in posture, and light exposure—have demonstrated that an earlier wake time in older people is accompanied by about a 1h advance of the rhythms of core body temperature and melatonin. In addition, older people wake up at an earlier circadian phase of the body temperature and plasma melatonin rhythm. The amplitude of the endogenous circadian component of the core body temperature rhythm assessed during constant routine and forced desynchrony protocols is reduced by 20–30% in older people. Recent assessments of the intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker in the absence of the confounding effects of light revealed no age-related reduction of this parameter in both sighted and blind individuals. Wake maintenance and sleep initiation are not markedly affected by age except that sleep latencies are longer in older people when sleep initiation is attempted in the early morning. In contrast, major age-related reductions in the consolidation and duration of sleep occur at all circadian phases. Sleep of older people is particularly disrupted when scheduled on the rising limb of the temperature rhythm, indicating that the sleep of older people is more susceptible to arousal signals genernpated by the circadian pacemaker. Sleep-homeostatic mechanisms, as assayed by the sleep-deprivation–induced increase of EEG slow-wave activity (SWA), are operative in older people, although during both baseline sleep and recovery sleep SWA in older people remains at lower levels. The internal circadian phase advance of awakening, as well as the age-related reduction in sleep consolidation, appears related to an age-related reduction in the promotion of sleep by the circadian pacemaker during the biological night in combination with a reduced homeostatic pressure for sleep. Early morning light exposure associated with this advance of awakening in older people could reinforce the advanced circadian phase. Quantification of the interaction between sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythmicity contributes to understanding age-related changes in sleep timing and quality.

Both focal and generalized types of epileptiform activity in humans are subject to biorhythmic modulation, and the various modulation patterns observed are in accord with a model which explains these patterns as a consequence of the interaction of two endogenous modulatory processes: one with a period of about 24 h, the other with a period of about 100 min. Differences in the phase angle between the two cyclic processes, determined by time of sleep onset, explain the various modulatory patterns observed. The mechanisms involved in the genesis and elaboration of electrical epileptiform activity in animal models are examined in relation to known processes involved in the physiology of sleep, and compared with data derived from long‐term studies of the time distribution of epileptic events in humans. In infantile spasms, clinical seizure activity and the ictal and interictal EEG patterns in relationship to the phases of the sleep cycle, the significant defects in the quality and quantity of sleep in this disorder, and the changes that take place in all of these when seizures are abolished by effective treatment, suggest that pontine mechanisms responsible for the sleep cycle may be involved in the elaboration of infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1985.tb05720.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2055143424", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment options for sleep disturbances remain limited, and there is a need for community-accessible programs that can improve sleep. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine the efficacy of a mind-body medicine intervention, called mindfulness meditation, to promote sleep quality in older adults with moderate sleep disturbances. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2012, at a medical research center among an older adult sample (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [7.4] years) with moderate sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] &gt;5). <h3>Interventions</h3> A standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) intervention (n = 24) or a sleep hygiene education (SHE) intervention (n = 25) was randomized to participants, who received a 6-week intervention (2 hours per week) with assigned homework. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The study was powered to detect between-group differences in moderate sleep disturbance measured via the PSQI at postintervention. Secondary outcomes pertained to sleep-related daytime impairment and included validated measures of insomnia symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue, as well as inflammatory signaling via nuclear factor (NF)–κB. <h3>Results</h3> Using an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to those in the SHE group on the PSQI. With the MAPs intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.7) at baseline and 7.4 (1.9) at postintervention. With the SHE intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.8) at baseline and 9.1 (2.0) at postintervention. The between-group mean difference was 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6-2.9), with an effect size of 0.89.

Sleep duration, social jet lag, and sleep disturbance were all significantly modulated by the interaction of chronotype and shift (mixed-model ANOVAs). Earlier chronotypes showed shortened sleep duration during night shifts, high social jet lag, as well as higher levels of sleep disturbance. A similar pattern was observed for later chronotypes during early shifts. Age itself only influenced sleep duration and quality per se, without showing interactions with shifts. We found that workers slept longer in fast, rotating shift schedules. Since chronotype changes with age, investigations on sleep behavior and circadian misalignment in shift-workers have to consider chronotype to fully understand interindividual and intraindividual variability, especially in view of the current demographic changes.

The crude incidence of hypertension per 100 person-years was 2.19 (95% CI, 1.71-2.67) in controls, 3.34 (95% CI, 2.85-3.82) in patients with OSA ineligible for CPAP therapy, 5.84 (95% CI, 4.82-6.86) in patients with OSA who declined CPAP therapy, 5.12 (95% CI, 3.76-6.47) in patients with OSA nonadherent to CPAP therapy, and 3.06 (95% CI, 2.70-3.41) in patients with OSA and treated with CPAP therapy. Compared with controls, the adjusted HRs for incident hypertension were greater among patients with OSA ineligible for CPAP therapy (1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75), among those who declined CPAP therapy (1.96; 95% CI, 1.44-2.66), and among those nonadherent to CPAP therapy (1.78; 95% CI, 1.23-2.58), whereas the HR was lower in patients with OSA who were treated with CPAP therapy (0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.94).<h3>Conclusion</h3>Compared with participants without OSA, the presence of OSA was associated with increased adjusted risk of incident hypertension; however, treatment with CPAP therapy was associated with a lower risk of hypertension.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2012.3418", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150429350", "source": "openalex"}

Although a number of perspectives have some empirical support, no one approach emerges as preeminent. Importantly, the efficacy of any particular psychological intervention cannot be taken as confirmation of presumed, underlying mechanisms. An integrated psychobiological inhibition model of insomnia is developed that accounts for the research data. The model views insomnia as arising from inhibition of de-arousal processes associated with normal sleep. It is proposed that sleep homeostatic and circadian factors are compromised by impairment of the automaticity and plasticity associated with good sleep, and that cognitive/affective processes activate the clinical complaint of insomnia. Common pathways for the action of cognitive-behavioral interventions are identified, and a research agenda is set for further conceptual and clinical study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135243", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148509680", "source": "openalex"}

In recent years, sleep curtailment has become a hallmark of modern society with both children and adults having shorter bedtimes than a few decades ago. This trend for shorter sleep duration has developed over the same time period as the dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity. There is rapidly accumulating evidence from both laboratory and epidemiological studies to indicate that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity and weight gain. The present article reviews laboratory evidence indicating that sleep curtailment in young adults results in a constellation of metabolic and endocrine alterations, including decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, elevated sympathovagal balance, increased evening concentrations of cortisol, increased levels of ghrelin, decreased levels of leptin, and increased hunger and appetite. We also review cross-sectional epidemiological studies associating short sleep with increased body mass index and prospective epidemiological studies that have shown an increased risk of weight gain and obesity in children and young adults who are short sleepers. Altogether, the evidence points to a possible role of decreased sleep duration in the current epidemic of obesity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-08-0298", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2163075259", "source": "openalex"}

A total of 617 subjects (219 subjects per chronotype group) matched for age, sex and employment status, completed an abridged morningness/eveningness questionnaire, a questionnaire on sleep habits and the quality of sleep, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Eveningness was associated with a greater need for sleep, less time in bed during the week compared to ideal sleep needs, more time in bed at the weekend, a later bedtime and waking‐up time especially at the weekend, more irregular sleep/wake habits and greater caffeine consumption. These subjects built up a sleep debt during the week and extended their duration of sleep at the weekend. They did not, however, rate themselves more sleepy than other types, despite the fact that our results showed a clear link between subjectively evaluated daytime somnolence and sleep debt. Why they were less affected by sleep deprivation is not clear.

Recent evidence suggests that intermittent use of CPAP by patients is more common than nightly compliance. To determine the consequences of intermittent CPAP use, in terms of a return of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime hypersomnolence, 15 OSAS subjects were evaluated at three times: (1) before CPAP treatment (pretreatment), (2) after 30 to 237 days posttreatment during a night of CPAP use (on CPAP), and (3) during a night without CPAP (off CPAP). Evaluations of sleep-disordered breathing and three domains of hypersomnolence, physiologic sleep tendency, subjective sleepiness, and performance, were accomplished with the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS), and psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), respectively. CPAP use was encouraged and monitored from pretreatment to post-treatment by daily diaries for most subjects and an electronic device for a subset of subjects. As expected, CPAP eliminated apneas and hypopneas, and following the on CPAP night, there were statistically significant improvements in objective measures of sleepiness (MSLT and PVT). Subjective measures of sleepiness and fatigue also showed improvement. Sleeping without CPAP for one night reversed virtually all of the sleep and daytime alertness gains derived from sleeping with CPAP. This occurred despite a statistically significant reduction in the RDI on the night off CPAP (M = 36.8, SD = 28.0 events/h) relative to the pretreatment night (M = 56.6, SD = 24.8 events/h), which may be due to a lessening of the edema of the upper airway following CPAP use. The results of the study suggest that failure to use CPAP for even a single night can result in reappearance of pretreatment levels of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime hypersomnolence, even though the rate of respiratory events may be lessened.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/147.5.1162", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2003111052", "source": "openalex"}

With appropriate stimulation parameters, each TMS pulse at <1 Hz evokes an individual, high-amplitude slow wave that originates under the coil and spreads over the cortex. TMS triggering of slow waves reveals intrinsic bistability in thalamocortical networks during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, evoked slow waves lead to a deepening of sleep and to an increase in EEG slow-wave activity (0.5-4.5 Hz), which is thought to play a role in brain restoration and memory consolidation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0702495104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104638127", "source": "openalex"}

These circumstances suggest that there is a critical need to achieve a mechanistic understanding of triggers of relapse and to target them with specific, empirically derived treatments. Sleep disturbances are among the most prominent correlates of mood episodes and inadequate recovery, yet sleep has been minimally studied in ways that integrate mechanistic understanding and treatment. In this article, the author seeks to define the limits of current knowledge and to specify preliminary clinical implications. Sleep disturbance is important because it impairs quality of life, contributes to relapse, and has adverse consequences for affective functioning. While sleep disturbance and circadian dysregulation are critical pathophysiological elements in bipolar disorder, many questions about the mechanisms that underpin the association remain. The author presents a model that recognizes a role for genetic vulnerability and suggests that there is a bidirectional relationship between daytime affect regulation and nighttime sleep such that an escalating vicious circle of disturbance in affect regulation during the day interferes with nighttime sleep/circadian functioning, and the effects of sleep deprivation contribute to difficulty in affect regulation the following day.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08010098", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142490107", "source": "openalex"}

Accordingly, we hypothesized that two nights of sleep loss would impair decision making quality and lead to increased risk-taking behavior on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which mimics real-world decision making under conditions of uncertainty. Thirty-four healthy participants completed the IGT at rested baseline and again following 49.5 h of sleep deprivation. At baseline, volunteers performed in a manner similar to that seen in most samples of healthy normal individuals, rapidly learning to avoid high-risk decks and selecting more frequently from advantageous low-risk decks as the game progressed. After sleep loss, however, volunteers showed a strikingly different pattern of performance. Relative to rested baseline, sleep-deprived individuals tended to choose more frequently from risky decks as the game progressed, a pattern similar to, though less severe than, previously published reports of patients with lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Although risky decision making was not related to participant age when tested at rested baseline, age was negatively correlated with advantageous decision making on the IGT, when tested following sleep deprivation (i.e. older subjects made more risky choices). These findings suggest that cognitive functions known to be mediated by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including decision making under conditions of uncertainty, may be particularly vulnerable to sleep loss and that this vulnerability may become more pronounced with increased age.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2006.00487.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995141428", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we quantify and characterize the aggregation of SDB and assess the degree to which familial similarities may be independent of obesity. This was a genetic-epidemiologic study that assessed the distribution of SDB in families identified through a proband with diagnosed sleep apnea and among families in the same community with no relative with known sleep apnea. SDB was assessed with overnight inhome monitoring of airflow, oxygen saturation, chest wall impedance, heart rate, and body movement. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess symptoms, and weight, height, and neck circumference were measured directly. Intergenerational and intragenerational correlation coefficients and pairwise odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with adjustment for proband sampling. In toto, 561 members of 91 families were studied: (1) 47 subjects with laboratory-confirmed SDB (index probands), (2) 44 community control subjects, and (3) the spouses and relatives of 1 and 2. Of all 91 families, 32 (35%) had two or more members with SDB, 30 (33%) had one affected member, and 29 had no affected members. SDB was more prevalent in the relatives of index probands (21%) than among neighborhood control subjects (12%) (p = 0.02). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and obesity, the odds of SDB, defined on the basis of age-specific threshold values for the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), was 1.3 greater in subjects with one affected relative, and 2.3 greater in subjects with three affected members when compared with subjects without affected family members. Intergenerational and intragenerational coefficients, describing the similarities in RDI levels among family members, were each 0.21 (p < 0.005), and they were not reduced significantly with adjustment for obesity. These results suggest that SDB significantly aggregates within families and that risk increases progressively with increasing numbers of affected relatives.

Children referred to a pediatric sleep disorders clinic during a 3-year period with a primary diagnosis of either polysomnographically-confirmed OSAS (n = 100) or a BSD (n = 52) were compared on several parent report measures assessing the following domains: symptoms of sleep disordered breathing, other sleep behaviors (primarily parasomnias), bedtime behaviors, and externalizing daytime behavior problems. The OSAS sample was then divided into a pure OSAS group (n = 78) and an OSAS plus a behavioral sleep diagnosis group (n = 22) based on the presence or absence of delayed sleep onset and/or prolonged nightwakings and compared on the parent-report symptom domains. Almost one-quarter of the OSAS group had clinically significant behavioral sleep problems, primarily bedtime resistance, in addition to OSAS. Bedtime resistance was associated with a significantly shortened sleep duration in both the BSD and OSAS-BSD groups. Although the OSAS-BSD group had less severe disease, as defined by polysomnographic variables, than the pure OSAS group, they were rated by their parents as having more daytime externalizing behavior problems associated with daytime sleepiness.

To provide a self-consistent account of the transition from wakefulness to sleep and of the generation of sleep slow waves, we have constructed a large-scale computer model that encompasses portions of two visual areas and associated thalamic and reticular thalamic nuclei. Thousands of model neurons, incorporating several intrinsic currents, are interconnected with millions of thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and both intra- and interareal corticocortical connections. In the waking mode, the model exhibits irregular spontaneous firing and selective responses to visual stimuli. In the sleep mode, neuromodulatory changes lead to slow oscillations that closely resemble those observed in vivo and in vitro. A systematic exploration of the effects of intrinsic currents and network parameters on the initiation, maintenance, and termination of slow oscillations shows the following. 1) An increase in potassium leak conductances is sufficient to trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep. 2) The activation of persistent sodium currents is sufficient to initiate the up-state of the slow oscillation. 3) A combination of intrinsic and synaptic currents is sufficient to maintain the up-state. 4) Depolarization-activated potassium currents and synaptic depression terminate the up-state. 5) Corticocortical connections synchronize the slow oscillation. The model is the first to integrate intrinsic neuronal properties with detailed thalamocortical anatomy and reproduce neural activity patterns in both wakefulness and sleep, thereby providing a powerful tool to investigate the role of sleep in information transmission and plasticity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00915.2004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063094367", "source": "openalex"}

Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions.

Recent evidence demonstrates that sleep–wake and circadian disruption often occur early in the course of the disease and may even precede the development of cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, the sleep–wake cycle appears to regulate levels of the pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide in the brain, and manipulating sleep can influence AD-related pathology in mouse models via multiple mechanisms. Finally, the circadian clock system, which controls the sleep–wake cycle and other diurnal oscillations in mice and humans, may also have a role in the neurodegenerative process. In this review, we examine the current literature related to the mechanisms by which sleep and circadian rhythms might impact AD pathogenesis, and we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these systems for the prevention of AD. The onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease may be associated with sleep cycle disturbance even before cognitive symptoms appear. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition that primarily affects older people, leading to dementia. Disturbed sleep patterns and problems with circadian rhythms, physiological processes which follow a natural 24-hour cycle, are often symptoms of the disease. David Holtzman and co-workers at the Washington University School of Medicine, USA, reviewed research suggesting that sleep disruption may actually occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and exacerbate the disease.

The authors used wrist actigraphy and questionnaires to estimate sleep and fatigue in 72 couples during their last month of pregnancy and 1st month postpartum. Both parents experienced more sleep disruption at night during the postpartum period as compared to the last month of pregnancy. Compared to fathers, with their stable 24-h sleep patterns over time, mothers had less sleep at night and more sleep during the day after the baby was born. Sleep patterns were also related to parents'work status and type of infant feeding. Both parents self-reported more sleep disturbance and fatigue during the 1st month postpartum than during pregnancy. Mothers reported more sleep disturbance than fathers, but there was no gender difference in ratings of fatigue. At both time points, fathers obtained less total sleep than mothers when sleep was objectively measured throughout the entire 24-h day. Further research is needed to determine the duration of sleep loss for both mothers and fathers, to evaluate the effect of disrupted sleep and sleep loss on psychosocial functioning and job performance, and to develop interventions for improving sleep patterns of new parents.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1099800403262142", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102189229", "source": "openalex"}

In a community sample of children aged 3 to 4 years with previous infant sleep problems, we aimed to 1) establish proportions with recurring, persisting, and resolving sleep problems; 2) identify early predictors of later sleep problems; and 3) identify comorbidities of persistent or recurrent sleep problems at age 3 to 4 years. Methods. A follow-up community survey was conducted of mothers of children aged 3 to 4 years who had, as 8- to 10-month-old infants with identified sleep problems, participated in a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of a brief sleep intervention from 3 middle-class local government areas in Melbourne, Australia. Infant sleep problems (standardized maternal questionnaire), maternal well-being (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), child behavior problems (Child Behavior Check List for ages 1.5 to 5 years), marital satisfaction (Dyadic Adjustment Scale), and family functioning (General Functioning Scale, McMaster Family Assessment Device) were measured. Results. Seventy-three percent (114 of 156) of mothers responded, 36 (32%) of whom reported a current problem with their child’s sleep. Current sleep problems were similar regardless of infant sleep intervention. Twelve percent (14 of 114) reported that their child’s sleep problem had persisted, and 19% (21 of 113) reported that it had recurred. Children with current sleep problems were more likely still to be nursed to sleep by an adult and had slightly higher mean scores on Child Behavior Check List subscales for Aggressive Behavior (54 vs 52) and Somatic Problems (55 vs 53). Their mothers had higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores (median: 8 vs 5) and more difficulties with their partner undermining the management of their child. However, early depression did not predict current sleep problems. Families of children with sleep problems were functioning as well as those without sleep problems. Conclusions. Persistence or recurrence of infant sleep problems in the preschool years is common and is associated with slightly higher child behavior problems and maternal depression scores. Results suggest that depressive symptoms are a result rather than cause of sleep problems. Despite this, families of children with sleep problems are functioning well.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.111.3.e203", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983205087", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2022496632", "title": "Melatonin and sleep in humans", "text": "Abstract: Early studies on the physiological effects of melatonin typically reported hypnotic ‘side‐effects’. Later studies, specifically addressing this action, failed to reliably replicate hypnotic effects using standard polysomnography. This difference may be related to differences in the basic physiological action of melatonin compared with more conventional hypnotics. It is suggested that melatonin exerts a hypnotic effect through thermoregulatory mechanisms. By lowering core body temperature, melatonin reduces arousal and increases sleep‐propensity. Thus, in humans, one role of melatonin is to transduce the light‐dark cycle and define a window‐of‐opportunity in which sleep‐propensity is enhanced. As such, melatonin is likely to be an effective hypnotic agent for sleep disruption associated with elevated temperature due to low circulating melatonin levels. The combined circadian and hypnotic effects of melatonin suggest a synergistic action in the treatment of sleep disorders related to the inappropriate timing of sleep and wakefulness. Adjuvant melatonin may also improve sleep disruption caused by drugs known to alter normal melatonin production (e.g., β‐blockers and benzodiazepines). If melatonin is to be developed as a successful clinical treatment, differences between the pharmacological profile following exogenous administration and the normal endogenous rhythm should be minimized. Continued development as a useful clinical tool requires control of both the amplitude and duration of the exogenous melatonin pulse. There is a need to develop novel drug delivery systems that can reliably produce a square‐wave pulse of melatonin at physiological levels for 8–10 hr duration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-079x.1993.tb00503.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022496632", "source": "openalex"}

The authors signed letters stating they did not have a conflict of interest. I assume this means they do not run polysomnography (PSG) labs, as an obvious consequence of the report will be a markedly increased demand for their use. One problem concerns children with primary snoring (PS). This can be seen, according to the report, in up to 12% of preschool-aged children. Furthermore, there is apparently no way to rule out OSAS in these children, without doing PSG. The unmistakable conclusion, therefore, is that up to 12% of preschool-aged children should be undergoing PSG. Do other pediatricians find this concept as ludicrous as I do? A second issue concerns those children with mild OSAS, mild meaning that they are not demonstrating obvious problems such as daytime somnolence or pulmonary hypertension. These children are diagnosed when their sleep studies are found to be abnormal (ie, at the tail end of the distribution curve). The guideline indicates, in one sentence in the section on research recommendations, that the natural history of these children is not known. That did not stop the committee from recommending that these children undergo adenotonsillectomy, however, even though it is not known whether mild OSAS is an actual disease or merely a statistical finding.

Yet the mechanisms that regulate the ability to sleep have only recently been subjected to detailed investigation. New studies show that the control of wake and sleep emerges from the interaction of cell groups that cause arousal with other nuclei that induce sleep such as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). The VLPO inhibits the ascending arousal regions and is in turn inhibited by them, thus forming a mutually inhibitory system resembling what electrical engineers call a “flip‐flop switch.” This switch may help produce sharp transitions between discrete behavioral states, but it is not necessarily stable. The orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus may help stabilize this system by exciting arousal regions during wakefulness, preventing unwanted transitions between wakefulness and sleep. The importance of this stabilizing role is apparent in narcolepsy, in which an absence of the orexin neurons causes numerous, unintended transitions in and out of sleep and allows fragments of REM sleep to intrude into wakefulness. These influences on the sleep/wake system by homeostatic and circadian drives, as well as emotional inputs, are reviewed. Understanding the pathways that underlie the regulation of sleep and wakefulness may provide important insights into how the cognitive and emotional systems interact with basic homeostatic and circadian drives for sleep.

Measurements of endothelin-1 and blood pressure were also obtained on three occasions, at similar times, in 12 healthy control subjects without sleep disturbances.Mean arterial pressure and endothelin-1 concentrations increased significantly after 4 h of untreated obstructive sleep apnea, and decreased after 5 h of continuous positive airway pressure. Changes in endothelin-1 levels were correlated with changes in mean arterial pressure (r = 0.44, P < 0.02) and with changes in oxygen saturation (r = 0.37, P < 0.05). Norepinephrine levels and plasma renin activity did not change significantly in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, and were not correlated with changes in blood pressure or oxygen saturation. In controls, blood pressure measurements at similar times during the night showed changes directionally opposite to that seen in obstructive sleep apnea, while endothelin-1 levels remained unchanged.Sleep apnea elicits increases in blood pressure and endothelin-1, with reductions in both after treatment. Vasoconstrictor and mitogenic effects of endothelin-1 may be implicated in increased cardiovascular risk in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004872-199917010-00010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2091937552", "source": "openalex"}

Periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) not only facilitate the consolidation of declarative memories, but in humans, SWS is also accompanied by a pronounced endogenous transcortical DC potential shift of negative polarity over frontocortical areas. To experimentally induce widespread extracellular negative DC potentials, we applied anodal tDCS (0.26 mA/cm 2 ) repeatedly (over 30 min) bilaterally at frontocortical electrode sites during a retention period rich in SWS. Retention of declarative memories (word pairs) and also nondeclarative memories (mirror tracing skills) learned previously was tested after this period and compared with retention performance after placebo stimulation as well as after retention intervals of wakefulness. Compared with placebo stimulation, anodal tDCS during SWS-rich sleep distinctly increased the retention of word pairs ( p &lt; 0.005). When applied during the wake retention interval, tDCS did not affect declarative memory. Procedural memory was also not affected by tDCS. Mood was improved both after tDCS during sleep and during wake intervals. tDCS increased sleep depth toward the end of the stimulation period, whereas the average power in the faster frequency bands (θ,α, andβ) was reduced. Acutely, anodal tDCS increased slow oscillatory activity &lt;3 Hz. We conclude that effects of tDCS involve enhanced generation of slow oscillatory EEG activity considered to facilitate processes of neuronal plasticity. Shifts in extracellular ionic concentration in frontocortical tissue (expressed as negative DC potentials during SWS) may facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2725-04.2004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097201141", "source": "openalex"}

We evaluated the effects of this procedure on BP and sleep apnea severity in patients with resistant hypertension and sleep apnea. We studied 10 patients with refractory hypertension and sleep apnea (7 men and 3 women; median age: 49.5 years) who underwent renal denervation and completed 3-month and 6-month follow-up evaluations, including polysomnography and selected blood chemistries, and BP measurements. Antihypertensive regimens were not changed during the 6 months of follow-up. Three and 6 months after the denervation, decreases in office systolic and diastolic BPs were observed (median: -34/-13 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BPs at 6 months; both P<0.01). Significant decreases were also observed in plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after glucose administration (median: 7.0 versus 6.4 mmol/L; P=0.05) and in hemoglobin A1C level (median: 6.1% versus 5.6%; P<0.05) at 6 months, as well as a decrease in apnea-hypopnea index at 6 months after renal denervation (median: 16.3 versus 4.5 events per hour; P=0.059). In conclusion, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation lowered BP in patients with refractory hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, which was accompanied by improvement of sleep apnea severity. Interestingly, there are also accompanying improvements in glucose tolerance. Renal sympathetic denervation may conceivably be a potentially useful option for patients with comorbid refractory hypertension, glucose intolerance, and obstructive sleep apnea, although further studies are needed to confirm these proof-of-concept data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.111.173799", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118458077", "source": "openalex"}

We document Britain's sleep based on a nationally representative sample of 1997, 16–93 year olds, who participated in face‐to‐face interviews. Fifty‐eight per cent of respondents reported sleep problems on one or more nights the previous week and 18% reported that the sleep they obtained was insufficient on the majority of nights. Sleep durations were longest in the youngest participants (16–24 years), who slept on average 1 h longer than the 7.04 (SD 1.55) sample average. Sleep duration showed no appreciable change beyond middle age. Men and women reported sleeping similar amounts but women reported more sleep problems. Men reported sleeping less when there were more children in their household. Workers (i.e. employees) reported sleeping less on workdays than on non‐workdays, but those based at home and those not employed did not. Inability to switch off from work was related to sleep duration on non‐workdays. Across all participants average sleep duration exhibited a non‐monotonic association with quality of life (i.e. contribution of sleep to energy, satisfaction and success in work, home and leisure activities). Quality of life was positively associated with sleep duration, for durations up to 9 h, but negatively associated with quality of life beyond this. Comparison of our data with the US national sleep poll revealed that Britain sleeps as little or less, whereas a comparison with data reported 40 years ago revealed no statistically reliable reductions. Although we may not sleep less than four decades ago, when we report sleeping less we also tend to associate that lack of sleep with poor performance and quality of life.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2004.00418.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064705669", "source": "openalex"}

The proportion of individuals with sleep-related accidents was 1.5-4 times greater in the hypersomnolent patient groups than in the control group. In patients with hypersomnia, the incidence of sleep-related accidents per year of excessive sleepiness was 3-7%. Although the proportion of patients with sleep-related accidents was highest in narcoleptics, apneics were involved in more sleep-related accidents because of their greater number. Apneics and nacroleptics accounted for 71% of all sleep-related accidents. The proportion of severe apneics who had sleep-related accidents was almost twice that of patients with mild or moderate apnea. Mean sleep latency by Multiple Sleep Latency Test did not differ significantly in patients with accidents and those without.

Circadian rhythm of sleep-wakefulness is controlled by the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The neuroanatomical substrates of the NREM sleep are located principally in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus and those of REM sleep are located in pons. A variety of significant physiological changes occur in all body systems and organs during sleep as a result of functional alterations in the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. The international classification of sleep disorders (ICSD, ed 2) lists eight categories of sleep disorders along with appendix A and appendix B. The four major sleep complaints include excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, abnormal movements or behaviour during sleep and inability to sleep at the desired time. The most important step in assessing a patient with a sleep complaint is obtaining a detailed history including family and previous histories, medical, psychiatric, neurological, drug, alcohol and substance abuse disorders. Some important laboratory tests for investigating sleep disorders consist of an overnight polysomnography, multiple sleep latency and maintenance of wakefulness tests as well as actigraphy. General physicians should have a basic knowledge of the salient clinical features of common sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (e.g., jet leg, shift work disorder, etc.) and parasomnias (e.g., partial arousal disorders, REM behaviour disorder, etc.) and these are briefly described in this chapter. The principle of treatment of sleep disorders is first to find cause of the sleep disturbance and vigorously treat the co-morbid conditions causing the sleep disturbance. If a satisfactory treatment is not available for the primary condition or does not resolve the problem, the treatment should be directed at the specific sleep disturbance. Most sleep disorders, once diagnosed, can be managed with limited consultations. The treatment of primary sleep disorders, however, is best handled by a sleep specialist.

The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134779", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3040457167", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate daytime screen use and use of electronic devices before bedtime in relation to sleep. Design A large cross-sectional population-based survey study from 2012, the youth@hordaland study, in Hordaland County in Norway. Setting Cross-sectional general community-based study. Participants 9846 adolescents from three age cohorts aged 16–19. The main independent variables were type and frequency of electronic devices at bedtime and hours of screen-time during leisure time. Outcomes Sleep variables calculated based on self-report including bedtime, rise time, time in bed, sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset. Results Adolescents spent a large amount of time during the day and at bedtime using electronic devices. Daytime and bedtime use of electronic devices were both related to sleep measures, with an increased risk of short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency and increased sleep deficiency. A dose–response relationship emerged between sleep duration and use of electronic devices, exemplified by the association between PC use and risk of less than 5 h of sleep (OR=2.70, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.39), and comparable lower odds for 7–8 h of sleep (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.96). Conclusions Use of electronic devices is frequent in adolescence, during the day as well as at bedtime. The results demonstrate a negative relation between use of technology and sleep, suggesting that recommendations on healthy media use could include restrictions on electronic devices.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006748", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157102249", "source": "openalex"}

Implicated in sleep regulation and cognitive functioning, spindles may represent heritable biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disease. Here we characterize spindles in 11,630 individuals aged 4 to 97 years, as a prelude to future genetic studies. Spindle properties are highly reliable but exhibit distinct developmental trajectories. Across the night, we observe complex patterns of age- and frequency-dependent dynamics, including signatures of circadian modulation. We identify previously unappreciated correlates of spindle activity, including confounding by body mass index mediated by cardiac interference in the EEG. After taking account of these confounds, genetic factors significantly contribute to spindle and spectral sleep traits. Finally, we consider topographical differences and critical measurement issues. Taken together, our findings will lead to an increased understanding of the genetic architecture of sleep spindles and their relation to behavioural and health outcomes, including neuropsychiatric disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15930", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2641667423", "source": "openalex"}

Insomnia was defined by a complaint of insomnia with duration of >or=1 year, whereas poor sleep was defined as a complaint of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or early final awakening. Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into three categories: >or=6 h of sleep (top 50% of the sample); 5-6 h (approximately third quartile of the sample); and <or=5 h (approximately the bottom quartile of the sample). Diabetes was defined either based on a fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dl or use of medication. In the logistic regression model, we simultaneously adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, depression, sleep-disordered breathing, and periodic limb movement.Chronic insomnia but not poor sleep was associated with a higher risk for diabetes. Compared with the normal sleeping and >or=6 h sleep duration group, the highest risk of diabetes was in individuals with insomnia and <or=5 h sleep duration group (odds ratio [95% CI] 2.95 [1.2-7.0]) and in insomniacs who slept 5-6 h (2.07 [0.68-6.4]).Insomnia with short sleep duration is associated with increased odds of diabetes.

The presence of these movements was unrelated to the foetal carotid blood gas values over a wide range of spontaneous variation.4. These foetal breathing movements were accompanied by comparatively small alterations of pulmonary volume recorded from a tracheal flowmeter, insufficient to clear the tracheal dead space. Occasionally a more prolonged expiration led to the outward flow of fluid.5. A description is given of sleep and wakefulness in foetal lambs from 0.78 of term.6. Rapid irregular breathing was associated with rapid eye movement sleep as seen in a warm saline bath or, in utero, as inferred from records of eye movements and electrocortical activity.7.

Conditional logistic regression models were fitted to longitudinally explore the association between REM OSA and development of hypertension. All models controlled for OSA events during non-REM sleep, either by statistical adjustment or by stratification.Fully adjusted models demonstrated significant dose-relationships between REM apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and prevalent hypertension. The higher relative odds of prevalent hypertension were most evident with REM AHI greater than or equal to 15.

Here we show the benefit of a daytime nap on motor memory consolidation and its relationship not simply with global sleep-stage measures, but unique characteristics of sleep spindles at regionally specific locations; mapping to the corresponding memory representation. Methodology/Principal Findings Two groups of subjects trained on a motor-skill task using their left hand – a paradigm known to result in overnight plastic changes in the contralateral, right motor cortex. Both groups trained in the morning and were tested 8 hr later, with one group obtaining a 60–90 minute intervening midday nap, while the other group remained awake. At testing, subjects that did not nap showed no significant performance improvement, yet those that did nap expressed a highly significant consolidation enhancement. Within the nap group, the amount of offline improvement showed a significant correlation with the global measure of stage-2 NREM sleep. However, topographical sleep spindle analysis revealed more precise correlations. Specifically, when spindle activity at the central electrode of the non-learning hemisphere (left) was subtracted from that in the learning hemisphere (right), representing the homeostatic difference following learning, strong positive relationships with offline memory improvement emerged–correlations that were not evident for either hemisphere alone. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that motor memories are dynamically facilitated across daytime naps, enhancements that are uniquely associated with electrophysiological events expressed at local, anatomically discrete locations of the brain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000341", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170139952", "source": "openalex"}

Structural/anatomic factors that constrict space for the soft tissues surrounding the pharynx and its lumen are crucial to the development of OSA in many patients. Enlargement of soft tissues enveloping the pharynx, including hypertrophied tonsils, adenoids, and tongue, is also an important factor predisposing to UA collapse, inasmuch as this can impinge on the pharyngeal lumen and narrow it during sleep. Other factors, including impairment of UA mechanoreceptor sensitivity and reflexes that maintain pharyngeal patency and respiratory control system instability, have also been identified as possible mechanisms facilitating UA instability. This suggests that OSA may be a heterogeneous disorder, rather than a single disease entity. Therefore, the extent to which various pathogenic factors contribute to the phenomenon of repetitive collapse of the UA during sleep probably varies from patient to patient. Further elucidation of specific pathogenic mechanisms in individuals with OSA may facilitate the development of new therapies that can be tailored to individual patient needs according to the underlying mechanism(s) of their disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00772.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143555661", "source": "openalex"}

There is less of a consensus, however, regarding the precise stages of memory development during which sleep is considered a requirement, simply favorable, or not important. This article begins with an overview of recent studies regarding sleep and learning, predominantly in the procedural memory domain, and is measured against our current understanding of the mechanisms that govern memory formation. Based on these considerations, I offer a new neurocognitive framework of procedural learning, consisting first of acquisition, followed by two specific stages of consolidation, one involving a process of stabilization, the other involving enhancement, whereby delayed learning occurs. Psychophysiological evidence indicates that initial acquisition does not rely fundamentally on sleep. This also appears to be true for the stabilization phase of consolidation, with durable representations, resistant to interference, clearly developing in a successful manner during time awake (or just time, per se). In contrast, the consolidation stage, resulting in additional/enhanced learning in the absence of further rehearsal, does appear to rely on the process of sleep, with evidence for specific sleep-stage dependencies across the procedural domain. Evaluations at a molecular, cellular, and systems level currently offer several sleep specific candidates that could play a role in sleep-dependent learning. These include the upregulation of select plasticity-associated genes, increased protein synthesis, changes in neurotransmitter concentration, and specific electrical events in neuronal networks that modulate synaptic potentiation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x05000026", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151632193", "source": "openalex"}

We tested the hypothesis that patients with OSA have impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, even in the absence of overt cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results —We studied 8 patients with OSA (age 44±4 years) and 9 obese control subjects (age 48±3 years). Patients with OSA were newly diagnosed, never treated for OSA, on no medications, and free of any other known diseases. All obese control subjects underwent complete overnight polysomnographic studies to exclude occult OSA. Resistance-vessel function was tested by use of forearm blood flow responses to intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine (a vasodilator that stimulates endothelial release of nitric oxide), sodium nitroprusside (an exogenous nitric oxide donor), and verapamil (a calcium channel blocker). Conduit-vessel function was also evaluated by ultrasonography. Brachial artery diameter was measured under baseline conditions, during reactive hyperemia (with flow increase causing endothelium-dependent dilatation), and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (an endothelium-independent vasodilator). Patients with OSA had a blunted vasodilation in response to acetylcholine ( P &lt;0.007), but responses to sodium nitroprusside and verapamil were not significantly different from those of control subjects. No significant difference in conduit-vessel dilation was evident between OSA patients and obese control subjects.

Although viewed as a passive condition, sleep is a highly active and dynamic process. The sleep-related decrease in muscle tone is associated with an increase in resistance to airflow through the upper airway. Partial or complete collapse of the airway during sleep can lead to the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas during sleep that define the syndrome of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea has become pervasive in Western society, affecting approximately 5% of adults in industrialized countries. Given the pandemic of obesity, the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome has also increased dramatically over the last decade. Although the role of sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease is uncertain, there is a growing body of literature that implicates sleep apnea in the pathogenesis of altered glucose metabolism. Intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation in sleep apnea can trigger a cascade of pathophysiological events, including autonomic activation, alterations in neuroendocrine function, and release of potent proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Epidemiologic and experimental evidence linking sleep apnea and disorders of glucose metabolism is reviewed and discussed here. Although the cause-and-effect relationship remains to be determined, the available data suggest that sleep apnea is independently associated with altered glucose metabolism and may predispose to the eventual development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00695.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114168282", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep duration shows a significant positive relation with cognitive performance (r = .08, confidence interval [CI] [.06, .10]). Subsequent analyses on cognitive subdomains indicate specific associations of sleep duration with executive functioning (r = .07, CI [.02, .13]), with performance on tasks that address multiple cognitive domains (r = .10, CI = [.05, .16]), and with school performance (r = .09, CI [.06, .12]), but not with intelligence. Quite unlike typical findings in adults, sleep duration was not associated with sustained attention and memory. Methodological issues and brain developmental immaturities are proposed to underlie the marked differences. Shorter sleep duration is associated with more behavioral problems (r = .09, CI [.07, .11]).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2076985735", "title": "Source modeling sleep slow waves", "text": "Slow waves are the most prominent electroencephalographic (EEG) feature of sleep. These waves arise from the synchronization of slow oscillations in the membrane potentials of millions of neurons. Scalp-level studies have indicated that slow waves are not instantaneous events, but rather they travel across the brain. Previous studies of EEG slow waves were limited by the poor spatial resolution of EEGs and by the difficulty of relating scalp potentials to the activity of the underlying cortex. Here we use high-density EEG (hd-EEG) source modeling to show that individual spontaneous slow waves have distinct cortical origins, propagate uniquely across the cortex, and involve unique subsets of cortical structures. However, when the waves are examined en masse, we find that there are diffuse hot spots of slow wave origins centered on the lateral sulci. Furthermore, slow wave propagation along the anterior−posterior axis of the brain is largely mediated by a cingulate highway. As a group, slow waves are associated with large currents in the medial frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate, the precuneus, and the posterior cingulate. These areas overlap with the major connectional backbone of the cortex and with many parts of the default network.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0807933106", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076985735", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2001331727", "title": "(Mis)perception of sleep in insomnia: A puzzle and a resolution.", "text": "Insomnia is prevalent, causing severe distress and impairment. This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025730", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001331727", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we assessed the associations of gender, SDB, and symptoms of SDB in 389 participants (16 to 84 yr of age) in an ongoing genetic-epidemiologic study of sleep apnea. Subjects included index probands with laboratory-confirmed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (laboratory sample, n = 36) and their family members and neighbors (the community sample). SDB was assessed with overnight in-home monitoring of airflow, oximetry, heart rate, and chest wall impedance, and symptoms were assessed with standardized questionnaires. In the entire sample, SDB, defined as a respiratory disturbance index [RDI] > or = 15, was more prevalent among males (38%) than among females (15%) (p < 0.05). Males predominated by a ratio of 8:1 in the laboratory sample (31 males, five females). In contrast, the proportion of males to females with SDB was only 2:1 in the community sample, in which an RDI > or = 15 was observed among 26% of males and 13% of females. In the laboratory sample, females tended to be younger and were significantly heavier than males. However, in the community sample, females with SDB were older than male apneic subjects (63.4 +/- 13.9 versus 47.2 +/- 15.6 years, mean +/- SD; p < 0.01), and included a majority of postmenopausal women (75%). No differences in body mass index were noted between males and females with SDB recruited from the community.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.149.3.8118642", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011269552", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2015801870", "title": "A Clinical Guide to Pediatric Sleep: Diagnosis and Management of Sleep Problems", "text": "A Clinical Guide to Pediatric Sleep: Diagnosis and Management of Sleep Problems, by Jodi A. Mindell and Judith A. Owens, Hagerstown, MD, Lippincott William & Wilkins, 295 pp., $42.95 in softcover. This is one of the most comprehensive, yet compact and easy-to-read books on sleep disorders in children. It is an important and necessary resource for every practicing pediatrician and pediatric primary care provider. The book is written to sensitize and it enhances the knowledge of pediatricians about sleep disorders in children. It underscores the facts that sleep disorders in children, when undiagnosed and untreated, become chronic conditions and have global impact on children's physical, emotional, and social development. Further, sleep disorders often coexist with mental health issues, attention deficits, social and school performance concerns in children. The book discusses the homeostatic process and endogenous circadian rhythm preferences of children in different age groups. It provides excellent handouts for anticipatory guidance to parents and has been written in a superb manner. The authors have classified the sleep disorders using DSM IV criteria and provided the ICD-9 codes for different types of sleep disorders to make office billing easy for the care providers. Chapter 4 discusses the evaluation of sleep disorders that includes comprehensive, yet simple questionnaires on sleep history of the child. It further goes into a differential diagnosis using symptom-based algorithms. The next chapter discusses the diagnosis and management of common sleep problems such as bedtime problems, night wakening, nighttime fears, nightmares, sleepwalking, night terrors, head banging, body rocking, bruxism, sleep apnea, sleep disordered breathing, restless leg syndrome, and periodic limb disorder. The chapter on sleep and medications is comprehensive and is written extremely well. It discusses most of the common drugs used for sleep disorders as well as drugs having effect on sleep. The medicine list is extensive and includes antihistamines, benzidiazpines, chloral hydrate, clonidine, trazadone, zolpidem (ambien), anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antihistamines, decongestants, steroids, nicotine, caffeine, and also commonly used herbal medicines. The authors take special efforts to discuss sleep issues seen in children with special health care needs. Further they discuss sleep and other medical conditions such as asthma, attention deficits, gastroesophageal (GE) reflux, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), migraines, fibromylagia, etc. Sleep, as part of several psychiatric conditions, is also discussed in details. Amazingly, the authors save the best to the last part of the book in the form of appendices. Appendix A, B, C, &D discuss the tools to diagnose sleep disorders and it includes simple yet comprehensive screening questionnaires, and sleep diaries that can be used for parents. Appendix E has six nicely written handouts on sleeps issues from birth to 18 years, and can be used for providing anticipatory guidance to parents. Appendix F provides diagnosis and management and handouts on 14 common sleep disorders seen in pediatric practice: Bedtime Problems, Nightwakings, Nighttime fears, Nightmares, Sleepwalking, Sleep Terrors, Head banging and Body rocking, Bruxism, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, Narcolepsy, Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome, Insomnia; and two general handouts as Sleep Tips for children, and adolescents. All of these are extremely useful for parents. Appendix G gives resources to the families for further help in dealing with sleep disorder(s) of their child. Finally the references and the index are written in an organized manner.

Selected evidence (362 articles) can be consolidated into seven management steps. SDB is suspected when symptoms or abnormalities related to upper airway obstruction are present (step 1). Central nervous or cardiovascular system morbidity, growth failure or enuresis and predictors of SDB persistence in the long-term are recognised (steps 2 and 3), and SDB severity is determined objectively preferably using polysomnography (step 4). Children with an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) >5 episodes·h(-1), those with an AHI of 1-5 episodes·h(-1) and the presence of morbidity or factors predicting SDB persistence, and children with complex conditions (e.g. Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome) all appear to benefit from treatment (step 5). Treatment interventions are usually implemented in a stepwise fashion addressing all abnormalities that predispose to SDB (step 6) with re-evaluation after each intervention to detect residual disease and to determine the need for additional treatment (step 7).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00385-2015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2190236223", "source": "openalex"}

Abnormalities in chemoreflex mechanisms may be implicated in increased cardiovascular stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We tested the hypothesis that chemoreflex function is altered in patients with OSA. Methods and Results —We compared ventilatory, sympathetic, heart rate, and blood pressure responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and the cold pressor test in 16 untreated normotensive patients with OSA and 12 normal control subjects matched for age and body mass index. Baseline muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was higher in the patients with OSA than in the control subjects (43±4 versus 21±3 bursts per minute; P &lt;0.001). During hypoxia, patients with OSA had greater increases in minute ventilation (5.8±0.8 versus 3.2±0.7 L/min; P =0.02), heart rate (10±1 versus 7±1 bpm; P =0.03), and mean arterial pressure (7±2 versus 0±2 mm Hg; P =0.001) than control subjects. Despite higher ventilation and blood pressure (both of which inhibit sympathetic activity) in OSA patients, the MSNA increase during hypoxia was similar in OSA patients and control subjects. When the sympathetic-inhibitory influence of breathing was eliminated by apnea during hypoxia, the increase in MSNA in OSA patients (106±20%) was greater than in control subjects (52±23%; P =0.04). Prolongation of R-R interval with apnea during hypoxia was also greater in OSA patients (24±6%) than in control subjects (7±5%) ( P =0.04). Autonomic, ventilatory, and blood pressure responses to hypercapnia and the cold pressor test in OSA patients were not different from those observed in control subjects. Conclusions —OSA is associated with a selective potentiation of autonomic, hemodynamic, and ventilatory responses to peripheral chemoreceptor activation by hypoxia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.99.9.1183", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048870600", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we show that with off-the-shelf WiFi devices, fine-grained sleep information like a person's respiration, sleeping postures and rollovers can be successfully extracted. We do this by introducing Wi-Sleep, the first sleep monitoring system based on WiFi signals. Wi-Sleep adopts off-the-shelf WiFi devices to continuously collect the fine-grained wireless channel state information (CSI) around a person. From the CSI, Wi-Sleep extracts rhythmic patterns associated with respiration and abrupt changes due to the body movement. Compared to existing sleep monitoring systems that usually require special devices attached to human body (i.e. Probes, head belt, and wrist band), Wi-Sleep is completely contact less. In addition, different from many vision-based sleep monitoring systems, Wi-Sleep is robust to low-light environments and does not raise privacy concerns. Preliminary testing results show that the Wi-Sleep can reliably track a person's respiration and sleeping postures in different conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/rtss.2014.30", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1989259731", "source": "openalex"}

Words learned at 8 p.m. do not induce (inhibitory) competition effects immediately, but do so after a 12-hr interval including a night's sleep, and continue to induce such effects after 24 hr. In contrast, words learned at 8 a.m. do not show such effects immediately or after 12 hr ofwakefulness, but show the effects only after 24 hr, after sleep has occurred.

Changes in the steady-state level of transcripts for various genes are remarkably common during sleep, as 2,090 genes in the cerebral cortex and 409 genes in the hypothalamus were defined as sleep specific and changed (increased or decreased) their expression during sleep. The largest categories of overrepresented genes increasing expression with sleep were those involved in biosynthesis and transport. In both the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, during sleep there was upregulation of multiple genes encoding various enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, as well as proteins for lipid transport. There was also upregulation during sleep of genes involved in synthesis of proteins, heme, and maintenance of vesicle pools, as well as antioxidant enzymes and genes encoding proteins of energy-regulating pathways.

REM during the intervening 4 hr did not appear to contribute to improvement. A two-step process, modeling throughput as the product of the amount of early SWS and late REM, accounts for 80 percent of intersubject variance.

We developed a novel method of assessing sleep duration using data from 4,094 Whitehall II Study (United Kingdom, 2012–2013) participants aged 60–83 who wore the accelerometer for 9 consecutive days, filled in a sleep log and reported sleep duration via questionnaire. Our sleep detection algorithm defined (nocturnal) sleep as a period of sustained inactivity, itself detected as the absence of change in arm angle greater than 5 degrees for 5 minutes or more, during a period recorded as sleep by the participant in their sleep log. The resulting estimate of sleep duration had a moderate (but similar to previous findings) agreement with questionnaire based measures for time in bed, defined as the difference between sleep onset and waking time (kappa = 0.32, 95%CI:0.29,0.34) and total sleep duration (kappa = 0.39, 0.36,0.42). This estimate was lower for time in bed for women, depressed participants, those reporting more insomnia symptoms, and on weekend days. No such group differences were found for total sleep duration. Our algorithm was validated against data from a polysomnography study on 28 persons which found a longer time window and lower angle threshold to have better sensitivity to wakefulness, while the reverse was true for sensitivity to sleep. The novelty of our method is the use of a generic algorithm that will allow comparison between studies rather than a \"count\" based, device specific method.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142533", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2180429985", "source": "openalex"}

Stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep were severely or completely suppressed. The sustained wakefulness could be attributed to pain and environmental disturbance to only minor degree.

These models are and will be variously neurochemical, chronobiological, genetic, and developmental in nature. Adequate testing of these models and predictions from them will require the use of pharmacologic and naturalistic probes and the use of sophisticated CNS imaging techniques. These probes will help further characterize the physiology of depression under conditions of disequilibrium or perturbation, such as following sleep deprivation, REM deprivation, phase advancement of the major sleep period, or the administration of antidepressant drugs with specific monoaminergic activity. Concurrently, if one is to understand further whether the sleep abnormalities of depression are part of a larger circadian rhythm disturbance, investigations will necessarily include 24-h measures of sleep-wake activity, psychomotor activity, and probably core body temperature rhythm under constant routine conditions. A complementary point of view would suggest that more intensive investigative efforts be focused on the first 100 min of sleep at night, since it is the first NREM-REM cycle that seems to show the greatest and most specific deviation in depressed patients from normal controls. Efforts to characterize further this part of the 24-h cycle, with respect to age- and gender-related variance as well as responses to physiologic, hormonal, pharmacologic, and naturalistic probes, are strongly warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/10.3.199", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1698710880", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2126469441", "title": "Antidepressants and their effect on sleep", "text": "Abstract Given the relationship between sleep and depression, there is inevitably going to be an effect of antidepressants on sleep. Current evidence suggests that this effect depends on the class of antidepressant used and the dosage. The extent of variation between the effects of antidepressants and sleep may relate to their mechanism of action. This systematic review examines randomised‐controlled trials (RCTs) that have reported the effect that antidepressants appear to have on sleep. RCTs are not restricted to depressed populations, since several studies provide useful information about the effects on sleep in other groups. Nevertheless, the distinction is made between those studies because the participant's health may influence the baseline sleep profiles and the effect of the antidepressant. Insomnia is often seen with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), with all tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) except amitriptyline, and all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with venlafaxine and moclobemide as well. Sedation has been reported with all TCAs except desipramine, with mirtazapine and nefazodone, the TCA‐related maprotiline, trazodone and mianserin, and with all MAOIs. REM sleep suppression has been observed with all TCAs except trimipramine, but especially clomipramine, with all MAOIs and SSRIs and with venlafaxine, trazodone and bupropion. However, the effect on sleep varies between compounds within antidepressant classes, differences relating to the amount of sedative or alerting (insomnia) effects, changes to baseline sleep parameters, differences relating to REM sleep, and the degree of sleep‐related side effects.

Little is known, however, about how and when this inferential knowledge emerges. Here, we test the hypothesis that human relational memory develops during offline time periods. Fifty-six participants initially learned five \"premise pairs\" (A>B, B>C, C>D, D>E, and E>F). Unknown to subjects, the pairs contained an embedded hierarchy (A>B>C>D>E>F). Following an offline delay of either 20 min, 12 hr (wake or sleep), or 24 hr, knowledge of the hierarchy was tested by examining inferential judgments for novel \"inference pairs\" (B>D, C>E, and B>E). Despite all groups achieving near-identical premise pair retention after the offline delay (all groups, >85%; the building blocks of the hierarchy), a striking dissociation was evident in the ability to make relational inference judgments: the 20-min group showed no evidence of inferential ability (52%), whereas the 12- and 24-hr groups displayed highly significant relational memory developments (inference ability of both groups, >75%; P < 0.001). Moreover, if the 12-hr period contained sleep, an additional boost to relational memory was seen for the most distant inferential judgment (the B>E pair; sleep = 93%, wake = 69%, P = 0.03). Interestingly, despite this increase in performance, the sleep benefit was not associated with an increase in subjective confidence for these judgments. Together, these findings demonstrate that human relational memory develops during offline time delays. Furthermore, sleep appears to preferentially facilitate this process by enhancing hierarchical memory binding, thereby allowing superior performance for the more distant inferential judgments, a benefit that may operate below the level of conscious awareness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0700094104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157011581", "source": "openalex"}

The sedative-like effects of melatonin were assessed by a simple sleep test: at 1330 h subjects were asked to hold a positive pressure switch in each hand and to relax with eyes closed while reclining in a quiet darkened room. Latency and duration of switch release, indicators of sleep, were measured. Areas under the time-melatonin concentration curve varied in proportion to the different melatonin doses ingested, and the 0.1- and 0.3-mg doses generated peak serum melatonin levels that were within the normal range of nocturnal melatonin levels in untreated people. All melatonin doses tested significantly increased sleep duration, as well as self-reported sleepiness and fatigue, relative to placebo.

Linear regression analysis was used to model the independent and synergistic effects of race and SES on sleep after adjusting for other factors that impact sleep in midlife women. Indices of SES were self-reported educational attainment and financial strain. Sleep was worse in African American women than Caucasian participants as measured by self-report, visual sleep stage scoring, and NREM EEG power. Slow wave sleep differences were also observed between Chinese and Caucasian participants. Racial differences persisted after adjustment for indices of SES. Although educational attainment was unrelated to sleep, financial strain was associated with decreased sleep quality and lower sleep efficiency. Financial strain-by-race interactions were not statistically significant, suggesting that financial strain has additive effects on sleep, independent of race. Independent relationships between race and financial strain with sleep were observed despite statistical adjustment for other factors that might account for these relationships. Results do not suggest that assessed indices of SES moderate the race-sleep relationship, perhaps due to too few women of low SES in the study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep/32.1.73", "url": "https://openalex.org/W165310196", "source": "openalex"}

The initial steps of this process occur at a cellular level within minutes or hours. Besides this rapid synaptic consolidation, systems consolidation occurs within a time frame of days to years. For declarative memory, the latter is presumed to rely on an interaction between different brain regions, in particular the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Specifically, sleep has been proposed to provide a setting that supports such systems consolidation processes, leading to a transfer and perhaps transformation of memories. Using functional MRI, we show that postlearning sleep enhances hippocampal responses during recall of word pairs 48 h after learning, indicating intrahippocampal memory processing during sleep. At the same time, sleep induces a memory-related functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the mPFC. Six months after learning, memories activated the mPFC more strongly when they were encoded before sleep, showing that sleep leads to long-lasting changes in the representation of memories on a systems level.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0705454104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2053308210", "source": "openalex"}

However, data are limited to self-reported sleep problems and may be confounded with other comorbidities. We examined whether electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep parameters predicted survival time independently of known predictors of all-cause mortality. Methods A total of 185 healthy older adults, primarily in their 60s through 80s, with no history of mental illness, sleep complaints, or current cognitive impairment, were enrolled in one of eight research protocols between October 1981 and February 1997 that included EEG sleep assessments.

The authors used two waves of data from a panel study of community residents aged 50 years or more to investigate this issue prospectively. METHOD: Data on symptoms of major depressive episodes and sleep problems were examined for a subgroup of the 1994 and 1995 surveys of the Alameda County (California) Study (N=2,370). The authors examined the effects of age, gender, education, marital status, social isolation, functional impairment, financial strain, and alcohol use. Depression was measured with 12 items that covered the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive episodes, including insomnia and hypersomnia. RESULTS: The prevalences were 23.1% for insomnia and 6.7% for hypersomnia in 1994. Sleep was a significant correlate of depression, as were being female, older age, social isolation, low education, financial strain, and functional impairment. When sleep problems and depression were examined prospectively, with controls for the effects of the other variables, sleep problems in 1994 predicted depression in 1995. However, other symptoms of major depressive episodes—anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness, psychomotor agitation/retardation, mood disturbance, thoughts of death—were much stronger predictors of future major depression. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance and other symptoms that are diagnostic for major depression are strongly associated with the risk of future depression. Sleep disturbance appears to be a less important predictor of depression. More epidemiologic research is needed on the relative contributions of the range of depressive symptoms to the risk of clinical depression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.157.1.81", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2166070267", "source": "openalex"}

In both groups, insulin sensitivity (SI) significantly decreased after sleep restriction, without a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, and inflammation increased. In male participants exposed to circadian misalignment, the reduction in SI and the increase in inflammation both doubled compared with those who maintained regular nocturnal bedtimes.

The present analyses are based on results available for 588 boys and 558 girls for whom mothers completed questions concerning demographics and sleep at annual intervals when their child was aged 10–13 years. The results indicated that nocturnal sleep times decreased, bedtimes were delayed and differences between weekend and school day sleep schedules progressively increased with age. Gender and puberty were both associated with the timing of sleep on weekends. Girls presented longer weekend time in bed (TIB) and later weekend wake time than boys. Similarly, subjects with higher pubertal status showed longer weekend TIB and later weekend wake time than subjects with lower pubertal status. Difficulty falling asleep was associated with later weekend wake time and with sleeping with a night light. In conclusion, the gender differences commonly reported in adolescents’ sleep patterns are most likely explained by girls’ higher pubertal status. This study emphasizes the link between puberty and a putative physiological need for more sleep, in presence of a general reduction of sleep times during adolescence.

In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress−sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home‐schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13052", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3015126389", "source": "openalex"}

Fifty-six healthy adolescents (25 males, age = 15–19 y) who studied in top high schools and were not habitual short sleepers were randomly assigned to Sleep Restriction (SR) or Control groups. Participants underwent a 2-w protocol consisting of 3 baseline nights (TIB = 9 h), 7 nights of sleep opportunity manipulation (TIB = 5 h for the SR and 9 h for the control groups), and 3 nights of recovery sleep (TIB = 9 h) at a boarding school. A cognitive test battery was administered three times each day. During the manipulation period, the SR group demonstrated incremental deterioration in sustained attention, working memory and executive function, increase in subjective sleepiness, and decrease in positive mood. Subjective sleepiness and sustained attention did not return to baseline levels even after 2 recovery nights. In contrast, the control group maintained baseline levels of cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood throughout the study. Incremental improvement in speed of processing, as a result of repeated testing and learning, was observed in the control group but was attenuated in the sleep-restricted participants, who, despite two recovery sleep episodes, continued to perform worse than the control participants. A week of partial sleep deprivation impairs a wide range of cognitive functions, subjective alertness, and mood even in high-performing high school adolescents. Some measures do not recover fully even after 2 nights of recovery sleep. A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page 497. Some of the world's most sleep deprived students live in East Asia where students excel in standardized academic tests. This might reinforce the notion that 'mind over matter' can overcome negative effects of chronic sleep restriction. We found that in adolescents, partial sleep deprivation of comparable duration and severity to that examined in studies on young healthy adults elicited equivalent or greater neurobehavioral deficits across several cognitive domains. Residual effects on sustained attention, speed of processing, and subjective alertness can still be observed even after 2 nights of recovery sleep. That even students from top high schools are susceptible to neurobehavioral deficits should cause policymakers and parents to reconsider if sleep should continue to be sacrificed for the sake of academic achievement.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.5552", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2177261198", "source": "openalex"}

Self-rated sleep measures (from the Karolinska Sleep Diary) were obtained after each sleep and subjected to intraindividual regression analyses across time. Most subjective sleep measures showed a strong covariation across conditions. Subjective quality of sleep mainly involved variables of sleep continuity, in particular, perceived calmness of sleep and sleep efficiency. “Sleep quality,” “calm sleep,” “ease of falling asleep,” and ability to “sleep throughout” the time allotted strongly covaried and formed an index of sleep quality. Self-rated ease of awakening deviated from the general pattern and was associated with poor sleep quality. So was reported dreaming (related to awakenings). It was concluded that most subjective sleep measures tend to covary across conditions and that “good sleep” is mainly a question of sleep continuity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1994.79.1.287", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035540709", "source": "openalex"}

The first section deals with whether efficacy and/or effectiveness have been demonstrated for continuous PAP (CPAP) treatment based on a variety of parameters and the level of OSA severity. Next, CPAP titration conducted with full, attended polysomnography in a sleep laboratory is compared with titration done under various other conditions. The third section investigates what can be expected regarding adherence and compliance with CPAP treatment as measured by subjective and objective methods and what factors may influence these parameters. Side effects and the influence of other specific factors on efficacy, effectiveness and safety of CPAP therapy are evaluated in the fourth section. Finally, the use of bilevel PAP therapy is reviewed for both patients with OSA and those with other selected nocturnal breathing disorders.

In the infant guinea pig, the electrocorticographic (ECoG) patterns of sleep were similar to those of the adult, except for the absence of spindles during the first 3 weeks. In the rat and the cat, states of vigilance were not clearly differentiated in ECoG patterns during the first week; near the 8th day a fast, high amplitude ECoG appeared during paradoxical sleep (PS). The first signs of slow‐wave sleep (SWS) appeared at 11 to 13 days of age in the rat and at 15 to 21 days in the cat. The greater the immaturity of the animal at birth, the greater was the amount of time spent in PS in the perinatal period. In the rat, which was born the most immature, the decrease in the percent time of PS was very rapid: 70 % at birth, it decreased to 12% on the 30th day. In the cat the decrease was slower. In the guinea pig, despite its relative maturity, the percent time of PS at birth was 7%, approximately double that in the adult. The length of extrauterine life as well as the degree of immaturity at birth, played a role in the development of the sleep‐wakefulness cycle.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.420020407", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1967797215", "source": "openalex"}

In six patients with obstructive sleep apnea, we applied incremental levels of positive pressure through a nasal mask during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. A positive critical opening pressure (Pcrit) of 3.3 +/- 3.3 (SD) cmH2O was demonstrated. As nasal pressure was raised above Pcrit, inspiratory airflow increased in proportion to the level of positive pressure applied until apneas were abolished (P less than 0.01). However, at pressures greater than Pcrit, esophageal pressures either did not correlate or correlated inversely with inspiratory airflow provided that esophageal pressure was less than Pcrit. When pressure was applied to a full face mask, inspiratory airflow did not occur and Pcrit could not be obtained at pressures well above Pcrit demonstrated with the nasal mask.

A mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (MOAHI) greater than or equal to 1 on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) defined OSA. A sleep laboratory physician read nocturnal oximetry trend and event graphs, blinded to clinical and polysomnographic results. Likelihood ratios were used to determine the change in probability of having OSA before and after oximetry results were known.Of 349 patients, 210 (60%) had OSA as defined polysomnographically. Oximetry trend graphs were classified as positive for OSA in 93 and negative or inconclusive in 256 patients. Of the 93 oximetry results read as positive, PSG confirmed OSA in 90 patients. A positive oximetry trend graph had a likelihood ratio of 19.4, increasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 97%. The median MOAHI of children with a positive oximetry result was 16.4 (7.5, 30.2). The 3 false-positive oximetry results were all in the subgroup of 92 children who had diagnoses other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy that might have affected breathing during sleep. A negative or inconclusive oximetry result had a likelihood ratio of.58, decreasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 47%. Interobserver reliability for oximetry readings was very good to excellent (kappa =.80).In the setting of a child suspected of having OSA, a positive nocturnal oximetry trend graph has at least a 97% positive predictive value. Oximetry could: 1) be the definitive diagnostic test for straightforward OSA attributable to adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children older than 12 months of age, or 2) quickly and inexpensively identify children with a history suggesting sleep-disordered breathing who would require PSG to elucidate the type and severity.

The period of study included 8 h of nocturnal sleep, 28 h of continuous wakefulness, and 8 h of daytime sleep. Blood samples for the measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, cortisol, and growth hormone were collected at 20-min intervals throughout the entire study. Insulin secretion rates were derived from C-peptide levels by deconvolution. Sleep was polygraphically monitored. During nocturnal sleep, levels of glucose and insulin secretion increased by 31 +/- 5% and 60 +/- 11%, respectively, and returned to baseline in the morning. During sleep deprivation, glucose levels and insulin secretion rose again to reach a maximum at a time corresponding to the beginning of the habitual sleep period. The magnitude of the rise above morning levels averaged 17 +/- 5% for glucose and 49 +/- 8% for calculated insulin secretion. Serum insulin levels did not parallel the circadian variation in insulin secretion, indicating the existence of an approximate 40% increase in insulin clearance during the night. Daytime sleep was associated with a 16 +/- 3% rise in glucose levels, a 55 +/- 7% rise in insulin secretion, and a 39 +/- 5% rise in serum insulin. The diurnal variation in insulin secretion was inversely related to the cortisol rhythm, with a significant correlation of the magnitudes of their morning to evening excursions. Sleep-associated rises in glucose correlated with the amount of concomitant growth hormone secreted. These studies demonstrate previously underappreciated effects of circadian rhythmicity and sleep on glucose levels, insulin secretion, and insulin clearance, and suggest that these effects could be partially mediated by cortisol and growth hormone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci115396", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127903745", "source": "openalex"}

In 31 healthy male volunteers, blood samples were obtained every 30 min during 2 nights: uninterrupted, baseline sleep and partial sleep deprivation-early night (awake until 0300 h). Sleep was measured by electroencephalogram polysomnography. Sleep onset was associated with an increase in serum levels of IL-6 (P < 0.05) during baseline sleep. During PSD-E, the nocturnal increase in IL-6 was delayed until sleep at 0300 h. Sleep stage analyses indicated that the nocturnal increase in IL-6 occurred in association with stage 1–2 sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, but levels during slow wave sleep were not different from those while awake. The profile of GH across the 2 nights was similar to that of IL-6, whereas the circadian-driven hormones cortisol and melatonin showed no concordance with sleep. Loss of sleep may serve to decrease nocturnal IL-6 levels, with effects on the integrity of immune system functioning. Alternatively, given the association between sleep stages and IL-6 levels, depressed or aged populations who show increased amounts of REM sleep and a relative loss of slow wave sleep may have elevated nocturnal concentrations of IL-6 with implications for inflammatory disease risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.85.10.6871", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030421130", "source": "openalex"}

A narrowed upper airway is very common among OSA patients, and is usually in adults due to nonspecific factors such as fat deposition in the neck, or abnormal bony morphology of the upper airway. Functional impairment of the upper airway dilating muscles is particularly important in the development of OSA, and patients have a reduction both in tonic and phasic contraction of these muscles during sleep when compared to normals. A variety of defective respiratory control mechanisms are found in OSA, including impaired chemical drive, defective inspiratory load responses, and abnormal upper airway protective reflexes. These defects may play an important role in the abnormal upper airway muscle responses found among patients with OSA. Local upper airway reflexes mediated by surface receptors sensitive to intrapharyngeal pressure changes appear to be important in this respect. Arousal plays an important role in the termination of each apnoea, but may also contribute to the development of further apnoea, because of reduction in respiratory drive related to the hypocapnia which results from postapnoeic hyperventilation. A cyclical pattern of repetitive obstructive apnoeas may result. A better understanding of the integrated pathophysiology of OSA should help in the development of new therapeutic techniques.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.95.08071161", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116502512", "source": "openalex"}

Our circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus, is entrained to the 24-hour solar day via a pathway from the retina and synchronises our internal biological rhythms. Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external light-dark cycles. While the exact relationship between the availability of artificial light and CRSWD remains to be established, nocturnal light has been shown to alter circadian rhythms and sleep in humans. On the other hand, light can also be used as an effective and noninvasive therapeutic option with little to no side effects, to improve sleep,mood and general well-being.

Therefore, we have developed a portable multibiomedical (PMB) recorder that monitors five parameters: indirect blood pressure, physical activity, body position, ambient temperature, and RR interval of the electrocardiogram. In the present study, we applied the PMB recorder over a 24-hour period to study the effect of insufficient sleep on blood pressure in subjects doing extensive overtime work. The parameters listed above were measured by the PMB recorder throughout a normal workday (mean period of sleep, 8 hours) and throughout a day with insufficient sleep (mean period of sleep, 3.6 hours) in 18 male technical workers aged 23 to 48 years old. Blood pressure (mean systolic/diastolic pressure±SD) significantly increased the day after a sleep-insufficient night (129±8/79±6 mm Hg) compared with the day after a normal night (123±8/76±7 mm Hg, P &lt;.05). However, ambient temperature, mean number of steps per minute, and percentage of time spent in a standing position showed no significant difference between these days. Spectral analysis of RR intervals showed that the ratio of the low-frequency component on the RR power spectrum (0.05 to 0.15 Hz) to the high-frequency component (0.15 to 0.40 Hz) was higher on the sleep-insufficient day (2.17±0.37 versus 1.81±0.37), as was the urinary excretion of norepinephrine ( P &lt;.05). Heart rate was significantly higher on the sleep-insufficient day (81±11 versus 76±8 beats per minute), after the data of two subjects with abnormal levels of physical activity were excluded ( P &lt;.01). These data suggest that lack of sleep may increase sympathetic nervous system activity on the following day, leading to increased blood pressure.

Humans can bear several days of continuous sleeplessness, experiencing deterioration in wellbeing and effectiveness; however, also a shorter reduction in the sleep time may lead to deteriorated functioning. Sleeplessness accounts for impaired perception, difficulties in keeping concentration, vision disturbances, slower reactions, as well as the appearance of microepisodes of sleep during wakefulness which lead to lower capabilities and efficiency of task performance and to increased number of errors. Sleep deprivation results in poor memorizing, schematic thinking, which yields wrong decisions, and emotional disturbances such as deteriorated interpersonal responses and increased aggressiveness. The symptoms are accompanied by brain tissue hypometabolism, particularly in the thalamus, prefrontal, frontal and occipital cortex and motor speech centres. Sleep deficiency intensifies muscle tonus and coexisting tremor, speech performance becomes monotonous and unclear, and sensitivity to pain is higher. Sleeplessness also relates to the changes in the immune response and the pattern of hormonal secretion, of the growth hormone in particular. The risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease increases. The impairment of performance which is caused by 20-25 hours of sleeplessness is comparable to that after ethanol intoxication at the level of 0.10% blood alcohol concentration. The consequences of chronic sleep reduction or a shallow sleep repeated for several days tend to accumulate and resemble the effects of acute sleep deprivation lasting several dozen hours. At work, such effects hinder proper performance of many essential tasks and in extreme situations (machine operation or vehicle driving), sleep loss may be hazardous to the worker and his/her environment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2478/v10001-010-0004-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1593453890", "source": "openalex"}

Arousal regulation and memory consolidation appear to be important in determining the development of PTSD; both are functions of sleep. Sleep findings from patients with chronic PTSD are complex and somewhat contradictory, and data from the acute phase are quite limited. The aim of the present study was to obtain polysomnographic recordings during an acute period after life-threatening experiences and injury and to relate measures of sleep duration and maintenance and the timing, intensity, and continuity of REM sleep to the early development of PTSD. METHOD: Twenty-one injured subjects meeting study criteria received at least one polysomnographic recording close to the time of medical/surgical stabilization and within a month of injury. PTSD symptoms were assessed concurrently and 6 weeks later. Sleep measures were compared among injured subjects with and without significant PTSD symptoms at follow-up and 10 noninjured comparison subjects and were also correlated with PTSD severity. RESULTS: There was more wake time after the onset of sleep in injured, trauma-exposed patients than in noninjured comparison subjects. Development of PTSD symptoms was associated with shorter average duration of REM sleep before a stage change and more periods of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The development of PTSD symptoms after traumatic injury is associated with a more fragmented pattern of REM sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.159.10.1696", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990320386", "source": "openalex"}

The present study investigated the concentration of lipid peroxidation biomarkers in patients with OSA in comparison with nonapneic controls and the effects of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) on these biomarkers.In Experiment 1, morning plasma levels of the oxidative-stress biomarkers, thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) and peroxides (PD), and of the antioxidant protective enzyme paraxonase-1 (PON1), were measured in OSA patients with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in nonapneic controls after an overnight fasting. The concentrations of the biomarkers were compared between patients and controls and were correlated with respiratory disturbance index (RDI). In Experiment 2, TBARS and PD were measured at hourly intervals during sleep in sleep-apnea patients before and after nCPAP treatment as well as in controls.In the first experiment, 114 consecutive patients with sleep apnea, 55 without (+OSA/-CVD) and 59 with CVD (+OSA/+CVD), and 30 nonapneic controls were investigated. Nine patients and 6 controls participated in Experiment 2. Five of the patients were also studied 9.3 +/- 3.9 months after nCPAP treatment.Morning levels of TBARS and PD were found to be significantly higher in both groups of OSA patients than in controls. The PON1 was lower in +OSA/+CVD patients than in controls and +OSA/-CVD patients, but the difference between the 2 OSA groups bordered on statistical significance.

A substantial body of literature has accumulated that provides a rational basis the evaluation and treatment of SWD and JLD. Physiological assessment has involved determination of circadian phase using core body temperature and the timing of melatonin secretion. Behavioral assessment has involved sleep logs, actigraphy and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ).

Regular-spiking and intrinsically bursting cortical neurons were mostly recorded from association suprasylvian areas 5 and 7; fewer neurons were also recorded from pericruciate motor and posterolateral visual areas. Although most cells were investigated under various anesthetics, a similar slow cortical rhythm was found in animals with brainstem transection at the low- or high-collicular levels. These cerveau isole (isolated forebrain) preparations display the major sleep rhythms of the EEG in the absence of general anesthetics. In 38% of recorded cortical neurons (n = 105), the slow rhythm was combined with delta oscillation. Both cellular rhythms were phase locked to the slow and delta oscillations in the surface- and depth-recorded EEG. In a group of this cell sample (n = 47), delta activity occurred as stereotyped, clock-like action potentials during the interdepolarization lulls of the slow rhythm. In another neuronal subsample (n = 58), delta events were grouped in sequences superimposed upon the depolarizing envelope of the slow rhythm, with such sequences recurring rhythmically at approximately 0.3–0.4 Hz. The associations between the two cellular and EEG rhythms (1–4 Hz and 0.3–0.4 Hz) were quantified by means of autocorrelograms, cross-correlograms, and spike-triggered averages. In 26% of recorded neurons (n = 72), the slow rhythm was combined with spindle oscillations. Regular-spiking cortical neurons fully reflected the whole frequency range of thalamically generated spindles (7–14 Hz). However, during similar patterns of EEG spindling, intrinsically bursting cells fired grouped action potentials (with intraburst frequencies of 100–200 Hz) at only 2–4 Hz. The dependence of the slow cortical oscillation upon the thalamus was studied by lesions and stimulation. The slow rhythm survived extensive ipsilateral thalamic destruction by means of electrolytic lesions or kainate-induced loss of perikarya in thalamic nuclei that were input sources to the recorded cortical neurons. To further prevent the possibility of a thalamic role in the genesis of the slow rhythm, through the contralateral thalamocortical systems and callosal projections, we also transected the corpus callosum in thalamically lesioned animals, and still recorded the slow rhythm in cortical neurons.

No significant incremental effect on CRP levels was found for the combined interventions as compared with either weight loss or CPAP alone. Reductions in insulin resistance and serum triglyceride levels were greater in the combined-intervention group than in the group receiving CPAP only, but there were no significant differences in these values between the combined-intervention group and the weight-loss group.

Although many theories of function, indirect evidence, and even common sense suggest sleep is needed for an increase in brain energy, brain energy levels have not been directly measured with modern technology. We here report that ATP levels, the energy currency of brain cells, show a surge in the initial hours of spontaneous sleep in wake-active but not in sleep-active brain regions of rat. The surge is dependent on sleep but not time of day, since preventing sleep by gentle handling of rats for 3 or 6 h also prevents the surge in ATP. A significant positive correlation was observed between the surge in ATP and EEG non-rapid eye movement delta activity (0.5-4.5 Hz) during spontaneous sleep. Inducing sleep and delta activity by adenosine infusion into basal forebrain during the normally active dark period also increases ATP. Together, these observations suggest that the surge in ATP occurs when the neuronal activity is reduced, as occurs during sleep. The levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (P-AMPK), well known for its role in cellular energy sensing and regulation, and ATP show reciprocal changes. P-AMPK levels are lower during the sleep-induced ATP surge than during wake or sleep deprivation. Together, these results suggest that sleep-induced surge in ATP and the decrease in P-AMPK levels set the stage for increased anabolic processes during sleep and provide insight into the molecular events leading to the restorative biosynthetic processes occurring during sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1423-10.2010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090240067", "source": "openalex"}

What is the most efficient sleep schedule? Does anything substitute for sleep? What is the most important sleep stage? Do we need less sleep when we get older? Genuine answers to these questions require some understanding of the function of sleep. How can one say which sleep is most efficient or how much sleep we need unless we know what sleep is supposed to accomplish? Sleep researchers and clinicians can retain some posture of expertise with answers like, \"Get enough sleep to keep from feeling sleepy during the day.\" But this temporizing answer addresses the issue of relieving discomfort , not the issue of need fulfillment. Would we feel comfortable advising patients to \"Eat enough to keep from feeling hungry\"? More genuine answers are difficult to come by because our understanding ofsleep function is quite uncertain. This paper aims to review for biologists the ground that sleep researchers have covered in their quest for the function of sleep and to convey our own contention that the issue is not yet resolved. This overview will not permit a detailed examination of all the theories of sleep function or the full merits of any of the theories, but we will note certain features of theoretical or empirical weakness to show why these theories have not enjoyed overwhelming acceptance. Greater attention will be given to the more recently advanced theories which have not been subjected to critical review. There are several indications that sleep is indeed functionally important, i.e., that it ultimately enhances survival. * Departments of Psychiatry and Psychology, The University of Chicago Correspondence: Sleep Research Laboratory, 5743 Drexel Ave. Chicago, IL 60637.

The occasional , rare reports of sleepless species or individuals probably result from insensitive or insufficiently prolonged observation. Sleep may also be ubiquitous among lower forms, e.g., amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, but this is uncertain because they do not show the characteristic electroencephalographic sleep patterns of the higher orders [I]. Their quiescent states might be simple reductions of activity characteristic of rest rather than sleep, which is much more organizationally complex. 2.Sleep has persisted in evolution even though it is apparently maladaptive with respect to other functions. While we sleep we do not procreate, protect or nurture the young, gather food, earn money, write papers, etc. It is against the logic of natural selection to sacrifice such important activities unless sleep serves equally or more important functions. 3.Accommodations are made to permit sleep in different environments and life styles. For example, the maintenance of critical muscle tone permits perching birds to sleep [2]. Some marine mammals sleep with one half ofthe brain at a time, which enables the wake half to continue regulation of periodic surfacing for air [3]. Many prey species select safe sleeping sites. 4.Sleep is homeostatically regulated. Sleep deprivation is usually followed by sleep compensation. The rebound sleep almost never compensates completely for lost sleep time, but it may be more \"intense\" than normal sleep. The urge to sleep following sleep deprivation may be so overpowering as to be life threatening, as is all too frequently seen in driving accidents. Selective deprivation of specific sleep stages is often followed by selective rebounds of the lost stage, suggesting that the different sleep stages serve at least partially different functions. 5.Serious physiological changes result from prolonged sleep deprivation of animals. Rats die after about two to three weeks of total sleep deprivation —not much longer than the average of 16 days of total food deprivation [4]. Rats also die after about five weeks of selective deprivation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [5], which usually comprises only about 7 to 10 percent of the adult rat's existence.

We investigated the effects of reduced sleep duration (by approximately 50%) to 4 h/night across 10 days, on peripherally circulating inflammatory mediators. In addition, we tested the prediction that degree of inflammation is quantitatively related to the extent to which pain is increased in response to prolonged sleep restriction. Randomized, 16 day controlled in-laboratory study conducted in GCRC. Eighteen volunteers were randomly assigned to either 12 days of sleeping 8 h/night or 4 h/night. Participants rated mood and pain symptoms throughout experimental days. Urine was collected and blood was drawn frequently on the baseline day and after the 10th experimental day for 25 hours.

IL-6 levels were elevated in the 4-h sleep condition over the 8-h sleep condition (P <0.05). CRP levels showed the same trend as IL-6, but did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.11). Levels of sTNFR p55 were unchanged in both groups. PG E2 and 11β-F2α metabolite increased in 4-h sleepers, but did not differ significantly from the 8-h sleepers. Elevated IL-6 levels were strongly associated with increased pain ratings in response to sleep restriction (r = 0.67, P <0.01), and this association could not be explained by elevations in tiredness-fatigue. Insufficient sleep quantity may facilitate and/or exacerbate pain through elevations of IL-6. In disorders where sleep disturbances are common, insufficient sleep quantity itself may establish and maintain its co-occurrence with pain and increased inflammation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/30.9.1145", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1890934353", "source": "openalex"}

In rodents, hippocampus-dependent memory may be particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation after training, as spatial memory in the Morris water maze is impaired by rapid eye movement sleep deprivation following training. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze, however, requires multiple training trials and performance, as measured by time to reach the hidden platform is influenced by not only spatial learning but also procedural learning. To determine if sleep is important for the consolidation of a single-trial, hippocampus-dependent task, we sleep deprived animals for 0–5 and 5–10 h after training for contextual and cued fear conditioning. We found that sleep deprivation from 0–5 h after training for this task impaired memory consolidation for contextual fear conditioning whereas sleep deprivation from 5–10 h after training had no effect. Sleep deprivation at either time point had no effect on cued fear conditioning, a hippocampus-independent task. Previous studies have determined that memory consolidation for fear conditioning is impaired when protein kinase A and protein synthesis inhibitors are administered at the same time as when sleep deprivation is effective, suggesting that sleep deprivation may act by modifying these molecular mechanisms of memory storage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.48803", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140117942", "source": "openalex"}

The stereotypical effects of heat or cold exposure are increased wakefulness and decreased rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep. These effects of the thermal environment on sleep stages are strongly linked to thermoregulation, which affects the mechanism regulating sleep. The effects on sleep stages also differ depending on the use of bedding and/or clothing. In semi-nude subjects, sleep stages are more affected by cold exposure than heat exposure. In real-life situations where bedding and clothing are used, heat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Humid heat exposure further increases thermal load during sleep and affects sleep stages and thermoregulation. On the other hand, cold exposure does not affect sleep stages, though the use of beddings and clothing during sleep is critical in supporting thermoregulation and sleep in cold exposure. However, cold exposure affects cardiac autonomic response during sleep without affecting sleep stages and subjective sensations. These results indicate that the impact of cold exposure may be greater than that of heat exposure in real-life situations; thus, further studies are warranted that consider the effect of cold exposure on sleep and other physiological parameters.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1880-6805-31-14", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2113296374", "source": "openalex"}

The sleep group was exposed to the novel words in the evening, followed by an initial test, a polysomnographically monitored night of sleep, and a second test in the morning. The wake group was exposed and initially tested in the morning and spent a retention interval of similar duration awake. Finally, both groups were tested a week later at the same circadian time to control for possible circadian effects. In the sleep group, participants recalled more words and recognized them faster after sleep, whereas in the wake group such changes were not observed until the final test 1 week later. Following acquisition of the novel words, recognition of the familiar words was slowed in both groups, but only after the retention interval, indicating that the novel words had been integrated into the mental lexicon following consolidation.

The study of how sleep regulatory networks are conserved is needed to better understand sleep across evolution. We present a detailed description of a sleep state in adult zebrafish characterized by reversible periods of immobility, increased arousal threshold, and place preference. Rest deprivation using gentle electrical stimulation is followed by a sleep rebound, indicating homeostatic regulation. In contrast to mammals and similarly to birds, light suppresses sleep in zebrafish, with no evidence for a sleep rebound. We also identify a null mutation in the sole receptor for the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) in zebrafish. Fish lacking this receptor demonstrate short and fragmented sleep in the dark, in striking contrast to the excessive sleepiness and cataplexy of narcolepsy in mammals. Consistent with this observation, we find that the hypocretin receptor does not colocalize with known major wake-promoting monoaminergic and cholinergic cell groups in the zebrafish. Instead, it colocalizes with large populations of GABAergic neurons, including a subpopulation of Adra2a-positive GABAergic cells in the anterior hypothalamic area, neurons that could assume a sleep modulatory role.

One hundred nine patients were excluded because they failed to obtain a postoperative polysomnogram or were lost to followup. All patients received a physical examination, cephalometric analysis, fiberoptic examination, and polysomnography before treatment to document OSAS and determine the areas of obstruction. A two‐phase surgical protocol was used for the reconstruction of the upper airway. Phase I surgery consisted of a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) for palatal obstruction and genioglossus advancement with hyoid myotomy‐suspension for base of tongue obstruction. Failures of phase I were offered phase 2 reconstruction, which consisted of maxillary‐mandibular advancement osteotomy. One hundred twenty‐one patients were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) before surgery and this was the primary method of evaluating surgical success. Results were reported on the polysomnogram performed a minimum of 6 months after surgery and compared to the preoperative polysomnogram and the second night nasal CPAP study. The polysomnographic results included respiratory disturbance index (RDI), lowest oxyhemoglobin saturation (LSAT), and sleep architecture parameters. Surgery was considered a success if it was equivalent to nasal CPAP or the postoperative RDI was less than 20 with normal oxygenation. The overall success rate, which included patients that dropped from the protocol, was 76.5%, with a mean followup of 9.3 months (SD, 6.7).

In order to establish whether sleep disorders truly belong to the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype, we conducted a subjective and objective study of sleep in a group of high-functioning adults with ASD but without sleep complaints, psychiatric disorders or neurological comorbidity. We compared the subjective data of 27 ASD participants with those of 78 healthy controls matched for chronological age and gender. Subjective measures of sleep in the clinical group were compatible with insomnia and/or a tolerable phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle. Subjective data were confirmed by objective laboratory sleep recordings in a subset of 16 patients and 16 controls. Persons with autism presented with a longer sleep latency (P < 0.04), more frequent nocturnal awakenings (P < 0.03), lower sleep efficiency (P < 0.03), increased duration of stage 1 sleep (P < 0.02), decreased non-REM sleep (stages 2 + 3 + 4, P < 0.04) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 + 4, P < 0.05), fewer stage 2 EEG sleep spindles (P < 0.004), and a lower number of rapid eye movements during REM sleep (P < 0.006) than did control participants. On clinical scales, the scores of persons with ASD on the Beck Depression Inventory were similar to those of persons without, but their trait anxiety scores on the Spielberger Anxiety Scale were higher (P < 0.02). The state anxiety scores of the Spielberger scale and cortisol levels were the same in the two groups. Objective total sleep time correlated negatively with the Social (-0.52, P < 0.05) and Communication (-0.54, P < 0.02) scales of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The sleep of clinical subgroups (10 with high-functioning autism, six with Asperger syndrome) did not differ, except for the presence of fewer EEG sleep spindles in the Asperger syndrome subgroup (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings indicate that atypicalities of sleep constitute a salient feature of the adult ASD phenotype and this should be further investigated in younger patients. Moreover, the results are consistent with an atypical organization of neural networks subserving the macro- and microstructure of sleep in ASD.

Moreover, poor sleep quality can be an important symptom of many sleep and medical disorders. However, objective measures of sleep quality, such as polysomnography, are not readily available to most clinicians in their daily routine, and are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for epidemiological and research studies., Several self-report questionnaires have, however, been developed. The present review aims to address their psychometric properties, construct validity, and factorial structure while presenting, comparing, and discussing the measurement properties of these sleep quality questionnaires. A systematic literature search, from 2008 to 2020, was performed using the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus, with predefined search terms. In total, 49 articles were analyzed from the 5734 articles found. The psychometric properties and factor structure of the following are reported: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), SLEEP-50 Questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). As the most frequently used subjective measurement of sleep quality, the PSQI reported good internal reliability and validity; however, different factorial structures were found in a variety of samples, casting doubt on the usefulness of total score in detecting poor and good sleepers. The sleep disorder scales (AIS, ISI, MSQ, JSS, LSEQ and SLEEP-50) reported good psychometric properties; nevertheless, AIS and ISI reported a variety of factorial models whereas LSEQ and SLEEP-50 appeared to be less useful for epidemiological and research settings due to the length of the questionnaires and their scoring. The MSQ and JSS seemed to be inexpensive and easy to administer, complete, and score, but further validation studies are needed. Finally, the ESS had good internal consistency and construct validity, while the main challenges were in its factorial structure, known-group difference and estimation of reliable cut-offs. Overall, the self-report questionnaires assessing sleep quality from different perspectives have good psychometric properties, with high internal consistency and test-retest reliability, as well as convergent/divergent validity with sleep, psychological, and socio-demographic variables. However, a clear definition of the factor model underlying the tools is recommended and reliable cut-off values should be indicated in order for clinicians to discriminate poor and good sleepers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031082", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3125378830", "source": "openalex"}

Here we used a unique opportunity to record intracranial depth EEG and single-unit activity in multiple brain regions of neurosurgical patients to better characterize spindle activity in human sleep. We find that spindles occur across multiple neocortical regions, and less frequently also in the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus. Most spindles are spatially restricted to specific brain regions. In addition, spindle frequency is topographically organized with a sharp transition around the supplementary motor area between fast (13–15 Hz) centroparietal spindles often occurring with slow-wave up-states, and slow (9–12 Hz) frontal spindles occurring 200 ms later on average. Spindle variability across regions may reflect the underlying thalamocortical projections. We also find that during individual spindles, frequency decreases within and between regions. In addition, deeper NREM sleep is associated with a reduction in spindle occurrence and spindle frequency. Frequency changes between regions, during individual spindles, and across sleep may reflect the same phenomenon, the underlying level of thalamocortical hyperpolarization. Finally, during spindles neuronal firing rates are not consistently modulated, although some neurons exhibit phase-locked discharges. Overall, anatomical considerations can account well for regional spindle characteristics, while variable hyperpolarization levels can explain differences in spindle frequency.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2604-11.2011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2004454719", "source": "openalex"}

In this work, we investigated the spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations during states of reduced consciousness such as drowsiness and sleep. For this purpose, we performed BOLD fMRI on normal subjects during varying levels of consciousness, from resting wakefulness to light (non‐slow wave) sleep. Depth of sleep was determined based on concurrently acquired EEG data. During light sleep, significant increases in the fluctuation level of the BOLD signal were observed in several cortical areas, among which visual cortex was the most significant. Correlations among brain regions involved with the default‐mode network persisted during light sleep. These results suggest that activity in areas such as the default‐mode network and primary sensory cortex, as measured from BOLD fMRI fluctuations, does not require a level of consciousness typical of wakefulness.

This stratified analysis of CANPAP tested the hypothesis that suppression of CSA below this threshold by CPAP would improve left ventricular ejection fraction and heart transplant-free survival.Of the 258 heart failure patients with CSA in CANPAP, 110 of the 130 randomized to the control group and 100 of the 128 randomized to CPAP had sleep studies 3 months later. CPAP patients were divided post hoc into those whose apnea-hypopnea index was or was not reduced below 15 at this time (CPAP-CSA suppressed, n=57, and CPAP-CSA unsuppressed, n=43, respectively). Their changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and heart transplant-free survival were compared with those in the control group. Despite similar CPAP pressure and hours of use in the 2 groups, CPAP-CSA-suppressed subjects experienced a greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at 3 months (P=0.001) and significantly better transplant-free survival (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.371 [0.142 to 0.967], P=0.043) than control subjects, whereas the CPAP-CSA-unsuppressed group did not (for left ventricular ejection fraction, P=0.984, and for transplant-free survival, hazard ratio 1.463 [95% confidence interval 0.751 to 2.850], P=0.260).These results suggest that in heart failure patients, CPAP might improve both left ventricular ejection fraction and heart transplant-free survival if CSA is suppressed soon after its initiation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.106.683482", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964315289", "source": "openalex"}

Nevertheless, the overall pathophysiologic mechanisms mediating end-organ injury in OSA remain undefined, particularly due to the very frequent coexistence of other disease states, such as obesity, that clearly complicate the potential cause-effect relationships. Two major, and to some extent overlapping, mechanisms have been proposed to explain the morbid consequences of OSA, namely increased generation and propagation of reactive oxygen species and initiation and amplification of inflammatory processes. The evidence supporting the validity of these concepts as well as that detracting from such mechanisms will be critically reviewed in the context of clinical and laboratory-based approaches. In addition, some of the contradictory issues raised by such evaluation of the literature will be interpreted in the context of putative modifications of the individual responses to OSA, as determined by genetic variants among susceptibility-related genes, and also by potential environmental modulators of the phenotypic expression of any particular end-organ morbidity associated with OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200608-1190pp", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1968071340", "source": "openalex"}

To address this issue, we investigated the effects of one night of total sleep deprivation on subjective stress and mood in response to low-stress and high-stress cognitive testing conditions in healthy adult volunteers in two separate experiments (total N = 53). Sleep was manipulated in a controlled, laboratory setting and stressor intensity was manipulated by changing difficulty of cognitive tasks, time pressure, and feedback about performance. Sleep-deprived participants reported greater subjective stress, anxiety, and anger than rested controls following exposure to the low-stressor condition, but not in response to the high-stressor condition, which elevated negative mood and stress about equally for both sleep conditions. These results suggest that sleep deprivation lowers the psychological threshold for the perception of stress from cognitive demands but does not selectively increase the magnitude of negative affect in response to high-stress performance demands.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026871", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167069827", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep SWA is thought to reflect sleep need, but the mechanisms of its homeostatic regulation remain unknown. Based on a recent hypothesis, we sought to determine whether a decrease in cortical synaptic strength can account for changes in sleep SWA.A large-scale computer model of the sleeping thalamocortical system was used to reproduce in detail the cortical slow oscillations underlying EEG slow waves.N/A.N/A.Simulated reductions in the strength of corticocortical synapses.Decreased synaptic strength led to (1) decreased single cell membrane potential oscillations and reduced network synchronization, (2) decreased rate of neural recruitment and decruitment, and (3) emergence of local clusters of synchronized activity. These changes were reflected in the local EEG as (1) decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, (2) decreased wave slope, and (3) increased number of multipeak waves. Spectral analysis confirmed that these changes were associated with a decrease in SWA.A decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for changes in sleep SWA and is accompanied by characteristic changes in slow-wave parameters. Experimental results from rat cortical depth recordings and human high-density EEG show similar changes in slow-wave parameters with decreasing SWA, suggesting that the underlying mechanism may indeed be a net decrease in synaptic strength.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/30.12.1617", "url": "https://openalex.org/W137630247", "source": "openalex"}

This technical report describes the procedures involved in developing the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in children. The group of primary interest for this report was otherwise healthy children older than 1 year who might have adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity as underlying risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The goals of the committee were to enhance the primary care clinician’s ability to recognize OSAS, identify the most appropriate procedure for diagnosis of OSAS, identify risks associated with pediatric OSAS, and evaluate management options for OSAS. Methods. A literature search was initially conducted for 2the years 1966–1999 and then updated to include 2000. The search was limited to English language literature concerning children older than 2 and younger than 18 years. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance, and committee members reviewed in detail any possibly appropriate articles to determine eligibility for inclusion. Additional articles were obtained by a review of literature and committee members’ files. Committee members compiled evidence tables and met to review and discuss the literature that was collected. Results. A total of 2115 titles were reviewed, of which 113 provided relevant original data for analysis. These articles were mainly case series and cross-sectional studies; overall, very few methodologically strong cohort studies or randomized, controlled trials concerning OSAS have been published. In addition, a minority of studies satisfactorily differentiated primary snoring from true OSAS. Reports of the prevalence of habitual snoring in children ranged from 3.2% to 12.1%, and estimates of OSAS ranged from 0.7% to 10.3%; these studies were too heterogeneous for data pooling. Children with sleep-disordered breathing are at increased risk for hyperactivity and learning problems. The combined odds ratio for neurobehavioral abnormalities in snoring children compared with controls is 2.93 (95% confidence interval: 2.23–3.83). A number of case series have documented decreased somatic growth in children with OSAS; right ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypertension also have been reported in children with OSAS. However, the risk growth and cardiovascular problems cannot be quantified from the published literature. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) is recognized as the gold standard for diagnosis of OSAS, and there are currently no satisfactory alternatives. The diagnostic accuracy of symptom questionnaires and other purely clinical approaches is low. Pulse oximetry appears to be specific but insensitive. Other methods, including audiotaping or videotaping and nap or home overnight PSG, remain investigational. Adenotonsillectomy is curative in 75% to 100% of children with OSAS, including those who are obese. Up to 27% of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for OSAS have postoperative respiratory complications, but estimates are varied. Risk factors for persistent OSAS after adenotonsillectomy include continued snoring and a high apnea-hypopnea index on the preoperative PSG. Conclusions. OSAS is common in children and is associated with significant sequelae. Overnight PSG is currently the only reliable diagnostic modality that can differentiate OSAS from primary snoring. However, the PSG criteria for OSAS have not been definitively validated, and it is not clear that primary snoring without PSG-defined OSAS is benign. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment for OSAS but requires careful postoperative monitoring because of the high risk of respiratory complications. Adenotonsillectomy is usually curative, but children with persistent snoring (and perhaps with severely abnormal preoperative PSG results) should have PSG repeated postoperatively.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.109.4.e69", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102772152", "source": "openalex"}

However, the mechanisms responsible for this important arousal response are uncertain. A unifying hypothesis is that arousal results from the increased respiratory effort that occurs as a result of ventilatory stimulation. If this is true, the magnitude of this effort during the breaths immediately preceding arousal from sleep should be similar regardless of the stimulus. Therefore, the negative inspiratory pleural pressure during the breaths preceding arousal would be similar, whether stimulated by added inspiratory resistive load, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. To test this hypothesis, we studied eight young, healthy men during full-night sleep studies. We measured their electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), inspired ventilation (VI), end tidal PCO2 (PetCO2), O2 saturation, and esophageal pressure (esophageal balloon) while inducing arousal from non-REM sleep using (1) a 30-cm H2O/L/s added resistive load, (2) progressive hypoxia, and (3) progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia. All subjects were eventually aroused following the addition of the 30-cm H2O/L/s added load and during progressive hypercapnia. However, only six of the eight men were aroused when the O2 saturation was reduced to a minimum of 70%. For each stimulus, arousal occurred at very different levels of ventilation and arterial chemistry (SaO2 and CO2). However, ventilatory effort for each subject was similar at the point of arousal regardless of the stimulus. The peak-negative esophageal pressure for the single inspiration preceding arousal (for the six subjects arousing with all three stimuli) was 16.8 ± 1.4 cm H2O for added resistive load, 15.0 ± 2.4 cm H2O for hypoxia, and 14.7 ± 2.1 cm H2O for hypercapnia. We conclude that increasing ventilatory effort may be the stimulus to arousal from sleep independent of the source of this rising drive to breathe.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/142.2.295", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066544084", "source": "openalex"}

Thirteen weight-stable control subjects matched for age, body mass index, gender (all men), and non-REM disordered breathing rate (DBR) also were studied before and after usual care intervention. During non-REM sleep, maximal inspiratory airflow was measured by varying the level of nasal pressure and Pcrit was determined by the level of nasal pressure below which maximal inspiratory airflow ceased. In the weight loss group, a significant decrease in DBR from 83.3 ± 31.0 to 32.5 ± 35.9 episodes/h and in Pcrit from 3.1 ± 4.2 to −2.4 ± 4.4 cm H2O (p < 0.00001) was demonstrated. Moreover, decreases in Pcrit were associated with nearly complete elimination of apnea in each patient whose Pcrit fell below −4 cm H2O. In contrast, no significant change in DBR and a minimal reduction in Pcrit from 5.2 ± 2.3 to 4.2 ± 1.8 cm H2O (p = 0.031) was observed in the \"usual care\" group.

NREM sleep cycles showed consistent curvilinear trends for all groups except that the trend in children was distinguished by a lengthy first NREM cycle. REM steep cycles showed quite similar curvilinear trends for the three normal age groups with the middle two cycles being longer than the first and fourth. In the CBS patients, REM sleep cycles did not show a significant trend across the night. Real‐time cycles (i.e., with time awake included) manifested trends quite similar to those excluding waking. The trends in sleep cycle durations are normative characteristics of sleep which may not be apparent on a single night. A more constant cycle was found in the CBS elderly and may indicate brain pathology.

Fifty-three subjects with Down syndrome (mean age 7.4 ± 1.2 [SE] years; range 2 weeks to 51 years) were studied. Chest wall movement, heart rate, electrooculogram, end-tidal Po2 and Pco2, transcutaneous Po2 and Pco2, and arterial oxygen saturation were measured during a daytime nap polysomnogram. Sixteen of these children also underwent overnight polysomnography. Nap polysomnograms were abnormal in 77% of children; 45% had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 4% had central apnea, and 6% had mixed apneas; 66% had hypoventilation (end-tidal Pco2, &amp;gt;45 mm Hg) and 32% desaturation (arterial oxygen saturation &amp;lt;90%). Overnight studies were abnormal in 100% of children, with OSA in 63%, hypoventilation in 81%, and desaturation in 56%. Nap studies significantly underestimated the presence of abnormalities when compared to overnight polysomnograms. Seventeen (32%) of the children were referred for testing because OSAS was clinically suspected, but there was no clinical suspicion of OSAS in 36 (68%) children. Neither age, obesity, nor the presence of congenital heart disease affected the incidence of OSA, desaturation, or hypoventilation. Polysomnograms improved in all 8 children who underwent tonsilletomy and adenoidectomy, but they normalized in only 3. It is concluded that children with Down syndrome frequently have OSAS, with OSA, hypoxemia, and hypoventilation. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is seen frequently in those children in whom it is not clinically suspected. It is speculated that OSAS may contribute to the unexplained pulmonary hypertension seen in children with Down syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.88.1.132", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4205987157", "source": "openalex"}

No longitudinal study to date has examined the association of this type of insomnia with incident hypertension using polysomnography. From a random, general population sample of 1741 adults of the Penn State Cohort, 1395 were followed-up after 7.5 years, and 786 did not have hypertension at baseline. Hypertension was determined by a self-report of receiving treatment for high blood pressure. Chronic insomnia was defined as a complaint of insomnia lasting ≥1 year, whereas poor sleep was defined as moderate-to-severe sleep difficulties. All of the subjects underwent 8-hour polysomnography. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) was defined as an obstructive apnea/hypopnea index ≥5. We used the median polysomnographic percentage of sleep time to define short sleep duration (ie, &lt;6 hours). We controlled for sex, race, age, caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol consumption, depression, sleep-disordered breathing, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and blood pressure in our analyses. Compared with normal sleepers who slept ≥6 hours, the highest risk for incident hypertension was in chronic insomniacs with short sleep duration (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.6–9.0]). The risk for incident hypertension in poor sleepers with short sleep duration was significantly increased but became marginally significant after controlling for obesity (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.9–2.8]). Chronic insomnia with short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk for incident hypertension in a degree comparable to sleep-disordered breathing. Objective short sleep duration in insomnia may serve as a useful predictor of the biological severity of the disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.112.193268", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141289928", "source": "openalex"}

Eight sleeps and eight naps were used for longitudinal simple and multiple regression analyses with standard polysomnographical sleep variables as predictors and subjective sleep quality as dependent variables. The results showed that subjective sleep quality (and related variables) was closely related to sleep efficiency, but not sleep stages. At least 87% efficiency was required for ratings of 'rather good' sleep. In addition, sleep quality ratings improved with closeness (of the awakening) to the circadian acrophase (17.00-21.00 hours) of the rectal temperature rhythm. The subjective ease of awakening differed from most other other variables in that it was related to low sleep efficiency. Objective and subjective homologues of sleep length and sleep latency showed high mean intraindividual correlations (r = 0.55 and 0.64, respectively).

We performed a systematic meta‐review of the top‐tier evidence examining how physical activity, sleep, dietary patterns and tobacco smoking impact on the risk and treatment outcomes across a range of mental disorders. Results from 29 meta‐analyses of prospective/cohort studies, 12 Mendelian randomization studies, two meta‐reviews, and two meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials were synthesized to generate overviews of the evidence for targeting each of the specific lifestyle factors in the prevention and treatment of depression, anxiety and stress‐related disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Standout findings include: a) convergent evidence indicating the use of physical activity in primary prevention and clinical treatment across a spectrum of mental disorders; b) emerging evidence implicating tobacco smoking as a causal factor in onset of both common and severe mental illness; c) the need to clearly establish causal relations between dietary patterns and risk of mental illness, and how diet should be best addressed within mental health care; and d) poor sleep as a risk factor for mental illness, although with further research required to understand the complex, bidirectional relations and the benefits of non‐pharmacological sleep‐focused interventions.

Inadequate sleep quantity and quality is a public health concern with an array of detrimental health outcomes. Portable mobile and media devices have become a ubiquitous part of children's lives and may affect their sleep duration and quality. <h3>Objective</h3> To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether there is an association between portable screen-based media device (eg, cell phones and tablet devices) access or use in the sleep environment and sleep outcomes. <h3>Data Sources</h3> A search strategy consisting of gray literature and 24 Medical Subject Headings was developed in Ovid MEDLINE and adapted for other databases between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. Searches of the published literature were conducted across 12 databases. No language restriction was applied. <h3>Study Selection</h3> The analysis included randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional study designs. Inclusion criteria were studies of school-age children between 6 and 19 years. Exclusion criteria were studies of stationary exposures, such as televisions or desktop or personal computers, or studies investigating electromagnetic radiation. <h3>Data Extraction and Synthesis</h3> Of 467 studies identified, 20 cross-sectional studies were assessed for methodological quality. Two reviewers independently extracted data. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcomes were inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness, studied according to an a priori protocol. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty studies were included, and their quality was assessed. The studies involved 125 198 children (mean [SD] age, 14.5 [2.2] years; 50.1% male). There was a strong and consistent association between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.42-3.32) (<i>P</i> &lt; .001,<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 90%), poor sleep quality (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88) (<i>P</i> = .003,<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 76%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.32-5.61) (<i>P</i> = .007,<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 50%).

Combining neck circumference with other signs and symptoms may allow the clinical diagnosis or exclusion of sleep apnoea to be made with reasonable confidence. This study examines these issues. METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients referred to a sleep clinic for investigation of sleep related breathing disorders completed a questionnaire covering daytime sleepiness, snoring, driving, and nasal disease. Body mass index and neck circumference corrected for height were measured and obstructive sleep apnoea severity was quantified as number of dips in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of more than 4% per hour of polysomnography. Multiple linear regression was used retrospectively to identify independent predictors of SaO2 dip rate, and the model derived was then prospectively tested in a further 85 subjects. RESULTS: The retrospective analysis showed that the question \"Do you fall asleep during the day, particularly when not busy?\" was the best questionnaire predictor of variance in the SaO2 dip rate (r2 = 0.13); no other question improved this correlation. This analysis also showed that neither body mass index nor any of the questionnaire variables improved the amount of variance explained by height corrected neck circumference alone (r2 = 0.35). A statistically similar prospective analysis confirmed this relationship (r2 = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Prospective study of these patients referred to a sleep clinic with symptoms suggesting sleep apnoea shows that neck circumference corrected for height is more useful as a predictor of obstructive sleep apnoea than general obesity. None of the questionnaire variables examined add to its predictive power, but alone it is inadequate to avoid the need for sleep studies to diagnose this disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.47.2.101", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981691121", "source": "openalex"}

The importance of sleep is underscored by its tight homeostatic control. Through a forward genetic screen, we identified a gene, sleepless, required for sleep in Drosophila. The sleepless gene encodes a brain-enriched, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Loss of SLEEPLESS protein caused an extreme (>80%) reduction in sleep; a moderate reduction in SLEEPLESS had minimal effects on baseline sleep but markedly reduced the amount of recovery sleep after sleep deprivation. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that quiver, a mutation that impairs Shaker-dependent potassium current, is an allele of sleepless. Consistent with this finding, Shaker protein levels were reduced in sleepless mutants. We propose that SLEEPLESS is a signaling molecule that connects sleep drive to lowered membrane excitability.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1155942", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990296960", "source": "openalex"}

Such problems can become chronic in some patients, persisting for many months or years after completion of cancer therapy. For patients with cancer, sleep is potentially affected by a variety of factors, including the biochemical changes associated with the process of neoplastic growth and anticancer treatments, and symptoms that frequently accompany cancer, such as pain, fatigue, and depression. Fatigue is highly prevalent and persistent in patients with cancer and cancer survivors. Although cancer-related fatigue and cancer-related sleep disorders are distinct, a strong interrelationship exists between these symptoms, and a strong possibility exists that they may be reciprocally related. The majority of studies that have assessed both sleep and fatigue in patients with cancer provide evidence supporting a strong correlation between cancer-related fatigue and various sleep parameters, including poor sleep quality, disrupted initiation and maintenance of sleep, nighttime awakening, restless sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. This paper reviews the data from these studies with a view toward suggesting further research that could advance our scientific understanding both of potential interrelationships between sleep disturbance and cancer-related fatigue and of clinical interventions to help with both fatigue and sleep disturbance.

There is now compelling evidence that the long-term storage of memories preferentially occurs during sleep. However, the factors mediating the selectivity of sleep-associated memory consolidation are poorly understood. Here, we show that the mere expectancy that a memory will be used in a future test determines whether or not sleep significantly benefits consolidation of this memory. Human subjects learned declarative memories (word paired associates) before retention periods of sleep or wakefulness. Postlearning sleep compared with wakefulness produced a strong improvement at delayed retrieval only if the subjects had been informed about the retrieval test after the learning period. If they had not been informed, retrieval after retention sleep did not differ from that after the wake retention interval. Retention during the wake intervals was not affected by retrieval expectancy. Retrieval expectancy also enhanced sleep-associated consolidation of visuospatial (two-dimensional object location task) and procedural motor memories (finger sequence tapping). Subjects expecting the retrieval displayed a robust increase in slow oscillation activity and sleep spindle count during postlearning slow-wave sleep (SWS). Sleep-associated consolidation of declarative memory was strongly correlated to slow oscillation activity and spindle count, but only if the subjects expected the retrieval test. In conclusion, our work shows that sleep preferentially benefits consolidation of memories that are relevant for future behavior, presumably through a SWS-dependent reprocessing of these memories.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3575-10.2011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992856299", "source": "openalex"}

The proposal to standardize recording techniques and scoring criteria was intended to increase the comparability of results reported by different investigators. Researchers who have applied the system correctly have increased the reliability of their sleep stage scoring. In the several decades since its publication, however, a number of serious areas of unreliability in the 1968 standard scoring system have been identified. In particular, researchers developing computer-based automatic sleep staging systems have encountered numerous vague and ambiguous areas in the current standard. At the 15th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Sleep Research (JSSR) in 1990, Terashima’s report from the Japanese Conference for Sleep Analysis emphasized the need to re-examine the definitions of sleep stages when developing computer staging systems based on the standard scoring system. The results of multiple comparisons among institutes and laboratories using methods for automated sleep staging based on the standard scoring system were unexpectedly poor. The lowest level of congruence between automation and records staged visually using the 1968 standard system was found for Stage 1 sleep, with the second worst agreement (still less than 70%) for sleep Stages 3 and 4. To increase both the within- and between-researcher agreement in sleep stage identification and to foster the development of computer algorithms for automatic analyses of sleep, a need for additional definitions was recognized. In 1991, the Subcommittee for Automatic Sleep Staging (SASS) was formed by the JSSR. The Subcommittee comprised 53 investigators and seven project leaders selected for their skill in scoring sleep records: S. Sugita (Chair), M. Okawa (co-Chair), T. Kobayashi, T. Hori, A. Miyasita, S. Shirakawa and Y. Atsumi. In 1995, based on their 5 year discussions, the Subcommittee proposed supplementary definitions and amendments for the Standard Scoring System to the JSSR. These proposals were reported in the JSSR Newsletter (1996; No. 13, February 1, pages 5–13). In 1997, at its 22nd Annual Meeting, the JSSR restructured the SASS to form the Sleep Computing Committee (SCC). The SCC working group has now formalized Supplements and Amendments to the Standard Scoring System based upon the 1995 SASS proposals. The Committee has met several times for discussion and to test their new definitions using carefully selected representative polysomnographic recordings. The final JSSR Sleep Computing Committee proposals have been published in Japanese as the ‘Learning Manual of PSG Chart: Polysomnogram, Sleep Stage Scoring, Interpretation’. The Committee has now prepared the English language version of their proposals for evaluation and empirical testing by sleep researchers all over the world. The JSSR’s proposals to supplement and amend the currently used criteria for sleep staging (A Manual of Standardized Terminology, Techniques and Scoring System for Sleep Stages of Human Subjects, Rechtschaffen A, Kales A (eds). BIS/BRI University of California, Los Angeles, 1968; hereafter, the ‘standard criteria (SC)’) are detailed below. When research purposes are not met by the SC, different movement time criteria may be used. However, in such cases, the modified criteria should be clearly stated and the degrees of modification should not exceed those in the following examples. MT is judged following the SC, with the addition of scoring parts of the recording with higher muscle tones and degrees of artifact as ‘gross movement’ or ‘movement with duration more than 50% of an epoch’, and the number of such segments is reported. Even when an epoch fulfils the SC definition of MT, the epoch may still be scored as a stage of sleep using additional criteria (below). In this case, an SC-defined epoch of MT can simultaneously be defined as an epoch of sleep and a body movement epoch. Examples of criteria: (i) MT epoch is scored as the same stage as the preceding epoch and (ii) MT epoch is scored as the same stage as the following epoch. The following supplementary definitions are used for scoring a transition from stage wake to Stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 is not necessarily defined as a sleep onset (sleep onset is defined below). Alpha waves are electroencephalographic waves with a frequency of 8 Hz or more but less than 13 Hz. A vertex sharp wave is a sharp waveform distinguished from background activities at or near Cz (C3, C4), with an amplitude of 75 μV or greater, and with a frequency of at least 5 Hz but no more than 14 Hz. Slow eye movements (SEM) can be difficult to detect in recordings that were not made using long time constants. The following definitions are considered to apply for recordings made under recommended conditions. Slow eye movements waveforms do not manifest saccade-like sharp, abrupt, movements. Rather, SEM are smooth sinusoidal eye movements with amplitudes of 100 μV or more, and 10 s or less in duration. Time constant: Longer time constants of 1.5 s or more are recommended to minimize deformations of SEM signals and to enhance the detection of SEM. Amplification: Amplification of 200 μV/5 mm is recommended. This amplification allows observation of subtle eye movements without appreciably increasing the likelihood of signals saturating the amplifier. Derivation: Monopolar recordings from both outer canthi are recommended to distinguish eye movements from contamination such as superimposition of electroencephalographic (EEG)waveforms. For subjects whose central EEG alpha waves during resting wakefulness occupy less than 50% of the analysis epoch when the eyes are closed, one of the following criteria should be used to judge Stage 1 sleep. When using these exception criteria, the resting wake EEG should be recorded both before bedtime and after awakening from all-night sleep recording along with observations to confirm that subjects are behaviorally awake. In subjects whose occipital EEG alpha activity occupy more than 50% of the analysis epoch during wakefulness with eyes closed, SC should be applied. Electroencephalogram of various frequencies but less than 8 Hz and 20 μV or more in amplitude, which is considered as EEG, suggesting lower vigilance level comparing resting wake with eyes closed condition, occupies more than 50%. In the absence of true alpha band activity, alpha-like activity in EEG frequencies below 8 Hz may be used to suggest lower vigilance levels when it is of 20 μV or greater amplitude, increases during resting wakefulness with the eyes closed, and occupies 50% or more of an epoch. When the preceding criteria (2) are applied, confirmation of SEM activity is also recommended. The following supplementary definitions of the K-complex should be considered. The K-complex waveform begins with the abrupt onset of a negative sharp wave, which is immediately followed by a high amplitude positive slow wave. Polyphasic (notched) negative-positive waves are sometimes observed just before the onset of the negative K-complex sharp wave. The duration of a K-complex must be longer than 0.5 s. Its peak-to-peak amplitude must be greater than 200 μV. Waveforms must be visually distinct from background EEG activities; and a waveform should not be identified as a K-complex if it occurs within 5 s preceding or following high voltage delta waves (defined below). The K-complex waveform may or may not be accompanied by sleep spindle activity (defined below). Termination of a K-complex is identified by the peak of a trailing negative wave, which follows the major positive component, neglecting other overlapping waves (Fig. 1). Sleep spindles are defined as trains of 12–16 Hz waves of 10 μV or greater amplitude, composed of at least six consecutive waves, or a train duration longer than 0.5 s. The appearance of the waveform train is not specified in the definition (i.e. a ‘spindle’ shape is not a requirement for identification as a sleep spindle). Although the mean frequency of a single train of waves can be used as a single descriptor for identified sleep spindles, its use must be clearly reported. Similarly, if a different amplitude threshold is used to identify sleep spindle activity, the threshold value must be clearly reported. Onset and termination of K-complex Sleep onset may be defined as necessary for research purposes, but should include the first epoch scored as one of the standard sleep Stages (1, 2, 3, 4, or REM) after the lights are darkened or a subject goes to bed. Researchers must report their definition of sleep onset. Researchers are expected to specify the sleep stage criteria used for the judgement of sleep onset, including all criteria for the duration of sleep stage(s), its (their) duration, and the time course of sleep etc. as in the following examples. In this example, the first epoch judged as one of the sleep stages is defined to be sleep onset. However, if the first stage is Stage 1, the epoch can be judged as sleep onset only if it is followed by consecutive epochs of sleep stages 2, 3, 4 or REM. In this example, the first epoch judged as one of the sleep stages is defined to be sleep onset. However, if the first stage is Stage 1, the epoch is judged as sleep onset on the condition that Stage 1 or the other stages continue for a specific length of time (e.g. 3 or 5 min). In this example, the first epoch judged as sleep Stages 2, 3, 4, or REM is defined to be sleep onset. (A definition to attach importance on the appearance of Stage 2.) In this example, the first epoch judged as sleep Stages 2, 3, 4, or REM is defined to be sleep onset. However, the epoch is judged as sleep onset on the condition that sleep Stages 2, 3, 4 or REM, follows for a specific duration (e.g. 3 or 5 min). The expressions of ‘Stage 1’ or ‘Stage 2’ in the example definitions can be modified to use ‘vertex sharp wave’ or ‘sleep spindle’ criteria as desired. If slow waves with frequencies below 2 Hz and with amplitudes greater 75 μV occupy between 20 and 50% of an epoch, that epoch is judged as Stage 3 sleep. If the slow waves occupy more than 50% of an epoch, that epoch is judged as Stage 4 sleep. However, because these definitions do not contain any descriptions of complex composite waveforms, it can often be difficult to judge Stages 3 and 4 under the SC. We add the following supplements to the definition of high amplitude slow waves given above. (i) When the combined period of two contiguous EEG waveforms is 0.5 s or longer (i.e. the frequency of the composite wave is 2 Hz or lower), that wave complex can be scored as one slow wave if the amplitudes of the two waves satisfy the requirement B ≥ A/2 (Fig. 2). (ii) When fast waves appear superimposed on a slow wave, the amplitude of the slow wave is still measured from peak-to-peak, including the superimposed waves. (iii) The onset of an individual slow wave must follow a trough satisfying the requirement B ≤ A/2 (Fig. 3). When bursts of slow wave activity precede or accompany an arousal response or high amplitude EMG (e.g. body movements), those bursts should not be considered slow waves for EEG stage scoring, but as one form of the arousal response. Such portions of a record should be considered part of the preceding or following epoch when stage scoring. Furthermore, the terms ‘movement arousal’ or ‘EEG arousal’ are recommended over the general term ‘arousal response’, following the definition of American Sleep Disorders Association (EEG arousal: scoring rules and examples. Sleep 1992; 15: 173–184). The same time constant, gain, electrode placements and montage can be used to record both SEM and REM. The REM waveform must appear as a saccadic movement, with rapid changes in angular velocity at the onset and termination of eye movement. Since small eye movements often appear during the transitions to and from REM sleep, a low amplitude criterion of 40 μV or greater (1 mm pen deflection under above-mentioned recording condition) is recommended. In recordings at 15 mm/s (or the equivalent digital display), REM activity should be identifiable as a 45° or greater angular departure from the baseline. Researchers should specifically report any modifications to the above-mentioned criteria. A twitch is defined as a skin-recorded EMG discharge with duration shorter than 0.5 s, or the EMG discharge accompanying the contraction of a single muscle unit. The term ‘these transient changes may be disregarded’ in the standard manual (p. 8) is ambiguous. Therefore, the muscle activities satisfying the above-mentioned definition of twitch may be disregarded, while a transient increase in tonic EMG not satisfying the definition may be regarded as a sign of movement arousal. Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968) discussed the difficulty of identifying the onset of REM sleep: A special case frequently arises where a movement arousal interrupts the continuity of stage REM, the mental-submental EMG quickly reverts to the stage REM level following the movement arousal, the EEG remains relatively low voltage, mixed frequency, and there is a resumption of REMs or change to stage 2 one or more epochs following the movement arousal. The problem is whether to score the interval following the movement arousal and the resumption of REMs or change to stage 2 as stage 1 or stage REM. (p.10, Part C). The general guidelines for distinguishing between Stage 1 and stage REM support little more than scorer judgement. The following partially modified guidelines have been arranged to aid the discrimination of Stage 1 from REM sleep. The following cases justify scoring as stage 1: (i) epochs follow long or intense movement arousals; (ii) epochs contain slow eye movements; (iii) epochs contain persisting alpha activity following a movement arousal; (iv) epochs contain well-formed vertex spikes; (v) epochs contain waveforms similar to, but not fulfilling the definitions of sleep spindles or K-complexes. Such cases may be considered as supporting evidence that the interval between the movement arousal and unambiguous Stage 2 or REM has been Stage 1. The following case justifies scoring as stage REM: (i) epochs contain well-formed saw-tooth waves. The following definitions of sleep parameters frequently used in sleep science and sleep medicine are listed for reference. Total recording time (TRT): The duration of time from the start to the end of a recording. Time in bed (TIB): The duration of time from ‘lights out’ to final awakening. Total sleep time (TST): The amount of actual sleep time in a recording. Sleep efficiency (SE): The ratio of total sleep time to time in bed (i.e. (TST ÷ TIB) × 100). Sleep period time (SPT): The duration of time from sleep onset to final awakening. Time spent in each of the sleep stages based on total recording time (TRT). TS1: Time spent in Stage 1. TS2: Time spent in Stage 2. TS3: Time spent in Stage 3. TS4: Time spent in Stage 4. TSR: Time spent in stage REM. Percentage of the sleep stages. (i) Percentage of the sleep stages based on sleep period time (SPT). %SW: Percentage of stage W. %S1: Percentage of Stage 1. %S2: Percentage of Stage 2. %S3: Percentage of Stage 3. %S4: Percentage of Stage 4. %SR: Percentage of stage REM. (ii) Percentage of the sleep stages based on total sleep time (TST). %S1: Percentage of Stage 1. %S2: Percentage of Stage 2. %S3: Percentage of Stage 3. %S4: Percentage of Stage 4. %SR: Percentage of stage REM. Wake time after sleep onset (WASO), intermittent awakening: The total time spent awake during sleep period time (SPT). Number of arousals: The number of arousals occurring in sleep period time (SPT). Number of stage shifts: The number of occasions of sleep stages shifting from one to another. Sleep latency: The duration of time from ‘lights out’, or bedtime, to the onset of sleep. REM sleep latency: The interval from sleep onset to the first appearance of stage REM sleep in a recording. REM activity: REM activity is identified as one or more REM in a unit of time and often expressed as the total number of such units. REM density: REM density is a function that expresses the frequency of eye movements per unit of time during stage REM. Number of REM episodes: The number of REM episodes that appear during sleep period time. If REM sleep continues with interruptions by wake or other sleep stages, such REM episodes are considered as a single REM episode when the interruption is less than 15 min. Sleep cycle: The first sleep cycle is the period from sleep onset to the end of the first REM sleep episode. Later sleep cycles are defined as the periods from the end of a REM sleep episode to the end of the subsequent REM sleep episode. REM sleep interval: The REM sleep interval is the interval between the end of a REM sleep episode and the beginning of the subsequent REM sleep episode. Time awake is generally excepted from the interval.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1819.2001.00810.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1970593689", "source": "openalex"}

We studied 32 patients with OSA during sleep while their upper airway was stabilized with continuous positive airway pressure. Twelve patients had repetitive OSA whenever they were asleep, regardless of body position or sleep stage, and were classified as having severe OSA (apnea–hypopnea index [AHI] = 88 ± 19). The remaining 20 patients had sporadic OSA or repetitive OSA for only part of the time (mild/moderate OSA; AHI = 27 ± 16). Susceptibility to periodic breathing (PB) was assessed by gradually increasing controller gain, using proportional assist ventilation. The increase in loop gain (LG) at each assist level was quantified from the ratio of assisted tidal volume (Vt) to the Vt obtained during single-breath reloading tests (Vt amplification factor [VtAF]). Nine of 12 patients with severe OSA developed PB, with recurrent central apneas, whereas only six of 20 patients in the mild/moderate group developed PB (p < 0.02). This difference was observed despite the subjection of the mild/moderate group to greater amplification of LG; the highest values of VtAF in the mild/moderate and severe groups were 2.7 ± 1.0 and 1.9 ± 0.7, respectively (p < 0.01). We conclude that the chemical control system is more unstable in patients with severe OSA than in patients with milder OSA.

However, these studies have focused on middle-aged people, excluding the elderly population from analysis. To investigate whether sleep apnea represents an independent risk factor in this population, we performed a prospective longitudinal study in a population-based cohort of subjects from 70 to 100 years old. Methods— Within the context of the Vitoria Sleep Project, a population-based study designed to investigate the prevalence of sleep apnea in the population of Vitoria, Spain, we performed a 6-year longitudinal study in a subsample cohort of 394 noninstitutionalized, initially event-free subjects (70 to 100 years old, median 77.28 years, 57.1% males). Demographic and polysomnographic data and known confounding factors (age, sex, smoking and alcohol consumption status, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol levels, and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension) were assessed at baseline. Hazard ratio for developing an ischemic stroke in relation to the apnea-hypopnea index at baseline was calculated. Results— Over the 6-year follow-up period, 20 ischemic strokes were registered. After adjustment for confounding factors, subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (defined as apnea-hypopnea index ≥30) at baseline had an increased risk of developing a stroke (hazard ratio=2.52, 95% CI=1.04 to 6.01, P =0.04).

The study was preceded by an extended period of habituation to laboratory conditions, and sleep was polygraphically recorded. Mean cortisol levels in the elderly were normal, but the amplitude of the circadian rhythm was reduced. Circulating levels of daytime and nighttime levels of both TSH and GH were greatly diminished in old age. In contrast, prolactin and melatonin concentrations were decreased during the nighttime only. The circadian rises of cortisol, TSH, and melatonin occurred 1-1.5 h earlier in elderly subjects, and the distribution of rapid-eye-movement stages during sleep was similarly advanced, suggesting that circadian timekeeping is modified during normal senescence. Despite perturbations of sleep, sleep-related release of GH and prolactin occurred in all elderly men. Age-related decreases in hormonal levels were associated with a decrease in the amplitude, but not the frequency, of secretory pulses. These findings demonstrate that the normal process of aging involves alterations in the central mechanisms controlling the temporal organization of endocrine release in addition to a reduction of secretory outputs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.1991.260.4.e651", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1776470977", "source": "openalex"}

We examined whether a comparable grouping of spindle and fast activity coinciding with slow oscillations can be found in human SWS. For negative and positive half-waves of slow oscillations (dominant frequency, 0.7–0.8 Hz) identified during SWS in humans (<i>n</i> = 13), wave-triggered averages of root mean square (rms) activity in the theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), spindle (12–15 Hz), and beta (15–25 Hz) range were formed. Slow positive half-waves were linked to a pronounced and widespread increase in rms spindle activity, averaging 0.63 ± 0.065 μV (23.4%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, with reference to baseline) at the midline central electrode (Cz). In contrast, spindle activity was suppressed during slow negative half-waves, on average by −0.65 ± 0.06 μV at Cz (−22%;<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in spindle activity 400–500 msec after negative half-waves was more than twofold the increase during slow positive half-waves (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.001). A similar although less pronounced dynamic was observed for beta activity, but not for alpha and theta frequencies. Discrete spindles identified during stages 2 and 3 of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep coincided with a discrete slow positive half-wave-like potential preceded by a pronounced negative half-wave (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). These results provide the first evidence in humans of grouping of spindle and beta activity during slow oscillations. They support the concept that phases of cortical depolarization during slow oscillations, reflected by surface-positive (depth-negative) field potentials, drive the thalamocortical spindle activity. The drive is particularly strong during cortical depolarization, expressed as surface-positive field potentials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.22-24-10941.2002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1767160910", "source": "openalex"}

The questionnaires were completed by the parents of 1000 unscreened elementary school children attending the third, fourth, and fifth grades. The schools were randomly selected from an urban area. Of the 1000 questionnaires, 972 were completed and could be used for statistical analysis. Among the parents, 24% reported sleeping poorly and 12% regularly relied on sedatives to induce sleep. Sleep difficulties lasting more than 6 months were present in 43% of the children. In 14% (132 of 972), sleep latency was longer than 30 minutes, and more than one complete arousal occurred during the night at least two nights per week. The following variables were seen among the poor sleepers: lower parental educational and professional status, parents who were more likely to be divorced or separated, and more noise or light in the rooms where they slept. They also presented a higher incidence of somnambulism, somniloquia, and night fears (nightmares and night terrors) than the children who slept well. Boys who slept poorly were significantly more likely to have insomniac fathers (P &amp;lt; .010). Regular use of sedatives was described in 4% (5 of 132) of the children who slept poorly.

The authors collected demographic and medication data, and the patients completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), questions assessing the presence of restless legs syndrome (RLS), a modified National Sleep Foundation sleep survey, and specific questions regarding falling asleep while driving.A total of 320 patients completed the questionnaire. The authors eliminated 17, six for incomplete data and 11 for having a primary diagnosis other than PD. The mean age of the remaining 303 patients was 67.1 +/- 10.7 years, and the mean duration of PD was 9.1 +/- 5.7 years. The ESS scores averaged 11.1 +/- 5.9, and in 50.2% of patients the score was abnormally high (>10). Stepwise regression analysis found that sleepiness correlated with longer duration of PD (p < 0.001), more advanced PD (p < 0.004), male sex (p < 0.001), and the use of any DA (p < 0.003). The soporific effects of the three most common DA (pramipexole, ropinirole, and pergolide) were similar. Falling asleep while driving was reported by 63/279 (22.6%) of current drivers and correlated with higher ESS scores (p < 0.05).

Recent studies suggest that they are frequent and have an impact on stroke outcome. <b>Methods:</b> We review current knowledge about frequency, clinical presentation, and consequences of poststroke SDB and SWD, and discuss treatment options. <b>Results:</b> SDB, presenting with obstructive, central, or mixed apneas, is present in 50%–70% of stroke patients. We recommend screening for SDB in all stroke patients by respirography. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for obstructive SDB, which reverses the vascular risk of the patients. In the absence of controlled trials, CPAP treatment should be reserved for patients with severe obstructive SDB, daytime symptoms (e.g., sleepiness), or high cardiovascular risk profile. Oxygen and adaptive servoventilation may be used for central SDB. SWD including insomnia, disturbances of wakefulness (hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue), sleep-related movement disorders (restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movements during sleep), and parasomnias (REM sleep behavior disorder) are found in 10%–50% of patients. SWD are associated with cognitive disturbances and may compromise neurologic recovery. Hypnotics and sedative antidepressants may aggravate SDB and neurologic recovery and should be used with caution.

To date, studies have not examined which aspect of sleep modulates amyloid-β or other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. Seventeen healthy adults (age 35–65 years) without sleep disorders underwent 5–14 days of actigraphy, followed by slow wave activity disruption during polysomnogram, and cerebrospinal fluid collection the following morning for measurement of amyloid-β, tau, total protein, YKL-40, and hypocretin. Data were compared to an identical protocol, with a sham condition during polysomnogram. Specific disruption of slow wave activity correlated with an increase in amyloid-β40 (r = 0.610, P = 0.009). This effect was specific for slow wave activity, and not for sleep duration or efficiency. This effect was also specific to amyloid-β, and not total protein, tau, YKL-40, or hypocretin. Additionally, worse home sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency by actigraphy in the six nights preceding lumbar punctures, was associated with higher tau (r = 0.543, P = 0.045). Slow wave activity disruption increases amyloid-β levels acutely, and poorer sleep quality over several days increases tau. These effects are specific to neuronally-derived proteins, which suggests they are likely driven by changes in neuronal activity during disrupted sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awx148", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2735226312", "source": "openalex"}

However, there is increasing evidence that autonomic mechanisms are implicated. A number of studies have consistently shown that patients with OSA have high levels of sympathetic nerve traffic. During sleep, repetitive episodes of hypoxia, hypercapnia and obstructive apnoea act through chemoreceptor reflexes and other mechanisms to increase sympathetic drive. Remarkably, the high sympathetic drive is present even during daytime wakefulness when subjects are breathing normally and no evidence of hypoxia or chemoreflex activation is apparent. Several neural and humoral mechanisms may contribute to maintenance of higher sympathetic activity and blood pressure. These mechanisms include chemoreflex and baroreflex dysfunction, altered cardiovascular variability, vasoconstrictor effects of nocturnal endothelin release and endothelial dysfunction. Long‐term continuous positive airway pressure treatment decreases muscle sympathetic nerve activity in OSA patients. The vast majority of OSA patients remain undiagnosed. Unrecognized OSA may contribute, in part, to the metabolic and cardiovascular derangements that are thought to be linked to obesity, and to the association between obesity and cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, acting through sympathetic neural mechanisms, OSA may contribute to or augment elevated levels of blood pressure in a large proportion of the hypertensive patient population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-201x.2003.01091.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038349359", "source": "openalex"}

There are numerous evidence that BDNF expression is decreased by experiencing psychological stress and that, accordingly, a lack of neurotrophic support causes major depression. Furthermore, disruption in sleep homeostatic processes results in higher stress vulnerability and is often associated with stress-related mental disorders. Recently, we reported, for the first time, a relationship between BDNF and insomnia and sleep deprivation (SD). Using a biphasic stress model as explanation approach, we discuss here the hypothesis that chronic stress might induce a deregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. In the long-term it leads to sleep disturbance and depression as well as decreased BDNF levels, whereas acute stress like SD can be used as therapeutic intervention in some insomniac or depressed patients as compensatory process to normalize BDNF levels. Indeed, partial SD (PSD) induced a fast increase in BDNF serum levels within hours after PSD which is similar to effects seen after ketamine infusion, another fast-acting antidepressant intervention, while traditional antidepressants are characterized by a major delay until treatment response as well as delayed BDNF level increase.Key messagesBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders.The interplay of stress and sleep impacts on BDNF level.Partial sleep deprivation (PSD) shows a fast action on BDNF level increase.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/07853890.2015.1131327", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2253188864", "source": "openalex"}

Although hypopneas constitute a majority of disordered breathing events, significant controversy remains about the best criteria used to define these events.The current investigation sought to assess the most appropriate definition for hypopneas that would be best correlated with cardiovascular disease.A community sample of middle-aged and older adults was recruited as part of the Sleep Heart Health Study. Full-montage polysomnography was conducted and hypopneas were defined using different thresholds of oxyhemoglobin desaturation with and without arousals. Prevalent cardiovascular disease was assessed based on self-report. Logistic regression analysis was used to characterize the independent association between the hypopnea index and prevalent cardiovascular disease.Using a sample of 6,106 adults with complete data on cardiovascular disease status and polysomnography, the current study found that hypopneas associated with an oxyhemoglobin desaturation of 4% or more were associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of confounding covariates. The adjusted prevalent odds ratios for quartiles of the hypopnea index using a 4% desaturation criterion were as follows: 1.00 (<1.10 events/h), 1.10 (1.01-3.20 events/h), 1.33 (3.21-7.69 events/h), and 1.41 (>7.69 events/h). Hypopnea measures based on less than 4% oxyhemoglobin desaturation or presence of arousals showed no association with cardiovascular disease.Hypopneas comprise a significant component of sleep-disordered breathing in the general community. By varying the criteria for defining hypopneas, this study demonstrates that hypopneas with a desaturation of at least 4% are independently associated with cardiovascular disease. In contrast, no association was observed between cardiovascular disease and hypopneas associated with milder desaturations or arousals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200712-1884oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107022994", "source": "openalex"}

Currently, PAP devices come in three forms: (1) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), (2) bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP), and (3) automatic self-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP). After a patient is diagnosed with OSA, the current standard of practice involves performing full, attended polysomnography during which positive pressure is adjusted to determine optimal pressure for maintaining airway patency. This titration is used to find a fixed single pressure for subsequent nightly usage. A task force of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reviewed the available literature. Based on this review, the Standards of Practice Committee developed these practice parameters as a guideline for using CPAP and BPAP appropriately (an earlier review and practice parameters for APAP was published in 2002). Major conclusions and current recommendations are as follows: 1) A diagnosis of OSA must be established by an acceptable method. 2) CPAP is effective for treating OSA. 3) Full-night, attended studies performed in the laboratory are the preferred approach for titration to determine optimal pressure; however, split-night, diagnostic-titration studies are usually adequate. 4) CPAP usage should be monitored objectively to help assure utilization. 5) Initial CPAP follow-up is recommended during the first few weeks to establish utilization pattern and provide remediation if needed. 6) Longer-term follow-up is recommended yearly or as needed to address mask, machine, or usage problems. 7) Heated humidification and a systematic educational program are recommended to improve CPAP utilization. 8) Some functional outcomes such as subjective sleepiness improve with positive pressure treatment in patients with OSA. 9) CPAP and BPAP therapy are safe; side effects and adverse events are mainly minor and reversible. 10) BPAP may be useful in treating some forms of restrictive lung disease or hypoventilation syndromes associated with hypercapnia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/29.3.375", "url": "https://openalex.org/W44398835", "source": "openalex"}

The boom in wearable technology is part of the digital health revolution and is producing many novel, highly sophisticated and relatively inexpensive consumer devices collecting data from multiple sensors and claiming to extract information about users' behaviors, including sleep. These devices are now able to capture different biosignals for determining, for example, HR and its variability, skin conductance, and temperature, in addition to activity. They perform 24/7, generating overwhelmingly large data sets (big data), with the potential of offering an unprecedented window on users' health. Unfortunately, little guidance exists within and outside the scientific sleep community for their use, leading to confusion and controversy about their validity and application. The current state-of-the-art review aims to highlight use, validation and utility of consumer wearable sleep-trackers in clinical practice and research. Guidelines for a standardized assessment of device performance is deemed necessary, and several critical factors (proprietary algorithms, device malfunction, firmware updates) need to be considered before using these devices in clinical and sleep research protocols.

We also conducted exploratory analyses aimed at examining potential moderating variables (age, sex, and comorbid depression and substance use disorders). Overall, studies with a greater proportion of male participants or a low rate of comorbid depression tended to find more PTSD‐related sleep disturbances.

Pharyngeal patency was determined by using fiber-optic nasopharyngoscopy during spontaneous central sleep apnea (n = 4) and induced hypocapnic central apnea via nasal mechanical ventilation (n = 10). Complete pharyngeal occlusion occurred in 146 of 160 spontaneously occurring central apneas in patients with central sleep apnea syndrome. During induced hypocapnic central apnea, gradual progressive pharyngeal narrowing occurred. More pronounced narrowing was noted at the velopharynx relative to the oropharynx and in subjects with SAH relative to normals. Complete pharyngeal occlusion frequently occurred in subjects with SAH (31 of 44 apneas) but rarely occurred in normals (3 of 25 apneas). Resumption of inspiratory effort was associated with persistent narrowing or complete occlusion unless electroencephalogram signs of arousal were noted. Thus pharyngeal cross-sectional area is reduced during central apnea in the absence of inspiratory effort. Velopharyngeal narrowing consistently occurs during induced hypocapnic central apnea even in normal subjects. Complete pharyngeal occlusion occurs during spontaneous or induced central apnea in patients with SAH. We conclude that subatmospheric intraluminal pressure is not required for pharyngeal occlusion to occur.

While many review articles have attempted to summarize the evidence for this association, it remains difficult to determine which domains of cognition are affected by OSA. This is because of marked differences in the nature of these reviews (e.g. many are unsystematic) and the many different tasks and domains assessed. This paper addresses this issue by comparing the results of only systematic reviews or meta‐analyses assessing the effects of OSA on cognition, the relationship between OSA severity and cognition, and/or the effects of treatment on cognition in OSA. Electronic databases and hand‐searching were undertaken to select reviews that reported on these areas. We found 33 reviews; five reviews met predetermined, stringent selection criteria. The majority of reviews supported deficits in attention/vigilance, delayed long‐term visual and verbal memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and executive function in individuals with OSA. There is also general agreement that language ability and psychomotor function are unaffected by OSA. Data are equivocal for the effects of OSA on working memory, short‐term memory and global cognitive functioning. Attention/vigilance dysfunction appears to be associated with sleep fragmentation and global cognitive function with hypoxaemia. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment of OSA appears to improve executive dysfunction, delayed long‐term verbal and visual memory, attention/vigilance and global cognitive functioning.

Primary outcomes examined were improvement in sleep latency, sleep quality and total sleep time. Meta-regression was performed to examine the influence of dose and duration of melatonin on reported efficacy. Participants Adults and children diagnosed with primary sleep disorders. Interventions Melatonin compared to placebo. Results Nineteen studies involving 1683 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Melatonin demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing sleep latency (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 7.06 minutes [95% CI 4.37 to 9.75], Z = 5.15, p<0.001) and increasing total sleep time (WMD = 8.25 minutes [95% CI 1.74 to 14.75], Z = 2.48, p = 0.013). Trials with longer duration and using higher doses of melatonin demonstrated greater effects on decreasing sleep latency and increasing total sleep time. Overall sleep quality was significantly improved in subjects taking melatonin (standardized mean difference = 0.22 [95% CI: 0.12 to 0.32], Z = 4.52, p<0.001) compared to placebo.

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. SETTING: The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) is a multicenter study designed to determine the cardiovascular consequences and the natural history of sleep disordered breathing. PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand four hundred seven community‐dwelling adults who participated in the SHHS (mean age 63, range 45–99; 52% women). MEASUREMENTS: Unattended home polysomnography (PSG) and sleep questionnaires. RESULTS: Older age was associated with shorter sleep time, diminished sleep efficiency, and more arousals in men and women. In men, age was independently associated with more Stage 1 and Stage 2 sleep and less slow‐wave (Stage 3 to 4) and rapid eye movement sleep. In women, older age was less strongly associated according to linear trend with sleep stage. Conversely, poor subjective sleep quality was not associated with older age in men, but older women had more trouble falling asleep, and there was a trend toward older women having more problems with waking up during the night and waking up too early. Associations between self‐report and directly measured sleep time and sleep latency were low to moderate across age groups (correlation coefficient=0.06–0.32). CONCLUSION: Older age was more strongly associated with poorer sleep according to PSG in men than women, yet the subjective report of poor sleep with older age was stronger in women. The higher prevalence of chronic health conditions, including sleep apnea, in older adults did not explain changes of sleep parameters with aging and age–sex differences in these relationships.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01755.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2111909270", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep regulation plays an intrinsic part in many behavioral and physiological functions. Currently, all researchers agree there is no single physiological role sleep serves. Nevertheless, it is quite evident that sleep is essential for many vital functions including development, energy conservation, brain waste clearance, modulation of immune responses, cognition, performance, vigilance, disease, and psychological state. This review details the physiological processes involved in sleep regulation and the possible functions that sleep may serve.

Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS:Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS:During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923921", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3012363620", "source": "openalex"}

Local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunits were recorded simultaneously in the cerebral cortex (areas 5-7) of naturally sleeping and awake cats. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) was characterized by oscillations in the slow (<1 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) frequency range. The high-amplitude slow-wave complexes consisted in a positivity of depth LFP, associated with neuronal silence, followed by a sharp LFP negativity, correlated with an increase of firing. This pattern was of remarkable spatiotemporal coherence, because silences and increased firing occurred simultaneously in units recorded within a 7 mm distance in the cortex. During wake and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, single units fired tonically, whereas LFPs displayed low-amplitude fast activities with increased power in fast frequencies (15-75 Hz). In contrast with the widespread synchronization during SWS, fast oscillations during REM and wake periods were synchronized only within neighboring electrodes and small time windows (100-500 msec). This local synchrony occurred in an apparent irregular manner, both spatially and temporally. Brief periods (<1 sec) of fast oscillations were also present during SWS in between slow-wave complexes. During these brief periods, the spatial and temporal coherence, as well as the relation between units and LFPs, was identical to that of fast oscillations of wake or REM sleep. These results show that natural SWS in cats is characterized by slow-wave complexes, synchronized over large cortical territories, interleaved with brief periods of fast oscillations, characterized by local synchrony, and of characteristics similar to that of the sustained fast oscillations of activated states.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.19-11-04595.1999", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146493929", "source": "openalex"}

The severity of OSA was determined from the apnea– hypopnea index (AHI) for total sleep time (AHITST), and was classified as mild (5 to 25 events/h), moderate (26 to 50 events/h), and severe ( > 50/events/h). Differences in OSA during different stages of sleep were assessed by comparing the AHI during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (AHINREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) (AHIREM) sleep and calculating the “REM difference” (AHIREM− AHINREM). Additionally, each overnight polysomnographic study was classified as showing one of three mutually exclusive types of OSA: (1) mild OSA, which occurred predominantly during REM sleep (REM OSA); (2) OSA of any severity, which occurred predominantly in the supine position (S OSA); or (3) OSA without a predominance in a single sleep stage or body position (A OSA). The mean AHITST for men was significantly higher than that for women (31.8 ± 1.0 versus 20.2 ± 1.5 events/h, p < 0.001). The male-to-female ratio was 3.2:1 for all OSA patients, and increased from 2.2:1 for patients with mild OSA to 7.9:1 for those with severe OSA. Women had a lower AHINREM than did men (14.6 ± 1.6 versus 29.6 ± 1.1 events/h, p < 0.001), but had a similar AHIREM (42.7 ± 1.6 versus 39.9 ± 1.2 events/h). Women had a significantly higher REM difference than did men (28.1 ± 1.5 versus 10.3 ± 1.1 events/h, p < 0.01). REM OSA occurred in 62% of women and 24% of men with OSA. S OSA occurred almost exclusively in men. We conclude that: (1) OSA is less severe in women because of milder OSA during NREM sleep; (2) women have a greater clustering of respiratory events during REM sleep than do men; (3) REM OSA is disproportionately more common in women than in men; and (4 ) S OSA is disproportionately more common in men than in women.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2158601579", "title": "Sleep-Induced Changes in Associative Memory", "text": "Abstract The notion that dreaming might alter the strength of associative links in memory was first proposed almost 200 years ago. But no strong evidence of such altered associative links has been obtained. Semantic priming can be used to quantify the strength of associative links between pairs of words; it is thought to measure the automatic spread of activation from a “node” representing one word to nodes representing semantically related words. Semantic priming could thus be used to test for global alterations in the strengths of associative links across the wake-sleep cycle. Awakenings from REM and nonREM (NREM) sleep produce a period of state carry-over during which performance is altered as a result of the brain's slow transition to full wakefulness, and cognitive testing in this period can provide information about the functioning of the brain during the prior sleep period. When subjects were tested across the night—before and after a night's sleep as well as immediately following forced awakenings from REM and NREM sleep—weak priming (e.g., thief-wrong) was found to be state dependent (p = 0.016), whereas strong priming (e.g., hot-cold) was not (p = 0.89). Weak primes were most effective in the presleep and REM sleep conditions and least effective in NREM and postsleep conditions. Most striking are analyses comparing weak and strong priming within each wake-sleep state. Contrary to the normal pattern of priming, subjects awakened from REM sleep showed greater priming by weak primes than by strong primes (p = 0.01). This result was seen in each of three protocols. In contrast, strong priming exceeded weak priming in NREM sleep. The shift in weak priming seen after REM sleep awakenings suggests that cognition during REM sleep is qualitatively different from that of waking and NREM sleep and may reflect a shift in associative memory systems, a shift that we hypothesize underlies the bizarre and hyperassociative character of REM-sleep dreaming. Known changes in brainstem activity that control the transition into and maintenance of REM sleep provide a possible explanation of this shift.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1162/089892999563319", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158601579", "source": "openalex"}

Our goal was to identify characteristics associated with inadequate sleep for a national random sample of elementary school–aged children (6–11 years) and adolescents (12–17 years). METHODS. Data from 68418 participants in the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health were analyzed by using weighted bivariate and multivariate regression models. The dependent variable was report of not getting enough sleep for a child of his or her age ≥1 night of the past week. Independent variables included demographic characteristics, child health, school and other activities, and family life. RESULTS. Parents of elementary school–aged children with inadequate sleep were more likely to report that their child was having problems at school or had a father with fair or poor health. Parents of adolescents with inadequate sleep were more likely to report that their child had an atopic condition, frequent or severe headaches, a parent with less-than-excellent emotional health, or experienced frequent parental anger. Inadequate sleep in both age groups was associated with parental report that their child usually or always displayed depressive symptomatology, family disagreements involved heated arguing, or parental concern that the child was not always safe at home, at school, or in their neighborhood.

Specifically, those sleeping < 5 h (odds ratio [OR] = 4.50, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-18.69) or sleeping between 5 to 6 h (OR = 4.24, 95% CI, 1.08-16.71) were at greater risk of developing the cold compared to those sleeping > 7 h per night; those sleeping 6.01 to 7 h were at no greater risk (OR = 1.66; 95% CI 0.40-6.95). This association was independent of prechallenge antibody levels, demographics, season of the year, body mass index, psychological variables, and health practices. Sleep fragmentation was unrelated to cold susceptibility. Other sleep variables obtained using diary and actigraphy were not strong predictors of cold susceptibility.Shorter sleep duration, measured behaviorally using actigraphy prior to viral exposure, was associated with increased susceptibility to the common cold.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.4968", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2189028582", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, little is known about the combined effect of time spent in sleep, SB and physical activity, that together constitute a composite whole, on obesity and cardio-metabolic health markers. Cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005–6 cycle on N = 1937 adults, was undertaken using a compositional analysis paradigm, which accounts for this intrinsic codependence. Time spent in SB, light intensity (LIPA) and moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) was determined from accelerometry and combined with self-reported sleep time to obtain the 24 hour time budget composition. The distribution of time spent in sleep, SB, LIPA and MVPA is significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, plasma glucose, plasma insulin (all p<0.001), and systolic (p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.003), but not HDL or LDL. Within the composition, the strongest positive effect is found for the proportion of time spent in MVPA. Strikingly, the effects of MVPA replacing another behavior and of MVPA being displaced by another behavior are asymmetric. For example, re-allocating 10 minutes of SB to MVPA was associated with a lower waist circumference by 0.001% but if 10 minutes of MVPA is displaced by SB this was associated with a 0.84% higher waist circumference. The proportion of time spent in LIPA and SB were detrimentally associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease markers, but the association with SB was stronger. For diabetes risk markers, replacing SB with LIPA was associated with more favorable outcomes. Time spent in MVPA is an important target for intervention and preventing transfer of time from LIPA to SB might lessen the negative effects of physical inactivity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139984", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1818552750", "source": "openalex"}

To analyse the EEG topography, power spectra were computed from 27 derivations. Mean power maps of the nonREM sleep EEG were calculated for 1-Hz bins between 1.0 and 24.75 Hz. Cluster analysis revealed a topographic segregation into distinct frequency bands which were similar for baseline and recovery sleep, and corresponded closely to the traditional frequency bands. Hallmarks of the power maps were the frontal predominance in the delta and alpha band, the occipital predominance in the theta band, and the sharply delineated vertex maximum in the sigma band. The effect of sleep deprivation on EEG topography was determined by calculating the recovery/baseline ratio of the power spectra. Prolonged waking induced an increase in power in the low-frequency range (1-10.75 Hz) which was largest over the frontal region, and a decrease in power in the sigma band (13-15.75 Hz) which was most pronounced over the vertex. The topographic pattern of the recovery/baseline power ratio was similar to the power ratio between the first and second half of the baseline night. These results indicate that changes in sleep propensity are reflected by specific regional differences in EEG power. The predominant increase of low-frequency power in frontal areas may be due to a high 'recovery need' of the frontal heteromodal association areas of the cortex.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01597.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973173732", "source": "openalex"}

(2) Reasons why actigraphy should be held to a substantially higher empirical standard than common medical tests and the best psychological tests have yet to be advanced. (3) Differences between actigraphy and polysomnography are not random and can be reduced. (3a) Sleep onset is a gradual rather than a discrete process. Actigraphy keys on an earlier phase of the sleep-onset process than does polysomnography, resulting in systematic rather than random differences. (3b) A sleep switch device can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of sleep-onset times. (3c) The residual unreliability of polysomnographic data explains a portion of the differences between actigraphy and polysomnography. Actigraphy cannot be expected to agree more completely with polysomnography than polysomnography does with itself.

Indeed, in patients with blunted chemical drive (e.g., obesity hypoventilation syndrome) and in instances when other defensive mechanisms fail, cortical arousal likely serves an important protective role. However, recent insight into the pathogenesis of OSA indicates that a substantial proportion of respiratory events do not terminate with a cortical arousal from sleep. In many cases, cortical arousals may actually perpetuate blood-gas disturbances, breathing instability, and subsequent upper airway closure during sleep. This brief review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms mediating respiratory-induced cortical arousal, the physiological factors that influence the propensity for cortical arousal, and the potential dual roles that cortical arousal may play in OSA pathogenesis. Finally, the extent to which existing sedative agents decrease the propensity for cortical arousal and their potential to be therapeutically beneficial for certain OSA patients are highlighted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00649.2013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976251971", "source": "openalex"}

In study 1, we reviewed the clinical records of 398 consecutive patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic Rochester for parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment. The frequency of suspected and polysomnogram (PSG)‐confirmed REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) among subjects with the synucleinopathies MSA, PD, or DLB was compared to the frequency among subjects with the nonsynucleinopathies Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). In study 2, we reviewed the clinical records of 360 consecutive patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville for parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment. The frequency of probable RBD among patients with PD and DLB was compared to the frequency among patients with AD and MCI. In study 3, we reviewed the brain biopsy or postmortem autopsy diagnoses of 23 Mayo Clinic Rochester patients who had been clinically examined for possible RBD and a neurodegenerative disorder. In study 1, patients with MSA, PD, or DLB were more likely to have probable and PSG‐confirmed RBD compared to subjects with the nonsynucleinopathies (probable RBD 77/120=64% vs. 7/278=3%, p &lt; 0.01; PSG‐confirmed RBD 47/120=39% vs. 1/278=0%, p &lt; 0.01). In study 2, patients with PD and DLB were more likely to have probable RBD compared to those with AD and MCI (56% vs. 2%, p &lt; 0.01). In study 3, of the 23 autopsied patients who had been questioned about possible RBD, 10 were clinically diagnosed with RBD. The neuropathologic diagnoses in these 10 included Lewy body disease in nine, and MSA in one. Of the other 13 cases, 12 did not have a history suggesting RBD, and the one case who did had normal electromyographic atonia during REM sleep on PSG and autopsy findings of PSP. Only one of these 13 had a synucleinopathy. The positive predictive values for RBD indicating a synucleinopathy for studies 1–3 were 91.7%, 94.3%, and 100.0%, respectively. Clinically suspected and PSG‐proven RBD occurs with disproportionally greater frequency in MSA, PD, and DLB compared to other neurodegenerative disorders. In the setting of degenerative dementia and/or parkinsonism, we hypothesize that RBD is a manifestation of an evolving synucleinopathy. © 2001 Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.1120", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129269087", "source": "openalex"}

Its citation history exhibits a long hibernation period followed by a sudden spike of popularity. Previous studies suggest a relative scarcity of SBs. The reliability of this conclusion is, however, heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary threshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations, applied to small or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets. Here we present a systematic, large-scale, and multidisciplinary analysis of the SB phenomenon in science. We introduce a parameter-free measure that quantifies the extent to which a specific paper can be considered an SB. We apply our method to 22 million scientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences over a time span longer than a century. Our results reveal that the SB phenomenon is not exceptional. There is a continuous spectrum of delayed recognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are taken into account. Although many cases of SBs can be identified by looking at monodisciplinary bibliographic data, the SB phenomenon becomes much more apparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets, where we can observe many examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in disciplines different from those where they were originally published. Our analysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has received little attention, and also provides empirical evidence against the use of short-term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1424329112", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171817276", "source": "openalex"}

Objective: To determine whether sleep restriction attenuates the effect of a reduced-calorie diet on excess adiposity. Design: Randomized, 2-period, 2-condition crossover study. Setting: University clinical research center and sleep laboratory. Patients: 10 overweight nonsmoking adults (3 women and 7 men) with a mean age of 41 years (SD, 5) and a mean body mass index of 27.4 kg/m2 (SD, 2.0). Intervention: 14 days of moderate caloric restriction with 8.5 or 5.5 hours of nighttime sleep opportunity. Measurements: The primary measure was loss of fat and fat-free body mass. Secondary measures were changes in substrate utilization, energy expenditure, hunger, and 24-hour metabolic hormone concentrations. Results: Sleep curtailment decreased the proportion of weight lost as fat by 55% (1.4 vs. 0.6 kg with 8.5 vs. 5.5 hours of sleep opportunity, respectively; P = 0.043) and increased the loss of fat-free body mass by 60% (1.5 vs. 2.4 kg; P = 0.002). This was accompanied by markers of enhanced neuroendocrine adaptation to caloric restriction, increased hunger, and a shift in relative substrate utilization toward oxidation of less fat. Limitation: The nature of the study limited its duration and sample size. Conclusion: The amount of human sleep contributes to the maintenance of fat-free body mass at times of decreased energy intake. Lack of sufficient sleep may compromise the efficacy of typical dietary interventions for weight loss and related metabolic risk reduction.

All patients and healthy controls were monitored in the sleep laboratory for 8 hours at night and at 2 daytime naps, each for 1 hour the following day.Obese patients compared with controls were sleepier during the day and their nighttime sleep was disturbed. During both naps, sleep latency, wake time after onset of sleep, and total wake time were significantly lower, whereas the percentage of sleep time was significantly higher in obese patients compared with controls. In contrast, during the nighttime testing, obese patients compared with controls demonstrated significantly higher wake time after onset of sleep, total wake time, and lower percentage of sleep time. An analysis of the relation between nighttime and daytime sleep suggested that daytime sleepiness in obese patients is a result of a circadian abnormality rather than just being secondary to nighttime sleep disturbance.Daytime sleepiness is a morbid characteristic of obese patients with a potentially significant impact on their lives and public safety.

Associated features include loud snoring, fragmented sleep, repetitive hypoxemia/hypercapnia, daytime sleepiness, and cardiovascular complications. The prevalence of OSA is 2–3% and 4–5% in middle-aged women and men, respectively. The prevalence of OSA among obese patients exceeds 30%, reaching as high as 50–98% in the morbidly obese population. Obesity is probably the most important risk factor for the development of OSA. Some 60–90% of adults with OSA are overweight, and the relative risk of OSA in obesity (BMI &amp;gt;29 kg/m2) is ≥10. Numerous studies have shown the development or worsening of OSA with increasing weight, as opposed to substantial improvement with weight reduction. There are several mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of OSA with obesity. These include reduced pharyngeal lumen size due to fatty tissue within the airway or in its lateral walls, decreased upper airway muscle protective force due to fatty deposits in the muscle, and reduced upper airway size secondary to mass effect of the large abdomen on the chest wall and tracheal traction. These mechanisms emphasize the great importance of fat accumulated in the abdomen and neck regions compared with the peripheral one. It is the abdomen much more than the thighs that affect the upper airway size and function. Hence, obesity is associated with increased upper airway collapsibility (even in nonapneic subjects), with dramatic improvement after weight reduction. Conversely, OSA may itself predispose individuals to worsening obesity because of sleep deprivation, daytime somnolence, and disrupted metabolism. OSA is associated with increased sympathetic activation, sleep fragmentation, ineffective sleep, and insulin resistance, potentially leading to diabetes and aggravation of obesity. Furthermore, OSA may be associated with changes in leptin, ghrelin, and orexin levels; increased appetite and caloric intake; and again exacerbating obesity. Thus, it appears that obesity and OSA form a vicious cycle where each results in worsening of the other.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2337/dc08-s272", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2122610724", "source": "openalex"}

In these cases, exercise promoted increased sleep efficiency and duration regardless of the mode and intensity of activity, especially in populations suffering from disease.

In patients with the sleep apnea syndrome, treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) normalizes both the apnea–hypopnea index and diurnal symptoms.

Measurements: Quality of life, objective sleepiness (Multiple Sleep Latency Test score), cognitive function, and arterial blood pressure. Results: The intervention and control groups were similar in terms of mean (±SE) age (54 ± 2 vs. 52 ± 2 years), apnea–hypopnea index (54 ± 3 vs. 57 ± 4), Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (7.0 ± 0.4 vs. 7.0 ± 0.4) and adherence to CPAP treatment (5.0 ± 0.4 vs. 4.0 ± 0.5 hours/d). Other variables, such as quality of life, cognitive function, and arterial blood pressure, were also similar in both groups before treatment. After 6 weeks of CPAP or sham CPAP, none of these variables changed significantly. Conclusion: In patients with an apnea–hypopnea index of 30 or greater and no subjective daytime sleepiness, CPAP does not modify quality of life, objective sleepiness, vigilance, attention, memory, information processing, visuomotor coordination, or arterial blood pressure.

Individuals show variation in their preference for the daily timing of activity; additionally, there is an association between chronotype and sleep duration/sleep complaints. Few studies have investigated sleep quality during the week days and weekends in relation to the circadian typology using self-assessment questionnaires or actigraphy. The purpose of this study was to use actigraphy to assess the relationship between the three chronotypes and the circadian rhythm of activity levels and to determine whether sleep parameters respond differently with respect to time (weekdays versus the weekend) in Morning-types (M-types), Neither-types (N-types) and Evening-types (E-types). The morningness–eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) was administered to 502 college students to determine their chronotypes. Fifty subjects (16 M-types, 15 N-types and 19 E-types) were recruited to undergo a 7-days monitoring period with an actigraph (Actiwacth® actometers, CNT, Cambridge, UK) to evaluate their sleep parameters and the circadian rhythm of their activity levels. To compare the amplitude and the acrophase among the three chronotypes, we used a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey–Kramer post-hoc test. To compare the Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm (MESOR) among the three chronotypes, we used a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test followed by pairwise comparisons that were performed using Dunn's procedure with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The analysis of each sleep parameter was conducted using the mixed ANOVA procedure. The results showed that the chronotype was influenced by sex (χ2 with p = 0.011) and the photoperiod at birth (χ2 with p < 0.05). Though the MESOR and amplitude of the activity levels were not different among the three chronotypes, the acrophases compared by the ANOVA post-hoc test were significantly different (p < 0.001). The ANOVA post-hoc test revealed the presence of a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the M-types (14:32 h) and E-types (16:53 h). There was also a significant interaction between the chronotype and four sleep parameters: Sleep end, Assumed Sleep, Immobility Time and Sleep Efficiency. Sleep Efficiency showed the same patterns as did Assumed Sleep and Immobility Time: the Sleep Efficiency of the E-types was poorer than that of the M- and N-types during weekdays (77.9% ± 7.0 versus 84.1% ± 4.9 and 84.1% ± 5.2) but was similar to that measured in the M- and N-types during the weekend. Sleep Latency and Movement and Fragmentation Index were not different among the three chronotypes and did not change on the weekend compared with weekdays. This study highlights two key findings: first, we observed that the circadian rhythm of activity levels was influenced by the chronotype; second, the chronotype had a significant effect on sleep parameters: the E-types had a reduced sleep quality and quantity compared with the M- and N-types during weekdays, whereas the E-types reached the same levels as the other chronotypes during the weekends. These findings suggest that E-types accumulate a sleep deficit during weekdays due to social and academic commitments and that they recover from this deficit during \"free days\" on the weekend.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/07420528.2014.986273", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124966347", "source": "openalex"}

Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that in vivo photostimulation of Hcrt neurons genetically targeted with ChR2, a light-activated cation channel, was sufficient to increase the probability of an awakening event during both slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. In the current study, we ask whether Hcrt-mediated sleep-to-wake transitions are affected by light/dark period and sleep pressure. We found that stimulation of Hcrt neurons increased the probability of an awakening event throughout the entire light/dark period but that this effect was diminished with sleep pressure induced by 2 or 4 h of sleep deprivation. Interestingly, photostimulation of Hcrt neurons was still sufficient to increase activity assessed by c-Fos expression in Hcrt neurons after sleep deprivation, although this stimulation did not cause an increase in transitions to wakefulness. In addition, we found that photostimulation of Hcrt neurons increases neural activity assessed by c-Fos expression in the downstream arousal-promoting locus ceruleus and tuberomammilary nucleus but not after 2 h of sleep deprivation. Finally, stimulation of Hcrt neurons was still sufficient to increase the probability of an awakening event in histidine decarboxylase-deficient knock-out animals. Collectively, these results suggest that the Hcrt system promotes wakefulness throughout the light/dark period by activating multiple downstream targets, which themselves are inhibited with increased sleep pressure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1205-09.2009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084556601", "source": "openalex"}

In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.115.185157", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2600383617", "source": "openalex"}

The results show that NREM power, for all frequencies below the beta range, has slower rise rates and reaches lower levels in the insomniac group, whereas beta power is significantly increased. In REM, insomniacs show lower levels in the delta and theta bands, whereas power in the faster frequency bands is significantly increased. Thus, the pathophysiology of insomnia is characterized not only by the generally acknowledged slow wave deficiency, but also by an excessive hyperarousal of the central nervous system throughout the night, affecting both REM and NREM sleep. This hyperarousal is interpreted in terms of the neuronal group theory of sleep which provides a possible explanation for the discrepancies observed between subjective impressions and objective measures of sleep. Also, it is suggested that the progressive hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical neurons as sleep deepens is slower in the patient population and that this may explain the observed slow wave deficiency. The homeostatic control of slow wave activity, on the other hand, would appear to be intact in the patient population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00189.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2028428817", "source": "openalex"}

Thus, sensorimotor correspondence is reflected in temporally precise activity patterns of single neurons that use long sensory memories to predict syllable sequences. Additionally, “spontaneous” activity of these neurons during sleep matches their sensorimotor activity, a form of song “replay.” These data suggest a model whereby sensorimotor correspondences are stored during singing but do not modify behavior, and off-line comparison (e.g., during sleep) of rehearsed motor output and predicted sensory feedback is used to adaptively shape motor output.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.290.5492.812", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067163191", "source": "openalex"}

We studied 8 healthy subjects (aged 40±5 years, 6 men and 2 women). Blood pressure, heart rate, forearm vascular resistance, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity were measured at rest and during 4 stressors (sustained handgrip, maximal forearm ischemia, mental stress, and cold pressor test). Measurements were obtained twice, once after normal sleep and once after a night of sleep deprivation. All measurements were obtained in a blinded, randomized manner. In comparison with normal sleep, sleep deprivation resulted in an increase in blood pressure (normal sleep versus sleep deprivation=82±8 versus 86±7 mm Hg, mean±SEM, P =0.012) and a decrease in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (normal sleep versus sleep deprivation=28±6 versus 22±6 bursts/min, P =0.017). Heart rate, forearm vascular resistance, and plasma catecholamines were not significantly changed by sleep deprivation, nor did sleep deprivation affect autonomic and hemodynamic responses to stressful stimuli. Sleep deprivation results in increased resting blood pressure, decreased muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and no change in heart rate.

Elimination of circadian rhythms through lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master circadian pacemaker, leads to fragmentation of wakefulness and sleep but does not eliminate the homeostatic response to sleep loss as indexed by the increase in EEG delta power. In humans, EEG delta power declines during sleep episodes nearly independently of circadian phase. Such observations have contributed to the prevailing notion that circadian and homeostatic processes are separate but recent data imply that this segregation may not extend to the molecular level. Here we summarize the criteria and evidence for a role for clock genes in sleep homeostasis. Studies in mice with targeted disruption for core circadian clock genes have revealed alterations in circadian rhythmicity as well as changes in sleep duration, sleep structure and EEG delta power. Clock-gene expression in brain areas outside the SCN, in particular the cerebral cortex, depends to a large extent on prior sleep-wake history. Evidence for effects of clock genes on sleep homeostasis has also been obtained in Drosophila and humans, pointing to a phylogenetically preserved pathway. These findings suggest that, while within the SCN clock genes are utilized to set internal time-of-day, in the forebrain the same feedback circuitry may be utilized to track time spent awake and asleep. The mechanisms by which clock-gene expression is coupled to the sleep-wake distribution could be through cellular energy charge whereby clock genes act as energy sensors. The data underscore the interrelationships between energy metabolism, circadian rhythmicity, and sleep regulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2009.06723.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067101252", "source": "openalex"}

The most commonly used OA reduces upper airway collapse by advancing the mandible (OAm). There is a strong evidence base demonstrating OAm improve OSA in the majority of patients, including some with more severe disease. However OAm are not efficacious for all, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing no therapeutic benefit. OAm are generally well tolerated, although short-term adverse effects during acclimatization are common. Long-term dental changes do occur, but these are for the most part subclinical and do not preclude continued use. Patients often prefer OAm to gold-standard CPAP treatment. Head-to-head trials confirm CPAP is superior in reducing OSA parameters on polysomnography; however, this greater efficacy does not necessarily translate into better health outcomes in clinical practice. Comparable effectiveness of OAm and CPAP has been attributed to higher reported nightly use of OAm, suggesting that inferiority in reducing apneic events may be counteracted by greater treatment adherence. Recently, significant advances in commercially available OAm technologies have been made. Remotely controlled mandibular positioners have the potential to identify treatment responders and the level of therapeutic advancement required in single night titration polysomnography. Objective monitoring of OAm adherence using small embedded temperature sensing data loggers is now available and will enhance clinical practice and research.

Stroke subtype was categorized as TIA, ischemic (IS), or hemorrhagic (HS). A portable respiratory recording (PRR) study was performed within 48–72 h after admission (acute phase), and subsequently after 3 mo (stable phase).

Prolonged curtailment of nocturnal sleep has been studied for its adverse effect on cognitive functioning and subjective tiredness, but relatively little is known about its effect on mood and physical symptoms. Objective: In order to test whether sleep restriction to 50% of the habitual time over 12 days affects diurnal and day-to-day variation of subjective ratings of mood and physical symptoms, 108 adjectives and statements were self-rated using visual analog scales every 2 h during the waking period.

Results: Optimism-sociability progressively declined over consecutive days of sleep restriction by 15%. Bodily discomfort showed a slight, but significant interindividual increase of 3% across days of sleep restriction due to significant increases of generalized body pain, back pain, and stomach pain.

No variable of interest predicted sleep, sleep predicted pain (beta = 0.13), pain predicted physical functioning (beta = -0.13), and physical functioning predicted depression (beta = -0.10).These findings highlight the high prevalence of sleep problems in this population and suggest that they play a critical role in exacerbating FMS symptoms. Furthermore, they support limited existing findings that sleep predicts subsequent pain in this population, but also extend the literature, suggesting that sleep may be related to depression through pain and physical functioning.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/art.23828", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1997598762", "source": "openalex"}

This association is maintained even when the sleep-wake cycle is desynchronized from the endogenous circadian rhythm of melatonin. Administration of melatonin during the day increases daytime sleep propensity as indexed by both the latency to sleep onset and sleep consolidation. The EEG during daytime sleep after melatonin administration exhibits characteristics reminiscent of the nocturnal sleep EEG, that is, increased sleep spindle activity and reduced slow-wave sleep and slow-wave activity, as detected by quantitative EEG analysis. Administration of higher doses of melatonin (5 mg or more) prior to nocturnal sleep results in an increase in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These data demonstrate that melatonin exerts effects on the main characteristics of human sleep, that is, latency to sleep onset, sleep consolidation, slow waves, sleep spindles, and REM sleep. There is a need for further studies using physiological doses and delivery systems that generate physiological plasma melatonin profiles to firmly establish the role of the endogenous circadian rhythm of melatonin in the circadian regulation of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/074873049701200618", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094532102", "source": "openalex"}

However, recent findings show that despite this effort, SD still impairs decision making involving the unexpected, innovation, revising plans, competing distraction, and effective communication.

In the present study, we examined serum levels of CRP and IL-6, IL-6 production by monocytes, and the effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Methods and Results— After polysomnography, venous blood was collected at 5 am from 30 patients with OSAS and 14 obese control subjects. Serum levels of CRP and IL-6 and spontaneous production of IL-6 by monocytes were investigated. In addition, the effects of 1 month of nCPAP were studied in patients with moderate to severe OSAS. Levels of CRP and IL-6 were significantly higher in patients with OSAS than in obese control subjects (CRP P &lt;0.001, IL-6 P &lt;0.05). IL-6 production by monocytes was also higher in patients with OSAS than in obese control subjects ( P &lt;0.01). In patients with OSAS, the primary factors influencing levels of CRP were severity of OSAS and body mass index and those influencing levels of IL-6 were body mass index and nocturnal hypoxia. nCPAP significantly decreased levels of both CRP ( P &lt;0.0001) and IL-6 ( P &lt;0.001) and spontaneous IL-6 production by monocytes ( P &lt;0.01). Conclusions— Levels of CRP and IL-6 and spontaneous production of IL-6 by monocytes are elevated in patients with OSAS but are decreased by nCPAP. Therefore, OSAS is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and nCPAP may be useful for decreasing these risks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.0000052627.99976.18", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977325333", "source": "openalex"}

Inclusion criteria for this study were middle and high school subjects aged 12 to 18 years old. The questionnaire, Adolescent Sleep, Caffeine Intake, and Technology Use, was developed by the investigators to measure adolescents' intake of caffeinated drinks, use of nighttime media-related technology, and sleep behaviors. Descriptive statistics characterized the subjects, their caffeine and technology use, and sleep variables. Regression models assessed the relationships between caffeine, technology use, and sleep variables, having adjusted for age, race, gender, and BMI.Sleep was significantly related to the multitasking index. Teenagers getting 8 to 10 hours of sleep on school nights tended to have 1.5- to 2-fold lower multitasking indices compared with those getting less sleep. Thirty-three percent of the teenagers reported falling asleep during school. Caffeine consumption tended to be 76% higher by those who fell asleep. The log-transformed multitasking index was significantly related to falling asleep during school and with difficulties falling asleep on weeknights.Many adolescents used multiple forms of technology late into the night and concurrently consumed caffeinated beverages. Subsequently, their ability to stay alert and fully functional throughout the day was impaired by excessive daytime sleepiness.

After an initial decrease in the 1990s, the overall death rate attributable to sleep-related infant deaths has not declined in more recent years. Many of the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths are strikingly similar. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths. Recommendations for a safe sleep environment include supine positioning, the use of a firm sleep surface, room-sharing without bed-sharing, and the avoidance of soft bedding and overheating. Additional recommendations for SIDS reduction include the avoidance of exposure to smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs; breastfeeding; routine immunization; and use of a pacifier. New evidence is presented for skin-to-skin care for newborn infants, use of bedside and in-bed sleepers, sleeping on couches/armchairs and in sitting devices, and use of soft bedding after 4 months of age. The recommendations and strength of evidence for each recommendation are included in this policy statement.

Orexin deficiency results in narcolepsy in humans, dogs, and rodents, suggesting that the orexin system is particularly important for maintenance of wakefulness. In addition, orexin deficiency also cause abnormalities in energy homeostasis and reward systems. Orexin activates waking active monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem regions to maintain a long, consolidated waking period. Orexin neurons receive abundant input from the limbic system. Orexin neurons also have reciprocal links with the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which regulates feeding. Moreover, the responsiveness of orexin neurons to peripheral metabolic cues, such as leptin and glucose, suggest that these neurons have important role as a link between the energy homeostasis and vigilance states. Orexin neurons also have a link with the dopaminergic reward system in the ventral tegmental nucleus. These findings suggest that the orexin system interacts with systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis to maintain proper vigilance states.

Conversely, mice acutely depleted of dopamine enter a different novel awake state characterized by spectral patterns of hippocampal local field potentials that resemble electrophysiological activity observed during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This dopamine-depleted state is marked by an apparent suppression of SWS and a complete suppression of REM sleep. Treatment with D 2 (but not D 1 ) dopamine receptor agonists recovers REM sleep in these mice. Altogether, these results indicate that dopamine regulates the generation of sleep–wake states.

Over the century, many authors have proposed sleep recommendations. The aim of this study was to describe historical trends in recommended and actual sleep durations for children and adolescents, and to explore the rationale of sleep recommendations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify recommendations for children’s sleep requirements and data reporting children’s actual total sleep time. For each recommendation identified, children’s actual sleep time was determined by identifying studies reporting the sleep duration of children of the same age, gender, and country in the same years. Historical trends in age-adjusted recommended sleep times and trends in children’s actual sleep time were calculated. A thematic analysis was conducted to determine the rationale and evidence-base for recommendations. RESULTS: Thirty-two sets of recommendations were located dating from 1897 to 2009. On average, age-specific recommended sleep decreased at the rate of –0.71 minute per year. This rate of decline was almost identical to the decline in the actual sleep duration of children (–0.73 minute per year). Recommended sleep was consistently ∼37 minutes greater than actual sleep, although both declined over time. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of empirical evidence for sleep recommendations was universally acknowledged. Inadequate sleep was seen as a consequence of “modern life,” associated with technologies of the time. No matter how much sleep children are getting, it has always been assumed that they need more.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-2039", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109768106", "source": "openalex"}

It is commonly assumed that flying birds maintain environmental awareness and aerodynamic control by sleeping with only one eye closed and one cerebral hemisphere at a time. However, sleep has never been demonstrated in flying birds. Here, using electroencephalogram recordings of great frigatebirds ( Fregata minor ) flying over the ocean for up to 10 days, we show that they can sleep with either one hemisphere at a time or both hemispheres simultaneously. Also unexpectedly, frigatebirds sleep for only 0.69 h d −1 (7.4% of the time spent sleeping on land), indicating that ecological demands for attention usually exceed the attention afforded by sleeping unihemispherically. In addition to establishing that birds can sleep in flight, our results challenge the view that they sustain prolonged flights by obtaining normal amounts of sleep on the wing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12468", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2498792650", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W189888755", "title": "The Visual Scoring of Sleep and Arousal in Infants and Children", "text": "Age is probably the single most crucial factor determining how humans sleep. Age and level of vigilance significantly influence the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the polysomnogram (PSG). The Pediatric Task Force provide an evidence-based review of the age-related development of the polysomnographic features of sleep in neonates, infants, and children, assessing the reliability and validity of these features, and assessing alternative methods of measurement. We used this annotated supporting text to develop rules for scoring sleep and arousals in infants and children. A pediatric EEG or PSG can only be determined to be normal by assessing whether the EEG patterns are appropriate for maturational age. Sleep in infants at term can be scored as NREM and REM sleep because all the polysomnographic and EEG features of REM sleep are present and quiet sleep, if not NREM sleep, is at least \"not REM sleep.\" The dominant posterior rhythm (DPR) of relaxed wakefulness increases in frequency with age: (1) 3.5-4.5 Hz in 75% of normal infants by 3-4 months post-term; (2) 5-6 Hz in most infants 5-6 months post-term; 3) 6 Hz in 70% of normal children by 2 months of age; and 3) 8 Hz (range 7.5-9.5 Hz) in 82% of normal children age 3 years, 9 Hz in 65% of 9-year-olds, and 10 Hz in 65% of 15-year-old controls. Sleep spindles in children occur independently at two different frequencies and two different scalp locations: 11.0-12.75 Hz over the frontal and 13.0-14.75 Hz over the centroparietal electrodes; these findings are most prominent in children younger than 13 years. Centroparietal spikes are often maximal over the vertex (Cz), less often maximal over the left central (C3) or right central (C4) EEG derivation. About 50% of sleep spindles within a particular infant's PSG are asynchronous before 6 months of age, 30% at 1 year. Based on this, we recommend that: (1) sleep spindles be scored as a polysomnographic signature of NREM stage 2 sleep (N2) at whatever age they are first seen in a PSG, typically present by 2 to 3 months post-term; (2) identify and score sleep spindles from the frontal and centroparietal EEG derivations, especially in infants and children younger than 13 years. NREM sleep in an infant or child can be scored if the dominant posterior rhythm occupies <50% of a 30-second epoch, and one or more of the following EEG patterns appear: (1) a diffuse lower voltage mixed frequency activity; (2) hypnagogic hypersynchrony; (3) rhythmic anterior theta of drowsiness; (4) diffuse high voltage occipital delta slowing; (5) runs or bursts of diffuse, frontal, frontocentral, or occipital maximal rhythmic 3-5 Hz slowing; (6) vertex sharp waves; and/or (7) post-arousal hypersynchrony. K complexes first appear 5 months post-term and are usually present by 6 months post-term, whereas clearly recognizable vertex sharp waves are most often seen 16 months post-term. Vertex sharp waves are best seen over the central (Cz, C3, C4) and K complexes over the frontal (Fz, F3, F4) electrodes. Slow wave activity (SWA) of slow wave sleep (SWS) is first seen as early as 2 to 3 months post-term and is usually present 4 to 4.5 months post-term. SWA of SWS in an infant or child often has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 100 to 400 microV. Based on consensus voting we recommended scoring N1, N2, and N3 corresponding to NREM 1, 2, and SWS whenever it was recognizable in an infant's PSG, usually by 4 to 4.5 months post-term (as early as 2-3 months post-term). Epochs of NREM sleep which contain no sleep spindles, K complexes, or SWA would be scored as N1; those which contain either K complexes or sleep spindles and <20% SWS as N2, and those in which >20% of the 30-second epoch contain 0.5 to 2 Hz >75 microV (usually 100-400 microV) activity as N3. The DPR should be scored in the EEG channel that is best observed, (typically occipital), but DPR reactive to eye opening can be seen in central electrodes. Because sleep spindles occur independently over the frontal and central regions in children, they should be scored whether they occur in the frontal or central regions. Because sleep spindles are asynchronous before age 2 years, simultaneous recording of left and right frontal and central activity may be warranted in children 1-2 years of age. Simultaneous recording of left, right, and midline central electrodes may be appropriate because of the asynchronous nature of sleep spindles before age 2 years, but reliability testing is needed. Evidence has shown that the PSG cannot reliably be used to identify neurological deficits or to predict behavior or outcome in infants because of significant diversity of results, even in normal infants. Normal sleep EEG patterns and architecture are present in the first year of life, even in infants with severe neurological compromise. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep and its disorders play critical roles in the development of healthy children and healthy adults thereafter. Reliability studies comparing head-to-head different scoring criteria, recording techniques, and derivations are needed so that future scoring recommendations can be based on evidence rather than consensus opinion. We need research comparing clinical outcomes with PSG measures to better inform clinicians and families exactly what meaning a PSG has in evaluating a child's suspected sleep disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.26819", "url": "https://openalex.org/W189888755", "source": "openalex"}

The human PET data indicate a preferential activation in REM of the pontine brain stem and of limbic and paralimbic cortical structures involved in mediating emotion and a corresponding deactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortical structures involved in the executive and mnemonic aspects of cognition. The pontine brainstem mechanisms controlling the neuromodulatory balance of the brain in rats and cats include noradrenergic and serotonergic influences which enhance waking and impede REM via anticholinergic mechanisms and cholinergic mechanisms which are essential to REM sleep and only come into full play when the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems are inhibited. In REM, the brain thus becomes activated but processes its internally generated data in a manner quite different from that of waking.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001756-199802160-00033", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068762026", "source": "openalex"}

Overall levels of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were not significantly affected by age. The latencies to REM sleep were shorter in older people when sleep coincided with the melatonin rhythm. REM sleep was increased in the first quarter of the sleep episode and the increase of REM sleep in the course of sleep was diminished in older people. 4 Sleep propensity co-varied with the circadian rhythms of body temperature and plasma melatonin in both age groups. Sleep latencies were longest just before the onset of melatonin secretion and short sleep latencies were observed close to the temperature nadir. In older people sleep latencies were longer close to the crest of the melatonin rhythm. 5 In older people sleep duration was reduced at all circadian phases and sleep consolidation deteriorated more rapidly during the course of sleep, especially when the second half of the sleep episode occurred after the crest of the melatonin rhythm. 6 The data demonstrate age-related decrements in sleep consolidation and increased susceptibility to circadian phase misalignment in older people. These changes, and the associated internal phase advance of the propensity to awaken from sleep, appear to be related to the interaction between a reduction in the homeostatic drive for sleep and a reduced strength of the circadian signal promoting sleep in the early morning.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.0611v.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969535988", "source": "openalex"}

The antibody response to vaccination provides a valid tool to assess the influence of sleep on adaptive immune functioning in humans, which is also clinically relevant. Methods Two groups of healthy humans (N = 19) not previously infected with hepatitis A virus (HAV) were studied. On the night after primary vaccination with inactivated HAV, which took place at 0900 hours, one group had regular sleep. The other group stayed awake, and did not sleep before 2100 hours the following day. HAV antibody titers were measured repeatedly until 28 days after vaccination. Plasma hormone concentrations and white blood cell (WBC) subset counts were determined on the night and day after vaccination. Results Subjects who had regular sleep after vaccination, displayed a nearly two-fold higher HAV antibody titer after 4 weeks than subjects staying awake on this night (p =.018). Compared with wakefulness, sleep after vaccination distinctly increased release of several immune-stimulating hormones including growth hormone, prolactin, and dopamine (p < .01). Concentrations of thyrotropin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were lowered by sleep (p < .02), whereas sleep only marginally influenced WBC subset counts. Conclusions Data suggest that sleep compared with sleep deprivation on the night after vaccination improves the formation of antigen-specific immune defense as reflected by antibody production in humans. Sleep presumably acts by inducing a hormonal environment in secondary lymphoid tissues, enhancing lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation and finally antibody synthesis.

This study examined the hypothesis that domains of neurobehavioral function would be selectively affected by sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Therefore, we assessed potential relationships between objectively measured sleep disturbances and neurobehavioral function in children with reported symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and also determined the incidence of snoring and other sleep problems in 5- to 7-year-old children in the local community and potential relationships to parental snoring and passive smoking. Methods. Parents of 5- to 7-year-old children in public schools were surveyed about their child’s sleeping habits using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire also asked whether they believed their child to be hyperactive or have ADHD. Children with reported symptoms of ADHD and control children were randomly selected and invited to the Sleep Medicine Center for an overnight polysomnographic assessment and a battery of neurocognitive tests. Results. The questionnaire response rate was 47.6% (n = 5728). Frequent and loud snoring was reported for 673 children (11.7%). Similarly, 418 (7.3%) children were reported to have hyperactivity/ADHD, 313 (76.5%) of which were boys. Eighty-three children with parentally reported symptoms of ADHD were invited for full evaluation at the Sleep Medicine Center together with 34 control children. After assessment with the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale, 44 children were designated as having “significant” symptoms of ADHD, 27 as “mild,” and 39 designated as “none” (controls). Overnight polysomnography indicated that obstructive sleep apnea was present in 5% of those with significant ADHD symptoms, 26% of those with mild symptoms, and 5% of those with no symptoms. In the cohort, no sleep variable accounted for more than a negligible proportion of the variance in domains of neurobehavioral function. Conclusions. An unusually high prevalence of snoring was identified among a group of children designated as showing mild symptoms of ADHD based on the Conners’ ADHD index identified from a community sample. However, whereas SDB is not more likely to occur among children with significant ADHD symptoms, it is significantly highly prevalent among children with mild hyperactive behaviors. Sleep studies further revealed that rapid eye movement disturbances are more likely to occur in children with significant symptoms, and they seem to impose significant but mild effects on daytime neurobehavioral functioning. We conclude that in children with significant symptoms of ADHD, the prevalence of SDB is not different from that of the general pediatric population and that rapid eye movement sleep in these children is disturbed and may contribute to the severity of their behavioral manifestations. Furthermore, SDB can lead to mild ADHD-like behaviors that can be readily misperceived and potentially delay the diagnosis and appropriate treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.111.3.554", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2045968389", "source": "openalex"}

Plasma ghrelin and leptin displayed diurnal rhythms with the ghrelin peak preceding and the leptin peak following the major daily feeding peak in hour 1 after dark onset. RF reversed the diurnal rhythm of these hormones and the rhythm of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and significantly altered the rhythm of T crt . In contrast, the duration and intensity of non-REMS (NREMS) were hardly responsive to RF. SD failed to change leptin concentrations, but it promptly stimulated plasma ghrelin and induced eating. SD elicited biphasic variations in the hypothalamic ghrelin contents. SD increased plasma corticosterone, but corticosterone did not seem to influence either leptin or ghrelin. The results suggest a strong relationship between feeding and the diurnal rhythm of leptin and that feeding also fundamentally modulates the diurnal rhythm of ghrelin. The variations in hypothalamic ghrelin contents might be associated with sleep-wake activity in rats, but, unlike the previous observations in humans, obvious links could not be detected between sleep and the diurnal rhythms of plasma concentrations of either ghrelin or leptin in the rat.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00294.2004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116753388", "source": "openalex"}

Oscillations (&lt;1 Hz) in SWS and transformation to an activated awake state were investigated with intracellular recordings <i>in vivo</i> and with computational models of the corticothalamic system. Occasional summation of the miniature EPSPs during the hyperpolarized (silent) phase of SWS oscillation activated the persistent sodium current and depolarized the membrane of cortical pyramidal (PY) cells sufficiently for spike generation. In the model, this triggered the active phase, which was maintained by lateral PY–PY excitation and persistent sodium current. Progressive depression of the excitatory interconnections and activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current led to termination of the 20–25 Hz activity after 500–1000 msec. Including thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons in the model increased the duration of the active epochs up to 1–1.5 sec and introduced waning spindle sequences. An increase in acetylcholine activity, which is associated with activated states, was modeled by the reduction in the K<sup>+</sup> leak current in PY and TC cells and by a decrease in intracortical PY–PY synaptic conductances. These changes eliminated the hyperpolarizing phases of network activity and transformed cortical neurons to tonic firing at 15–20 Hz. During the transition from SWS to the activated state, the input resistance of cortical neurons gradually increased and, in a fully activated state, reached the same or even higher values as during silent phases of SWS oscillations. The model describes many essential features of SWS and activated states in the thalamocortical system as well as the transition between them.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.22-19-08691.2002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1895907979", "source": "openalex"}

Hypocretin-containing neurons have widespread projections throughout the CNS with particularly dense excitatory projections to monoaminergic centers such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, serotoninergic raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. The hypocretins were originally believed to be primarily important in the regulation of appetite; however, a major function emerging from research on these neuropeptides is the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Deficiency in hypocretin neurotransmission results in the sleep disorder narcolepsy in mice, dogs, and humans. The hypocretins are also uniquely positioned to link sleep, appetite, and neuroendocrine control.

Estimates of a system of demand equations demonstrate that higher wage rates reduce sleep time among men but increase their waking nonmarket time by an equal amount.

We investigated directly whether dysfunction and inflammation occur in vivo in the vascular endothelium of patients with OSA. The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on endothelial function and repair capacity were assessed. Methods and Results— Thirty-two patients with newly diagnosed OSA and 15 control subjects were studied. Proteins that regulate basal endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production (endothelial NO synthase [eNOS] and phosphorylated eNOS) and inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NOS) and markers of oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine) were quantified by immunofluorescence in freshly harvested venous endothelial cells before and after 4 weeks of CPAP therapy. Vascular reactivity was measured by flow-mediated dilation. Circulating endothelial progenitor cell levels were quantified to assess endothelial repair capacity. Baseline endothelial expression of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS was reduced by 59% and 94%, respectively, in patients with OSA compared with control subjects. Expression of both nitrotyrosine and cyclooxygenase-2 was 5-fold greater in patients with OSA than in control subjects, whereas inducible NOS expression was 56% greater. Expression of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS significantly increased, whereas expression of nitrotyrosine, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible NOS significantly decreased in patients who adhered to CPAP ≥4 hours daily. Baseline flow-mediated dilation and endothelial progenitor cell levels were lower in patients than in control subjects, and both significantly increased in patients who adhered to CPAP ≥4 hours daily. Conclusions— OSA directly affects the vascular endothelium by promoting inflammation and oxidative stress while decreasing NO availability and repair capacity. Effective CPAP therapy is associated with the reversal of these alterations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.107.741512", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137988289", "source": "openalex"}

The hypocretins/orexins have been implicated in the regulation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. In the present study, we investigated whether the locus coeruleus (LC), a structure receiving dense hcrtergic innervation, which is quiescent during REM sleep, might be a target for hcrt to regulate REM sleep. Local administration of hcrt1 but not hcrt2 in the LC suppressed REM sleep in a dose-dependent manner and increased wakefulness at the expense of deep, slow-wave sleep. These effects were blocked with an antibody that neutralizes hcrt binding to hcrt receptor 1. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry showed the presence of hcrt receptor 1 but not the presence of hcrt receptor 2 in the LC. Iontophoretic application of hcrt1 enhanced the firing rate of LC neurons in vivo , and local injection of hcrt1 into the LC induced the expression of c- fos in the LC area. We propose that hcrt receptor 1 in the LC is a key target for REM sleep regulation and might be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of narcolepsy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.20-20-07760.2000", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110175860", "source": "openalex"}

REM sleep was associated with selective activation of extrastriate visual cortices, particularly within the ventral processing stream, and an unexpected attenuation of activity in the primary visual cortex; increases in regional cerebral blood flow in extrastriate areas were significantly correlated with decreases in the striate cortex. Extrastriate activity was also associated with concomitant activation of limbic and paralimbic regions, but with a marked reduction of activity in frontal association areas including lateral orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.

Here we use direct current electroencephalography to demonstrate large-scale infraslow oscillations in the human cortex at frequencies ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 Hz. These oscillations, which are not detectable in conventional electroencephalography because of its limited recording bandwidth (typical lower limit 0.5 Hz), were observed in widespread cortical regions. Notably, the infraslow oscillations were strongly synchronized with faster activities, as well as with the interictal epileptic events and K complexes.

Evaluation of six consecutive SA patients demonstrated that bradycardia occurred during 95% of all apneas (central, obstructive, and mixed) and became marked with increased apnea length (P less than 0.01) and increased oxyhemoglobin desaturation (P less than 0.01). Heart rate slowed 9.5 beats per minute (bpm) during apneas of 10-19 s in duration, 11.4 bpm during 20-39s apneas, and 16.6 bpm during 40-59-s apneas. Sleep stage had no effect unexplained by apnea length or degree of desaturation. Oxygen administration to four SA patients completely prevented the bradycardia although apneas lengthened (P less than 0.05) in three. Sleeping normal subjects did not develop bradycardia during hypoxic hyperpnea but, instead, HR increased with hypoxia in all sleep stages, although the increase in HR was not as great as that which occurred while awake. Breath holding in awake normals did not result in bradycardia during hyperoxia (SaO2 = 99%), but was consistently (P less than 0.01) associated with heart rate slowing during room air breath-holds (-6 bpm) at SaO2 = 93%, with more striking slowing (-20 bpm) during hypoxic breath-holds (P less than 0.01) at SaO2 = 78%. Breath holding during hyperoxic hypercapnia had no significant effect on rate. Breath holding in awake SA subjects demonstrated similar findings.

As a result of the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation that healthy infants be placed on their side or back for sleep, the percentage of infants sleeping prone has decreased dramatically. With the increase in supine sleeping, pediatricians have questioned if there are differences in the rate of acquisition of early motor milestones between prone and supine sleeping infants. Methods. To examine this question, we performed a prospective, practice-based study of healthy term infants. Infants were recruited before the age of 2 months. Parents were asked to record infant sleep position and awake time spent prone until 6 months of age. A developmental log was used to track milestones from birth until the infant was walking. Age of acquisition of eight motor milestones was determined, and the mean ages of milestone attainment of prone and supine sleepers were compared. Results. Three hundred fifty-one infants completed the study. Prone sleepers acquired motor milestones at an earlier age than supine sleepers. There was a significant difference in the age of attainment of rolling prone to supine, tripod sitting, creeping, crawling, and pulling to stand. There was no significant difference in age when infants walked. Conclusions. The pattern of early motor development is affected by sleep position. Prone sleepers attain several motor milestones earlier than supine sleepers. However, all infants achieved all milestones within the accepted normal age range. Pediatricians can use this information to reassure parents. This difference in milestone attainment is not a reason to abandon the American Academy of Pediatrics' sleep position recommendations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.102.5.1135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061798150", "source": "openalex"}

This results in a condition of relative sympathetic dominance even in a situation such as sleep, normally described as a condition of vagal dominance and, consequently, low risk for lethal events.

Patients were more somnolent, anxious, and depressed than control subjects (p < 0.01), and they had a lower level of vigilance and poorer driving performance (p < 0.01). Yet, we did not find any correlation between the degree of daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression, the number of respiratory events, nocturnal hypoxemia, level of vigilance, or driving simulator performance and the risk of automobile accidents among SAS patients. In conclusion, patients with SAS have an increased risk of automobile accidents. None of the clinical or physiological markers commonly used to define disease severity appear able to discriminate those patients at higher risk of having an automobile accident.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.158.1.9709135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2131678043", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we used autoregressive spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram (EKG) interbeat interval sequence to characterize stress-related changes in heart rate variability during sleep in 59 healthy men and women.Participants (N = 59) were randomly assigned to a control or stress condition, in which a standard speech task paradigm was used to elicit acute stress in the immediate presleep period. EKG was collected throughout the night. The high frequency component (0.15-0.4 Hz Eq) was used to index parasympathetic modulation, and the ratio of low to high frequency power (0.04-0.15 Hz Eq/0.15-0.4 Hz Eq) of heart rate variability was used to index sympathovagal balance.Acute psychophysiological stress was associated with decreased levels of parasympathetic modulation during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep and increased levels of sympathovagal balance during NREM sleep. Parasympathetic modulation increased across successive NREM cycles in the control group; these increases were blunted in the stress group and remained essentially unchanged across successive NREM periods. Higher levels of sympathovagal balance during NREM sleep were associated with poorer sleep maintenance and lower delta activity.Changes in heart rate variability associated with acute stress may represent one pathway to disturbed sleep. Stress-related changes in heart rate variability during sleep may also be important in association with chronic stressors, which are associated with significant morbidity and increased risk for mortality.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.psy.0000106884.58744.09", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2025078777", "source": "openalex"}

Recent systematic reviews of the literature reveal that the vast majority of studies find an adverse association between screen-based media consumption and sleep health, primarily via delayed bedtimes and reduced total sleep duration. The underlying mechanisms of these associations likely include the following: (1) time displacement (ie, time spent on screens replaces time spent sleeping and other activities); (2) psychological stimulation based on media content; and (3) the effects of light emitted from devices on circadian timing, sleep physiology, and alertness. Much of our current understanding of these processes, however, is limited by cross-sectional, observational, and self-reported data. Further experimental and observational research is needed to elucidate how the digital revolution is altering sleep and circadian rhythms across development (infancy to adulthood) as pathways to poor health, learning, and safety outcomes (eg, obesity, depression, risk-taking).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-1758j", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2766989955", "source": "openalex"}

Loss of Hcrt function results in the sleep disorder narcolepsy. However, the normal pattern of Hcrt release across the sleep–wake cycle is unknown. We monitored Hcrt-1 release in the basal forebrain, perifornical hypothalamus, and locus ceruleus (LC) across the sleep–wake cycle using microdialysis in freely moving cats and a sensitive solid phase radioimmunoassay. We found that the peptide concentration in dialysates from the hypothalamus was significantly higher during active waking (AW) than during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Moreover, Hcrt-1 release was significantly higher during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than during SWS in the hypothalamus and basal forebrain. We did not detect a significant difference in release across sleep–waking states in the LC, perhaps because recovered levels of the peptide were lower at this site. Because there was a trend toward higher levels of Hcrt-1 release during AW compared with quiet waking (QW) in our 10 min dialysis samples, we compared Hcrt-1 levels in CSF in 2 hr AW and QW periods. Hcrt-1 release into CSF was 67% higher during AW than during QW. Elevated levels of Hcrt during REM sleep and AW are consistent with a role for Hcrt in the central programming of motor activity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.22-13-05282.2002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103398040", "source": "openalex"}

To determine the effect of testosterone on ventilatory function and whether testosterone may play a role in the development of obstructive apnoea, we performed waking ventilatory drive studies and sleep studies in five hypogonadal men. These androgen‐deficient subjects were studied both while receiving no treatment and after six weeks of testosterone replacement therapy (testosterone oenanthate 200 mg i.m. every 2 weeks). Hypoxic ventilatory drive decreased significantly, from 158 · 39 (mean · SEM) off testosterone to 88 · 19 on testosterone therapy ( P &lt; 0.05). Hypercapnoeic ventilatory drive did not change significantly on testosterone. Obstructive sleep apnoea developed in one man and markedly worsened in another man in association with testosterone administration. Both of these subjects also exhibited marked decreases in oxygen saturation with the development of cardiac dysrhythmias during sleep and large increases in haematocrit. The remaining three hypogonadal men did not demonstrate significant sleep apnoea either on or off testosterone. The percentage of sleep time spent in REM sleep increased from 14 · 3% to 22 · 2% when the men were receiving testosterone ( P &lt; 0.01), but the episodes of sleep apnoea tended to occur during non‐REM sleep. We conclude that in some hypogonadal men, replacement dosages of testosterone may affect ventilatory drives and induce or worsen obstructive sleep apnoea. The obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is a potential complication of testosterone therapy. These results suggest that androgen levels present in normal man may play an important role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.1985.tb00161.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143323456", "source": "openalex"}

The sleep disturbance in cirrhosis was not associated with clinical parameters nor with cognitive impairment. Cirrhotic subjects and patients with chronic renal failure with unsatisfactory sleep showed higher scores for depression and anxiety, raising the possibility that the effects of chronic disease may underlie the pathogenesis of sleep disturbance. However, in contrast to chronic renal failure, unsatisfactory sleep in cirrhosis was associated with delayed bedtime, delayed wake-up time, and evening chronotypology.

Three baseline nights of 8 hours (2300–0700 hours) were followed by four nights with 4 hours of sleep (2300–0300 hours) and three recovery nights of 8 hours (2300–0700 hours). Sleep restriction curtailed sleep stages 1 and 2 as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but left slow wave sleep largely unaffected. In the first two recovery nights, total sleep time and REM sleep were enhanced, and sleep latency was shortened. Slow wave sleep was increased only in the first recovery night. In accordance with the prediction of the two-process model of sleep regulation, slow wave activity (SWA; spectral power density in the 0.75–4.5-Hz range) in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep increased by approximately 20% in the first night following sleep restriction, remained at this level in the subsequent 3 nights and decreased immediately after the first recovery night. In contrast to these immediate changes, progressive and more persistent changes were seen in the EEG activity of higher frequencies. Thus, activity in the upper delta band tended to gradually increase from night to night during the sleep restriction period, whereas after an initial increase, activity in the theta-alpha band changed in the opposite direction. The progressive changes were also present in the EEG spectra of REM sleep and wakefulness. Because the time course of these changes paralleled the cumulative deficit in REM sleep, they may represent a correlate of REM sleep pressure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/16.2.100", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1818859001", "source": "openalex"}

This review provides an overview of recent epidemiologic studies on the relations between habitual short sleep duration and dietary intake in adults from 16 cross-sectional studies. The studies have observed consistent associations between short sleep duration and higher total energy intake and higher total fat intake, and limited evidence for lower fruit intake, and lower quality diets. Evidence also suggests that short sleepers may have irregular eating behavior deviating from the traditional 3 meals/d to fewer main meals and more frequent, smaller, energy-dense, and highly palatable snacks at night. Although the impact of short sleep duration on dietary intake tends to be small, if chronic, it may contribute to an increased risk of obesity and related chronic disease. Mechanisms mediating the associations between sleep duration and dietary intake are likely to be multifactorial and include differences in the appetite-related hormones leptin and ghrelin, hedonic pathways, extended hours for intake, and altered time of intake. Taking into account these epidemiologic relations and the evidence for causal relations between sleep loss and metabolism and cardiovascular function, health promotion strategies should emphasize improved sleep as an additional factor in health and weight management. Moreover, future sleep interventions in controlled studies and sleep extension trials in chronic short sleepers are imperative for establishing whether there is a causal relation between short sleep duration and changes in dietary intake.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3945/an.115.008623", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2183907399", "source": "openalex"}

Most children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have mild-to-moderate forms, for which neurobehavioral complications are believed to be the most important adverse outcomes. To improve understanding of this morbidity, its long-term response to adenotonsillectomy, and its relationship to polysomnographic measures, we studied a series of children before and after clinically indicated adenotonsillectomy or unrelated surgical care. METHODS. We recorded sleep and assessed behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric morbidity in 105 children 5.0 to 12.9 years old: 78 were scheduled for clinically indicated adenotonsillectomy, usually for suspected SDB, and 27 for unrelated surgical care. One year later, we repeated all assessments in 100 of these children. RESULTS. Subjects who had an adenotonsillectomy, in comparison to controls, were more hyperactive on well-validated parent rating scales, inattentive on cognitive testing, sleepy on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and likely to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) as judged by a child psychiatrist. In contrast, 1 year later, the 2 groups showed no significant differences in the same measures. Subjects who had an adenotonsillectomy had improved substantially in all measures, and control subjects improved in none. However, polysomnographic assessment of baseline SDB and its subsequent amelioration did not clearly predict either baseline neurobehavioral morbidity or improvement in any area other than sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS. Children scheduled for adenotonsillectomy often have mild-to-moderate SDB and significant neurobehavioral morbidity, including hyperactivity, inattention, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and excessive daytime sleepiness, all of which tend to improve by 1 year after surgery. However, the lack of better correspondence between SDB measures and neurobehavioral outcomes suggests the need for better measures or improved understanding of underlying causal mechanisms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2005-1837", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2028620799", "source": "openalex"}

Alternating REM with NREM sleep conserves energy by decreasing the need for core body temperature defense. Three EA phenotypes are proposed: sleep-wake cycling, torpor, and continuous (or predominant) wakefulness. Each phenotype carries inherent costs and benefits. Sleep-wake cycling downregulates specific biological processes in waking and upregulates them in sleep, thereby decreasing energy demands imposed by wakefulness, reducing cellular infrastructure requirements, and resulting in overall energy conservation. Torpor achieves the greatest energy savings, but critical biological operations are compromised. Continuous wakefulness maximizes niche exploitation, but endures the greatest energy demands.

Television (TV) has been associated with sleep curtailment, but little is known about small screens (eg, smartphones), which can be used in bed and emit notifications. Therefore, we examined associations of different screens in sleep environments with sleep duration and perceived insufficient rest or sleep. METHODS: Participants included 2048 fourth- and seventh-graders participating in the Massachusetts Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration Study in 2012 to 2013. Using linear and log binomial regression, we examined cross-sectional associations of small screens and TVs in sleep environments and screen time with weekday sleep duration and perceived insufficient rest or sleep in the past week. RESULTS: Children who slept near a small screen (compared with never) reported 20.6 fewer minutes of sleep (95% confidence interval [CI], −29.7 to −11.4) and had a higher prevalence of perceived insufficient rest or sleep (prevalence ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.60).

Polysomnography was also performed on 19 patients. Medical history, sleep history, location of stroke, and severity of neurological deficit were recorded, and patients were observed by staff for evidence of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Functional abilities were measured with the use of the Barthel Index (BI). Outcome variables included ability to return home at discharge, continued residence at home at 3 and 12 months, BI at discharge, BI at 3 and 12 months, and death from any cause at 12 months.Mean SaO2 during oximetry was 94.0 +/- 1.7%, and percentage of recording time spent at < 90% SaO2 was 4.3 +/- 5.7%.

Oximetry abnormalities were associated with a history of snoring. Polysomnography on 19 patients confirmed oximetry evidence of severe SDB.

Desaturation events were largely due to obstructive apneas.SDB accompanied by arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation is common in patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke and is associated with higher mortality at 1 year and lower BI scores at discharge and at 3 and 12 months after stroke. SDB may be an independent predictor of worse functional outcome. Obstructive sleep apnea appeared to be the most common form of SDB, and the frequent history of snoring suggests that SDB preceded the stroke in most patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.str.27.2.252", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096763948", "source": "openalex"}

Concomitantly, global figures relating to obesity and diabetes mellitus have increased in an alarming fashion in adults and children, and it has been hypothesized that neuro-hormonal changes accompanying this behavioral sleep deprivation may lead to insulin resistance and, subsequently, to diabetes mellitus. Sleep deprivation has been associated with multiple physiological changes, including increased cortisol and ghrelin levels, decreased leptin levels and impaired glucose metabolism. Experimental studies have also shown an increase in inflammatory and pro-inflammatory markers, which are indicators of body stress, under sleep deprivation. This review elaborates further on this hypothesis, exploring the molecular basis for the link between both entities and the underlying pathophysiology that results in insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. We review the results of experimental and epidemiological studies, specifically examining the relationship between sleep duration and the immune and endocrine systems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2174/1874306401105010031", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135706626", "source": "openalex"}

The sleep-wake cycle is normally timed to occur at a specific phase relative to the external cycle of light-dark exposure. It is also timed at a specific phase relative to internal circadian rhythms, such as the pineal melatonin rhythm, the circadian sleep-wake propensity rhythm, and the rhythm of responsiveness of the circadian pacemaker to light. Variations in these internal and external phase relationships, such as those that occur in blindness, aging, morning and evening, and advanced and delayed sleep-phase syndrome, lead to sleep disruptions and complaints. Changes in ocular circadian photoreception, interindividual variation in the near-24-h intrinsic period of the circadian pacemaker, and sleep homeostasis can contribute to variations in external and internal phase. Recent findings on the physiological and molecular-genetic correlates of circadian sleep disorders suggest that the timing of the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms is closely integrated but is, in part, regulated differentially.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00924.2001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099661570", "source": "openalex"}

Yoga, an ancient Eastern science, incorporates stress‐reduction techniques that include regulated breathing, visual imagery, and meditation as well as various postures. The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga (TY) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor, which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low‐impact postures in patients with lymphoma. METHODS Thirty‐nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait‐list control group. Patients in the TY group participated in 7 weekly yoga sessions, and patients in the wait‐list control group were free to participate in the TY program after the 3‐month follow‐up assessment. RESULTS Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2–3 three yoga sessions, and 58% completed at least 5 sessions. Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow‐up compared with patients in the wait‐list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P &lt; 0.004). This included better subjective sleep quality ( P &lt; 0.02), faster sleep latency ( P &lt; 0.01), longer sleep duration ( P &lt; 0.03), and less use of sleep medications ( P &lt; 0.02). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance, state anxiety, depression, or fatigue. CONCLUSIONS The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep‐related outcomes. However, there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes.

Several validated questionnaires have been developed to assess sleep, but these tools are lengthy to administer and may be impractical for epidemiologic studies. We examined whether a 3-item sleep questionnaire, similar to those typically used in epidemiologic studies, closely corresponded with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy monitoring.Methods: Eligible participants were Western Australian women aged 18 to 80 years. Participants completed a sleep questionnaire, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 nights, and completed a brief daily sleep log. Objective actigraphy measurements for 56 participants were summarized by mean and mode and compared with the subjective reports, using weighted kappa and delta.Results: Data collected from the questionnaire showed poor agreement with objectively measured sleep, with kappas ranging from −0.19 to 0.14.Conclusions: Our results indicate that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy. The findings have implications for studies that have used such sleep questions.

At the cellular level, during SWS, a slow oscillation (&lt;1 Hz) synchronizes firing patterns in large neuronal populations and is reflected on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as large-amplitude, low-frequency waves. By using simultaneous EEG and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we characterized the transient changes in brain activity consistently associated with slow waves (&gt;140 μV) and delta waves (75–140 μV) during SWS in 14 non-sleep-deprived normal human volunteers. Significant increases in activity were associated with these waves in several cortical areas, including the inferior frontal, medial prefrontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate areas. Compared with baseline activity, slow waves are associated with significant activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and brainstem, whereas delta waves are related to frontal responses. No decrease in activity was observed. This study demonstrates that SWS is not a state of brain quiescence, but rather is an active state during which brain activity is consistently synchronized to the slow oscillation in specific cerebral regions. The partial overlap between the response pattern related to SWS waves and the waking default mode network is consistent with the fascinating hypothesis that brain responses synchronized by the slow oscillation restore microwake-like activity patterns that facilitate neuronal interactions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0801819105", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2161937485", "source": "openalex"}

The development of clinical strategies for screening and managing depression in patients with SRBD requires elucidation of the association between the 2 conditions. This population-based epidemiological study assesses SRBD as a longitudinal predictor of depression. <h3>Methods</h3> Men (n = 788) and women (n = 620) randomly selected from a working population were evaluated for SRBD by in-laboratory polysomnography and for depression by the Zung depression scale. Results of multiple studies, performed at 4-year intervals, were available for most participants. Sleep-related breathing disorder was characterized by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; events per hour) categories: AHI = 0, no SRBD; 0&lt;AHI&lt;5, minimal SRBD; 5≤AHI&lt;15, mild SRBD; and AHI≥15, moderate or worse SRBD. Depression was defined as a score of 50 or higher on the Zung scale or use of antidepressants. Potential confounding, interacting, and mediating factors were assessed by clinical measurements and questionnaires. <h3>Results</h3> In purely longitudinal models, an increase of 1 SRBD category (eg, from minimal to mild SRBD) was associated with a 1.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.6) increased adjusted odds for development of depression. In adjusted models combining longitudinal and cross-sectional associations, compared with participants with no SRBD, the odds for development of depression were increased by 1.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) in participants with minimal SRBD, by 2.0-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.9) in participants with mild SRBD, and by 2.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.7-3.9) in those with moderate or worse SRBD. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our longitudinal findings of a dose-response association between SRBD and depression provide evidence consistent with a causal link between these conditions and should heighten clinical suspicion of depression in patients with SRBD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.166.16.1709", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115476973", "source": "openalex"}

Although in the past sleep has been considered a state of quiet, experimental and clinical evidences suggest a noteworthy activation of different biological systems during sleep. A key role is played by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), whose modulation regulates cardiovascular functions during sleep onset and different sleep stages. Therefore, an interest on the evaluation of autonomic cardiovascular control in health and disease is growing by means of linear and non linear heart rate variability (HRV) analyses. The application of classical tools for ANS analysis, such as HRV during physiological sleep, showed that the rapid eye movement (REM) stage is characterized by a likely sympathetic predominance associated with a vagal withdrawal, while the opposite trend is observed during non-REM sleep. More recently, the use of non linear tools, such as entropy-derived indices, have provided new insight on the cardiac autonomic regulation, revealing for instance changes in the cardiovascular complexity during REM sleep, supporting the hypothesis of a reduced capability of the cardiovascular system to deal with stress challenges. Interestingly, different HRV tools have been applied to characterize autonomic cardiac control in different pathological conditions, from neurological sleep disorders to sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In summary, linear and non linear analysis of HRV are reliable approaches to assess changes of autonomic cardiac modulation during sleep both in health and diseases. The use of these tools could provide important information of clinical and prognostic relevance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2013.00294", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969770478", "source": "openalex"}

Assessment of daytime sleep propensity under baseline conditions and following experimental disruption of SWS. Healthy young (20–30 y, n = 44), middle-aged (40–55 y, n = 35) and older (66–83 y, n = 31) men and women, completed a 2-way parallel group study. After an 8-h baseline sleep episode, subjects were randomized to 2 nights with selective SWS disruption by acoustic stimuli, or without disruption, followed by 1 recovery night. Objective and subjective sleep propensity were assessed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). During baseline sleep, SWS decreased (P < 0.001) and the number of awakenings increased (P < 0.001) across the 3 age groups. During the baseline day, MSLT values increased across the three age groups (P < 0.0001) with mean values of 8.7min (SD: 4.5), 11.7 (5.1) and 14.2 (4.1) in the young, middle-aged, and older adults, respectively. KSS values were 3.7 (1.0), 3.2 (0.9), and 3.4 (0.6) (age-group: P = 0.031). Two nights of SWS disruption led to a reduction in MSLT and increase in KSS in all 3 age groups (SWS disruption vs. control: P < 0.05 in all cases). Healthy aging is associated with a reduction in daytime sleep propensity, sleep continuity, and SWS. In contrast, experimental disruption of SWS leads to an increase in daytime sleep propensity. The age-related decline in SWS and reduction in daytime sleep propensity may reflect a lessening in homeostatic sleep requirement.

To describe infant sleep patterns and investigate relationships between infant sleep problems and maternal well-being in the community setting. Design. Cross-sectional community survey. Setting. Maternal and Child Health Centers in 3 middle-class local government areas in Melbourne, Australia. Participants. Mothers of infants 6 to 12 months of age. Main Outcome Measures. Maternal well-being (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and infant sleep problems (standardized maternal questionnaire). Results. The survey was completed by 738 mothers (94% response rate), of whom 46% reported their infant's sleep as a problem. In the univariate analyses, sleep patterns characterizing a sleep problem included the infant sleeping in the parent's bed, being nursed to sleep, taking longer to fall asleep, waking more often and for longer periods overnight, and taking shorter naps. The same sleep patterns were associated with high depression scores and tended to increase as depression scores increased. Because of positive skew, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score was analyzed in 3 categories (&amp;lt;10, 10–12, and &amp;gt;12) using validated cutoff scores from community and clinical studies. Fifteen percent of mothers scored above 12 on the depression scale, indicating probable clinical depression, and 18% scored between 10 and 12, indicating possible clinical depression. After adjusting for potential confounders and factors significant in the univariate analyses, maternal report of an infant sleep problem remained a significant predictor of a depression score &amp;gt;12 (odds ratio: 2.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.27,3.56) and &amp;gt;10 (odds ratio: 2.88; 95% confidence interval: 1.93,4.31). However, mothers reporting good sleep quality, despite an infant sleep problem, were not more likely to suffer depression. Conclusions. Maternal report of infant sleep problems and depression symptoms are common in middle-class Australian communities. There is a strong association between the 2, even when known depression risk factors are taken into account. Maternal report of good sleep quality attenuates this relationship. Appropriate anticipatory guidance addressing infant sleep could potentially decrease maternal report of depressive symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.107.6.1317", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140293749", "source": "openalex"}

Using data of the Survey of Mid-Life in the United States (MIDUS), we investigated whether duration and quality of sleep, assessed by actigraphy, were related to subjective well-being and whether this relationship was mediated by subjective sleep quality. Three hundred and thirteen mainly white American individuals from the general population and 128 urban-dwelling African American individuals between 35 and 85 years of age were studied cross-sectionally. Sleep duration, variability of sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and time awake after sleep onset were assessed by actigraphy over a period of 7 days. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, positive psychological well-being and symptoms of psychological distress were assessed with the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. In both white and African Americans high day-to-day variability in sleep duration was related to lower levels of subjective well-being controlling age, gender, educational and marital status, and BMI. By contrast, sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and time awake after sleep onset were not related to subjective well-being controlling covariates and other sleep variables. Moreover, the relationship between variability in sleep duration and well-being was partially mediated by subjective sleep quality. The findings show that great day-to-day variability in sleep duration – more than average sleep duration – is related to poor subjective sleep quality and poor subjective well-being.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071292", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030341972", "source": "openalex"}

Quiescent cells of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms can survive for long periods without nutrients. This alternative state of cells is still poorly understood, yet much benefit is to be gained by understanding it both scientifically and with reference to human health. Here, we review our knowledge of one “model” quiescent cell population, in cultures of yeast grown to stationary phase in rich media. We outline the importance of understanding quiescence, summarize the properties of quiescent yeast cells, and clarify some definitions of the state. We propose that the processes by which a cell enters into, maintains viability in, and exits from quiescence are best viewed as an environmentally triggered cycle: the cell quiescence cycle. We synthesize what is known about the mechanisms by which yeast cells enter into quiescence, including the possible roles of the protein kinase A, TOR, protein kinase C, and Snf1p pathways. We also discuss selected mechanisms by which quiescent cells maintain viability, including metabolism, protein modification, and redox homeostasis.

In rodents they occur in association with sharp waves and are grouped by the cortical slow oscillation such that, in parallel with sleep spindles, ripple activity is suppressed during the hyperpolarized down-state and enhanced during the depolarized up-state. The temporal coupling between slow oscillations, spindles and ripples has been suggested to serve a hippocampo-neocortical dialogue underlying memory consolidation during sleep. Here, we examined whether a similar coupling exists between these oscillatory phenomena in humans. In sleep recordings from seven epileptic patients, scalp-recorded slow oscillations and spindles as well as parahippocampal ripples recorded from foramen ovale electrodes were identified by automatic algorithms. Additionally, ripple and spindle root mean square activity was determined for relevant frequency bands. Ripple density was higher during Non-REM than REM sleep (P < 0.001). Ripple activity distinctly decreased time-locked to slow oscillation negative half-waves in the three patients without temporal structural alterations (P < 0.001), whereas in the four patients with severe mesiotemporal structural alterations this coupling was obscure. Generally, in the patients ripple activity was increased before spindle peaks and distinctly decreased after the peak (P < 0.001). Ripples were consistently associated with interictal spikes suggesting that spike–ripple complexes represent an epileptic transformation of sharp wave–ripple complexes in the epileptic hippocampus. Our findings are consistent with the notion of a hippocampo-to-neocortical information transfer during sleep that is linked to coordinate ripple and spindle activity, and that in the intact temporal lobe is synchronized to cortical slow oscillations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awm146", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2131436025", "source": "openalex"}

Both nocturnal hypoxemia and impairment of daytime vigilance have been suggested as the pathogenesis of these deficits, yet it remains difficult to find good correlations between cognitive deficits and either of these physiological parameters. In the present study, 10 normal controls were compared to 10 moderately and 10 severely apneic patients, all recorded in a sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights, with a vigilance and neuropsychological assessment made during the intervening day. Relative to the controls, moderate and severe OSAS showed differences in many cognitive functions, although the severely affected showed the greater differences. Moreover, severe apneics were also worse than moderate apneics on tests that were found to be normal in the latter group. This suggests a discontinuity in the appearance of neuropsychological deficits as OSAS progresses. Further analyses revealed that reductions in general intellectual measures, as well as in executive and psychomotor tasks were all attributable to the severity of hypoxemia, while other attention and memory deficits were related to vigilance impairment. Therefore, both vigilance impairment and nocturnal hypoxemia may differentially contribute to the cognitive dysfunctions found in OSAS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01688639108405110", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019546014", "source": "openalex"}

Hypoxic ventilatory responses (HVR) were measured during progressive isocapnic hypoxia, and hypercapnic ventilatory responses (HCVR) were measured using a rebreathing technique. Measures of resting ventilation, i.e., minute ventilation, tidal volume, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal gas concentrations, did not change with short-term sleep deprivation.

Evidence-based, spatially explicit estimates of population at risk are needed to inform planning and implementation of field interventions, monitor disease trends, raise awareness and support advocacy. Comprehensive, geo-referenced epidemiological records from HAT-affected countries were combined with human population layers to map five categories of risk, ranging from “very high” to “very low,” and to estimate the corresponding at-risk population. Results Approximately 70 million people distributed over a surface of 1.55 million km2 are estimated to be at different levels of risk of contracting HAT. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for 82.2% of the population at risk, the remaining 17.8% being at risk of infection from T. b. rhodesiense. Twenty-one million people live in areas classified as moderate to very high risk, where more than 1 HAT case per 10,000 inhabitants per annum is reported. Discussion Updated estimates of the population at risk of sleeping sickness were made, based on quantitative information on the reported cases and the geographic distribution of human population. Due to substantial methodological differences, it is not possible to make direct comparisons with previous figures for at-risk population. By contrast, it will be possible to explore trends in the future. The presented maps of different HAT risk levels will help to develop site-specific strategies for control and surveillance, and to monitor progress achieved by ongoing efforts aimed at the elimination of sleeping sickness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001859", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126295663", "source": "openalex"}

Four electronic databases were searched in December 2018 for articles published in the previous 10 years. Fourteen health outcomes were examined. A total of 41 articles, including 92 340 unique participants from 14 countries, met inclusion criteria. Sleep was assessed objectively in 37% of studies and subjectively in 63% of studies. Findings suggest that later sleep timing and greater sleep variability were generally associated with adverse health outcomes. However, because most studies reported linear associations, it was not possible to identify thresholds for “late sleep timing” or “large sleep variability”. In addition, social jetlag was associated with adverse health outcomes, while weekend catch-up sleep was associated with better health outcomes. The quality of evidence ranged from “very low” to “moderate” across study designs and health outcomes using GRADE. In conclusion, the available evidence supports that earlier sleep timing and regularity in sleep patterns with consistent bedtimes and wake-up times are favourably associated with health.

A key transcription factor in the transcriptional/translational feedback loop of mammalian circadian genes is BMAL1/Mop3, a heterodimeric partner to CLOCK. It was previously shown that mice deficient in the BMAL1/Mop3 gene become immediately arrhythmic in constant darkness and have reduced locomotor activity levels under entrained and constant conditions. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mammalian BMAL1/Mop3 gene would have regulatory effects on sleep-wake patterns. In mice with targeted deletion of the BMAL1/Mop3 gene, EEG/EMG sleep-wake patterns were recorded under entrained and free-running conditions as well as following acute (6-hrs) sleep deprivation. Mice homozygous for the BMAL1/Mop3 deletion showed an attenuated rhythm of sleep and wakefulness distribution across the 24-hr period. In addition, these mice showed increases in total sleep time, sleep fragmentation and EEG delta power under baseline conditions, and an attenuated compensatory response to acute sleep deprivation. These new data strengthen the hypothesis that molecular components of the circadian system play a central role in the generation of sleep and wakefulness beyond just the timing of these behavioral vigilance states.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/28.4.395", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155402067", "source": "openalex"}

This guideline provides otolaryngologists with evidence‐based recommendations for using polysomnography in assessing children, aged 2 to 18 years, with sleep‐disordered breathing and are candidates for tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy. Polysomnography is the electrographic recording of simultaneous physiologic variables during sleep and is currently considered the gold standard for objectively assessing sleep disorders. Purpose. There is no current consensus or guideline on when children 2 to 18 years of age, who are candidates for tonsillectomy, are recommended to have polysomnography. The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve referral patterns for polysomnography among these patients. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of anesthesiology, pulmonology medicine, otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine. Results. The committee made the following recommendations: (1) before determining the need for tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with sleep‐disordered breathing for polysomnography if they exhibit certain complex medical conditions such as obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (2) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for sleep‐disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in statement 1 for whom the need for surgery is uncertain or when there is discordance between tonsillar size on physical examination and the reported severity of sleep‐disordered breathing. (3) Clinicians should communicate polysomnography results to the anesthesiologist prior to the induction of anesthesia for tonsillectomy in a child with sleep‐disordered breathing. (4) Clinicians should admit children with obstructive sleep apnea documented on polysomnography for inpatient, overnight monitoring after tonsillectomy if they are younger than age 3 or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea‐hypopnea index of 10 or more obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir less than 80%, or both). (5) In children for whom polysomnography is indicated to assess sleep‐disordered breathing prior to tonsillectomy, clinicians should obtain laboratory‐based polysomnography, when available.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599811409837", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171751225", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W49430721", "title": "Respiratory Arousal From Sleep: Mechanisms and Significance", "text": "The mechanisms by which respiratory stimuli induce arousal from sleep and the clinical significance of these arousals have been explored by numerous studies in the last two decades. Evidence to date suggests that the arousal stimulus in nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) is related to the level of inspiratory effort rather than the individual stimuli that contribute to ventilatory drive. A component of the arousal stimulus proportional to the level of inspiratory effort may originate in mechanoreceptors either in the upper airway or respiratory pump. Medullary centers responsible for ventilatory drive may also send a signal proportionate to the level of drive to higher centers in the brain which are responsible for arousal. Thus, the arousal stimulus may consist of multiple components, each increasing as inspiratory effort increases. The level of effort triggering arousal is an index of the arousability of the brain (arousal threshold). A deeper stage of sleep, central nervous system depressants, prior sleep fragmentation, and the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been observed to increase the arousal threshold to airway occlusion. Less information is available concerning the mechanisms of arousal from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. While REM sleep is associated with the longest obstructive apneas in patients with OSA, normal human subjects appear to have a similar or lower arousal threshold to respiratory stimuli in REM compared to NREM sleep. Recent studies have challenged the assumption that the termination of all obstructive apnea is dependent on arousal from sleep. Improvements in methods to detect and quantitate changes in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) may better define the relationship between arousal and apnea termination. This may result in improved criteria for identifying EEG changes of clinical significance. While little is known concerning the mechanisms of arousal in central sleep apnea, arousal may play an important role in inducing this type of apnea in some patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.8.654", "url": "https://openalex.org/W49430721", "source": "openalex"}

To examine sleep patterns, it is advisable to utilize valid subjective and objective measures. Laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) is deemed the gold standard to measure sleep objectively, but is impractical for long-term and home utilization (e.g. resource-demanding, difficult to use). Hence, alternative devices have been developed. This study aimed to review the literature systematically, providing an overview of available objective sleep measures in non-laboratory settings as an alternative to PSG. To identify relevant articles, a specific search strategy was run in EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Compendex (Engineering Village 2). In addition, reference lists of retrieved articles were screened and experts within this research field were contacted. Two researchers, using specified in/exclusion criteria, screened identified citations independently in three stages: on title, abstract and full text. Data from included articles were extracted and inserted into summarizing tables outlining the results. Of the 2217 electronically identified citations, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. Additional searches revealed eight papers. Psychometric characteristics of nine different objective measures of sleep pattern alternatives to PSG [(bed) actigraphy, observation, bed sensors, eyelid movement- and non-invasive arm sensors, a sleep switch and a remote device] were evaluated. Actigraphy is used widely and has been validated in several populations. Alternative devices to measure sleep patterns are becoming available, but most remain at prototype stage and are validated insufficiently. Future research should concentrate on the development and further validation of non-invasive, inexpensive and user-friendly sleep measures for non-laboratory settings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2009.00814.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1490882700", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2020287085", "title": "Biochemical regulation of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep", "text": "The concept, that sleep regulatory substances (sleep factors) exist, stems from classical endocrinology and is supported by positive transfer experiments in which tissue fluids obtained from sleepy or sleeping animals elicited sleep when injected into recipient animals. The transfer experiments concluded with the identification of four sleep factors: delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP), uridine, oxidized glutathione, and a muramyl peptide. A physiological sleep regulatory role, however, has not been determined for these substances. In contrast, transfer experiments did not play a part in the development of the strong experimental evidence that implicated the currently known sleep factors in sleep regulation. These substances include adenosine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), interleukin-1 (IL1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). They promote non-REMS in various species, inhibition of their action or endogenous production results in loss of spontaneous sleep, and their synthesis and/or release display variations correlating with sleep-wake activity. Although the source of these substances vary they all enhance sleep by acting in the basal forebrain/anterior hypothalamus – preoptic region. It is also characteristic of these substances that they interact in multiple ways often resulting in mutual stimulation or potentiation of each other. Finally, there is a third group of substances whose significance in sleep regulation is less clear but for which there are two or more lines of evidence suggesting that they may have a role in modulating non-REM sleep (NREMS). This group includes oleamide, cortistatin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin, and nitric oxide (NO). More sleep regulatory substances are likely to be discovered in the future although it is a long and difficult process requiring multiple laboratories to generate sufficient convincing data to implicate any one of them in sleep regulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2741/1033", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020287085", "source": "openalex"}

The amount, distribution, and fragmentation of the behavioral states wakefulness (W), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS), as well as EEG delta power in SWS, were determined and compared among strains and between baseline and recovery from a 6-hour sleep deprivation (SD) starting at lights-on. In baseline, the most striking strain differences concerned sleep amount, the onset and duration of the main rest period, and SWS fragmentation. The time course of delta power in SWS during the main rest period was similar between strains. Immediately following the SD, high delta power values were reached (higher for AK than for 129). However, the relative increase in delta power, compared to the first 6 hours of the baseline rest period, was not strain-specific. Over the first 6 hours of recovery, W was decreased and PS increased in AK, B6, BR, and 129. In C and D2, time spent in any of the states was not affected by the SD. In contrast, in the recovery dark period, SWS and PS were invariably increased. In recovery, SWS fragmentation was strongly reduced for D2, resulting in the disappearance of the strain differences observed in baseline. Since these inbred strains are fully homozygous and thus can be considered genetic clones, the sleep-related strain differences reported here can be attributed to differences in genotype. Therefore, this study provides a basis for the identification of genetic factors underlying sleep and its regulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/22.2.155", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1725142253", "source": "openalex"}

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces blood pressure, but adherence is often suboptimal, and the benefit beyond management of conventional risk factors is uncertain. Since intermittent hypoxemia may underlie cardiovascular sequelae of sleep apnea, we evaluated the effects of nocturnal supplemental oxygen and CPAP on markers of cardiovascular risk.We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in which patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited from cardiology practices. Patients were screened for obstructive sleep apnea with the use of the Berlin questionnaire, and home sleep testing was used to establish the diagnosis. Participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 to 50 events per hour were randomly assigned to receive education on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle alone (the control group) or, in addition to education, either CPAP or nocturnal supplemental oxygen. Cardiovascular risk was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of the study treatment. The primary outcome was 24-hour mean arterial pressure.Of 318 patients who underwent randomization, 281 (88%) could be evaluated for ambulatory blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up. On average, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure at 12 weeks was lower in the group receiving CPAP than in the control group (-2.4 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to -0.1; P=0.04) or the group receiving supplemental oxygen (-2.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.1 to -0.5; P=0.02).

This finding, prominent in middle-aged depressed patients, has led to an examination of the ratio between the first and second non—rapid eye movement periods. This delta sleep measure seems to be a more robust predictor of recurrence than rapid eye movement latency. Analysis of data on 74 patients in a long-term maintenance treatment study for a minimum of 24 months demonstrates that the delta sleep ratio can predict survival time following discontinuation of drug treatment.

Compliance with this relatively obtrusive therapy has not been well studied. METHODS--Usage of CPAP was investigated in 54 patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (median 36 (range 7-129) apnoeas + hypopnoeas/hour slept) over the first 1-3 months after starting CPAP therapy. In all cases CPAP usage was monitored by hidden time clocks that indicated for how long the machines were switched on--that is, the CPAP run time. In 32 patients the time at which the CPAP mask pressure was at the therapeutic level of CPAP pressure set for that patient--that is, the mask time--was also monitored. In all patients objective daytime sleepiness was assessed by multiple sleep latency before and after CPAP therapy. RESULTS--The mean (SE) nightly CPAP run time was 4.7 (0.4) hours. There was no correlation between run time and severity of the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome as assessed by apnoea + hypopnoea frequency or multiple sleep latency, and no correlation between CPAP usage and improvement in multiple sleep latency. Thirty two patients in whom mask time was recorded had therapeutic CPAP pressures for 89% (3%) of their CPAP run times. Patients who experienced side effects from CPAP used their CPAP machines significantly less than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS--Patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome used CPAP for less than five hours/night on average with no correlation between severity of sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome and CPAP usage.

To evaluate the clinical presentation and polysomnography of prepubertal children with repetitive sleep terrors and sleepwalking, to compare them with a control group, and to evaluate the treatment of associated sleep disorders. Methods. Patients with complaint of sleep terrors with or without sleepwalking were studied retrospectively. A control group was also recruited. Each subject received a standardized evaluation, which included the following: 1) Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire; 2) interview regarding child’s medical and sociofamilial history, orthodontic history, schooling, psychological difficulties, medication intake, and family history of medical and sleep disorders; 3) general pediatric physical examination and neurologic, otolaryngological, and craniofacial examination by a specialist; 4) obtaining medical history on variables relevant to early life sleep disorders; 5) polysomnography, which included electroencephalogram (EEG; C3/A2, Fp1/T1, T1/O1, O1/C3, C4/A1, Fp2/T2, T2/O2, O2/C4), chin and leg electromyelogram, right and left electro-oculogram, and electrocardiogram (modified V2 lead); respiration was monitored with a nasal cannula/pressure transducer system, mouth thermistor, chest and abdominal bands, pulse oximeter, and neck microphone; respiratory effort was monitored with calibrated esophageal manometry; variables were collected on a computerized sleep system; and 6) available family members with a positive history of sleep terrors and sleepwalking received clinical evaluations similar to those used for index cases; they also underwent ambulatory monitoring with an Edentrace system, which monitors heart rate, body position, oro-nasal flow, chest impedance, breathing noises (neck microphone), and pulse oximetry. Movements are deduced from artifact, and leg movements may be recorded on one channel if the equipment is preset for such recording. Subjects used logs to record “lights out” time, “lights on” time, nocturnal awakenings, and other events that occurred during the night. All original and follow-up recordings were rescored by 2 of 4 randomly selected specialists who were blind to subject identity. Mann-Whitney U test was used for group comparison. Nonparametric χ2 test was used to compare percentages of symptoms in symptomatic children versus control children. Results. Eighty-four children (5 with sleep terrors and 79 with both sleep terrors and sleepwalking) and 36 normal control children formed the studied population. All subjects were Tanner stage 1 (prepubertal). None of the control children had any parasomnias. Fifty-one (61%) of 84 children with parasomnia had a diagnosis of an additional sleep disorder: 49 with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and 2 with restless leg syndrome (RLS). Twenty-nine of the children with both parasomnia and SDB had a positive family history of parasomnias, and 24 of the 29 also had a positive family history of SDB. Of the 51 children with associated sleep disorders, 45 were treated. Forty-three of 49 children with SDB were treated with tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and/or turbinate revision, and 2 of 2 children with RLS were treated with Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, at bedtime. Treatment of the precipitating sleep disorder eliminated parasomnias in all 45 children. In all 43 children who received surgery, polysomnography performed 3 to 4 months later indicated the disappearance of SDB. The recordings also showed an absence of confusional arousals. The number of EEG arousals significantly decreased from a mean of 9 ± 2.6 EEG arousals ≥3 seconds/hour during total sleep time to 3 ± 1.5. The number of EEG arousals ≥3 seconds during the first sleep cycle of slow wave sleep (stage 3–4 non–rapid eye movement sleep) decreased from 4 ± 1.4 to 1 ± 0.2. In all surgically treated cases, parents also reported subsequent absence of the parasomnia. The 2 symptomatic children who were treated with Pramipexole had a complete absence of confusional arousals on the follow-up recording and reported no parasomnia since treatment. The periodic limb movement syndrome arousal index (number of EEG arousals associated with periodic limb movement/hour) decreased from 11 and 16 to 0 and 0.2, respectively. Parasomnia persisted in the 6 children who were untreated for SDB. Surgeons had refused to perform surgery on these children because of lack of data on the relationship between parasomnia and SDB-related tonsil and adenoid enlargement. Conclusion. Children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive polysomnographies, discrete patterns (eg, nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high θ or slow α EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children’s respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula/pressure transducer system and/or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement. It remains to be investigated whether a genetic factor directly influences sleep terror and sleepwalking or instead influences other disorders that fragment sleep and lead to confusional arousals. Additional studies are needed to investigate the association between SDB and non–rapid eye movement parasomnias in the general population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.111.1.e17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105059392", "source": "openalex"}

RESULTS: Frequent nightmares were found exclusively in subjects diagnosed with current PTSD at the time of the survey (15.0%). In the sample of veterans who served in Vietnam (N=1,167), combat exposure was strongly correlated with frequency of nightmares, moderately correlated with sleep onset insomnia, and weakly correlated with disrupted sleep maintenance. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that in Vietnam theater veterans, 57% of the variance in the frequency of nightmares was accounted for by war zone exposure and non-sleep-related PTSD symptoms. Alcohol abuse, chronic medical illnesses, panic disorder, major depression, and mania did not predict the frequency of nightmares after control for nonsleep PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent nightmares appear to be virtually specific for PTSD. The nightmare is the domain of sleep disturbance most related to exposure to war zone traumatic stress.

We, therefore, conducted a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study of the effects of 4 wk of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or oral placebo on 24-h blood pressure in 68 patients (55 males, 13 females; median apnea–hypopnea index [AHI], 35) not receiving hypotensive medication. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded for the last 48 h of each treatment. Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) were also recorded. All patients were normotensive. There was a small decrease in 24-h diastolic blood pressure (placebo, 79.2 [SE 0.9] mm Hg; CPAP, 77.8 [SE 1.0] mm Hg; p = 0.04) with the greatest fall occurring between 2:00 a.m. and 9:59 a.m. The observed decrease in 24-h diastolic blood pressure was greater in two a priori groups, CPAP use ⩾ 3.5 h per night (81.5 [SE 1.2] mm Hg; 79.6 [SE 1.2] mm Hg; p = 0.03) and those with more than twenty 4% desaturations per hour (82.4 [SE 2.1] mm Hg; 77.4 [SE 2.1] mm Hg; p = 0.002). Systolic pressure also fell in the latter group (133.1 [SE 2.8] mm Hg; 129.1 [SE 2.1] mm Hg; p = 0.009). Desaturation frequency was the best predictor of diastolic blood pressure fall with CPAP (r = 0.38; p = 0.002). Both ESS and FOSQ domains improved. Thus, CPAP can reduce blood pressure in patients with SAHS, particularly in those with nocturnal oxygen desaturation, but the decrease is small.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.163.2.2005037", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994381724", "source": "openalex"}

One hundred forty nine consecutive PD patients attending the Movement Disorders Clinic of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India and 115 age‐matched healthy controls participated. After clinical evaluation, sleep assessment was done using a 23‐question, validated sleep questionnaire. Mean age of PD patients and the duration of illness were 58.37 (S.D. 10.45) years and 5.7 (S.D. 3.85) years, respectively. The mean age of the controls was 56.50 (S.D. 11.45) years ( P &gt; 0.05). Sleep problems were seen in 63 (42%) PD patients compared to 12% of controls. These were: insomnia in 32%, nightmares in 32%, and excessive day time sleepiness in 15% of PD patients as compared with 5%, 5% and 6%, respectively, in controls ( P &lt; 0.025). Presence of nightmares was significantly associated with higher Hoehn and Yahr score ( P &lt; 0.002), high unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) Part I score ( P &lt; 0.000) and levodopa dose ( P &lt; 0 .025).

Objective: To test the utility of a diagnostic algorithm in conjunction with ambulatory CPAP titration in initial management of obstructive sleep apnea. Design: A randomized, controlled, open-label trial that compared standard PSG with ambulatory CPAP titration in high-risk patients identified by a diagnostic algorithm. Setting: A tertiary referral sleep disorders program in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Patients: 68 patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea–hypopnea index [AHI] >15 episodes/h) identified by sequential application of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, Sleep Apnea Clinical Score, and overnight oximetry. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to PSG or ambulatory titration by using a combination of auto-CPAP and overnight oximetry. They were observed for 3 months. Measurements: Apnea–hypopnea index on CPAP, ESS score, quality of life, and CPAP adherence. Results: The PSG and ambulatory groups had similar median BMI (38 kg/m2), age (55 years), ESS score (14 points), and respiratory disturbance index (31 episodes of respiratory disturbance/h). Each episode is determined by a computer algorithm based on analysis of oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry. After 3 months, there were no differences in the primary outcome, AHI on CPAP (median, 3.2 vs. 2.5; difference, 0.8/h [95% CI, −0.9 to 2.3]) (P = 0.31), between the PSG and ambulatory groups, or in the secondary outcomes, ESS score, Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index, and CPAP. Adherence to CPAP therapy was better in the ambulatory group than in the PSG group (median, 5.4 vs. 6.0; difference, −1.12 h/night [CI, −2.0 to 0.2]) (P = 0.021). Conclusions: In the initial management of patients with a high probability of obstructive sleep apnea, PSG confers no advantage over the ambulatory approach in terms of diagnosis and CPAP titration. The ambulatory approach may improve adherence to treatment. When access to PSG is inadequate, the ambulatory approach can be used to expedite management of patients most in need of treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-146-3-200702060-00004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130340796", "source": "openalex"}

In the present study, 17 patients with SAS were evaluated with various focused frontal lobe-related tests in comparison with 17 normal controls. Such tasks explored attention, short-term memory spans, learning abilities, planning and programming capacities, categorizing activities and verbal fluency. Patients were found to have a significantly decreased ability to initiate new mental processes and to inhibit automatic ones, in conjunction with a tendency for perseverative errors. They were also affected with deficits of verbal and visual learning abilities and had reduced memory spans. Such defects were further evaluated via logistic regression against two criteria of the severity of the disease: the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep and the level of nocturnal hypoxemia. Memory deficits were rather related to the former, whereas typical frontal lobe-related abnormalities seemed rather consistent with the latter.

Children with SDB had significantly lower mean scores on the Differential Ability Scales for General Conceptual Ability (similar to IQ) and for the Non‐verbal Cluster. On the neuropsychology assessment battery (NEPSY), children with SDB scored significantly lower than the control group on the attention/executive function domain and two subtests within that domain, one measuring visual attention and the other executive function. In addition, children with SDB scored significantly lower than the controls on one subtest from the NEPSY language domain: Phonological Processing. This subtest measures phonological awareness, a skill that is critical for learning to read. No differences in behavior, as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) or the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale, were found between the two groups. Using a novel algorithm to assess sleep pressure, we found that children with SDB were significantly sleepier than controls.

A simplified three-state system is used: Wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (R), and non-REM sleep (S). The system scores the sleep stages in standard 30-s epochs. A number of features associated with the epoch RR-intervals, an inductance plethysmography estimate of rib cage respiratory effort, and an electrocardiogram-derived respiration (EDR) signal were investigated. A subject-specific quadratic discriminant classifier was trained, randomly choosing 20% of the subject's epochs (in appropriate proportions of W, S and R) as the training data. The remaining 80% of epochs were presented to the classifier for testing. An estimated classification accuracy of 79% (Cohen's kappa value of 0.56) was achieved. When a similar subject-independent classifier was trained, using epochs from all other subjects as the training data, a drop in classification accuracy to 67% (kappa = 0.32) was observed. The subjects were further broken in groups of low apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) and high AHI and the experiments repeated. The subject-specific classifier performed better on subjects with low AHI than high AHI; the performance of the subject-independent classifier is not correlated with AHI. For comparison an electroencephalograms (EEGs)-based classifier was trained utilizing several standard EEG features. The subject-specific classifier yielded an accuracy of 87% (kappa = 0.75), and an accuracy of 84% (kappa = 0.68) was obtained for the subject-independent classifier, indicating that EEG features are quite robust across subjects. We conclude that the cardiorespiratory signals provide moderate sleep-staging accuracy, however, features exhibit significant subject dependence which presents potential limits to the use of these signals in a general subject-independent sleep staging system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2005.869773", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101709445", "source": "openalex"}

Children with diagnoses of sleep-disordered breathing were drawn from our database and sorted by age and initial symptoms. Clinical findings, based on interviews and questionnaires, an orocraniofacial scale, and nocturnal polygraphic recordings were tabulated and compared. If the results of the first polygraphic recording were inconclusive, a second night's recording was performed with the addition of Pes monitoring. In addition, simultaneous measurements of tcPCO2 and endtidal CO2 with sampling through a catheter were performed on this second night in 76 children. These 76 recordings were used as our gold standard, because they were the most comprehensive. For this group, 1848 apneic events and 7040 abnormal respiratory events were identified based on airflow, thoracoabdominal effort, and Pes recordings. We then analyzed the simultaneously measured tcPCO2 and expired CO2 levels to ascertain their ability to identify these same events.The first night of polygraphic recording was inconclusive enough to warrant a second recording in 316 of 411 children. Children were identified as having either UARS (n = 259), OSAS (n = 83), or other sleep disorders (n = 69). Children with small triangular chins, retroposition of the mandible, steep mandibular plane, high hard palate, long oval-shaped face, or long soft palate were highly likely to have sleep-disordered breathing of some type. If large tonsils were associated with these features, OSAS was much more frequently noted than UARS. In the 76 gold standard children, Pes, tcPCO2, and expired CO2 measurements were in agreement for 1512 of the 1848 apneas and hypopneas that were analyzed. Of the 7040 upper airway resistance events, only 2314 events were consonant in all three measures. tcPCO2 identified only 33% of the increased respiratory events identified by Pes; expired CO2 identified only 53% of the same events.UARS is a subtle form of sleep-disordered breathing that leads to significant clinical symptoms and day and nighttime disturbances. When clinical symptoms suggest abnormal breathing during sleep but obstructive sleep apneas are not found, physicians may, mistakenly, assume an absence of breathing-related sleep problems. Symptoms and orocraniofacial information were not useful in distinguishing UARS from OSAS but were useful in distinguishing sleep-disordered breathing (UARS and OSAS) from other sleep disorders. The analysis of esophageal pressure patterns during sleep was the most revealing of the three techniques used for recognizing abnormal breathing patterns during sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.98.5.871", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1765095761", "source": "openalex"}

In patients with sleep apnea hypopnea, sleep abnormalities consist of repetitive episodes of arousals and awakenings that lead to sleep fragmentation. Because the propensity for upper airway collapse is increased in these patients, we wondered if sleep fragmentation could increase upper airway collapsibility and contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In eight normal subjects, upper airway collapsibility was assessed during sleep by progressively decreasing the pressure in a nasal mask while recording airflow, mask, and esophageal pressures. The critical pressure was determined by the relationship between breath-by-breath values of maximal inspiratory airflow of each flow-limited inspiratory cycle and the corresponding mask pressure. Critical pressure was measured twice in each subject: after one night of total sleep deprivation and after one night of sleep fragmentation using auditory stimuli. The two measures were done in random order 1 wk apart. A polysomnographic recording was obtained the night after each measurement of critical pressure. Sleep architecture was identical after sleep deprivation and fragmentation. Sleep-related breathing abnormalities were more frequent after sleep fragmentation than after sleep deprivation. Critical pressure was -17.1 +/- 6.8 cm H2O (mean +/- SEM) after sleep deprivation, and -12.3 +/- 6.3 cm H2O after sleep fragmentation (p < 0.05), corresponding to an earlier closing of the upper airway.

These shifts have been shown to result in corresponding shifts in sleep phase (later sleep onset) and sleep deprivation among teenagers in Western societies. However, the effect of these developmental changes on the sleep habits of Korean teenagers has not been analyzed. This study aims to quantify age-related changes in sleep/wake patterns among Korean teenagers and elucidate cultural and other factors causing these changes.The School Sleep Habits Survey was administered in homeroom classes to students in grades 5 to 12 (mean age: 13.7 +/- 2.4 years) selected via a 2-way stratification sampling method. The survey included items regarding usual sleep/wake patterns over the previous 2 weeks as well as measures of daytime sleepiness, sleep/wake-problem behavior, depressed mood, and morningness/eveningness.A total of 1457 students (52.9% male) completed the survey. The higher the grade, the later bedtime was found to be on both school days and weekends. There was a similar relationship between increasing grade and earlier wake time on school days, but higher grades were associated with later wake time on weekends. Total sleep time decreased by approximately 3 hours on school nights and 1 hour on weekend nights from grades 5 to 12. Adolescents were severely sleep deprived, with mean school-night total sleep times of 6.02, 5.62, and 4.86 hours for 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders, respectively. In the higher grades, there was a greater discrepancy between school nights and weekends in terms of bedtime and wake time, and the magnitude of weekend oversleep increased. Older students also reported more daytime sleepiness, more sleep/wake-problem behavior, more depressed mood, and more eveningness preference. The chief reasons students cited for their sleep deprivation differed across grades: Academic demands and entertainment (such as Internet and television) were reported by 5th- and 6th-graders, entertainment and then academic demands by 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders, and early school start time and academic demands by 10th-, 11th- and 12th-graders.This study clearly demonstrates that Korean adolescents do not get adequate sleep and that they have profound discrepancies in their sleep/wake patterns between school and weekend nights. Compared with previous studies from other countries, Korean students display even greater sleep deprivation and also more irregular sleep/wake patterns. This study also demonstrates that academic demands/stress and early school start time are the most important contributing factors for sleep deprivation among Korean adolescents. These findings stress the need to promote awareness of the magnitude of adolescent sleep deprivation and its detrimental effects in Korean society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2004-0815g", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096912103", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty boys diagnosed as having ADHD (DSM-IV), aged between 5 and 10 years, and 22 age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. All children were medication-free and showed no clinical signs of sleep and alertness problems.No significant differences in sleep variables were found between boys with ADHD and controls. The mean latency period was shorter in children with ADHD. Significant differences were found for MSLT 1, 2 and 3 (p < .05). Mean reaction time was longer in children with ADHD, with significant differences in all tests (p < .05). Number and duration of sleep onsets measured by the MSLT correlated significantly with the hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattentive-passivity indices of the CTRS and CPRS.Children with ADHD were more sleepy during the day, as shown by the MSLT, and they had longer reaction times. These differences are not due to alteration in the quality of nocturnal sleep. The number of daytime sleep onsets and the rapidity of sleep-onsets measured as MSLT were found to be pertinent physiological indices to discriminate between ADHD subtypes. These results suggest that children with ADHD have a deficit in alertness.

MSLTs were conducted following nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and daily sleep diaries in 289 males and 267 females (age 35–70, 97% Caucasians). Multiple SOREMPs were observed in 13.1% of males and 5.6% of females.

Because of significant sex interactions, analyses were stratified by sex. Increased prevalence of HLA-DQB1*0602, a marker of narcolepsy, was observed in males but not in females with ≥2 SOREMPs. Males with multiple SOREMPs compared with those with no SOREMPs had shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency during NPSG, were sleepier on the MSLT and reported increased sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy-like symptoms, suggesting a narcolepsy-like phenotype. In males only, the occurrence of SOREMPs increased with shift work and some indirect markers of sleep restriction, such as shorter sleep a day before NPSG. SOREMPs were unrelated to age, body mass index, depression (Zung Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Scale) and the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep (AHI), but were associated with decreased mean lowest oxygen saturation in males. Finally, we found that both males and females with SOREMPs reported taking more antidepressants, but those were of the types known not to suppress REM sleep.

During each study period, emotional reactivity was investigated using the experience-sampling methodology by which residents received 3 phone calls at random times during their working day for 3 consecutive days. These calls reminded them to fill out brief questionnaires concerning change of circumstances over the previous 15 minutes and to rate their emotional response to these circumstances using the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales. Fatigue at those times was measured by a subscale of the Profile of Mood States.Multilevel regression analysis was used to determine the influence of sleep duration and sleep fragmentation on the emotional reactions to goal-disruptive and goal-enhancing daytime events. We found that sleep loss intensified negative emotions and fatigue following daytime disruptive events, while positive emotion was mitigated following goal-enhancing events. Sleep loss also resulted in an overall elevated baseline for positive emotion.Sleep loss amplifies the negative emotive effects of disruptive events while reducing the positive effect of goal-enhancing events. Methodologically, the study highlights the utility and advantages of event-level analysis as opposed to the current practice of random sampling of emotion states during waking hours, disregarding contextual factors associated with purposeful, goal-oriented behavior episodes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/28.1.47", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1937723051", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep was short (mean 5.5 h) between shifts, with little difference between day shift (5.7 h) and night shift (5.4 h). Sleepiness scores were low overall (3 on a 1–9 scale, with higher score indicating greater sleepiness), with 45% of nurses having high level of sleepiness (score > 7) on at least one shift. Nurses were progressively sleepier each shift, and night nurses were sleepier toward the end of the shift compared to the beginning.

Next, we compared the effect of MCH and NaCl intracerebroventricular (ICV) administrations on sleep stage quantities to further determine whether MCH neurons play an active role in PS regulation.

Athletic performance is reduced by a night or more without sleep, but the influence on performance of partial sleep restriction over 1–3 nights, a more real-world scenario, remains unclear. Studies investigating sleep in athletes often suffer from inadequate experimental control, a lack of females and questions concerning the validity of the chosen sleep assessment tools. Research only scratches the surface on how sleep influences athlete health. Studies in the wider population show that habitually sleeping &lt;7 hours/night increases susceptibility to respiratory infection. Fortunately, much is known about the salient risk factors for sleep inadequacy in athletes, enabling targeted interventions. For example, athlete sleep is influenced by sport-specific factors (relating to training, travel and competition) and non-sport factors (eg, female gender, stress and anxiety). This expert consensus culminates with a sleep toolbox for practitioners (eg, covering sleep education and screening) to mitigate these risk factors and optimise athlete sleep. A one-size-fits-all approach to athlete sleep recommendations (eg, 7–9 hours/night) is unlikely ideal for health and performance. We recommend an individualised approach that should consider the athlete’s perceived sleep needs. Research is needed into the benefits of napping and sleep extension (eg, banking sleep).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-102025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3095114374", "source": "openalex"}

Research Methods and Procedures: Anthropometric measurements, plasma lipid‐lipoprotein profile, plasma leptin concentrations, and total sleep duration were determined in a sample of 323 men and 417 women ages 21 to 64 years. Results: When compared with adults reporting 7 to 8 hours of sleep per day, the adjusted odds ratio for overweight/obesity was 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 2.10) for those with 9 to 10 hours of sleep and 1.69 (95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 2.39) for those with 5 to 6 hours of sleep, after adjustment for age, sex, and physical activity level. In each sex, we observed lower adiposity indices in the 7‐ to 8‐hour sleeping group than in the 5‐ to 6‐hour sleeping group. However, all of these significant differences disappeared after statistical adjustment for plasma leptin levels. Finally, the well‐documented regression of plasma leptin levels over body fat mass was used to predict leptin levels of short‐duration sleepers (5 and 6 hours of sleep), which were then compared with their measured values. As expected, the measured leptin values were significantly lower than predicted values. Discussion: There may be optimal sleeping hours at which body weight regulation is facilitated. Indeed, short sleep duration predicts an increased risk of being overweight/obese in adults and is related to a reduced circulating leptin level relative to what is predicted by fat mass. Because sleep duration is a potentially modifiable risk factor, these findings might have important clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of obesity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2007.512", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964615628", "source": "openalex"}

It has been suggested that behavioural or environmental factors, as well as sleep stage at awakening, may affect the severity of sleep inertia. In order to determine the time course of sleep inertia dissipation under normal entrained conditions, subjective alertness and cognitive throughput were measured during the first 4 h after habitual waketime from a full 8‐h sleep episode on 3 consecutive days. We investigated whether this time course was affected by either sleep stage at awakening or behavioural/environmental factors. Sleep inertia dissipated in an asymptotic manner and took 2–4 h to near the asymptote. Saturating exponential functions fitted the sleep inertia data well, with time constants of 0.67 h for subjective alertness and 1.17 h for cognitive performance. Most awakenings occurred out of stage rapid eye movement (REM), 2 or 1 sleep, and no effect of sleep stage at awakening on either the severity of sleep inertia or the time course of its dissipation could be detected. Subjective alertness and cognitive throughput were significantly impaired upon awakening regardless of whether subjects got out of bed, ate breakfast, showered and were exposed to ordinary indoor room light (≈150 lux) or whether subjects participated in a constant routine (CR) protocol in which they remained in bed, ate small hourly snacks and were exposed to very dim light (10–15 lux). These findings allow for the refinement of models of alertness and performance, and have important implications for the scheduling of work immediately upon awakening in many occupational settings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1999.00128.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170197371", "source": "openalex"}

The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. Seventy four studies predominately conducted between 2000 and 2015 were included in the review. A meta-analysis of surveys linking road, rail, and aircraft noise exposure to self-reports of sleep disturbance was conducted. The odds ratio for the percent highly sleep disturbed for a 10 dB increase in Lnight was significant for aircraft (1.94; 95% CI 1.61–2.3), road (2.13; 95% CI 1.82–2.48), and rail (3.06; 95% CI 2.38–3.93) noise when the question referred to noise, but non-significant for aircraft (1.17; 95% CI 0.54–2.53), road (1.09; 95% CI 0.94–1.27), and rail (1.27; 95% CI 0.89–1.81) noise when the question did not refer to noise.

Passive positive-pressure hyperventilation (PHV) was performed for 3 min awake and during nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep with hyperoxia [fractional inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) = 0.50], normoxia and hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.12). During wakefulness, no immediate posthyperventilation apnea was noted following abrupt cessation of PHV in 27 of 28 trials [mean hyperventilation end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) 29 +/- 2 Torr, range 22-35]. During spontaneous breathing in hyperoxia, PETCO2 rose from 40.4 +/- 0.7 Torr awake to 43.2 +/- 1.4 Torr during NREM sleep. PHV during NREM sleep caused apnea when PETCO2 was reduced to 3-6 Torr below NREM sleep levels and 1-2 Torr below the waking level. In hypoxia, PETCO2 increased from 37.1 +/- 0.1 awake to 39.8 +/- 0.1 Torr during NREM sleep. PHV caused apnea when PETCO2 was reduced to levels 1-2 Torr below NREM sleep levels and 1-2 Torr above awake levels. Apnea duration (5-45 s) was significantly correlated to the magnitude of hypocapnia (range 27-41 Torr). PHV caused no apnea when isocapnia was maintained via increased inspired CO2. Prolonged hypoxia caused periodic breathing, and the abrupt transition from short-term hypoxic-induced hyperventilation to acute hyperoxia caused apnea during NREM sleep when PETCO2 was lowered to or below the subject's apneic threshold as predetermined (passively) by PHV. We concluded that effective ventilatory rhythmogenesis in the absence of stimuli associated with wakefulness is critically dependent on chemoreceptor stimulation secondary to PCO2-[H+].", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1983.55.3.813", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2309925718", "source": "openalex"}

One area of controversy involves the use of a respiratory disturbance index to define various abnormalities, but apneas and hypopneas are not the only abnormalities obtained on polysomnograms, which can be diagnostic for sleep-disordered breathing. Adenotonsillectomy is often considered the treatment of choice for pediatric OSAS.

These rebounds usually have been accompanied by substantial rebounds of REM sleep. In contrast, chronic TSD (2 weeks or longer) by the disk-over-water (DOW) method has produced only huge, long-lasting rebounds of REM sleep with no rebound of high-amplitude NREM sleep. To evaluate whether the different rebounds result from different methods or from different lengths of deprivation, rats were subjected to 24-hour TSD by the DOW method. Rebounds included increases in high-amplitude and slow-wave activity; ie, the methods produced similar rebound patterns following short-term TSD. (Chronic TSD by continually enforced locomotion would be strategically difficult and severely confounded with motor fatigue.) Rats subjected to DOW-TSD for 4 days, well before the development of severe TSD symptoms, showed primarily REM sleep rebounds. Rats subjected to 1 day of selective REM sleep deprivation, but not their closely yoked control rats, showed large, significant REM sleep rebounds, which evidently were not induced by the stress of the deprivation method per se. The combined findings prompted reexamination of published evidence relevant to \"sleep intensity,\" including \"negative rebounds,\" rebounds in other species, the effects of stress and fatigue, depth of sleep indicators, and extended sleep.

It is traditionally performed by a sleep expert who assigns to each 30 s of the signal of a sleep stage, based on the visual inspection of signals such as electroencephalograms (EEGs), electrooculograms (EOGs), electrocardiograms, and electromyograms (EMGs). We introduce here the first deep learning approach for sleep stage classification that learns end-to-end without computing spectrograms or extracting handcrafted features, that exploits all multivariate and multimodal polysomnography (PSG) signals (EEG, EMG, and EOG), and that can exploit the temporal context of each 30-s window of data. For each modality, the first layer learns linear spatial filters that exploit the array of sensors to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and the last layer feeds the learnt representation to a softmax classifier. Our model is compared to alternative automatic approaches based on convolutional networks or decisions trees. Results obtained on 61 publicly available PSG records with up to 20 EEG channels demonstrate that our network architecture yields the state-of-the-art performance. Our study reveals a number of insights on the spatiotemporal distribution of the signal of interest: a good tradeoff for optimal classification performance measured with balanced accuracy is to use 6 EEG with 2 EOG (left and right) and 3 EMG chin channels. Also exploiting 1 min of data before and after each data segment offers the strongest improvement when a limited number of channels are available. As sleep experts, our system exploits the multivariate and multimodal nature of PSG signals in order to deliver the state-of-the-art classification performance with a small computational cost.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2018.2813138", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2963919481", "source": "openalex"}

Four of them developed bedrest-activity cycle period lengths very different from 24 hr (x = 36.8 hr) despite the persistence ofnear-24- hr oscillations in other physiologic functions, including that of body temperature (x = 24.6 hr). The percentage of sleep time spent in REM sleep varied significantly with the phase of that near-24-hr body temperature cycle. The peak in REM sleep propensity (RSP) occurred on the rising slope of the average body temperature curve, coincident with the phase of peak sleep tendency. This was associated with a significantly increased REM episode duration and shortened REM latency (including sleep-onset REM episodes), but without a significant change in the REM - NREM cycle length. We conclude that there is an endogenous circadian rhythm of REM sleep propensity which is closely coupled to the body temperature rhythm and is capable of free-running with a period different from both 24 hr and the average period of the sleep-wake cycle.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/2.3.329", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1214040260", "source": "openalex"}

However, their pathological origin is unknown. Here we show that patients with Huntington's disease (HD) have disrupted night-day activity patterns. This disruption was mirrored in a transgenic model of HD (R6/2 mice) in which daytime activity increased and nocturnal activity fell, eventually leading to the complete disintegration of circadian behavior. The behavioral disturbance was accompanied by marked disruption of expression of the circadian clock genes mPer2 and mBmal1 in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the principal circadian pacemaker in the brain. The circadian peak of expression of mPer2 was prematurely truncated, and the mRNA levels of mBmal1 were attenuated and failed to exhibit a significant circadian oscillation. Circadian cycles of gene expression in the motor cortex and striatum, markers of behavioral activation in wild-type mice, were also suppressed in the R6/2 mice, providing a neural correlate of the disturbed activity cycles. Increased daytime activity was also associated with reduced SCN expression of prokineticin 2 , a transcriptional target of mBmal1 encoding a neuropeptide that normally suppresses daytime activity in nocturnal mammals. Together, these molecular abnormalities could explain the pathophysiological changes in circadian behavior. We propose that circadian sleep disturbances are an important pathological feature of HD, that they arise from pathology within the SCN molecular oscillation, and that their treatment will bring appreciable benefits to HD patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3842-04.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126357344", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W194212139", "title": "Interrelations Between Sleep and the Somatotropic Axis", "text": "In the human as in other mammals, growth hormone (GH) is secreted as a series of pulses. In normal young adults, a major secretory episode occurs shortly after sleep onset, in temporal association with the first period of slow-wave (SW) sleep. In men, approximately 70% of the daily GH output occurs during early sleep throughout adulthood. In women, the contribution of sleep-dependent GH release to the daily output is lower and more variable. Studies involving shifts of the sleep-wake cycle have consistently shown that sleep-wake homeostasis is the primary determinant of the temporal organization of human GH release. Effects of circadian rhythmicity may occasionally be detected. During nocturnal sleep, the sleep-onset GH pulse is caused by a surge of hypothalamic GHRH release which coincides with a circadian-dependent period of relative somatostatin disinhibition. Extensive evidence indicates the existence of a consistent relationship between SW sleep and increased GH secretion and, conversely, between awakenings and decreased GH release. There is a linear relationship between amounts of SW sleep--whether measured by visual scoring or by delta activity--and amounts of concomitant GH secretion, although dissociations may occur, most likely because of variable levels of somatostatin inhibition. Pharmacological stimulation of SW sleep results in increased GH release, and compounds which increase SW sleep may therefore represent a novel class of GH secretagogues. During aging, SW sleep and GH secretion decrease with the same chronology, raising the possibility that the peripheral effects of the hyposomatotropism of the elderly may partially reflect age-related alterations in sleep-wake homeostasis. While the association between sleep and GH release has been well documented, there is also evidence indicating that components of the somatotropic axis are involved in regulating sleep. The studies are most consistent in indicating a role for GHRH in promoting NREM and/or SW sleep via central, rather than peripheral, mechanisms. A role for GH in sleep regulation is less well-documented but seems to involve REM, rather than NREM, sleep. It has been proposed that the stimulation of GH release and the promotion of NREM sleep by GHRH are two separate processes which involve GHRH neurons located in two distinct areas of the hypothalamus. Somatostatinergic control of GH release appears to be weaker during sleep than during wake, suggesting that somatostatinergic tone is lower in the hypothalamic area(s) involved in sleep regulation and sleep-related GH release than in the area controlling daytime GH secretion. While the concept of a dual control of daytime and sleep-related GH secretion remains to be directly demonstrated, it allows for the reconciliation of a number of experimental observations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/21.6.553", "url": "https://openalex.org/W194212139", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2118126199", "title": "Sleep epidemiology--a rapidly growing field", "text": "The human body has adapted to daily changes in dark and light such that it anticipates periods of sleep and activity. Deviations from this circadian rhythm come with functional consequences. Thus, 17 hours of sustained wakefulness in adults leads to a decrease in performance equivalent to a blood alcohol-level of 0.05%;[1] the legal level for drink driving in many countries.[2] Rats deprived of sleep die after 32 days,[3] and, with longer periods of sleep deprivation, this would also be the case in human beings. Indeed, sleep deprivation is a common form of torture.[4] Given the readily observable effects of sleep in everyday life, it is not surprising that there has been scholarly interest in sleep since the beginning of recorded history.[5] Sleep epidemiology as a subject in its own right has a recognisable history of just over 30 years,[6] with the first modern epidemiological studies of sleep disturbances appearing around 1980.[7;8] Nevertheless, a PubMed search for terms “sleep/insomnia” and “epidemiology” shows that the cumulative number of papers on the subject over the past 10 years is already about 10,000. Although this is less than for standard risk factors, such as obesity (>60,000) and smoking (50,000)(Figure 1), the annual number of papers on sleep epidemiology is rising rapidly (Figure 2). This issue of IJE includes a review[9] of the first comprehensive textbook of Sleep Epidemiology,[10] and the purpose of our Editorial is further to highlight recent developments to give the reader an idea why the coming years are likely to see an increasing interest in sleep studies. Figure 1 Exposures AND Epidemiology 2000–2010 Figure 2 Sleep/insomnia AND Epidemiology by year Why the upsurge in interest? There are several reasons for an increase in interest in sleep from an epidemiological perspective. First, sleep problems are associated with accidents and human errors. It has been estimated that 10–15% of fatal motor-vehicle crashes are due to sleepiness or driver fatigue. Furthermore, by 2020 the number of people killed in motor-vehicle crashes is expected to double to 2.3 million deaths worldwide, of which approximately 230,000–345,000 will be due to sleepiness or fatigue.[11] It has been estimated that nearly 100,000 deaths occur each year in US hospitals due to medical errors and sleep deprivation have been shown to make a significant contribution.[12] Similarly, in a national sample in Sweden of over 50,000 people interviewed over 20 years disturbed sleep almost doubled the risk of a fatal accident at work.[13] Second, sleep problems are common. Population studies show that sleep deprivation and disorders affect many more people worldwide than had been previously thought. A recent study found 20% of 25–45 year-olds slept “90 minutes less than they needed to be in good shape”.[14] Insomnia is the most common specific sleep disorder, with ‘some insomnia problems over the past year’ reported by approximately 30% of adults and chronic insomnia by approximately 10%.[15] Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea, characterized by respiratory difficulties during sleep, is also very high with estimates of 9–21% in women and 24–31% in men.[16;17] Third, sleep problems are likely to increase. The rapid advent of the 24/7 society involving round-the-clock activities and increasing night time use of TV, internet and mobile phones mean that adequate sleep durations may become increasingly compromised. Some data suggest a decline in sleep duration of up to 18 minutes per night over the past 30 years.[18;19] Complaints of sleeping problems have increased substantially over the same period, with short sleep (<6 hours/night) in full-time workers becoming more prevalent.[19;20] As more shift work is required to service 24/7 societies the proportion of workers exposed to circadian rhythm disorders, such as shift work sleep disorder, and their effects on health and performance is likely to rise. Sleep architecture is known to change with age; slow-wave (or deep) sleep decreases and lighter sleep increases. Other changes include increases in nocturnal sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. As the proportion of elderly people in populations across the world increases, these changing sleep patterns will raise the prevalence of sleep disorders. Similarly, the increasing worldwide obesity epidemic and the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea, which is over double among the obese, ensure sleep disorders will be of increasing public health importance in lower as well as high income countries.[16;21] Fourth, sleep problems are associated with short and long-term effects on health and well-being. Immediate effects at the individual level relate to well-being, performance, daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Longer term, evidence has accumulated of associations between sleep deprivation and sleep disorders and numerous health outcomes including premature mortality, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, inflammation, obesity, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, and psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. As this evidence represents the core of Sleep Epidemiology, we provide below a snapshot on key findings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyr203", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118126199", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this investigation was to help clarify this problem. Previously published data from several investigations were used to calculate the reference range of normal values for each test, defined by the mean+/-2 SD or by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The 'rule of thumb' that many people rely on to interpret MSLT results is shown here to be misleading. Previously published results from each test were also available for narcoleptic patients who were drug-free at the time and who by definition had EDS. This enabled the sensitivity and specificity of the three tests to be compared for the first time, in their ability to distinguish the EDS of narcolepsy from the daytime sleepiness of normal subjects. The receiver operator characteristic curves clearly showed that the ESS is the most discriminating test, the MWT is next best and the MSLT the least discriminating test of daytime sleepiness.

Methods: Sleep data were recorded using the ŌURA ring and standard PSG on a single laboratory overnight. Metrics were compared using Bland-Altman plots and epoch-by-epoch (EBE) analysis. Results: Summary variables for sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were not different between ŌURA ring and PSG. PSG-ŌURA discrepancies for WASO were greater in participants with more PSG-defined WASO (p < .001). Compared with PSG, ŌURA ring underestimated PSG N3 (~20 min) and overestimated PSG REM (~17 min; p < .05). PSG-ŌURA differences for TST and WASO lay within the ≤ 30 min a-priori-set clinically satisfactory ranges for 87.8% and 85.4% of the sample, respectively. From EBE analysis, ŌURA ring had a 96% sensitivity to detect sleep, and agreement of 65%, 51%, and 61%, in detecting \"light sleep\" (N1), \"deep sleep\" (N2 + N3), and REM sleep, respectively. Specificity in detecting wake was 48%. Similarly to PSG-N3 (p < .001), \"deep sleep\" detected with the ŌURA ring was negatively correlated with advancing age (p = .001). ŌURA ring correctly categorized 90.9%, 81.3%, and 92.9% into PSG-defined TST ranges of < 6 hr, 6–7 hr, > 7 hr, respectively.

Two tasks, one testing maintenance and the other manipulation and maintenance, were used. After SD, response times for both tasks were significantly slower. Performance was better preserved in the more complex task. Both tasks activated a bilateral, left hemisphere-dominant frontal-parietal network of brain regions reflecting the engagement of verbal working memory. In both states, manipulation elicited more extensive and bilateral (L&gt;R) frontal, parietal, and thalamic activation. After SD, there was reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent signal response in the medial parietal region with both tasks. Reduced deactivation of the anterior medial frontal and posterior cingulate regions was observed with both tasks. Finally, there was disproportionately greater activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral thalamus when manipulation was required. This pattern of changes in activation and deactivation bears similarity to that observed when healthy elderly adults perform similar tasks. Our data suggest that reduced activation and reduced deactivation could underlie cognitive impairment after SD and that increased prefrontal and thalamic activation may represent compensatory adaptations. The additional left frontal activation elicited after SD is postulated to be task dependent and contingent on task complexity.

Although chronic sleep loss is common in today's society, many people are unaware of the potential adverse health effects of habitual sleep restriction. Under strict experimental conditions, short‐term restriction of sleep results in a variety of adverse physiologic effects, including hypertension, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, impairment of glucose control, and increased inflammation. A variety of epidemiologic studies have also suggested an association between self‐reported sleep duration and long‐term health. Individuals who report both an increased (&gt;8 h/d) or reduced (&lt;7 h/d) sleep duration are at modestly increased risk of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and developing symptomatic diabetes. Although the data are not definitive, these studies suggest that sleep should not be considered a luxury, but an important component of a healthful lifestyle.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0889-7204.2004.02422.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078271091", "source": "openalex"}

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness.

Objective: This guideline is designed to assist primary care provid- ers as well as sleep medicine specialists, surgeons, and dentists who care for patients with OSA by providing a comprehensive strategy for the evaluation, management and long-term care of adult patients with OSA. Methods: The Adult OSA Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) was assembled to produce a clinical guideline from a review of existing practice parameters and available literature. All existing evidence-based AASM practice parameters relevant to the evaluation and management of OSA in adults were incorporated into this guideline. For areas not covered by the practice parameters, the task force performed a literature review and made consensus recom- mendations using a modified nominal group technique. recommendations: Questions regarding OSA should be incorpo- rated into routine health evaluations. Suspicion of OSA should trigger a comprehensive sleep evaluation. The diagnostic strategy includes a sleep-oriented history and physical examination, objective testing, and education of the patient. The presence or absence and severity of OSA must be determined before initiating treatment in order to identify those patients at risk of developing the complications of sleep apnea, guide selection of appropriate treatment, and to provide a baseline to establish the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Once the diag- nosis is established, the patient should be included in deciding an ap- propriate treatment strategy that may include positive airway pressure devices, oral appliances, behavioral treatments, surgery, and/or ad- junctive treatments. OSA should be approached as a chronic disease requiring long-term, multidisciplinary management.

Sleep problems were also very persistent: between a half and two‐thirds of children who exhibited sleep problems ai Time 1 still had them 3 years later. Sleep problems were associated with a number of child characteristics: poor communication skills, poor academic skills, poor self‐help skills, incontinence, daytime behaviour problems and epilepsy.

To test this hypothesis, we used data from a cohort of 420 patients presenting to the Penn Center for Sleep Disorders. Associations between individual variables in the clinical evaluation model and sleep apnea as defined by a re-spiratory disturbance index greater than or equal to 15 events per hour were characterized by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariable logistic regression was used to simultaneously estimate ORs for multiple variables and to control for other relevant patient characteristics. Results showed that narrowing of the airway by the lateral pharyngeal walls (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6–3.9) had the highest association with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) followed by tonsillar enlargement (OR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0–3.8), enlargement of the uvula (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–2.9), and tongue enlargement (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0–3.1). Low-lying palate, retrognathia, and overjet were not found to be significantly associated with OSA. Controlling for BMI and neck circumference, only lateral narrowing and enlargement of the tonsils maintained their significant (OR = 2.0 and 2.6, respectively). A subgroup analysis examining differences between male and female subjects showed that no oropharyngeal risk factor achieved significance in women while lateral narrowing was the sole independent risk factor in men. These findings suggest that enlargement of the oropharyngeal soft tissue structures, particularly the lateral pharyngeal walls, is associated with an increased likelihood of OSA among patients presenting to sleep disorders centers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.162.2.9908123", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1791691867", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2162002928", "title": "Sleep States in Premature Infants", "text": "SUMMARY Suggestions that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is ontogenetically primitive and observations of the behaviour of premature infants led to an attempt to trace the development of sleep in human infants from the premature period to three months after the expected date of delivery. Three sleep states were established, Quiet Sleep, Active Sleep (REM sleep), and Transitional Sleep, for the categorization of each 20 second interval of sleep during lengthy electroence‐phalographic and polygraphic recordings. Criteria regarding observed movements, eye movements, respiratory pattern, heart rate, chin electromyogram, and the EEG were used for a visual analysis of the tracings, with the specification that only four of the six criteria had to be met for classification of a 20 second interval as one sleep state or another. A second analysis, by means of computer sorting, was more rigid in that each 20 second interval had to meet all three criteria regarding observed movement, respiratory pattern, and eye movements. The other criteria were omitted. The second stricter analysis yielded a greater percentage of intervals that could not be called Active or Quiet Sleep and were, therefore, classified as Transitional Sleep, especially below 35 weeks gestational age. This finding/supports the concept that the sleep states of the more premature infants are less well defined and that the simultaneous occurrence of all the necessary criteria, particularly in Active 5jileep, is rarer than at later ages. Both analyses showed that the amount of Quiet Sleep increases as the infant matures, from 10 per cent at 31–32 weeks gestational age to roughly 50 per cent at 3 months past term. Conversely, Active Sleep decreases with maturation, the exact amount depending on the method of categorization. When the records were analysed visually, Active Sleep was found to constitute 68 per cent of the total sleep at 33–34 weeks gestational age and diminished to 36 per cent at 3 months; with computer sorting the comparable figures were 45 per cent and 25 per cent. Nevertheless, the figures for premature infants at term and 3 months were similar to those for full‐term infants at the same ages. The ill‐defined nature of the Active Sleep state in the early gestational ages and its subsequent delineation and diminution in amount amplify previous characterizations of this sleep state as a neurophysiologically primitive state and predecessor of the later stage during which dreaming occurs. RÉSUMÉ EAtats de sommeil chez les prématurés On a suggéré que le sommeil avec mouvements rapides des yeux (REM) est primitif ontogénétiquement; ceci, ajoutéà des observations du comportement des prématurés, nous a amenéà tenter de tracer le développement du sommeil chez les nouveaux‐nés humains depuis la période prématurée jusqu'à trois mois après la date prévue de l'accouchement. Trois états de sommeil ont étéétablis: Sommeil Tranquille, Sommeil Actif (Sommeil REM), et Sommeil Transitoire; pour la caractérisation de chacun d'entre eux on a étudié des intervalles de 20 secondes de sommeil pendant de longs enregistrements électroencépha‐lographiques et polygraphiques. Les critères concernant les mouvements observés, schéma respiratoire, vitesse du coeur, électromyogramme du menton et électroencéphalogramme ont été utilisés pour une analyse visuelle des courbes, en spécifiant que la rencontre de quatre des six critères suffisait pour la classification d'un intervalle de 20 secondes dans un état de sommeil ou un autre. Une seconde analyse, au moyen d'un computeur, a été plus rigoureuse du fait que chaque intervalle de 20 secondes devait satisfaire chacun des trois critères concernant les mouvements observés, schéma respiratoire et mouvements des yeux. Les autres critères avaient été supprimés. La seconde analyse, plus stricte, a fourni un pourcentage plus élevé d'intervalles qui ne pouvaient être appelés ni Sommeil Actif ni Sommeil Tranquille, et qui, par conséquent, ont été classés comme Sommeil Transitoire, en particulier au dessous de 35 semaines d'âge de gestation. Ces résultats viennent à l'appui du concept selon lequel les états de sommeil des plus prématurés sont moins bien dé nis et que l'occurrence simultanée de tous les critères nécessaires, particulièrement dans le Sommeil Actif, est plus rare qu'à un âge plus élevé. Les deux analyses ont montré que la quantité de Sommeil Tranquille augmente à mesure que l'enfant mûrit, de 10 pour cent à 31–32 semaines de gestation jusqu'à environ 50 pour cent à trois mois après terme. Au contraire, le Sommeil Actif diminue avec la maturation, sa quantité exacte dépendant de la méthode de caractérisation. Lorsque les enregistrements étaient analysés visuellement, le Sommeil Actif constituait 68 pour cent du sommeil total à 33–34 semaines d'âge gestationnel et diminuait jusqu'à 36 pour cent à trois mois; l'analyse par computeur donnait comme chiffres correspondants 45 pour cent et 25 pour cent. Tout de même, les chiffres pour les enfants prématurés à terme et à trois mois étaient similaires à ceux concernant les enfants nés à terme aux mêmes âges. La nature mal définie du Sommeil Actif dans les premiers âges gestationnels, ensuite son esquisse et sa diminution en quantité amplifient les caractérisations précédentes de cet état de sommeil comme un état neurophysiologiquement primitif et le prédécesseur de cet état plus avancé de sommeil pendant lequel les rèves se forment. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Schlafzustände bei Frühgeborenen In der Literatur auftréténde Hinweise dass Schlaf mit rapider Augenbewegung (REM) ontogenetisch primitiv ist, sowohl als auch Beobachtungen des Benehmens frügeborener Kinder, führten zu einem Versuch, die Entwicklung des Schlafes bei Kindern zu verfolgen, von der Frühgeburtsperiode bis zu drei Monaten nach dem erwartétén Niederkunfts‐Datum. Drei Schlafzustände wurden festgestellt, Ruhiger Schlaf, Aktiver Schlaf (REM‐Schlaf) und Übergangs‐Schlaf, bei der Kategorisierungjedes 20‐Sekunden‐lntervalls im Schlaf während langdauernder elektro‐enzephalographischer und polygraphischer Aufnahmen. Kriterien im Hinblick auf beobachtété Bewegungen, Augenbewegungen, Atem‐Rhythmus, Herz‐Geschwindigkeit, Kinn‐Elektromyogramm und Elektro‐Enzephalogramm wurden bei einer visuellen Analyse der Aufnahmen verwendet, mit der Spezifikation dass nur vier der sechs Kriterien vorhanden sein mussten, um einen 20‐Sekunden‐Intervall als den einen oder anderen Schlafzustand zu klassifizieren. Eine zweite Analyse, bei der Rechenmáschinen verwendet wurden, war strenger insofern als jeder 20‐Sekunden‐Intervall alle drei Kriterien im Hinblick auf beobachtété Bewegungen, Atem‐Rhythmus und Augenbewegungen aufweisen musste. Die anderen Kriterien wurden nicht beachtet. Die zweite, strengere Analyse ergab einen höheren Prozentsatz von Intervallen die weder Aktiver noch Ruhiger Schlaf gennant werden konnten, und die deshalb als Übergangs‐Schlaf klassifiziert wurden, besonders bei einem Schwangerschafts‐Alter von weniger als 35 Wochen. Dieser Befund unterstützt die Auffassung dass die Schlafzustände der früherge‐borenen Kinder nicht so bestimmbar sind, und dass das gleichzeitige Auftreten all der notwendigen Kriterien, besonders bei dem Aktiven Schlaf, seltener ist als bei späteren Altersstufen. Beide Analysen zeigten dass der Ruhige Schlaf zunimmt bei zunehmender Reife des Kindes, von 10 Prozent bei einem Schwangerschafts‐Alter von 31–32 Wochen bis zu ungefähr 50 Prozent bei einem Alter von 3 Monaten nach der vorhergesehenen Niederkunft. Andererseits nimmt der Aktive Schlaf mit der Maturation ab, wobei die Vergleichsziffern von der Methode der Kategorisierung abhängen. Bei visueller Analyse des Untersuchungs‐materials fand man dass der Aktive Schlaf beim Schwangerschafts‐Alter von 33–34 Wochen 68 Prozent des totalen Schlafes ausmacht und sich bei 3 Monaten auf 36 Prozent verringert hat; bei Anwendung der Rechenmaschine waren die entsprechenden Zahlen 45 Prozent und 25 Prozent. Doch waren die Zahlen für Frühgeborene im Geburtsalter und im Alter von 3 Monaten ähnlich denen für normalgeborene Kinder derselben Altersstufen. RESUMEN Estados de sueño en niños prematuros Sugestiones de que un sueño en que los ojos mueven rápidamente es ontogenéticamente primitivo, así como observaciones del comportamiento de niños prematuros, motivaron una tentativa de trazar la evolución del sueño de los infantes humanos desde el período prematura hasta tres meses después de la fecha cuando se había esperado el parto. Se establecieron tres estados de sueño; sueño tranquilo, sueño activo (en el que los ojos mueven rápidamente), y sueño transicional, para clasificar cada período de sueño de 20 segundos durante registros electroencefalográficos y poligráficos prolongados. Se usaban criterios tocante a movimientos observados, movimientos de los ojos, tipo de respiración, velocidad de latir el corazón, electromiograma del mentón, y el EEG para hacer una análisis visual de los trazados, especificando que solamente había que satisfacer cuatro de los seis criterios para clasificar un período de 20 segundos como cierto estado de sueño o como otro. Una segunda análisis, que consistió en una clasificación por calculadora, fue más rígida puesto que cada período de 20 segundos tuvo que satisfacer todos los tres criterios tocante a movimientos observados, tipo de respiración, y movimientos de los ojos. Se omitieron los otros criterios. La segunda análisis, más rigurosa, reveló un porcentaje mayor de intervalos que no podían clasificarse como sueño tranquilo ni como sueño activo y por eso se clasificaron como sueño transicional, sobre todo en niños menores de 35 semanas de edad gestacional. Este hallazgo apoya el concepto que los estados de sueño de los niños más prematuros son menos bien definidos, y que la ocurrencia simultánea de todos los criterios necesarios, sobre todo en el sueño activo, es más rara que en los infantes mayores. Ambas análisis mostraron que la cantidad de sueño tranquilo crece a medida que el niño madura, desde el 10 por ciento a la edad gestacional de 31–32 semanas hasta el 50 por ciento aproximadamente a los tres meses después de término. El sueño activo, en cambio, se disminuye a medida que el niño madura, con una rapidez que varía un poco según el método de categorizatión. Según un análisis visual de los registros, el sueño activo com‐prendía un 68 por ciento del sueño total a la edad gestacional de 33–34 semanas, pero solamente un 36 por ciento a los tres meses. Según un análisis por calculadora, las cifras eran un 45 por ciento y un 25 por ciento. De todos modos, las cifras para niños prematuros, a término y a los tres meses, eran semejantes a las para niños nacidos a término, a las mismas edades. El carácter mal definido del estado de sueño activo a las edades gestacionales menores, así como su delineatión y diminutión en cantidad subsiguientes, apoyan caracterizaciones anteriores de este estado de sueño como tipo primitivo del punto de vista neurofisiológico, y como antecesor del tipo de dormir que se ve más tarde, en el cual ocurren sueños.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1967.tb02212.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162002928", "source": "openalex"}

There is a great need for scientists and clinicians to consider sex and gender differences in their sleep research to account for the unique biology of women. To understand the role of sex differences in sleep and the state of women's sleep health research, the Society for Women's Health Research convened an interdisciplinary expert panel of well-established sleep researchers and clinicians for a roundtable meeting. Focused discussions on basic and clinical research along with a focus on specific challenges facing women with sleep-related problems and effective therapies led to the identification of knowledge gaps and the development of research-related recommendations. Additionally, sex differences in sleep disorders were noted and discussed in the context of underlying hormonal differences. Differences in sleep behavior and sleep disorders may not only be driven by biological factors but also by gender differences in the way women and men report symptoms. Progress has been made in identifying sex and gender differences in many areas of sleep, but major research gaps in the areas of epidemiology, sleep regulation, sleep quality, diagnosis, and treatment need to be addressed. Identifying the underlying nature of sex and gender differences in sleep research has potential to accelerate improved care for both men and women facilitating better diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately prevention of sleep disorders and related comorbid conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2014.4816", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2316666697", "source": "openalex"}

In light of the available data and with the prevalence of sleep deprivation (SD), we sought to determine the effect of SD on neuronal functioning. We found that the exposure of rats to 72 hr of primarily rapid eye movement SD impaired their subsequent performance on a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task but had no effect on an amygdala-dependent learning task. To determine the underlying cellular level mechanisms of this hippocampal deficit, we examined the impact of SD on several fundamental aspects of membrane excitability and synaptic physiology in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells. We found that neuronal excitability was severely reduced in CA1 neurons but not in granule cells and that the production of long-term potentiation of synaptic strength was inhibited in both areas. Using multiple SD methods we further attempted to differentiate the effects of sleep deprivation from those associated with the nonspecific stress induced by the sleep deprivation methods. Together these data suggest that failure to acquire adequate sleep produces several molecular and cellular level alterations that profoundly inhibit hippocampal functioning.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.23-29-09687.2003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1863554980", "source": "openalex"}

To investigate whether liraglutide 3.0 mg reduces OSA severity compared with placebo using the primary end point of change in apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) after 32 weeks. Liraglutide's weight loss efficacy was also examined. In this randomized, double-blind trial, non-diabetic participants with obesity who had moderate (AHI 15–29.9 events h−1) or severe (AHI ⩾30 events h−1) OSA and were unwilling/unable to use continuous positive airway pressure therapy were randomized for 32 weeks to liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=180) or placebo (n=179), both as adjunct to diet (500 kcal day−1 deficit) and exercise. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 48.5 years, males 71.9%, AHI 49.2 events h−1, severe OSA 67.1%, body weight 117.6 kg, body mass index 39.1 kg m−2, prediabetes 63.2%, HbA1c 5.7%). After 32 weeks, the mean reduction in AHI was greater with liraglutide than with placebo (−12.2 vs −6.1 events h−1, estimated treatment difference: −6.1 events h−1 (95% confidence interval (CI), −11.0 to −1.2), P=0.0150). Liraglutide produced greater mean percentage weight loss compared with placebo (−5.7% vs −1.6%, estimated treatment difference: −4.2% (95% CI, −5.2 to −3.1%), P<0.0001). A statistically significant association between the degree of weight loss and improvement in OSA end points (P<0.01, all) was demonstrated post hoc. Greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were seen with liraglutide versus placebo (both P<0.001). The safety profile of liraglutide 3.0 mg was similar to that seen with doses ⩽1.8 mg. As an adjunct to diet and exercise, liraglutide 3.0 mg was generally well tolerated and produced significantly greater reductions than placebo in AHI, body weight, SBP and HbA1c in participants with obesity and moderate/severe OSA.

The mouse Clock mutation induces pronounced changes in overall circadian organization. We sought to determine whether this genetic disruption of circadian timing would affect sleep homeostasis. The Clock mutation affected a number of sleep parameters during entrainment to a 12 hr light/dark (LD 12:12) cycle, when animals were free-running in constant darkness (DD), and during recovery from 6 hr of sleep deprivation in LD 12:12. In particular, in LD 12:12, heterozygous and homozygous Clock mutants slept, respectively, approximately 1 and approximately 2 hr less than wild-type mice, and they had 25 and 51% smaller increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during 24 hr recovery, respectively, than wild-type mice. The effects of the mutation on sleep are not readily attributable to differential entrainment to LD 12:12 because the baseline sleep differences between genotypes were also present when animals were free-running in DD. These results indicate that genetic alterations of the circadian clock system and/or its regulatory genes are likely to have widespread effects on a variety of sleep and wake parameters, including the homeostatic regulation of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.20-21-08138.2000", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148152432", "source": "openalex"}

The optimal approach to the quantification of sleep fragmentation continues to be debated. Modest and erratic correlations between measures of sleepiness and traditional measures of EEG arousals have pushed investigators to try and find more sensitive measures of sleep fragmentation. Simply correlating various measures of sleep fragmentation with a measure of sleepiness has significant limitations. Since sleep fragmentation is not the only factor affecting daytime sleepiness, these correlations can be misleading. For example, a subject with severely fragmented sleep will show elevated sleepiness during the day. However, the overall correlation may be reduced because lack of fragmented sleep does not guarantee that the level of sleepiness will be low. Multivariate statistical modeling is needed to account for sources of variance simultaneously in the prediction of daytime sleepiness. In this way it may be possible to identify the optimal definition of sleep fragmentation. More studies are needed that evaluate \"sub-cortical\" arousals, EEG arousals, and daytime function simultaneously. Ideally, clarification of these measurement issues will lead to an improved understanding of sleep structure and the mechanism through which sleep fragmentation impacts daytime function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/25.3.268", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3028627", "source": "openalex"}

Participants performed an emotional face recognition task, in which they evaluated 3 different affective face categories: Sad, Happy and Angry, each ranging in a gradient from neutral to increasingly emotional. In the TSD group, the task was performed once under conditions of sleep deprivation, and twice under sleep-rested conditions following different durations of sleep recovery. In the SC group, the task was performed twice under sleep-rested conditions, controlling for repeatability. In the TSD group, when sleep-deprived, there was a marked and significant blunting in the recognition of Angry and Happy affective expressions in the moderate (but not extreme) emotional intensity range; differences that were most reliable and significant in female participants. No change in the recognition of Sad expressions was observed. These recognition deficits were, however, ameliorated following one night of recovery sleep. No changes in task performance were observed in the SC group. Sleep deprivation selectively impairs the accurate judgment of human facial emotions, especially threat relevant (Anger) and reward relevant (Happy) categories, an effect observed most significantly in females.

Atherosclerosis is a key mechanism for these cardiovascular events. Recent cross-sectional studies showed the presence of early signs of atherosclerosis in patients with OSA who were free of comorbidities.Objectives: To determine the impact of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on atherosclerosis.Methods: We randomly assigned 24 patients with severe OSA (age, 46 ± 6 yr) who were free of comorbidities to receive no treatment (control, n = 12) or CPAP (n = 12) for 4 months. Carotid intima-media thickness, arterial stiffness (evaluated by pulse-wave velocity), carotid diameter, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, C-reactive protein, and catecholamines were determined at baseline and after 4 months.Measurements and Main Results: At baseline, all measurements were similar in both groups and did not change in the control group after 4 months. In contrast, a significant decrease occurred in carotid intima-media thickness (707 ± 105 vs. 645 ± 95 μm, P = 0.04), pulse-wave velocity (10.4 ± 1.0 vs. 9.3 ± 0.9 m/s, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (3.7 ± 1.8 vs. 2.0 ± 1.2 mg/L, P = 0.001), and catecholamines (365 ± 125 vs. 205 ± 51 ng/ml, P < 0.001) after 4 months of CPAP.

Continuous 5 min epochs representing a unique sleep stage (i.e., wakefulness, sleep stages 1 and 2, or slow-wave sleep) were extracted. fMRI time series of subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) (cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus, and subiculum) were extracted based on cytoarchitectonical probability maps. We observed sleep stage-dependent changes in HF functional coupling. The HF was integrated to variable strength in the default mode network (DMN) in wakefulness and light sleep stages but not in slow-wave sleep. The strongest functional connectivity between the HF and neocortex was observed in sleep stage 2 (compared with both slow-wave sleep and wakefulness). We observed a strong interaction of sleep spindle occurrence and HF functional connectivity in sleep stage 2, with increased HF/neocortical connectivity during spindles. Moreover, the cornu ammonis exhibited strongest functional connectivity with the DMN during wakefulness, while the subiculum dominated hippocampal functional connectivity to frontal brain regions during sleep stage 2. Increased connectivity between HF and neocortical regions in sleep stage 2 suggests an increased capacity for possible global information transfer, while connectivity in slow-wave sleep is reflecting a functional system optimal for segregated information reprocessing.

For older adults, emerging evidence suggests poor sleep quality increases risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. Given the aging population – and the impending economic burden associated with increasing numbers of dementia patients – there is pressing need to improve sleep quality among older adults. As such, research efforts have increased focus on investigating the association between age-related sleep changes and cognitive decline in older adults. Sleep quality is a complex construct to evaluate empirically, and yet the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is commonly used in studies as their only measure of sleep quality. Furthermore, the PSQI may not be the best sleep quality measure for older adults, due to its reliance on the cognitive capacity to reflect on the past month. Further study is needed to determine the PSQI's validity among older adults. Thus, the current study examined sleep quality for 78 community dwelling adults 55+ to determine the PSQI's predictive validity for objective sleep quality (as measured by actigraphy). We compared two subjective measures of sleep quality – the PSQI and Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) – with actigraphy (MotionWatch 8; camntech). Our results suggest perceived sleep quality is quite different from objective reality, at least for adults 55+. Importantly, we show this difference is unrelated to age, gender, education, or cognitive status (assessed using standard screens). Previous studies have shown the PSQI to be a valuable tool for assessing subjective sleep quality; however, our findings indicate for older adults the PSQI should not be used as a substitute for actigraphy, or vice versa. Hence, we conclude best practice is to include both subjective and objective measures when examining sleep quality in older adults (i.e., the PSQI, CSD, and actigraphy).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2015.00166", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141118708", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of ADHD with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. ADHD is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). Psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with ADHD for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. Long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. Current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of ADHD, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between ADHD and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: ADHD may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic ADHD; ADHD and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and ADHD and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12402-014-0151-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121891157", "source": "openalex"}

EEG power density in waking gradually increased in most frequencies during the SD period. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep was enhanced on both recovery days, and rapid-eye-movement sleep was enhanced only on recovery 1. In the initial 4 h of recovery 1, EEG slow-wave activity (SWA; mean power density 0.75-4.0 Hz) in NREM sleep was elevated relative to baseline, and the number of brief awakenings (nBA) was reduced. In the dark period of recovery 1 and the light period of recovery 2, SWA was below baseline, and nBA was increased. During the entire recovery period, SWA and nBA, both expressed as deviation from baseline values, were negatively correlated. During the SD period, TCRT was above baseline, and in the initial 16 h of recovery 1 it was below baseline. Whereas TCRT was negatively correlated with NREM sleep, no significant correlation was found between TCRT and SWA within NREM sleep. It is concluded that SD causes a short-lasting intensification of sleep, as indicated by the enhanced SWA and the reduced nBA, and a long-lasting increase in sleep duration. The different time courses of SWA and TCRT suggest that variations in NREM sleep intensity are not directly related to changes in TCRT.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.1991.261.1.r198", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125337181", "source": "openalex"}

Nonrestorative sleep was analyzed in relationship to sociodemographic determinants, environmental factors, life habits, health, sleep-wake schedule, and psychological factors. <h3>Results</h3> The prevalence of NRS was 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 10.4%-11.2%) in the sample, was higher in women than in men (12.5% vs 9.0%;<i>P</i>&lt;.001), and decreased with age. The United Kingdom (16.1%) and Germany (15.5%) had the highest prevalence of NRS and Spain (2.4%), the lowest. In multivariate analyses, several factors were positively associated with NRS. The most important were younger age, dissatisfaction with sleep, difficulty getting started in the morning, stressful life, presence of anxiety, bipolar or a depressive disorder, and having a physical disease. When compared with subjects who have difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (without NRS), subjects with NRS reported more frequently a variety of daytime impairment (irritability, physical, and mental fatigue) and consulted a physician twice as frequently for their sleeping difficulties than did other subjects with insomnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Nonrestorative sleep is a frequent symptom in the general population, but its prevalence largely varies between countries. It is often associated with mental disorders and characteristics of sleep deprivation (such as extra sleep time on weekends). Nonrestorative sleep affected more frequently the active classes of the population and caused greater daytime impairment than difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.1.35", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105127676", "source": "openalex"}

We classified the pertinent studies conducted on real shift workers in field conditions by the type of shift system and study design (ie, whether the shift systems were modified or not – “treatment” versus “no treatment”). The results of the observational studies in which no changes to the shift system were made (ie, no treatment) showed that, irrespective of the shift system, night and early-morning shifts and quick returns are associated with short sleep and increases in sleepiness. The same is true for very long shifts (&gt;16 hours) and extremely long weekly working hours (&gt;55 hours). For all categories of shift systems, there was a lack of controlled intervention studies, limiting the possibility to provide solution-focused recommendations for shift scheduling. Most of the controlled intervention studies had been conducted on workers under regular 3-shift systems. These studies suggested that a change from slowly backward-rotating shifts to rapidly forward-rotating shifts is advantageous for alertness and, to some degree, sleep. We also found that a change from an 8- to 12-hour shift system does not necessarily result in impairments in the sleep–wake pattern. The level of research evidence was affected by many of the studies’ frequent methodological limitations in measuring sleep and sleepiness. In all, to have reliable and solution-focused recommendations for shift scheduling, methodologically sound controlled intervention studies are required in different categories of shift systems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.2900", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998080078", "source": "openalex"}

Although it is not well defined or well understood at present, cancer-related fatigue is generally regarded as a form of tiredness that does not improve following rest or sleep. Objectively recorded sleep and biological rhythms have not been well investigated in these patients, but it appears that most cancer patients may in fact not be getting a good night's sleep. Evidence is accumulating that sleep is often disturbed in cancer patients, probably owing to a variety of causes. We posit that some degree of cancer-related fatigue experienced during the day may relate to sleep/wake cycles or to the quality and quantity of sleep obtained at night. Different components or dimensions of fatigue (physical, attentional/cognitive, emotional/affective, etc.) are probably associated in some way with disrupted sleep and desynchronized sleep/wake rhythms. These associations may change in measurable ways prior to treatment, during treatment and after treatment completion. In cancer patients, as in other medically ill patients, sleep that is inadequate or unrefreshing may be important not only to the expression of fatigue, but to the patients' quality of life and their tolerance to treatment, and may influence the development of mood disorders and clinical depression.

Sleep disorders research has shown that sleep apnoea, insomnia and other sleep disorders confer risk for cardiometabolic disease, particularly in the presence of reduced sleep duration. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between general sleep disturbance, operationalized as 'difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much' as measured in a large, nationally representative sample, and self-reported history of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease, diabetes and obesity. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analysed. Complete data were available for 138,201 individuals. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis examined associations before and after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, medical and psychological factors. After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and health risk factors, sleep duration was associated with obesity [odds ratio (OR)=1.18, P<0.0005), diabetes (OR=1.18, P<0.005), myocardial infarction (OR=1.36, P<0.0005), stroke (OR=1.22, P<0.05) and coronary artery disease (OR=1.59, P<0.0005).

Sleep disturbance is a significant risk factor for obesity, diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary artery disease, and effects for obesity, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease are the most robust after adjustment. This study demonstrates that sleep disturbance is a novel risk factor that is potentially modifiable.

We report that dFB neurons communicate via inhibitory transmitters, including allatostatin-A (AstA), with interneurons connecting the superior arch with the ellipsoid body of the central complex. These \"helicon cells\" express the galanin receptor homolog AstA-R1, respond to visual input, gate locomotion, and are inhibited by AstA, suggesting that dFB neurons promote rest by suppressing visually guided movement. Sleep changes caused by enhanced or diminished allatostatinergic transmission from dFB neurons and by inhibition or optogenetic stimulation of helicon cells support this notion. Helicon cells provide excitation to R2 neurons of the ellipsoid body, whose activity-dependent plasticity signals rising sleep pressure to the dFB. By virtue of this autoregulatory loop, dFB-mediated inhibition interrupts processes that incur a sleep debt, allowing restorative sleep to rebalance the books.

The purpose of this systematic review was to profile the objective and experienced characteristics of sleep among elite athletes, and to consider relationships between elite sport and insomnia symptomatology. Studies relating to sleep involving participants described on a pre-defined continuum of 'eliteness' were located through a systematic search of four research databases: SPORTDiscus, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar, up to April 2016. Once extracted, studies were categorised as (1) those mainly describing sleep structure/patterns, (2) those mainly describing sleep quality and insomnia symptomatology and (3) those exploring associations between aspects of elite sport and sleep outcomes. The search returned 1676 records. Following screening against set criteria, a total of 37 studies were identified. The quality of evidence reviewed was generally low. Pooled sleep quality data revealed high levels of sleep complaints in elite athletes. Three risk factors for sleep disturbance were broadly identified: (1) training, (2) travel and (3) competition. While acknowledging the limited number of high-quality evidence reviewed, athletes show a high overall prevalence of insomnia symptoms characterised by longer sleep latencies, greater sleep fragmentation, non-restorative sleep, and excessive daytime fatigue.

We therefore hypothesized that hypocapnia would be an important determinant of Cheyne-Stokes respiration with central sleep apnea (CSR-CSA) in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). To test this hypothesis, 24 male patients with CHF underwent overnight polysomnography during which transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) was measured. Lung to ear circulation time (LECT), derived from an ear oximeter as an estimate of circulatory delay, and CSR-CSA cycle length were determined. Patients were divided into a CSR-CSA group (n = 12, mean ± SEM of 49.2 ± 6.3 central apneas and hypopneas per h sleep) and a control group without CSR-CSA (n = 12, 4.9 ± 0.8 central apneas and hypopneas per h sleep). There were no significant differences in left ventricular ejection fraction, awake PaO2, mean nocturnal SaO2, or LECT between the two groups. In contrast, the awake PaCO2 and mean sleep PtcCO2 were significantly lower in the CSR-CSA group than in the control group (33.0 ± 1.2 versus 37.5 ± 1.0 mm Hg, p < 0.01, and 33.2 ± 1.2 versus 42.5 ± 1.2 mm Hg, p < 0.0001, respectively). Neither group had significant awake or sleep-related hypoxemia. In addition, CSR-CSA cycle length correlated with LECT (r = 0.939, p < 0.001).

Traditional approaches (e.g., Polysomnography (PSG)) are limited to clinic usage. Recent radio frequency (RF) based approaches require specialized devices or dedicated wireless sensors and are only able to track breathing rate. In this work, we propose to track the vital signs of both breathing rate and heart rate during sleep by using off-the-shelf WiFi without any wearable or dedicated devices. Our system re-uses existing WiFi network and exploits the fine-grained channel information to capture the minute movements caused by breathing and heart beats. Our system thus has the potential to be widely deployed and perform continuous long-term monitoring. The developed algorithm makes use of the channel information in both time and frequency domain to estimate breathing and heart rates, and it works well when either individual or two persons are in bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can accurately capture vital signs during sleep under realistic settings, and achieve comparable or even better performance comparing to traditional and existing approaches, which is a strong indication of providing non-invasive, continuous fine-grained vital signs monitoring without any additional cost.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2746285.2746303", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977986674", "source": "openalex"}

CPAP treatment (vs. sham CPAP) was associated with significant mean decreases in systolic blood pressure (3.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 6.4; P=0.001), diastolic blood pressure (2.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.9 to 4.1; P<0.001), serum total cholesterol (13.3 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 5.3 to 21.3; P=0.005), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (13.3 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 4.8 to 21.8; P=0.009), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (9.6 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 2.5 to 16.7; P=0.008), triglycerides (18.7 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 4.3 to 41.6; P=0.02), and glycated hemoglobin (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P=0.003). The frequency of the metabolic syndrome was reduced after CPAP therapy (reversal found in 11 of 86 patients [13%] undergoing CPAP therapy vs. 1 of 86 [1%] undergoing sham CPAP). Accelerated hypertension developed 1 patient receiving CPAP therapy first, intolerance to CPAP developed in 2 others, and another patient declined to continue sham CPAP.In patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, 3 months of CPAP therapy lowers blood pressure and partially reverses metabolic abnormalities.

Sixty-nine patients less than 18 years old had polysomnographically documented obstructive sleep apnea and were observed postoperatively in the pediatric intensive care unit. Of these, 16 (23%) had severe respiratory compromise, defined as intermittent or continuous oxygen saturation of 70% or less, and/or hypercapnia, requiring intervention. Compared with patients without respiratory compromise, these patients were younger (3.4±4 vs 6.1 ±4 years) and had more obstructive events per hour of sleep on the polysomnogram (49±41 vs 19±30). They were more likely to weigh less than the fifth percentile for age (odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 18.7), to have an abnormal electrocardiogram and/or echocardiogram (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.3 to 15.1), and to have a craniofacial abnormality (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.5 to 26). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the most significant risk factors were age below 3 years and an obstructive event index greater than 10. Children with obstructive sleep apnea are at risk for respiratory compromise following adenotonsillectomy; young age and severe sleep-related upper airway obstruction significantly increase this risk. We recommend in-hospital postoperative monitoring for children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea.

The evidence was based on a literature search of relevant articles published through December 2004, which resulted in identifying and extracting data from 182 articles, which were graded using standardized approaches. Diverse physiological sensors have been utilized to quantify airflow limitation in patients with suspected SRBD. Although thermistry appears appropriate for identifying apneas, the available evidence did not indicate it provides valid quantification of airflow reduction. The emerging evidence evaluating the accuracy of signal detection against the gold standard measurements (e.g., pneumotachography) suggested the superiority of inductance plethysmography and nasal pressure transducers for detection of hypopneas, with some evidence that recordings from a nasal pressure transducer may better approximate flow/volume than uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. However, since the nasal pressure transducer has only recently been incorporated into large-scale studies, there are as of yet few data that address the predictive value of transducer-identified events relative to clinical or physiological outcomes. Very few studies directly compared the validity of alternative approaches for defining the duration, amplitude change, and use of corroborative data from desaturation or arousal for defining hypopneas. Many observational studies utilizing various designs and approaches for event detection have shown significant associations between measures of SRBD and health outcomes. Data from the 2 largest sleep cohort studies, the Sleep Heart Health Study and the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort, both used definitions of hypopneas based on \"discernible\" reductions of inductance plethysmography signals with associated desaturation and showed that the derived AHIs using these hypopnea definitions correlated with various indices of morbidity. However, it is not clear whether alternative definitions would provide comparable if not better prediction, or whether optimal approaches for event identification would vary for different outcomes. Despite these limitations, forming a consensus on optimal approaches for recording and measuring respiratory events is an important step toward generating data from different clinical or research laboratories that can be compared. However, additional research is needed, including direct comparisons of alternative measuring approaches for predicting clinical outcomes, with a need to address these issues in large samples across the age spectrum and with inclusion of promising new technology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.26818", "url": "https://openalex.org/W147630397", "source": "openalex"}

To assess the involvement of GABAA receptors in the physiologic regulation of sleep, the article emphasizes the hypnotic properties shared by agonistic modulators and by the selective agonists of the GABAA receptor complex. In both rats and normal sleeping individuals, agonistic modulators are able to reduce sleep latency, increase sleep continuity, and promote non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep as well as the occurrence of spindles. Furthermore, nearly all of these compounds have been shown to attenuate slow-wave activity (SWA) and to suppress the occurrence of REM sleep. In the same species, GABAA agonist(s) do not seem to affect sleep latency or REM sleep time, but may increase sleep continuity and NREM sleep and augment SWA while depressing spindle activity in humans. The distinct sleep effects of GABAA agonists may be due to their unspecific stimulation of GABAA receptors throughout the brain, and to the fact that they are poor substrates for uptake and probably exert more tonic effects than liberated GABA. If so, the involvement of GABAA receptors in the various aspects of sleep can be inferred more accurately from the hypnotic effects of agonistic modulators. This implies that an activation of GABAA receptors plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of NREM sleep and in the generation of sleep spindles, but disrupts the processes underlying slow EEG components and the triggering of REM sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/22.1.33", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1498112602", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we estimated the disease-free survival rate from defined neurodegenerative syndromes in all the consecutive IRBD patients diagnosed and followed-up in our tertiary referal sleep center between November 1991 and July 2013. Results The cohort comprises 174 patients with a median age at diagnosis of IRBD of 69 years and a median follow-up of four years. The risk of a defined neurodegenerative syndrome from the time of IRBD diagnosis was 33.1% at five years, 75.7% at ten years, and 90.9% at 14 years. The median conversion time was 7.5 years. Emerging diagnoses (37.4%) were dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in 29 subjects, Parkinson disease (PD) in 22, multiple system atrophy (MSA) in two, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 12.

These studies, which constitute a very heterogeneous group in terms of methodology and patient population, are reviewed and the results summarized. This review focused on the following outcomes: sleep apnea (i.e. reduction in the apnea/hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index), ability of oral appliances to reduce snoring, effect of oral appliances on daytime function, comparison of oral appliances with other treatments (continuous positive airway pressure and surgery), side effects, dental changes (overbite and overjet), and long-term compliance. We found that the success rate, defined as the ability of the oral appliances to reduce apnea/hypopnea index to less than 10, is 54%. The response rate, defined as at least 50% reduction in the initial apnea/hypopnea index (although it still remained above 10), is 21%. When only the results of randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled studies are considered, the success and response rates are 50% and 14%, respectively. Snoring was reduced by 45%. In the studies comparing oral appliances to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), an appliance reduced initial AHI by 42%, CPAP reduced it by 75%, and UPPP by 30%. The majority of patients prefer using oral appliance than CPAP. Use of oral appliances improves daytime function somewhat; the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) dropped from 11.2 to 7.8 in 854 patients. A summary of the follow-up compliance data shows that at 30 months, 56-68% of patients continue to use oral appliance. Side effects are relatively minor but frequent. The most common ones are excessive salivation and teeth discomfort. Efficacy and side effects depend on the type of appliance, degree of protrusion, vertical opening, and other settings.

Sleep complaints are common in haemodialysis patients. In the general population, insomnia impacts negatively on health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). The objective of this study was to examine the association between quality of sleep and HRQoL in haemodialysis patients independent of known predictors of HRQoL. Methods. Quality of sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and HRQoL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36‐item Short Form (SF‐36) in 89 haemodialysis patients. Results. Sixty‐three (71%) subjects were ‘poor sleepers' (global PSQI >5). The SF‐36 mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) correlated inversely with the global PSQI score (MCS, r=−0.28, P<0.01; PCS, r=−0.45, P<0.01). The PCS score also correlated with age (r=−0.24, P=0.02), haemoglobin (r=0.21, P=0.048) and comorbidity (r=−0.40, P<0.01), and mean PCS was lower in depressed subjects (26.2 vs 35.9, P=0.02).

Surgical and nonsurgical approaches to weight loss have been evaluated, although most studies to date suffer from methodological limitations including lack of random assignment to treatment groups, confounding of treatment interventions, absence of untreated controls and lack of adequate follow-up assessment. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/19.2.104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W91591195", "source": "openalex"}

This study was initiated to examine the impact of starting school on adolescent sleep, to compare weekday and weekend sleep times, and to attempt to normalize the timing of the circadian sleep/wake cycle by administering bright light in the morning. This was a collaborative project involving high school students and their parents, as well as high school and university faculty members, for the purpose of contributing information to the scientific community while educating students about research processes and their own sleep/wake cycles and patterns. Methods. Sixty incoming high school seniors kept sleep/wake diaries beginning in August and continuing through 2 weeks after the start of school in September. Sleep diaries were also kept for 1 month in November and 1 month in February. Early-morning light treatments were given to 19 students in the last 2 weeks of November and the last 2 weeks of February. Neuropsychologic performance was measured with computer-administered tests. Paper-and-pencil tests were used for assessment of mood and vigor. A testing period consisted of 2 consecutive days at the beginning and end of November and at the beginning and end of February. Tests were given 3 times per day, ie, in the morning before school (6:30–8:00 am), during midday lunch periods (11:30 am to 1:00 pm), and in the afternoon (3:00–4:30 pm), on each of the test days. Results. Adolescents lost as much as 120 minutes of sleep per night during the week after the start of school, and weekend sleep time was also significantly longer (∼30 minutes) than that seen before the start of school (August). No significant differences were found between weekday sleep in the summer and weekend sleep during the school year. Early-morning light treatments did not modify total minutes of sleep per night, mood, or computer-administered vigilance test results. All students performed better in the afternoon than in the morning. Students in early morning classes reported being wearier, being less alert, and having to expend greater effort. Conclusions. The results of this study demonstrated that current high school start times contribute to sleep deprivation among adolescents. Consistent with a delay in circadian sleep phase, students performed better later in the day than in the early morning. However, exposure to bright light in the morning did not change the sleep/wake cycle or improve daytime performance during weekdays. Both short-term and long-term strategies that address the epidemic of sleep deprivation among adolescents will be necessary to improve health and maximize school performance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2004-1649", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2136566387", "source": "openalex"}

This mismatch occurs because the 24-h zeitgebers, such as the natural light-dark cycle, keep the circadian rhythms from phase shifting to align with the night-work, day-sleep schedule. This is a review of studies in which the sleep schedule is shifted several hours, as in shift work, and bright light is used to try to phase shift circadian rhythms. Phase shifts can be produced in laboratory studies, when subjects are kept indoors, and faster phase shifting occurs with appropriately timed bright light than with ordinary indoor (dim) light. Bright light field studies, in which subjects live at home, show that the use of artificial nocturnal bright light combined with enforced daytime dark (sleep) periods can phase shift circadian rhythms despite exposure to the conflicting 24-h zeitgebers. So far, the only studies on the use of bright light for real shift workers have been conducted at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In general, the bright light studies support the idea that the control of light and dark can be used to overcome many of the problems of shift work. However, despite ongoing practical applications (such as at NASA), much basic research is still needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/074873049501000208", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2060819195", "source": "openalex"}

After ghrelin administration, slow-wave sleep was increased during the total night and accumulated δ-wave activity was enhanced during the second half of the night. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep was reduced during the second third of the night, whereas all other sleep EEG variables remained unchanged. Furthermore, GH and prolactin plasma levels were enhanced throughout the night, and cortisol levels increased during the first part of the night (2200–0300). The response of GH to ghrelin was most distinct after the first injection and lowest after the fourth injection. In contrast, cortisol showed an inverse pattern of response. Leptin levels did not differ between groups. Our data show a distinct action of exogenous ghrelin on sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion. We suggest that ghrelin is an endogenous sleep-promoting factor. This role appears to be complementary to the already described effects of the peptide in the regulation of energy balance. Furthermore, ghrelin appears to be a common stimulus of the somatotropic and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical systems.

Differences in reliability according to whether or not weekend measurements were included were investigated. Further, the correlation between objectively (actigraphy) measured sleep and subjectively measured sleep quality was studied over the different days of the week.The results concerning actigraphy sleep measures suggest that data from at least 2 nights are to be recommended when assessing sleep percent and at least 5 nights when assessing sleep efficiency. For actigraphy-measured total sleep time, more than 7 nights are needed. At least 6 nights of measurements are required for a reliable measure of self-reported sleep. Fewer nights (days) are required if measurements include only week nights.

In analyses of initial test performance, women sleeping ≤5 hours/night scored worse than women sleeping 7 hours/night (mean difference on global score combining all cognitive tests = 0.15 standard units, 95% CI: −0.28, −0.02). Women who regularly had difficulty falling or staying asleep scored 0.11 units lower on the global score (95% CI: −0.22, 0.01) compared with those who rarely had difficulty sleeping. These differences were equivalent to the mean differences in score observed between participants who were 4 to 5 years apart in age.

However, the isolated effect of sleep on the activity of these muscles (comparing OSA patients with controls) has not been studied. We therefore determined waking levels of genioglossus (GG) and tensor palatini (TP) muscle activity (% of maximum electromyographic [EMG] activity) in 10 OSA patients and eight controls, and then assessed the impact of the first two breaths of sleep (theta electroencephalographic [EEG] activity) following a period of stable wakefulness. Apnea patients demonstrated greater genioglossal (27.4 +/- 4.0 versus 10.7 +/- 2.1%) and tensor palatini (31.9 +/- 6.5 versus 10.6 +/- 1.9%) EMG activity than did controls during wakefulness. This augmented muscle activity in apnea patients could be reduced to near control levels during wakefulness with the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the upper airway. At sleep onset, control subjects demonstrated small but consistent decrements in the activity of both the TP and GG muscles. On the other hand, apnea patients demonstrated large, significantly greater decrements in TP EMG at sleep onset than did the control subjects. The effect of sleep on GG EMG in apnea patients was inconsistent, with most (n = 7) demonstrating large (significantly larger than controls) decrements in genioglossal activity. However, three OSA patients demonstrated small increments in GG EMG at sleep onset despite falling TP EMG and obstructive apnea or hypopnea. We conclude that sleep onset is associated with significantly larger decrements in TP muscle EMG activity in OSA patients than in controls, which may represent a loss of neuromuscular compensation that is present during wakefulness.

Increasing age was related to earlier habitual waketime, earlier bedtime, less time in bed and better mood and alertness at waketime. In the laboratory, increasing age was associated with less time asleep, increased number of awakenings, decreased sleep efficiency, lower percentages of slow‐wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, higher percentages of Stage 1 and 2, shorter REM latency and reduced REM activity and density. Increasing age was also associated with higher morningness scores. After controlling for the effects of age, morningness was associated with earlier waketime, earlier bedtime, less time in bed, better alertness at waketime, less time spent asleep, more wake in the last 2 h of sleep, decreased REM activity, less stage REM (min and percentage), more Stage 1 (min and percentage) and fewer minutes of Stage 2. For one set of variables (night time in bed, waketime, total sleep time, wake in the last 2 h of sleep and minutes of REM and REM activity), morningness‐eveningness accounted for about half of the relationship between age and sleep. For another set of variables (bedtime, alertness at waketime, percentages of REM and Stage 1), morningness‐eveningness accounted for the entire relationship between age and sleep. In conclusion, age and morningness were both important predictors of the habitual sleep patterns and polysomnographic sleep characteristics of people in the middle years of life (20‐59 y).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1997.00230.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2045617252", "source": "openalex"}

Conversely, dysfunctional affective brain processing can lead to life-threatening risk behaviors (e.g., addiction) and emotion imbalance (e.g., mood disorders). The state of sleep deprivation continues to be associated with maladaptive emotional regulation, leading to exaggerated neural and behavioral reactivity to negative, aversive experiences. However, such detrimental consequences are paradoxically aligned with the perplexing antidepressant benefit of sleep deprivation, elevating mood in a proportion of patients with major depression. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how sleep loss alters the dynamics of brain and behavioral reactivity to rewarding, positive emotional experiences. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here we demonstrate that sleep deprivation amplifies reactivity throughout human mesolimbic reward brain networks in response to pleasure-evoking stimuli. In addition, this amplified reactivity was associated with enhanced connectivity in early primary visual processing pathways and extended limbic regions, yet with a reduction in coupling with medial frontal and orbitofrontal regions. These neural changes were accompanied by a biased increase in the number of emotional stimuli judged as pleasant in the sleep-deprived group, the extent of which exclusively correlated with activity in mesolimbic regions. Together, these data support a view that sleep deprivation not only is associated with enhanced reactivity toward negative stimuli, but imposes a bidirectional nature of affective imbalance, associated with amplified reward-relevant reactivity toward pleasure-evoking stimuli also. Such findings may offer a neural foundation on which to consider interactions between sleep loss and emotional reactivity in a variety of clinical mood disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3220-10.2011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1968748283", "source": "openalex"}

Data from the Actillume are presented as two variables, the sum (total of all activity movements within the prescribed epoch) and the maximum activity (the largest or maximum movement recorded during the prescribed epoch), and by electroencephalogram (EEG). One difficulty in making comparisons was that the EEG records showed diffuse slowing, making it extremely difficult to score sleep/wake activity and making it difficult to use the EEG as a \"gold standard\". Nevertheless, the correlation for total sleep time from EEG and Actillume was r = 0.91 (p < 0.001) for sum activity and r = 0.81 for maximum activity (p < 0.005). Correlations for percent sleep were r = 0.78 (p < 0.01) for maximum activity and r = 0.61 for sum activity. The comparison of sleep/wake determined by the Actillume vs. observations resulted in a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 90%. We conclude that the Actillume is the most feasible technique for studying sleep and wake activity in demented nursing-home patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.1.24", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1636066922", "source": "openalex"}

These include monoaminergic neurons in the brainstem and posterior hypothalamus, cholinergic neurons in the brainstem and basal forebrain, and hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Collectively, these systems impart tonic activation to their neuronal targets in the diencephalon and neocortex that is reflected in the low-voltage fast-frequency electroencephalogram patterns of wakefulness. Neuronal discharge in these arousal systems declines rapidly at sleep onset. Transitions from waking to sleep, therefore, involve coordinated inhibition of multiple arousal systems. An important source of sleep-related inhibition of arousal arises from neurons located in the preoptic hypothalamus. These preoptic neurons are strongly activated during sleep, exhibiting sleep/waking state-dependent discharge patterns that are the reciprocal of that observed in the arousal systems. The majority of preoptic sleep regulatory neurons synthesize the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Anatomical and functional evidence supports the hypothesis that GABAergic neurons in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) and ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) exert inhibitory control over the monoaminergic systems and the hypocretin system during sleep. Recent findings indicate that MnPN and VLPO neurons integrate homeostatic aspects of sleep regulation and are important targets for endogenous sleep factors, such as adenosine and growth hormone releasing hormone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1417.027", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038008568", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN--A study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly and of two controls matched for age and date with each index case. The parents of control infants were interviewed within 72 hours of the index infant9s death. Information was collected on bedding, sleeping position, heating, and recent signs of illness for index and control infants. SETTING--A defined geographical area comprising most of the county of Avon and part of Somerset. SUBJECTS--72 Infants who had died suddenly and unexpectedly (of whom 67 had died from the sudden infant death syndrome) and 144 control infants. RESULTS--Compared with the control infants the infants who had died from the sudden infant death syndrome were more likely to have been sleeping prone (relative risk 8.8; 95% confidence interval 7.0 to 11.0; p less than 0.001), to have been more heavily wrapped (relative risk 1.14 per tog above 8 tog; 1.03 to 1.28; p less than 0.05), and to have had the heating on all night (relative risk 2.7; 1.4 to 5.2; p less than 0.01). These differences were less pronounced in the younger infants (less than 70 days) than the older ones. The risk of sudden unexpected death among infants older than 70 days, nursed prone, and with clothing and bedding of total thermal resistance greater than 10 tog was increased by factors of 15.1 (2.6 to 89.6) and 25.2 (3.7 to 169.0) respectively compared with the risk in infants of the same age nursed supine or on their side and under less than 6 tog of bedding. CONCLUSIONS--Overheating and the prone position are independently associated with an increased risk of sudden unexpected infant death, particularly in infants aged more than 70 days. Educating parents about appropriate thermal care and sleeping position of infants may help to reduce the incidence of the sudden infant death syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.301.6743.85", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992699164", "source": "openalex"}

This work proposes a joint classification-and-prediction framework based on CNNs for automatic sleep staging, and, subsequently, introduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture to power the framework. Given a single input epoch, the novel framework jointly determines its label (classification) and its neighboring epochs' labels (prediction) in the contextual output. While the proposed framework is orthogonal to the widely adopted classification schemes, which take one or multiple epochs as contextual inputs and produce a single classification decision on the target epoch, we demonstrate its advantages in several ways. First, it leverages the dependency among consecutive sleep epochs while surpassing the problems experienced with the common classification schemes. Second, even with a single model, the framework has the capacity to produce multiple decisions, which are essential in obtaining a good performance as in ensemble-of-models methods, with very little induced computational overhead. Probabilistic aggregation techniques are then proposed to leverage the availability of multiple decisions. We conducted experiments on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF Expanded with 20 subjects, and Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies dataset with 200 subjects. The proposed framework yields an overall classification accuracy of 82.3% and 83.6%, respectively. We also show that the proposed framework not only is superior to the baselines based on the common classification schemes but also outperforms existing deep-learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work going beyond the standard single-output classification to consider multitask neural networks for automatic sleep staging. This framework provides avenues for further studies of different neural-network architectures for automatic sleep staging.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2018.2872652", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2805033630", "source": "openalex"}

However, either the integration of plasmids into mammalian genomes or the use of retro-/lentiviral systems have intrinsic limitations. The use of transposable elements, e.g. the Sleeping Beauty system (SB), circumvents most of these drawbacks (integration sites, size limitations) and allows the quick generation of stable cell lines. The integration process of SB is catalyzed by a transposase and the handling of this gene transfer system is easy, fast and safe. Here, we report our improvements made to the existing SB vector system and present two new vector types for robust constitutive or inducible expression of any gene of interest. Both types are available in 16 variants with different selection marker (puromycin, hygromycin, blasticidin, neomycin) and fluorescent protein expression (GFP, RFP, BFP) to fit most experimental requirements. With this system it is possible to generate cell lines from stable transfected cells quickly and reliably in a medium-throughput setting (three to five days). Cell lines robustly express any gene-of-interest, either constitutively or tightly regulated by doxycycline.

Subjective sleep quality, calmness of sleep, ease of falling asleep, ability to ‘sleep through’, number of awakenings, and sleep latency showed a significant pattern of ‘better’ sleep with increasing prior time awake and with closeness to the circadian minimum (nadir) of rectal temperature (morning hours). ‘Ease of awakening’ in contrast, ‘decreased’ with increasing time awake and with closeness to the nadir/ morning hours. Multiple regression analysis showed that subjective sleep quality was predicted by subjective calmness of sleep and ease of falling asleep, among the subjective measures, and by total sleep time (TST) and slow‐wave sleep (SWS – stages 3 +4) among the physiological sleep measures. The subjective ease of awakening was predicted by slow‐wave sleep (negatively) and the circadian maximum of rectal temperature.

The data are examined from both cross-sectional (age group) and longitudinal (individual) perspectives.

At 3 weeks of age, most infants were put into their cribs for the night already asleep. When they awakened in the middle of the night, they were removed from their cribs. By the time they returned to their cribs, they were again asleep. By 3 months of age, infants who were put into the crib awake at bedtime and allowed to fall asleep on their own were more likely to return to sleep on their own after awakenings later in the night. In contrast, infants who were put into the crib already asleep at the beginning of the night were significantly more likely to be removed from the crib following a subsequent nighttime awakening.

Interestingly, 45 of the 46 sleep bruxers with values below SB-RDC were classified in the low-frequency cluster. These individuals were more likely to complain of pain and fatigue of masticatory muscles than were the higher-frequency sleep bruxers (odds ratios &gt; 3.9, p &lt; 0.01). Sleep bruxers were distributed among three heterogeneous groups. Sleep bruxers with low frequencies of orofacial activities were more at risk of reporting pain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/154405910708600906", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101375200", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of the present work was to study human electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep spindles during dexmedetomidine sedation and compare them with spindles during normal physiological sleep, to test the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine exerts its effects via normal sleep‐promoting pathways. Methods: EEG was continuously recorded from a bipolar frontopolar–laterofrontal derivation with Entropy Module (GE Healthcare) during light and deep dexmedetomidine sedation (target‐controlled infusions set at 0.5 and 3.2 ng/ml) in 11 healthy subjects, and during physiological sleep in 10 healthy control subjects. Sleep spindles were visually scored and quantitatively analyzed for density, duration, amplitude (band‐pass filtering) and frequency content (matching pursuit approach), and compared between the two groups. Results: In visual analysis, EEG activity during dexmedetomidine sedation was similar to physiological stage 2 (S2) sleep with slight to moderate amount of slow‐wave activity and abundant sleep spindle activity. In quantitative EEG analyses, sleep spindles were similar during dexmedetomidine sedation and normal sleep. No statistically significant differences were found in spindle density, amplitude or frequency content, but the spindles during dexmedetomidine sedation had longer duration (mean 1.11 s, SD 0.14 s) than spindles in normal sleep (mean 0.88 s, SD 0.14 s; P =0.0014). Conclusions: Analysis of sleep spindles shows that dexmedetomidine produces a state closely resembling physiological S2 sleep in humans, which gives further support to earlier experimental evidence for activation of normal non‐rapid eye movement sleep‐promoting pathways by this sedative agent.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.2007.01537.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2025829561", "source": "openalex"}

We identify 47 genetic associations at P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 , of which 20 reach a stricter threshold of P &lt; 8 × 10 −10 . These include 26 novel associations with measures of sleep quality and 10 with nocturnal sleep duration. The majority of identified variants associate with a single sleep trait, except for variants previously associated with restless legs syndrome. For sleep duration we identify a missense variant (p.Tyr727Cys) in PDE11A as the likely causal variant. As a group, sleep quality loci are enriched for serotonin processing genes.

Hypoxia and hypercapnia, acting via the chemoreflexes, elicit increases in sympathetic nerve activity. The sympathetic responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are potentiated during apnea, when the sympathetic inhibitory influence of the thoracic afferent nerves is eliminated. As a consequence of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor response to apneic events, patients with obstructive sleep apnea manifest marked increases in blood pressure during sleep, especially evident at the end of the apnea. The increases in sympathetic activity and blood pressure during sleep in these patients appear to carry over into the daytime such that patients with sleep apnea have an increased prevalence of hypertension and high levels of sympathetic nerve activity. Although the mechanism underlying the persistent elevation in sympathetic activity during the daytime is not known, it is likely that the increased sympathetic drive is implicated in the higher daytime blood pressures in these patients. Whereas patients with sleep apnea have an increased prevalence of hypertension, in those patients with sleep apnea who do have hypertension, the sympathetic response to apneic events may be potentiated. This may be secondary to impaired baroreflex sensitivity, since the baroreflexes exert an inhibitory influence on the chemoreflex responses to hypoxia. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure results in an acute reduction in blood pressure and sympathetic activity during sleep. Prolonged effective treatment of sleep apnea may also reduce daytime blood pressure levels. This review examines the physiology of the chemoreflex responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia and apnea, as well as the physiologic responses to sleep in normal humans. These physiologic responses are compared with the pathophysiologic sympathetic and hemodynamic responses that characterize obstructive sleep apnea. Increases in sympathetic activity and blood pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea may play a role in linking sleep apnea to hypertension and cardiac and vascular events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004872-199715120-00062", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042517296", "source": "openalex"}

In contrast, mean V I for the group with nocturnal desaturation decreased by 21% during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and by 39% during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep as compared with wakefulness. This reduction was due mainly to a decrease in tidal volume (V T). Hypoventilation was most pronounced during REM sleep, irrespective of the underlying disease.

At NREM‐REM sleep transitions a power shift from A to M was present over almost the entire frequency range, while the direction of shifts between M and P differed between frequency bands. Within NREM sleep, frequency specific power gradients were present: In the low delta band power in both A (0.25 Hz bin) and P (0.25–1.0 Hz bins) was higher than in M . In the 4–9 Hz range the relation was A &gt; M &gt; P , and in the 15–25 Hz range power was largest in M . Power in the spindle frequency range was highest at 11.75 Hz in M , and at 13.5–13.75 Hz in A . Topographical differences were seen also in the temporal changes of power across and within NREM sleep episodes. Whereas NREM sleep power in the 2‐Hz bin was higher in A than in M in the first episode, this difference vanished in the course of the night.

As a consequence, almost 40% of hypnotic medications are prescribed to people over age 60. Yet, hypnotics are often of little benefit in this population. As such, an effective non‐drug alternative could prove important in the management of age‐related sleep maintenance insomnia. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of bright light exposure in the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Design : Following baseline sleep and circadian rhythms assessment, subjects with sleep‐maintenance insomnia were treated with timed exposure to either bright white light or dim red light for 12 consecutive days. Sleep and circadian rhythms recordings were subsequently obtained and measures of sleep quality were compared to assess efficacy of the treatments. Setting : Baseline and post‐treatment sleep and circadian rhythms assessments took place in the Laboratory of Human Chronobiology, Department of Psychiatry, Cornell University Medical College. The treatment phase of the study was conducted in participants' homes. Participants : Sixteen men and women between the ages of 62 and 81 years were studied. All subjects were free of hypnotic medication, and all had experienced sleep disturbance for at least 1 year prior to entering the study. Results : Exposure to bright light resulted in substantial changes in sleep quality. Waking time within sleep was reduced by an hour, and sleep efficiency improved from 77.5% to 90%, without altering time spent in bed. Increased sleep time was in the form of Stage 2 sleep, REM sleep, and slow wave sleep. The effects were remarkably consistent across subjects.

Sleep deprivation in the animal model produces a condition that eventually becomes highly lethal, lacks specific localization, and is reversible with sleep, implying mediation by a biochemical abnormality. Metabolic and immunological consequences of sleep deprivation point to a high potential for antioxidant imbalance. The objective, therefore, was to study glutathione content in the liver, heart, and lung, because glutathione is considered a major free radical scavenger that reflects the degree to which a tissue has been oxidatively challenged. We also investigated major enzymatic antioxidants, including catalase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as indexes of glutathione recycling. Catalase activity and glutathione content, which normally are tightly regulated, were both decreased in liver by 23-36% by 5 and 10 days of sleep deprivation. Such levels are associated with impaired health in other animal models of oxidative stress-associated disease. The decreases were accompanied by markers of generalized cell injury and absence of responses by the other enzymatic antioxidants under study. Enzymatic activities in the heart indicated an increased rate of oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activity during sleep deprivation. Recovery sleep normalized antioxidant content in liver and enhanced enzymatic antioxidant activities in both the liver and the heart. The present results link uncompensated oxidative stress to health effects induced by sleep deprivation and provide evidence that restoration of antioxidant balance is a property of recovery sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00565.2004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100138491", "source": "openalex"}

During slow-wave sleep (SWS), however, declarative memory consolidation is particularly strong, while acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus drop to a minimum. Observations in rats led to the hypothesis that the low cholinergic tone during SWS is necessary for the replay of new memories in the hippocampus and their long-term storage in neocortical networks. However, this low tone should not affect nondeclarative memory systems. In this study, increasing central nervous cholinergic activation during SWS-rich sleep by posttrial infusion of 0.75 mg of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine completely blocked SWS-related consolidation of declarative memories for word pairs in human subjects. The treatment did not interfere with consolidation of a nondeclarative mirror tracing task. Also, physostigmine did not alter memory consolidation during waking, when the endogenous central nervous cholinergic tone is maximal. These findings are in line with predictions that a low cholinergic tone during SWS is essential for declarative memory consolidation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0305404101", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119042170", "source": "openalex"}

To explore the distribution of sleep apnea in the population and its co-morbidities, random telephone dialing was used between 1990 and 1994 to recruit subjects for a prevalence survey of sleep-disordered breathing in San Diego adults. Events from which blood oxygen desaturations ≥4% resulted were monitored with home recording instruments, usually for three consecutive nights. Among 190 women ages 40–64 years, a median of 4.3 desaturation events per hour of sleep were observed. A higher median of 6.7 events per hour was observed among 165 men. Frequencies were much higher among members of minority groups, leading to a standard estimate that 16.3% of U.S. Hispanics and racial minorities have ≥20 events/hour as compared to 4.9% of non-Hispanic Whites ages 40–64. Obesity indicated by body-mass index was the most important demographic predictor of sleep-disordered breathing, followed by age, male gender, and ethnicity. Quality of well-being was not significantly impaired in subjects with more respiratory events; however, there was some increase in blood pressure and wake-within-sleep associated with sleep-disordered breathing. This survey indicates that sleep-disordered breathing is more common, especially among minorities, than had been previously believed, but less co-morbidity may be associated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.1.65", "url": "https://openalex.org/W5967079", "source": "openalex"}

The expression of REM sleep-related physiology (e.g. thalamocortical arousal, ponto-geniculate-occipital (PGO) waves, and atonia) depends upon a subpopulation of PPN neurons that release acetylcholine (ACh) to act upon muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). Serotonin's potent hyperpolarization of cholinergic PPN neurons is central to present working models of REM sleep control. A growing body of experimental evidence and clinical experience suggests that the responsiveness of the PPN region, and thereby modulation of REM sleep, involves closely adjacent glutamatergic neurons and alternate afferent neurotransmitters. Although many of these afferents are yet to be defined, dopamine-sensitive GABAergic pathways exiting the main output nuclei of the basal ganglia and adjacent forebrain nuclei appear to be the most conspicuous and the most likely to be clinically relevant. These GABAergic pathways are ideally suited to modulate the physiologic hallmarks of REM sleep differentially (e.g. atonia versus cortical activation), because each originates from a functionally unique forebrain circuit and terminates in a unique pattern upon brain stem neurons with unique membrane characteristics. Evidence is reviewed that changes in the quality, timing, and quantity of REM sleep that characterize narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder, and neurodegenerative and affective disorders (depression and schizophrenia) reflect 1) changes in responsiveness of cells in the PPN region governed by these afferents; 2) increase or decrease in PPN cell number; or 3) mAChRs mediating increased responsiveness to ACh derived from the PPN. Auditory evoked potentials and acoustic startle responses provide means independent from recording sleep to assess pathophysiologies affecting the PPN and its connections and thereby complement investigations of their role in affecting daytime functions (e.g. arousal and attention).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.9.757", "url": "https://openalex.org/W66994731", "source": "openalex"}

We reviewed 107 relevant articles, of which 60 included quantitative measures of both alcohol use and sleep. Measurements and Results Behavioral studies suggest that up to 2 to 3 standard drinks before bedtime initially promotes sleep, but these effects diminish in as few as 3 days of continued use. Clinical investigations support a relationship between sleep disturbance and alcohol use, but variability in the definition and measurement of these domains and a preponderance of cross-sectional studies make uncertain the strength and direction of the association. Conclusions The association of insomnia with alcohol use disorders suggests that the clinical evaluation of patients with sleep problems should include a careful assessment of alcohol use. Future studies of this relationship should employ prospective designs with standardized, validated measures of both sleep and alcohol use.

In one of the papers included in this Symposium, Bremer (2) reviews the work which has been reported since 1954 on the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in sleep. The relationship of dreaming to the depth of sleep has been investigated by such workers as Kleitman (5), Dement (4) and Wolpert (11). These studies have been made possible by the application of modern techniques of measuring mental activity. The use of electroencephalographic methods has allowed an approximate classification of the different levels of sleep which enables different workers to adopt a standard frame of reference. Measurements of rapid eye movements and of changes in muscle potential during sleep have provided more objective methods of assessing dream activity. Other recent studies have attempted to make an objective assessment of the physical and mental effects of sleep deprivation (Morris et al. , 7, Bliss et al. , 1, Murray et al. , 8, Wilkinson, 9, Williams et al. , 10).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.108.456.642", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2025433746", "source": "openalex"}

Females reached their peak in eveningness earlier (about 17 yrs of age) than males (about 21 yrs of age). Thereafter, the ideal sleep‐time preference advanced in men and women with increasing age. Females presented a more significant advanced sleep phase than males only during the years when sexual hormones are typically active.

To accomplish this goal, 18 male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) underwent overnight polysomnography with simultaneous monitoring of pressures in the posterior nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and esophagus. From the profile of pressures recorded in the UA and esophagus, the regions over which the UA collapses during apneas could be determined. The patients were 54 ± 14 y of age and were grossly obese with a body mass index of 37 ± 2 kg/m2. They had moderately severe OSA with a mean apnea plus hypopnea index of 62 ± 8 per hour. During NREM sleep, 10 of the 18 (56%) patients had collapse confined to the velopharyngeal or retropalatal segment of the upper airway. The remaining 44% of the patients demonstrated collapse of the retroglossal segment of the oropharynx located caudal to the inferior margin of the soft palate. Upper airway collapse at the level of the hyoid bone was not observed during NREM sleep. Observations made during REM sleep in nine patients demonstrated that collapse occurred in a more caudal segment of the UA in seven patients during REM than during NREM sleep. The effect of sleep position was evaluated in 10 patients and found to have little affect on the extent over which the UA collapsed during sleep independent of sleep state. The effects of UPPP on regional UA collapse were evaluated in a small group of six patients. The results indicated that patients with UA collapse confined to the velopharynx preoperatively may have persistent collapse of this level after surgery and that failure to respond is not always due to collapse of more caudal segments of the UA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/141.5_pt_1.1350", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087967662", "source": "openalex"}

Portable Medilog tape-recorders were used for ambulatory EEG monitoring of 25 male papermill workers (25-55 years) during days with night and afternoon work. The results showed that sleep after night work was two hours shorter than after afternoon work. The sleep reduction affected mainly Stage 2 and REM sleep while slow wave sleep was unchanged. In connection with night work 28% of the workers took a nap in the afternoon. These naps contained a large proportion of slow wave sleep and were, apparently, caused by the sleep deficit after the short main sleep period. The EEG recordings also revealed that 20% of the participants had sleep episodes during night work. These naps were as long as the afternoon naps, were experienced as \"dozing offs\" rather than naps, occurred at the time of the trough of the circadian wakefulness rhythm, and were concomitant with extreme subjective sleepiness and low rated work load. It was concluded that not only the sleep of shift workers was disturbed, but also the wakefulness--to the extent that sleepiness during night work sometimes reached a level where reasonable wakefulness could not be maintained. The latter observation is probably of special importance in work situations demanding a great responsibility for human lives or for great economic values.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1989.tb01934.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071716559", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep staging segments a period of sleep into a sequence of phases providing the basis for most clinical decisions in sleep medicine. Manual sleep staging is difficult and time-consuming as experts must evaluate hours of polysomnography (PSG) recordings with electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) data for each patient. Here, we present U-Sleep, a publicly available, ready-to-use deep-learning-based system for automated sleep staging ( sleep.ai.ku.dk ). U-Sleep is a fully convolutional neural network, which was trained and evaluated on PSG recordings from 15,660 participants of 16 clinical studies. It provides accurate segmentations across a wide range of patient cohorts and PSG protocols not considered when building the system. U-Sleep works for arbitrary combinations of typical EEG and EOG channels, and its special deep learning architecture can label sleep stages at shorter intervals than the typical 30 s periods used during training. We show that these labels can provide additional diagnostic information and lead to new ways of analyzing sleep. U-Sleep performs on par with state-of-the-art automatic sleep staging systems on multiple clinical datasets, even if the other systems were built specifically for the particular data. A comparison with consensus-scores from a previously unseen clinic shows that U-Sleep performs as accurately as the best of the human experts. U-Sleep can support the sleep staging workflow of medical experts, which decreases healthcare costs, and can provide highly accurate segmentations when human expertize is lacking.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00440-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3156463266", "source": "openalex"}

We employed functional connectivity analysis of rs-fMRI series obtained from 25 healthy participants, covering all non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages. We focused on the default mode network (DMN) and its anticorrelated network (ACN) that are involved in internal and external awareness during wakefulness. Using independent component analysis, cross-correlation analysis (CCA), and intraindividual dynamic network tracking, we found significant changes in DMN/ACN integrity throughout the NREM sleep. With increasing sleep depth, contributions of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/retrosplenial cortex (RspC), parahippocampal gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex to the DMN decreased. CCA revealed a breakdown of corticocortical functional connectivity, particularly between the posterior and anterior midline node of the DMN and the DMN and the ACN. Dynamic tracking of the DMN from wakefulness into slow wave sleep in a single subject added insights into intraindividual network fluctuations. Results resonate with a role of the PCC/RspC for the regulation of consciousness.

In 177 patients, sudden, unexpected, and irresistible sleep episodes while engaged in some activity were identified in a structured telephone interview. Ninety‐one of these patients denied the occurrence of appropriate warning signs. A total of 133 patients (75%) had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score &gt;10; 65 (37%) &gt;15. Thirty‐one patients (18%) had an ESS score ≤10 and yet experienced sleep attacks without warning signs. Thus, although a significant proportion of patients at risk for sleep attacks might be identified using the ESS, roughly 1% of the PD patient population seems to be at risk for sleep attacks without appropriate warning signs and without accompanying daytime sleepiness. Sleep attacks occurred with all dopamine agonists marketed in Germany (α‐dihydroergocryptine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole), and no significant difference between ergot and nonergot drugs was evident. Levodopa ( L ‐dopa) monotherapy carried the lowest risk for sleep attacks (2.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7–4.0%) followed by dopamine agonist monotherapy (5.3%; 95% CI, 1.5–9.2%) and combination of L ‐dopa and a dopamine agonist (7.3%; 95% CI, 6.1–8.5%). Neither selegeline nor amantadine or entacapone appeared to influence the occurrence of sleep attacks. A high ESS score, intake of dopamine agonists, and duration of PD were the main influencing factors for the occurrence of sleep attacks. The odds ratio for dopamine agonist therapy was 2.9 compared to 1.9 with L ‐dopa therapy and 1.05 for a 1‐year‐longer disease duration. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.10417", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105801762", "source": "openalex"}

An additional 13 patients showed a reduction of 25 to 50%. If patients free of ectopic activity during 24-hour monitoring sessions are excluded from analysis, then in 35 of 45 patients, or in 78%, sleep was associated with a lowered occurrence of ventricular extrasystoles. During sleep the VPB grade was likewise lowered. Thus the mean grade for 45 patients changed from 2.75 while awake to 1.78 while asleep. It is of interest that in a number of these patients, trials of various antiarrhythmic drugs were less effective than sleep in reducing the incidence and grade of VPBs.

Interactions of the oscillators have been postulated to account for multimodal sleep/wake patterns. The ultradian models simulate the cyclic alternation of nonREM sleep and REM sleep by assuming a reciprocal interaction of two cell groups. The homeostatic models propose that a sleep/wake dependent process (Process S) underlies the rise in sleep pressure during waking and its decay during sleep. The time course of this process has been derived from EEG slow-wave activity, an indicator of nonREM sleep intensity. The predictions of homeostatic models have been most extensively tested in experiments. The interaction of Process S with a single circadian process can account for multimodal sleep/wake patterns, internal desynchronization and the time course of daytime sleepiness.

We compared the measures in light sleep, slow-wave sleep, REM sleep and supine vs. lateral positions.

For all‐cause mortality, when sleep duration was &lt;7 hours per day, the pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.06 (95% CI , 1.04–1.07) per 1‐hour reduction; when sleep duration was &gt;7 hours per day, the pooled RR was 1.13 (95% CI , 1.11–1.15) per 1‐hour increment. For total cardiovascular disease, the pooled RR was 1.06 (95% CI , 1.03–1.08) per 1‐hour reduction and 1.12 (95% CI , 1.08–1.16) per 1‐hour increment of sleep duration. For coronary heart disease, the pooled RR was 1.07 (95% CI , 1.03–1.12) per 1‐hour reduction and 1.05 (95% CI , 1.00–1.10) per 1‐hour increment of sleep duration. For stroke, the pooled RR was 1.05 (95% CI , 1.01–1.09) per 1‐hour reduction and 1.18 (95% CI , 1.14–1.21) per 1‐hour increment of sleep duration.

Data from 100 consecutive patients referred for sleep study for suspected sleep apnea were used to develop the model using logistic regression analysis. For each subject, the model predicted the probability of having an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 15; this probability was compared with the AHI measured from sleep study. A probability cutoff point (= 0.15) was decided on that minimized the number of subjects with false-negative predictions. Four terms — apneas observed by bed partner, hypertension, body mass index, and age—were found to contribute significantly to the model with observed apneas being by far the most predictive term of the four (adjusted odds ratio 19.7). When the model was tested to estimate the probability of an AHI > 15 for 105 patients from a second group of consecutive patients referred for sleep study, the model correctly classified 33 of 36 patients with a measured AHI > 15 (sensitivity = 92%) and 35 of 69 patients with a measured AHI ⩽ 15 (specificity = 51%). This study shows that analysis of clinical features of patients presenting with suspected sleep apnea may reduce the need for sleep studies by about one-third yet still lead to the identification of the great majority of patients with abnormal breathing during sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/142.1.14", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982790149", "source": "openalex"}

Differences in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of α‐synuclein aggregation disorders including PD. Objectives To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals. Methods Microbiota of flash‐frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed. Results Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia , were observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms. Conclusion Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. © 2017 The Authors.

Methods: All-night polysomnography was obtained in patients with acute Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition major depressive disorder (n = 22) and age-, gender-, and body weight-matched comparison controls (n = 18). After the onset of sleep, nocturnal serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), and IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR) were sampled. Results: As compared with matched controls, depressed patients showed significant (p <.05) nocturnal elevations of circulating levels of IL-6 and sICAM. Both sleep latency and rapid eye movement (REM) density had moderate correlations with IL-6 and sICAM (r's ≥0.30). Backward regression analyses indicated that sleep latency (β = 0.34, p <.05) and REM density (β = 0.27, p = .09) were better predictors of IL-6 than depressive status. Similarly, sleep latency (β = 0.27, p = .06) and REM density (β = 0.32, p = .02) were also better predictors of sICAM. Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that sleep disturbance is associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory markers IL-6 and sICAM. This relationship was not accounted for by other confounding factors such as age and body weight. These findings suggest that the elevations in inflammatory markers found in depressive subjects may be partially the result of disturbances of sleep initiation found in this population.

The objective of this study was to describe the impact of OSA on patients' QoL. A list of 186 items potentially related to QoL of patients with OSA was constructed. From this list, consecutive patients were asked, at the time of the diagnosis, to identify the most significant items and to grade their importance on a 5‐point scale. The item impact was determined from the proportion of patients who identified it as important, and the mean importance score attributed to this item (impact score=frequency×importance). One hundred patients (82 male; mean age: 51 yrs) were interviewed. The items having the most important impact on QoL clustered into five domains: 1) daytime symptoms; 2) nocturnal symptoms; 3) limitation of activities; 4) emotions; and 5) interpersonal relationships. The impact of obstructive sleep apnoea on quality of life is not limited to excessive daytime sleepiness.

Continuous noninvasive recordings of finger blood pressure were obtained in 7 subjects. In light sleep (stage 2 sleep) the number of sympathetic bursts/min decreased to 90±8% (mean±SEM) and total MSA (=burst/minxmean burst area) to 89±5% of the awake value (P < 0.05, n = 14). In deep sleep (stage 3–4) total MSA decreased further, to 71±8% of the awake value (n = 5). There was no close correlation between variations of depth of sleep and variations of sympathetic activity but during continuously deepening sleep MSA decreased progressively with time. In stage 2 sleep, high amplitude K complexed were accompanied by short-lasting increases of sympathetic activity. Since these increases of MSA were not preceded by decreases of diastolic blood pressure, which is known to evoke increased sympathetic nerve traffic in muscle nerves, we suggest that K complex related increases of MSA are signs of arousal which elicit both cortical EEG phenomena and activation of cerebral sympathetic centres. During desynchronized (REM) sleep, total MSA increased to 124±12% of the value in awake state (n = 5). The increases occurred mainly in short irregular periods, often related to rapid eye movements and there was an inverse relationship between the duration of the desynchronized sleep and the increase of total MSA. Our findings are similar to the data obtained in animal experiments and may partly explain changes of blood pressure during synchronized and desynchronized sleep and the increase of total MSA.

A prerequisite for understanding the neurocognitive consequences of primary insomnia is to establish task paradigms that robustly differentiate insomniacs from well-sleeping subjects. We hypothesized that the decline in performance that typically occurs with an increasing cognitive demand would provide a more sensitive measure than performance on a single task version. The hypothesis was tested, first, by assessing the performance on two vigilance tasks with different cognitive demands in 25 elderly patients with primary insomnia and 13 healthy well-sleeping age-matched subjects. Secondly, we investigated the performance response to sleep therapy using a waiting-list controlled design. Sleep therapy consisted of a multi-component intervention including sleep restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, bright-light therapy, structured physical activity and body temperature manipulations. The results show that insomniacs differed markedly from controls in their reaction times across tasks with different cognitive demands: patients responded faster on the 'simple' vigilance task, yet slower on the 'complex' vigilance task. Sleep therapy effectively restored normal performance: patients became significantly slower on the 'simple' task and faster on the 'complex' task, returning to the performance levels of control subjects. These findings indicate that the performance decline associated with increasing cognitive demands is possibly the first sensitive and robust measure of the neurocognitive sequelae of insomnia. We suggest that future studies on cognition in primary insomnia should apply a design that varies task demands.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00671.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005371006", "source": "openalex"}

Manual sleep stage scoring is a time-consuming task for sleep experts and is limited by inter-rater reliability. In this paper, we propose an automatic sleep stage annotation method called SleepEEGNet using a single-channel EEG signal. The SleepEEGNet is composed of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract time-invariant features, frequency information, and a sequence to sequence model to capture the complex and long short-term context dependencies between sleep epochs and scores. In addition, to reduce the effect of the class imbalance problem presented in the available sleep datasets, we applied novel loss functions to have an equal misclassified error for each sleep stage while training the network. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method on different single-EEG channels (i.e., Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz EEG channels) from the Physionet Sleep-EDF datasets published in 2013 and 2018. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved the best annotation performance compared to current literature, with an overall accuracy of 84.26%, a macro F1-score of 79.66% and κ = 0.79.

The investigation was performed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Sixteen patients (4 male, 12 female) with previously established psychophysiological insomnia (ICSD-code 1.A.1.), and with a median age of 49 (range: 22 to 55), were included in the study. The main inclusion criteria were reported primary insomnia according to ICSD criteria, which was confirmed by polysomnographic recording, and the absence of acute diseases. During the study, the patients underwent 8 polysomnographic recordings: i. e., 2 recordings (baseline and study night) at each time point at which the short and long-term effects of placebo and valerian were tested. The target variable of the study was sleep efficiency. Other parameters describing objective sleep structure were the usual features of sleep-stage analysis, based on the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968), and the arousal index (scored according to ASDA criteria, 1992) as a sleep microstructure parameter. Subjective parameters such as sleep quality, morning feeling, daytime performance, subjectively perceived duration of sleep latency, and sleep period time were assessed by means of questionnaires. After a single dose of valerian, no effects on sleep structure and subjective sleep assessment were observed. After multiple-dose treatment, sleep efficiency showed a significant increase for both the placebo and the valerian condition in comparison with baseline polysomnography. We confirmed significant differences between valerian and placebo for parameters describing slow-wave sleep. In comparison with the placebo, slow-wave sleep latency was reduced after administration of valerian (21.3 vs. 13.5 min respectively, p < 0.05). The SWS percentage of time in bed (TIB) was increased after long-term valerian treatment, in comparison to baseline (9.8 vs. 8.1 % respectively, p < 0.05). At the same time point, a tendency for shorter subjective sleep latency, as well as a higher correlation coefficient between subjective and objective sleep latencies, were observed under valerian treatment. Other improvements in sleep structure - such as an increase in REM percentage and a decrease in NREM1 percentage - took place simultaneously under placebo and valerian treatment. A remarkable finding of the study was the extremely low number of adverse events during the valerian treatment periods (3 vs. 18 in the placebo period). In conclusion, treatment with a herbal extract of radix valerianae demonstrated positive effects on sleep structure and sleep perception of insomnia patients, and can therefore be recommended for the treatment of patients with mild psychophysiological insomnia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2000-7972", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006055085", "source": "openalex"}

Clinically, PLMs resemble spinal FRs. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> FRs were obtained by electrically stimulating the medial plantar nerve and recording from antagonist leg and thigh muscles bilaterally. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Compared with controls, patients had significantly increased spinal cord excitability, as indicated by lower threshold and greater spatial spread of the FR, which was more prominent during sleep. Multiple late responses were seen during sleep in all patients and in some controls at higher threshold. The most prominent of these responses had a very long duration and a latency range of 250 to 800 msec, and because of its close temporal relationship to the FR stimulus, the authors considered it was a late, high-threshold component of the FR (FR3). The authors also found a similarity between the pattern of muscle recruitment and spatial spread of late components of the FR and those of spontaneous PLMs. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The results support the hypothesis that PLMs in RLS and FRs share common spinal mechanisms and suggest that PLMs may result from enhanced spinal cord excitability in RLS patients.

We found that age, sex, body mass index, bed partner observation of apnea and pharyngeal examination were significant predictors of AHI, explaining 36% of the variability. Subjective impression of the examining clinician was also an independent significant predictor of AHI, accounting for 10% of the variability. Using a conventional cutoff value of 10 to divide patients into apneics (AHI > 10) and nonapneics (AHI ≤ 10), the sensitivity of subjective impression was 60% and the specificity 63%.

For younger children, greater parental warmth predicted more hours of weekday sleep, whereas for adolescents, stricter household rules were protective. On weekends, African American adolescents and Hispanic children slept less, and there were strong effects of activity choices including time spent on television, computer and videogames, sports, religious activities, socializing, and employment. In accounting for age-related decreases in sleep hours from childhood to adolescence, earlier school start times, greater hours of homework, greater paid employment, less time spent on meals, and fewer household rules were all significant mediators.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/0893-3200.21.1.4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102213139", "source": "openalex"}

Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the opioid group was significantly lower during both wakefulness (difference 2.1%, p < .001) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (difference 2.2%, p < .001) but not during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (difference 1.2%) than in the nonopioid group. Within the opioid group, and after controlling for body mass index, age, and sex, there was a dose-response relationship between morphine dose equivalent and apnea-hypopnea (p < .001), obstructive apnea (p < .001), hypopnea (p < .001), and central apnea indexes (p < .001). Body mass index was inversely related to apnea-hypopnea index severity in the opioid group. Ataxic or irregular breathing during NREM sleep was also more prevalent in patients who chronically used opioids (70% vs 5.0%, p < .001) and more frequent (92%) at a morphine dose equivalent of 200 mg or higher (odds ratio = 15.4, p = .017).There is a dose-dependent relationship between chronic opioid use and the development of a peculiar pattern of respiration consisting of central sleep apneas and ataxic breathing.

The results showed that more women than men reported participating in a regular exercise program and having sleep symptoms of disorders in maintaining sleep and nightmares and that more men than women did regular vigorous activity and walking at a brisk pace for more than 6 blocks per day. Both men and women had significantly reduced risk of disorders in maintaining sleep associated with regular activity at least once a week, participating regularly in an exercise program, and walking at a normal pace for more than 6 blocks per day.

The source of the inconsistency is the denominator of the widely published operational definition of SE: ratio of total sleep time (TST) to time in bed (TIB) (multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage). When taken literally, TIB includes non-sleep-related activity (e.g., reading, texting, conversing with a partner, watching television) both prior to initiating sleep and after the final awakening. However, the construct of SE refers to TST compared to the amount of time spent attempting to initially fall asleep and sleep discontinuity. Non-sleep related activities in bed do not reflect that construct. Also, time out of bed during nighttime awakenings, a manifestation of sleep discontinuity, should be included in the SE denominator. Using TIB as the denominator can also create a methodological problem when SE is an outcome measure in sleep intervention research. It is proposed that research and practice would benefit by clarifying and adopting a consistent operational definition that more accurately captures the construct of SE. An alternate denominator, duration of the sleep episode (DSE), is suggested, where DSE = sleep onset latency (SOL) + TST + time awake after initial sleep onset but before the final awakening (WASO) + time attempting to sleep after final awakening (TASAFA). The proposed formula for SE would be: SE = TST / DSE (× 100). DSE can be easily calculated using standard sleep diary entries along with one item from the Expanded Consensus Sleep Diary.

The recent description of a true placebo (sham CPAP) prompted us to conduct a randomized trial of CPAP or placebo to assess the effectiveness of CPAP in improving SAHS-related symptoms and daytime function in patients with moderate to severe SAHS. Forty-eight patients, stratified in four groups according to severity, were randomly allocated into two treatment groups (optimal and sham CPAP) for a 6-wk period. Of these, 45 completed follow-up (91% males; age: 54 ± 10 yr; body mass index [BMI]: 32 ± 6 kg/m2; apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]: 54 ± 19 events/h; and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]: 16 ± 5). The ESS, a questionnaire on SAHS-related symptoms, Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were completed at inclusion and after treatment. After 10 d of washout, the placebo group was treated with optimal CPAP and reassessed before and after optimal CPAP. The group receiving optimal CPAP when compared with the group with sham CPAP showed considerably greater improvement in the relief of sleepiness ( − 9.5 versus − 2.3, p < 0.001), other SAHS-related symptoms ( − 18.5 versus − 4.5, p < 0.001), vigilance ( + 8.5 versus + 3.4, p = 0.009), and general productivity ( + 4.0 versus + 0.5, p = 0.04) FOSQ scales.

Moreover, sleep is a malleable behavior that may be improved by individual and organizational changes. Despite the consequential and modifiable nature of sleep, little consensus exists regarding its conceptualization, and how the choice of conceptualization may impact relationships with organizational antecedents and outcomes. To offer a stronger foundation for future theory and research about employee sleep, this study calculated meta-analytic correlations of sleep quality and sleep quantity from 152 primary studies of sleep among workers in organizations. Analyses revealed that both sleep quality and sleep quantity associated negatively with workload and a number of health, attitudinal, and affective outcomes. Despite their conceptual similarity, notable differences existed in sleep quality and sleep quantity in terms of their relationships to many different correlates. Generally, the relationships between sleep quality and the examined correlates were stronger for variables that reflected perceptions. Moderator analyses showed that relationships between sleep quality and quantity may be affected by measurement method and the number of self-report items used, while there is little evidence of the effect of measurement time frame. Findings from this first meta-analytic investigation of the occupational sleep literature have implications for the development of theory about relationships between sleep and work, the measurement of sleep, the identification of organizational correlates of sleep, and the design of interventions intended to improve employee sleep.

Its use for all subjects with sleep-disordered breathing, regardless of daytime symptoms, is unclear.Objectives: This multicenter controlled trial assesses the effects of 1 year of CPAP treatment on blood pressure (BP) in nonsymptomatic, hypertensive patients with OSA.Methods: We evaluated 359 patients with OSA. Inclusion criteria consisted of an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 19 hour−1, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score less than 11, and one of the following: under antihypertensive treatment or systolic blood pressure greater than 140 or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg.

In a univariate comparison with normal subjects, depressed patients showed less total sleep, longer sleep latency, more early morning awake time, more intermittent awake time, less delta sleep, less sleep efficiency, and shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latencies; compared with insomniacs, depressed patients showed greater early morning awake time, shorter REM latency, greater REM index, and greater REM density. Using multivariate discriminant analysis, 82% of the sample were correctly classified by diagnosis: 100% of the normal subjects, 72% of the depressed patients, and 77% of the insomniacs. Eight variables contributed to the multivariate separation of depressed individuals from insomniacs and normals: total sleep time, total recording period, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, early morning awake time, awake time, REM time, and REM %. When the discriminant functions were applied to a second group of 18 primary depressed patients, 82% were correctly classified as depressed. These results suggest that primary depressed patients and primary insomniac patients may show relatively characteristic patterns of sleep abnormality.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.1979.01780010091010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964357132", "source": "openalex"}

In the current study, we attempted to validate a novel automatic algorithm, which was developed for actigraphic studies in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea by comparing it on an epoch-by-epoch basis to standard polysomnography. Prospective cohort study. Multicenter, university hospital, sleep laboratories. A total of 228 subjects from 3 different sleep centers (Skara, Boston, Haifa) participated. Simultaneous recording of polysomnography and Watch_PAT100, an ambulatory device that contains a built-in actigraph. The automatic sleep/wake algorithm is based on both the quantification of motion (magnitude and duration) and the various periodic movement patterns, such as those occurring in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The overall sensitivity and specificity to identify sleep was 89% and 69%, respectively. The agreement ranged from 86% in the normal subjects to 86%, 84%, and 80% in the patients with mild, moderate, and severe obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. There was a tight agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography in determining sleep efficiency (78.4 ± 9.9 vs 78.8 ± 13.4%), total sleep time (690 ± 152 vs 690 ± 154 epochs), and sleep latency (56.8 ± 31.4 vs 43.3 ± 45.4 epochs). While for most individuals the difference between the polysomnography and actigraphy was relatively small, for some there was a substantial disagreement. We conclude that this actigraphy algorithm provides a reasonably accurate estimation of sleep and wakefulness in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea on an epoch-by-epoch basis. This simple method for assessment of total sleep time may provide a useful tool for the accurate quantification of obstructive sleep apnea in the home environment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/27.8.1560", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2396760804", "source": "openalex"}

With the introduction of a new standard for sleep stage scorings (AASM standard) there is a need for studies on interrater reliability (IRR). The SIESTA database resulting from an EU-funded project provides a large number of studies (n = 72; 56 healthy controls and 16 subjects with different sleep disorders, mean age +/- SD: 57.7 +/- 18.7, 34 females) for which scorings according to both standards (AASM and R&K) were done. Differences in IRR were analysed at two levels: (1) based on quantitative sleep parameter by means of intraclass correlations; and (2) based on an epoch-by-epoch comparison by means of Cohen's kappa and Fleiss' kappa. The overall agreement was for the AASM standard 82.0% (Cohen's kappa = 0.76) and for the R&K standard 80.6% (Cohen's kappa = 0.68). Agreements increased from R&K to AASM for all sleep stages, except N2. The results of this study underline that the modification of the scoring rules improve IRR as a result of the integration of occipital, central and frontal leads on the one hand, but decline IRR on the other hand specifically for N2, due to the new rule that cortical arousals with or without concurrent increase in submental electromyogram are critical events for the end of N2.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00700.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963756232", "source": "openalex"}

Nevertheless, several other factors affect hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Sleep has modest but clearly detectable modulatory effects on HPA axis activity. Sleep onset exerts an inhibitory effect on cortisol secretion while awakenings and sleep offset are accompanied by cortisol stimulation. During waking, an association between cortisol secretory bursts and indices of central arousal has also been detected. Abrupt shifts of the sleep period induce a profound disruption in the daily cortisol rhythm, while sleep deprivation and/or reduced sleep quality seem to result in a modest but functionally important activation of the axis. HPA hyperactivity is clearly associated with metabolic, cognitive and psychiatric disorders and could be involved in the well-documented associations between sleep disturbances and the risk of obesity, diabetes and cognitive dysfunction. Several clinical syndromes, such as insomnia, depression, Cushing's syndrome, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) display HPA hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, psychiatric and metabolic impairments. Further research to delineate the functional links between sleep and HPA axis activity is needed to fully understand the pathophysiology of these syndromes and to develop adequate strategies of prevention and treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2010/759234", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013718939", "source": "openalex"}

Of 3383 questionnaires distributed 3269 (96.5%) were returned. Main outcome measures 1. Sleep frequency and duration, settling procedures, time taken to setde at night, age when child first slept through the night and number of night-time wakenings requiring parental intervention. 2. Parents' problems with their child's sleep behaviour. Results There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behaviour. Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age. Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age. Frequent nighttime wakening is common from four to 12 months. Night-time settling requires more parental input from 18 months. A large proportion of parents (28.6%) have a problem with their child's sleep behaviour.

An interdisciplinary European Respiratory Society task force evaluated the scientific literature according to the standards of evidence-based medicine. Evidence supports the use of mandibular advancement devices in mild to moderate OSAS. Maxillomandibular osteotomy seems to be as efficient as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients who refuse conservative treatment. Distraction osteogenesis is usefully applied in congenital micrognathia or midface hypoplasia. There is a trend towards improvment after weight reduction. Positional therapy is clearly inferior to CPAP and long-term compliance is poor. Drugs, nasal dilators and apnoea triggered muscle stimulation cannot be recommended as effective treatments of OSAS at the moment. Nasal surgery, radiofrequency tonsil reduction, tongue base surgery, uvulopalatal flap, laser midline glossectomy, tongue suspension and genioglossus advancement cannot be recommended as single interventions.

This study examined the effects of work schedule on sleep duration, excessive sleepiness, sleep attacks, driving, and domestic/professional accidents. A representative sample of the general population of the state of New York—3,345 individuals ≥18 yrs of age—was interviewed by telephone regarding their sleep and psychiatric and organic disorders. Multivariate models were applied to derive odds ratios (OR) after adjustment for age, sex, physical illness, mental disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and sleep duration. On average (±SE), workers slept 6.7 ± 1.5 h, but 40% slept <6.5 h/main sleep episode. Short-sleep duration (<6 h) was strongly associated with fixed night (OR: 1.7) and day-evening-night shiftwork arrangement (OR: 1.9). Some 20% of the workers manifested excessive sleepiness in situations requiring high attention, and it was associated with the fixed night (OR: 3.3) and day-evening-night work arrangements (OR: 1.5). Overall, 5% of the workers reported sleep attacks; however, they occurred three-times more frequently in the fixed night (15.3%) than other work arrangements (OR: 3.2). Driving accidents during the previous 12 months were reported by 3.6% of the workers and were associated with fixed night (OR: 3.9) and day-evening-night (OR: 2.1) work schedules. The findings of this study indicate that working outside the regular daytime hours was strongly associated with shorter sleep duration, sleepiness, and driving accident risk. Night work is the most disrupting, as it is associated with insufficient sleep during the designated rest span and excessive sleepiness and sleep attacks during the span of activity, with an associated consequence being increased driving accident risk.

The objective of the study was to determine the relative contribution of mechanical loads and dynamic neuromuscular responses to pharyngeal collapse during sleep. Sixteen obstructive sleep apnea patients and sixteen normal subjects were matched on age, sex, and body mass index. Pharyngeal collapsibility, defined by the critical pressure, was measured during sleep. The critical pressure was partitioned between its passive mechanical properties (passive critical pressure) and active dynamic responses to upper airway obstruction (active critical pressure). Compared with normal subjects, sleep apnea patients demonstrated elevated mechanical loads as demonstrated by higher passive critical pressures [-0.05 (SD 2.4) vs. -4.5 cmH2O (SD 3.0), P = 0.0003]. Dynamic responses were depressed in sleep apnea patients, as suggested by failure to lower their active critical pressures [-1.6 (SD 3.5) vs. -11.1 cmH2O (SD 5.3), P < 0.0001] in response to upper airway obstruction. Moreover, elevated mechanical loads placed some normal individuals at risk for sleep apnea. In this subset, dynamic responses to upper airway obstruction compensated for mechanical loads and maintained airway patency by lowering the active critical pressure. The present study suggests that increased mechanical loads and blunted neuromuscular responses are both required for the development of obstructive sleep apnea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00282.2006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104989536", "source": "openalex"}

Design: A prospective, longitudinal study. Setting: Referral sleep laboratory of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. Patients: 42 of the 48 eligible patients with stable congestive heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%). Measurements: After an adaptation night, polysomnography and Holter monitoring were done in the sleep laboratory. Arterial blood gases and pH were measured, and cardiac radionuclide ventriculography and pulmonary, renal, and thyroid function tests were done. Results: Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (n = 23) had an hourly rate of apnea and hypopnea (apnea–hypopnea index) of 20 episodes per hour or less; group II (n = 19 [45%; CI, 30% to 60%]) had an index of more than 20 episodes per hour. In group II, the index varied from 26.5 to 82.2 episodes per hour (mean ±SD, 44 ±13 episodes per hour; CI, 38 to 51 episodes per hour). Group II had significantly more arousals (24 ±12 compared with 3 ±3 in group I) that were directly attributable to episodes of apnea and hypopnea, longer periods of time with an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 90% (23% ±24% of total sleep time compared with 2% ±4%), lower arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep (74% ±13% compared with 87% ±4%), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (22% ±9% compared with 30% ±10%), and a significantly increased number of episodes of nocturnal ventricular arrhythmias. Multiple regression analyses showed that left ventricular systolic dysfunction was an independent risk factor for sleep apnea in patients with congestive heart failure. Conclusions: The prevalence of severe occult sleep-disordered breathing is high in ambulatory patients with stable, optimally treated chronic congestive heart failure. The breathing episodes are associated with severe nocturnal arterial blood oxyhemoglobin desaturation and excessive arousals. Severe untreated sleep-disordered breathing may adversely affect left ventricular function, resulting in a vicious cycle that could contribute to death in patients with congestive heart failure.

The association may be incidental. I studied the temporal relation between arousal and opening and impact of arousal on flow response at opening in 82 patients (apnea–hypopnea index, 46 ± 35/hour). Obstructive apneas–hypopneas were induced by dial-down of continuous positive airway pressure. Obstructions and hypopneas occurred in 44 and 56% of dial-downs, respectively. When arousal occurred (83% of dial-downs), the temporal relation between arousal and opening was inconsistent between and within patients. Frequency of opening without or before arousal increased with milder obstructions (p < 10−9) and with delta power of EEG (p < 10−6). Time of opening was unaffected by whether arousal occurred before or after opening (18.0 ± 9.8 vs. 18.1 ± 10.5 seconds). Flow response was already excessive when opening occurred without or before arousal (180 ± 148% of initial flow decline) and was considerably higher when arousal occurred (267 ± 154%, p < 10−10). Flow undershoot after first ventilatory response was greater if arousal occurred (p < 0.01). It is concluded that arousals are incidental events that occur when thresholds for arousal and for arousal-independent opening are close. They are not needed to initiate opening or to obtain adequate flow and they likely increase the severity of the disorder by promoting greater ventilatory instability.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200307-1023oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1968771781", "source": "openalex"}

Because pressure support predisposes to central apneas in healthy subjects, we examined whether the presence of a backup rate on assist-control ventilation would decrease apnea-related arousals and improve sleep quality. Sleep fragmentation, measured as the number of arousals and awakenings, was greater during pressure support than during assist-control ventilation: 79 +/- 7 versus 54 +/- 7 events per hour (p = 0.02). Central apneas occurred during pressure support in six patients; heart failure was more common in these six patients than in the five patients without apneas: 83 versus 20% (p = 0.04). Among patients with central apneas, adding dead space decreased sleep fragmentation: 44 +/- 6 versus 83 +/- 12 arousals and awakenings per hour (p = 0.02). Changes in sleep-wakefulness state caused greater changes in breath components and end-tidal CO2 during pressure support than during assist-control ventilation. In conclusion, inspiratory assistance from pressure support causes hypocapnia, which combined with the lack of a backup rate and wakefulness drive can lead to central apneas and sleep fragmentation, especially in patients with heart failure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200209-999oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2073196382", "source": "openalex"}

A baseline nocturnal sleep period was followed by one night's total sleep deprivation, then sleep at 180° phase shift, and then return to a normal nocturnal sleep episode (SP-3). Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured every 20 min (obtained by an indwelling venous catheter), rectal temperature was measured every minute, and sleep was polygraphically defined. During the first 4 h of sustained sleep, cortisol secretion was decreased even when sleep occurred during a time when the subject was usually awake; conversely, it was elevated if awake at the usual daily time of sleeping. This was not the case for the last 4 h of sleep. Body temperature was also decreased but during each entire 7-to8-h sleep period. Meals produced only a small brief rise of cortisol and produced no change in body temperature. Stage 4 sleep was increased during the 180° inverted sleep episode and decreased during SP-3. REM sleep however was increased during SP-3. A reciprocal relationship was found between REM and stages 3 and 4 for the second, third, and fourth, and sixth h of sleep for SP-3. These results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the behavioral complex of sleeping on cortisol secretion superimposed on its endogenous circadian and ultradian rhythm.

In order to examine how hypocretin activity fluctuates across 24 h with respect to the sleep–wake cycle, we measured changes in extracellular hypocretin‐1 levels in the lateral hypothalamus and medial thalamus of freely moving rats with simultaneous sleep recordings. Hypocretin levels exhibited a robust diurnal fluctuation; levels slowly increased during the dark period (active phase), and decreased during the light period (rest phase). Levels were not correlated with the amount of wake or sleep in each period. Although an acute 4 ‐ h light‐shift did not alter hypocretin levels, 6 ‐ h sleep deprivation significantly increased hypocretin release during the forced‐wake period. Hypocretin activity is, thus, likely to build up during wakefulness and decline with the occurrence of sleep. These findings, together with the fact that a difficulty in maintaining wakefulness during the daytime is one of the primary symptoms of hypocretin‐deficient narcolepsy, suggest that hypocretin activity may be critical in opposing sleep propensity during periods of prolonged wakefulness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01725.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049082572", "source": "openalex"}

In four subjects who sustained sleep while nasal pressure remained below the Pcrit, recurrent occlusive apneas were demonstrated. The relationship between maximal inspiratory airflow and nasal pressure in each subject was fit by linear regression and demonstrated upper airway Pcrit at the zero-flow intercept that were not significantly different from those observed experimentally.

Following a traumatic event, the full spectrum of PTSD symptoms typically requires several months to develop. During this time, sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nightmares, and fragmented rapid eye movement sleep predict later development of PTSD symptoms. Only a minority of individuals exposed to trauma go on to develop PTSD. We hypothesize that sleep disturbance resulting from an acute trauma, or predating the traumatic experience, may contribute to the etiology of PTSD. Because symptoms can worsen over time, we suggest that continued sleep disturbances can also maintain and exacerbate PTSD. Sleep disturbance may result in failure of extinction memory to persist and generalize, and we suggest that this constitutes one, non-exclusive mechanism by which poor sleep contributes to the development and perpetuation of PTSD. Also reviewed are neuroendocrine systems that show abnormalities in PTSD, and in which stress responses and sleep disturbance potentially produce synergistic effects that interfere with extinction learning and memory. Preliminary evidence that insomnia alone can disrupt sleep-dependent emotional processes including consolidation of extinction memory is also discussed. We suggest that optimizing sleep quality following trauma, and even strategically timing sleep to strengthen extinction memories therapeutically instantiated during exposure therapy, may allow sleep itself to be recruited in the treatment of PTSD and other trauma and stress-related disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13587-015-0018-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116745309", "source": "openalex"}

Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chest wall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associated with failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction for micrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201108-1455ci", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006640824", "source": "openalex"}

Each PSG recording was blindly scored using conventional scoring criteria, and resulting measures of total sleep period, total sleep time, sleep efficiency percent, stage 1 time, slow-wave sleep time, and rapid eye movement latency were used to compare the two subject groups within each PSG recording site (i.e. lab and home). Statistical analyses showed the normals sleepers and insomniacs evidenced similar pronounced first night effects (FNEs) when undergoing LPSG. However, neither mean values of the selected sleep parameters nor measures reflecting their night-to-night variability differentiated the insomniacs from the normal sleepers when such measures were derived from LPSG. In contrast, FNEs were generally absent for both subject groups when they underwent HPSG. Moreover, the insomniacs displayed significantly greater variability in several of their sleep measures during HPSG than did the normal sleepers. Overall, results suggest FNEs are a concern mainly when using LPSG, and HPSG may be more sensitive than LPSG for documenting sleep differences between normal sleepers and insomniacs.

The circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, generates circadian, approximately 24-hour rhythms in many physiologic functions. However, the observed hormonal oscillations do not simply reflect the output of this internal clock. Instead, daily hormonal profiles are the product of a complex interaction between the output of the circadian pacemaker, periodic changes in behavior, light exposure, neuroendocrine feedback mechanisms, gender, age, and the timing of sleep and wakefulness. The interaction of these factors can affect hormonal secretory pulse frequency and amplitude, with each endocrine system differentially affected by these factors. This chapter examines recent advances in understanding the effects on endocrine rhythms of a number of these factors. Sleep exerts a profound effect on endocrine secretion. Sleep is a dynamic process that is characterized by periodic changes in electrophysiologic activity. These electrophysiologic changes, which are used to mark the state and depth of sleep, are associated with periodic, short-term variations in hormonal levels. The secretion of hormones such as renin and human growth hormone are strongly influenced by sleep or wake state, while melatonin and cortisol levels are relatively unaffected by sleep or wake state. In addition, sleep is associated with changes in posture, behavior, and light exposure, each of which is known to affect endocrine secretion. Furthermore, the tight concordance of habitual sleep and wake times with certain circadian phases has made it difficult to distinguish sleep and circadian effects on these hormones. Specific protocols, designed to extract circadian and sleep information semi-independently, have been developed and have yielded important insights into the effects of these regulatory processes. These results may help to account for changes in endocrine rhythms observed in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including the dyssomnia of shift work and visual impairment. Yet to be fully investigated are the interactions of these factors with age and gender. Characterization of the factors governing hormone secretion is critical to understanding the temporal regulation of endocrine systems and presents many exciting areas for future research.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1492839114", "source": "openalex"}

At baseline, an abnormal left ventricular filling pattern was present in 15 of the 27 OSAS patients and only in 3 of the 15 control subjects (P=0.020). Impaired relaxation was by far the most common abnormal pattern in both groups (11 and 3 patients, respectively).

Our objective was to investigate the immunological effects of prolonged sleep restriction and subsequent recovery sleep, by simulating a working week and following recovery weekend in a laboratory environment. Methods and Findings After 2 baseline nights of 8 hours time in bed (TIB), 13 healthy young men had only 4 hours TIB per night for 5 nights, followed by 2 recovery nights with 8 hours TIB. 6 control subjects had 8 hours TIB per night throughout the experiment. Heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured after the baseline (BL), sleep restriction (SR) and recovery (REC) period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at these time points, counted and stimulated with PHA. Cell proliferation was analyzed by thymidine incorporation and cytokine production by ELISA and RT-PCR. CRP was increased after SR (145% of BL; p<0.05), and continued to increase after REC (231% of BL; p<0.05). Heart rate was increased after REC (108% of BL; p<0.05). The amount of circulating NK-cells decreased (65% of BL; p<0.005) and the amount of B-cells increased (121% of BL; p<0.005) after SR, but these cell numbers recovered almost completely during REC. Proliferation of stimulated PBMC increased after SR (233% of BL; p<0.05), accompanied by increased production of IL-1β (137% of BL; p<0.05), IL-6 (163% of BL; p<0.05) and IL-17 (138% of BL; p<0.05) at mRNA level.

Conclusions 5 nights of sleep restriction increased lymphocyte activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β IL-6 and IL-17; they remained elevated after 2 nights of recovery sleep, accompanied by increased heart rate and serum CRP, 2 important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, long-term sleep restriction may lead to persistent changes in the immune system and the increased production of IL-17 together with CRP may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004589", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063611046", "source": "openalex"}

Positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) is frequently used to treat children who have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and do not respond to adenotonsillectomy. However, no studies have evaluated objectively adherence to PAP in children, and few studies have evaluated objectively the effectiveness of PAP. The objective of this study was to determine adherence and effectiveness of PAP (both continuous [CPAP] and bilevel [BPAP] pressure) in children with obstructive apnea. METHODS. A prospective, multicenter study was performed of children who were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to 6 months of CPAP versus BPAP. Adherence was measured objectively using the equipment's computerized output. Effectiveness was evaluated using polysomnography. RESULTS. Twenty-nine children were studied. Approximately one third of children dropped out before 6 months. Of the 21 children for whom 6-month adherence data could be downloaded, the mean nightly use was 5.3 ± 2.5 (SD) hours. Parental assessment of PAP use considerably overestimated actual use. PAP was highly effective, with a reduction in the apnea hypopnea index from 27 ± 32 to 3 ± 5/hour, and an improvement in arterial oxygen saturation nadir from 77 ± 17% to 89 ± 6%. Results were similar for children who received CPAP versus BPAP. Children also had a subjective improvement in daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS. Both CPAP and BPAP are highly efficacious in pediatric obstructive apnea.

Methods: Twenty-four children with SDB completed an open-label intervention study for 16 weeks with daily montelukast therapy. Sleep studies and adenoid size estimates from lateral X-ray films of the neck were obtained before and after treatment. In a parallel study, adenoid and tonsillar tissues from children with obstructive sleep apnea or recurrent throat infections were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting for gene and protein expression of leukotriene receptors LT1-R and LT2-R, and for concentrations of LTB4 and LTC4/D4/E4. Results: Montelukast treatment induced significant reductions in adenoid size and respiratory-related sleep disturbances, which were absent in 16 children with SDB who did not receive treatment. LT1-R and LT2-R mRNA was similarly abundant in adenoid tissues, but increased LT1-R and LT2-R protein expression and higher levels of LTB4 and LTC4/D4/E4 emerged in children with obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusions: Oral therapy with a leukotriene modifier appears to be associated with improved breathing during sleep. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials will be needed to corroborate current findings and solidly establish antiinflammatory strategies, such as leukotriene modifiers, as therapeutic alternatives in children with SDB too mild to justify referral for adenotonsillectomy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200408-1064oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031933130", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment guidelines to help manage challenging behaviors in ASD fail to mention sleep at all, or they present a very limited account. Moreover, limited attention is given to children with low-functioning autism, those individuals who often experience the most severe sleep disruption and behavioral problems. This paper describes the nature of sleep difficulties in ASD and highlights the complexities of sleep disruption in individuals with low-functioning autism. It is proposed that profiling ASD children based on the nature of their sleep disruption might help to understand symptom and behavioral profiles (or vice versa) and therefore lead to better-targeted interventions. This paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of current knowledge and proposes areas that are important for future research. Treating disordered sleep in ASD has great potential to improve daytime behavior and family functioning in this vulnerable population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1866-1955-6-44", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152754204", "source": "openalex"}

In the preliminary study described here, we evaluated the extent to which symptoms of stress and depression are associated with subjective sleep complaints and quantitative measures of sleep in individuals with chronic insomnia. Methods: Subjects were 14 healthy adults who met criteria for primary insomnia as specified in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Measures of stress, depression, and subjective sleep quality were collected before subjects participated in a two-night laboratory sleep series. We hypothesized that elevated symptoms of stress and depression would be associated with subjective sleep complaints and electroencephalographic evidence of hyperarousal during sleep. Hyperarousal during sleep was defined as decreases in delta power and elevations in alpha and beta power throughout non–rapid eye movement sleep, and symptoms of stress were defined as the tendency to experience stress-related intrusive thoughts and the interaction between intrusion tendency and the number of recent stressful events (subjective stress burden). Results: A stronger tendency to experience stress-related intrusive thoughts was associated with greater sleep complaints and a trend toward higher beta power, whereas increases in subjective stress burden were associated with decreases in delta power. In addition, elevations in subclinical symptoms of depression were associated with greater sleep complaints and elevations in alpha power. Conclusions: Observed relationships among symptoms of stress, depression, subjective sleep complaints, and electroencephalographic power may be relevant to the discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep in patients with insomnia and may be more broadly applicable to sleep complaints in association with stressful life events and major depression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006842-200003000-00014", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2065546220", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, Ohayon underscored the evidence for a link between these two disorders in the general population, showing that 800 out of 100,000 individuals had both, a breathing-related sleep disorder and a major depressive disorder, with up to 20% of the subjects presenting with one of these disorders also having the other. In some populations, depending on age, gender and other demographic and health characteristics, the prevalence of both disorders may be even higher: OSA may affect more than 50% of individuals over the age of 65, and significant depressive symptoms may be present in as many as 26% of a community-dwelling population of older adults. In clinical practice, the presence of depressive symptomatology is often considered in patients with OSA, and may be accounted for and followed-up when considering treatment approaches and response to treatment. On the other hand, sleep problems and specifically OSA are rarely assessed on a regular basis in patients with a depressive disorder. However, OSA might not only be associated with a depressive syndrome, but its presence may also be responsible for failure to respond to appropriate pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, an undiagnosed OSA might be exacerbated by adjunct treatments to antidepressant medications, such as benzodiazepines. Increased awareness of the relationship between depression and OSA might significantly improve diagnostic accuracy as well as treatment outcome for both disorders. In this review, we will summarize important findings in the current literature regarding the association between depression and OSA, and the possible mechanisms by which both disorders interact. Implications for clinical practice will be discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-859x-4-13", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104275748", "source": "openalex"}

The recognition of a particularly dense innervation of orexinergic nerves in the locus coeruleus, together with the observed increase in firing rate of locus coeruleus neurons following application of orexin‐A in vitro, further highlighted a potential involvement of the peptide in modulating the arousal state. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered orexin‐A on the sleep–wake cycle of conscious rats using electroencephalographic and electromyographic recordings. When administered at the onset of the normal sleep period, orexin‐A (1, 10 or 30 μg/rat ICV) produced a dose‐dependent increase in the time rats spent awake during the second and third hours after dosing. The enhancement of arousal was accompanied by a marked reduction in paradoxical sleep and deep slow wave sleep at the highest dose. The latency to the first occurrence of paradoxical sleep was also prolonged. This overall profile of increased arousal and decreased paradoxical sleep is consistent with a high rate of firing of locus coeruleus neurons as would be expected to occur following ICV administration of orexin‐A. It is concluded that orexin‐A may play an important physiological role in regulating the sleep–wake state, a hypothesis considerably strengthened by the recently reported narcoleptic phenotype of prepro‐orexin (the precursor for orexin‐A) knockout mice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00919.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068973973", "source": "openalex"}

The drivers also had blood pressure recorded while awake, seated, and after 15 min of quiet rest. Seventy-eight percent of the drivers had an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) ≥5 per hour of sleep; 10% had an ODI ≥30 per hour of sleep. There was a significant difference in the body mass index (BMI) between drivers with ODI <5 and drivers with ODI ≥5 (25.7 ±6.0 kg/m2 in drivers with ODI <5 vs 29.0±6.3 kg/m2 in drivers with ODI ≥5, p<0.001). Sixteen percent of all drivers tested were hypertensive. Twelve percent were unaware of their hypertension. Hypertensive drivers were significantly more overweight (p<0.0001), slept more restlessly (p<0.04), took more naps (p<0.03), and woke up more frequently during the night (p<0.005). About 20% of drivers presented symptoms indicating very regular sleep disturbances. Drivers who had been with the company for more than 1 year were more likely to present daytime fatigue, daytime tiredness, unrestorative sleep, hypertension, and higher BMI. Long-haul truck drivers have very irregular sleep/wake schedules and a high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. Chronic sleep/wake disruption and partial, prolonged sleep deprivation may worsen sleep-disordered breathing. This combination of problems may impact significantly on the daytime alertness of truckers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.107.5.1275", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090442408", "source": "openalex"}

Although various rhythms occurring during the state of resting sleep (spindle, 7-14 Hz; delta, 1-4 Hz; and slow oscillation, <1 Hz) are conventionally described by using their different frequencies, they are coalesced within complex wave-sequences due to the synchronizing power of the cortically generated slow oscillation (main peak around 0.7 Hz). In intracellular recordings from anesthetized animals, the slow oscillation is characterized by a biphasic sequence consisting of a prolonged hyperpolarization and depolarization. Basically similar patterns are observed by means of extracellular discharges and/or field potentials in naturally sleeping animals and humans. The depolarizing component of the slow oscillation is transferred to the thalamus where it contributes to the synchronization of spindles over widespread territories. The association between the depolarizing component of the slow oscillation and the subsequent sequence of spindle waves forms what is termed the K-complex. The slow oscillation also groups cortically generated delta waves. At variance with previous assumptions that the brain lies for the most part in the dark and a global inhibition occurs in resting sleep, cortical cells are quite active in this behavioral state. This unexpectedly rich activity raises the possibility that, during sleep, the brain is occupied to specify/reorganize circuits and to consolidate memory traces acquired during wakefulness.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1491105838", "source": "openalex"}

All those studies that dealt with residents' moods and attitudes demonstrated deleterious effects of sleep deprivation and fatigue. The implications of this finding for patient care deserve exploration. Residents' acuity on performance tests requiring prolonged vigilance tended to deteriorate with acute sleep loss, while their performances on most brief psychomotor tests measuring manual dexterity, reaction times, and short-term recall were not adversely affected. The data presently available suggest that sleep-deprived or fatigued house officers can compensate for sleep loss in crises or other novel situations. However, sleep-deprived residents may be more prone to errors on routine, repetitive tasks and tasks that require sustained vigilance, which form a substantial portion of residents' workload.

Appropriate scheduling of polysomnography and the introduction of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) during sleep are not defined. Our aim was to determine the parameters of daytime lung function associated with sleep hypoventilation in patients with DMD. As our method we chose a prospective comparison of wakeful respiratory function (spirometry, lung volumes, maximal mouth pressures, arterial blood gases) with outcomes of polysomnography. All measurements were made with subjects breathing air. Nineteen subjects were studied. The FEV1 was correlated with PaCO2 (r = − 0.70, p < 0.001) and base excess (r = − 0.68, p < 0.01). All of these parameters were significantly related to sleep oxygenation (proportion of total sleep time spent at an SaO2 ⩽ 90% [TST < 90%]). An FEV1 < 40% was a sensitive (91%) but not specific (50%) indicator of sleep hypoventilation (TST < 90% of ⩾ 2%); a PaCO2 of ⩾ 45 mm Hg was an equally sensitive (91%) but more specific (75%) indicator while a base excess of ⩾ 4 mmol/L was highly specific (100%) but less sensitive (55%). After introduction of NIV during sleep (n = 8), there was a significant reduction in wakeful PaCO2 (54 ± 7.4 to 49.1 ± 4 mm Hg, p < 0.02) over 0.9 ± 0.4 yr despite a further decline in FEV1 (0.84 ± 0.46 to 0.64 ± 0.39 L, p < 0.05). We conclude that in patients with DMD, (1) arterial blood gases should be performed once the FEV1 falls below 40% of the predicted value; (2) polysomnography should be considered when the PaCO2 is ⩾ 45 mm Hg, particularly if the base excess is ⩾ 4 mmol/L; (3) the decrease in wakeful PaCO2 after NIV administered during sleep implicates sleep hypoventilation in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure; and (4) impaired ventilatory drive is a possible mechanism for respiratory failure, as the NIV-associated decrease in wakeful PaCO2 occurs despite a further decline in ventilatory capacity, suggesting continuing deterioration in respiratory muscle function.

The primary molecular domains affected are sympathetic activity, oxidative stress and inflammation. Other affected domains include adipokines, adhesion molecules and molecules that respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Changes in molecular domains affected by OSA, assessed in blood and/or urine, can provide a molecular signature for OSA that could potentially be used diagnostically and to predict who is likely to develop different OSA-related comorbidities. High-throughput discovery strategies such as microarrays, assessing changes in gene expression in circulating blood cells, have the potential to find new candidates and pathways thereby expanding the molecular signatures for OSA. More research is needed to fully understand the pathophysiological significance of these molecular signatures and their relationship with OSA comorbidities. Many OSA subjects are obese, and obesity is an independent risk factor for many comorbidities associated with OSA. Moreover, obesity affects the same molecular pathways as OSA. Thus, a challenge to establishing a molecular signature for OSA is to separate the effects of OSA from obesity. We propose that the optimal strategy is to evaluate the temporal changes in relevant molecular pathways during sleep and, in particular, the alterations from before to after sleep when assessed in blood and/or urine. Such changes will be at least partly a consequence of chronic intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation that occurs during sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/32.4.447", "url": "https://openalex.org/W26912437", "source": "openalex"}

Variability among individuals in sleep/wake biology and behavior is pervasive. The magnitude of such individual differences is often considerable and comparable to the effect sizes of many experimental and clinical interventions. Evidence is accumulating that certain aspects of sleep/wake-related variability—such as sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and vulnerability to the effects of sleep loss—involve trait characteristics in healthy populations and among sleep-disordered patients. Establishing the trait-specific nature of variability in sleep/wake parameters is a prerequisite for elucidating the corresponding neurophysiologic and/or genetic mechanisms. At present, it remains largely unknown what underlies or predicts sleep/wake-related traits, what relationships these traits may have to each other, and what functional significance may be associated with specific traits. Scientific studies addressing these issues are warranted, as understanding the basis of trait variability may yield new insights into sleep/wake regulation and sleep pathology. Understanding individual differences in sleep and wakefulness may also have provocative but important implications for health economics and clinical care, as well as for safety, productivity, and general well-being.

Elderly individuals tend to go to sleep earlier in the evening and wake earlier due to a phase advance in their normal circadian sleep cycle. Furthermore the development of sleep-related respiratory disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea or Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR) associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) occur with increasing prevalence in the elderly. The development of such disorders is often of major concern because they are associated with systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and impaired neurocognition.

On the one hand, REM sleep has been associated with the activation of the pons, thalamus, limbic areas, and temporo-occipital cortices, and the deactivation of prefrontal areas, in line with theories of REM sleep generation and dreaming properties. On the other hand, during non-REM (NREM) sleep, decreases in brain activity have been consistently found in the brainstem, thalamus, and in several cortical areas including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), in agreement with a homeostatic need for brain energy recovery. Benefiting from a better temporal resolution, more recent studies have characterized the brain activations related to phasic events within specific sleep stages. In particular, they have demonstrated that NREM sleep oscillations (spindles and slow waves) are indeed associated with increases in brain activity in specific subcortical and cortical areas involved in the generation or modulation of these waves. These data highlight that, even during NREM sleep, brain activity is increased, yet regionally specific and transient. Besides refining the understanding of sleep mechanisms, functional brain imaging has also advanced the description of the functional properties of sleep. For instance, it has been shown that the sleeping brain is still able to process external information and even detect the pertinence of its content. The relationship between sleep and memory has also been refined using neuroimaging, demonstrating post-learning reactivation during sleep, as well as the reorganization of memory representation on the systems level, sometimes with long-lasting effects on subsequent memory performance. Further imaging studies should focus on clarifying the role of specific sleep patterns for the processing of external stimuli, as well as the consolidation of freshly encoded information during sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/33.12.1589", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101059856", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty-nine children had obstructive apnea and 21 had primary snoring. Children with obstructive apnea had significantly greater mean BP variability during wakefulness and sleep, a higher night-to-day systolic BP, and a smaller nocturnal dipping of mean BP.

Loosing even a few hours of sleep can have detrimental effects on a wide variety of cognitive processes such as attention, language, reasoning, decision making, learning and memory. While sleep is necessary to ensure normal healthy cognitive functioning, it can also enhance performance beyond the boundaries of the normal condition. This article discusses the enhancing potential of sleep, mainly focusing on the domain of learning and memory. Sleep is known to facilitate the consolidation of memories learned before sleep as well as the acquisition of new memories to be learned after sleep. According to a widely held model this beneficial effect of sleep relies on the neuronal reactivation of memories during sleep that is associated with sleep-specific brain oscillations (slow oscillations, spindles, ripples) as well as a characteristic neurotransmitter milieu. Recent research indicates that memory processing during sleep can be boosted by (i) cueing memory reactivation during sleep, (ii) stimulating sleep-specific brain oscillations, and (iii) targeting specific neurotransmitter systems pharmacologically. Olfactory and auditory cues can be used, for example, to increase reactivation of associated memories during post-learning sleep. Intensifying neocortical slow oscillations (the hallmark of slow wave sleep) by electrical or auditory stimulation and modulating specific neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and glutamate likewise facilitates memory processing during sleep. With this evidence in mind, this article concludes by discussing different methodological caveats and ethical issues that should be considered when thinking about using sleep for cognitive enhancement in everyday applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00046", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054148526", "source": "openalex"}

Studies in all languages were considered which either investigated the association between obstructive sleep apnoea in adults and key health outcomes or evaluated the effectiveness of treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea with continuous positive airways pressure in adults. <b>Main outcome measures:</b> Mortality, systematic hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, vehicle accidents, measures of daytime sleepiness, and quality of life. <b>Results:</b> 54 epidemiological studies examined the association between sleep apnoea and health related outcomes. Most were poorly designed and only weak or contradictory evidence was found of an association with cardiac arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, and stroke. Evidence of a link with sleepiness and road traffic accidents was stronger but inconclusive. Only one small randomised controlled trial evaluated continuous positive airways pressure. Five non-randomised controlled trials and 38 uncontrolled trials were identified.

It has been postulated that there is a relation between the rate of improvement in neurobehavioral functioning and rate of decline of slow-wave sleep and/or slow-wave activity (SWS/SWA) during sleep, but this has not been verified. Thus, a cross-study comparison was conducted in which dose-response curves (DRCs) were constructed for Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) tests taken at 1000 hours by subjects who had been allowed to sleep 0 hours, 2 hours, 5 hours or 8 hours the previous night. We found that the DRCs to each PVT metric improved in a saturating exponential manner, with recovery rates that were similar [time constant (T) ≈2.14 hours] for all the metrics. This recovery rate was slightly faster than, though not statistically significantly different from, the reported rate of SWS/SWA decline (T≈2.7 hours). The DRC to the SSS improved much more slowly than psychomotor vigilance, so that it could be fit equally well by a linear function (slope = −0.26) or a saturating exponential function (T=9.09 hours). We conclude that although SWS/SWA, subjective alertness, and a wide variety of psychomotor vigilance metrics may all change asymptotically during sleep, it remains to be determined whether the underlying physiologic processes governing their expression are different.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/22.2.171", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2166252035", "source": "openalex"}

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is usually effectively treated by adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A). However, there may be a waiting list for T&amp;A, and the procedure is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications in children with OSA. Needed is a simple test that will facilitate logical prioritization of the T&amp;A surgical list and help to predict children who are at highest risk of postoperative complications. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a severity scoring system for overnight oximetry and to evaluate the score as a tool to prioritize the T&amp;A surgical list. Methods. This study comprised 3 phases. In phase 1, a severity score was developed by review of preoperative overnight oximetry in children who had urgent T&amp;A in 1999–2000. In phase 2, the score was validated retrospectively in 155 children who had polysomnography (PSG) before T&amp;A in 1992–1998. In a phase 3, a 12-month prospective evaluation of a protocol based on the score was conducted. Results. In phase 1, a 4-level severity score was developed on the basis of the number and the depth of desaturation events (normal to severely abnormal, categories 1–4). In phase 2, the McGill oximetry score correlated with severity of OSA by PSG criteria. In phase 3, a clinical management protocol was developed based on the score. Of 230 children tested, 179 (78%) had a normal/inconclusive oximetry (category 1) and went on to have PSG. Those with a positive oximetry (categories 2–4; 22%) had no additional sleep studies before T&amp;A. Timing of T&amp;A was based on oximetry score, leading to a significant reduction in waiting time for surgery for those with higher oximetry scores. Postoperative respiratory complications were more common with increasing oximetry score. Conclusions. Overnight pulse oximetry can be used to estimate the severity of OSA, to shorten the diagnostic and treatment process for those with more severe disease, and to aid clinicians in prioritization of T&amp;A and planning perioperative care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.113.1.e19", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100905560", "source": "openalex"}

There was a marked delay (over 90 minutes) in time of going to bed and waking up on weekends compared to weeknights. About 50% of the sample complained of insufficient sleep and estimated needing about half an hour more sleep on the average to feel rested. A subgroup of the sample (17%) fit the criteria for at least a mild form of delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). This delayed sleep pattern presumably arises from a delay in their endogenous biological rhythms that creates difficulty in falling asleep early enough to get sufficient sleep before necessary weekday morning awakening. Compared to the whole sample, the DSPS group less often reported sufficient sleep on weekdays and more often reported drowsiness and irritability during the day from insufficient sleep. Academic performance in their psychology course was lower for the DSPS group than for the rest of the sample and also lower than a group of sleep-disturbed but not drowsy students.

Seizures/hour was higher in NREM sleep (0.35 for NREM and 0.09 for REM; p=0.0001). For single seizures occurring in 1 night, seizure rate was significantly higher in NREM stages 1 and 2 as compared to NREM stages 3 and 4 sleep. A significant increase in log delta power, an automated measure of sleep depth, was observed in the 10 minutes prior to seizures. Both seizures and IEDs are facilitated by NREM sleep. While deeper stages of NREM sleep activate IEDs, lighter stages of NREM sleep promote seizures, at least for single seizures occurring in 1 night.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/25.8.56", "url": "https://openalex.org/W106949967", "source": "openalex"}

Using subdural and depth recordings from epileptic patients, we now report the first evidence of state-dependent hippocampal θ waves (4-7 Hz) in humans. Unlike the continuous θ in rodents, however, these oscillations were consistently observed during REM sleep in short (∼1 sec) bursts and during transitions to wake in longer epochs. θ waves were also observed in the basal temporal lobe and frontal cortex during transitions from sleep to wake and in quiet wakefulness but not in REM, and they were not coherent with hippocampal θ oscillations. The absence of functional coupling between neocortex and hippocampus during θ periods indicates that multiple θ generators exist in the human brain, and that they are dynamically regulated by brain state. γ oscillations were also present during REM θ bursts, but the fluctuations in γ power were not associated with θ phase, pointing out another significant difference between rodent and human θ properties. Together, these findings suggest that the generation mechanisms of θ oscillations in humans might have evolved from tonic to phasic in hippocampus during REM sleep and extended from hippocampus to cortex, where they appear in certain wakefulness-related states.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.23-34-10897.2003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132486749", "source": "openalex"}

We have evaluated the ability of a questionnaire to identify increased apnea activity (IAA) in 465 participants in an epidemiologic study of OSA. Subjects and their roommates each completed a questionnaire and underwent in-home sleep studies. Responses to 56 questions about sleep habits, sleepiness, and daytime performance were analyzed with factor analysis, logistic regression, and receiver-operator curves (ROCs). Factor analysis demonstrated that 16 questions, grouped into five factors (functional impact of sleepiness, self-reported breathing disturbances, roommate-observed breathing disturbances, driving impairment, and insomnia) explained 67% of the variance in the questionnaire data. Symptom questions demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations: 0.91 to 0.98). Moderate levels of agreement were observed between self- and roommate-reported responses for nine of ten questions asked of both the subject and his/her partner (kappa statistics: 0.34 to 0.57). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that IAA could be best predicted by three questions about intensity of snoring, roommate-observed choking, and having fallen asleep while driving (ROC area: 0.78). Use of symptoms with data on gender and body mass index (BMI) improved predictive ability by 10% (ROC area: 0.87). Thus, questionnaire data provide a valid means of characterizing symptom distributions in population surveys of OSA. Predictive ability is not significantly improved with multiple questions or a separate roommate questionnaire, but is improved with consideration of data on BMI and gender.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.150.3.8087345", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1989041864", "source": "openalex"}

Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant independent correlates of the AHI were the overnight changes in leg fluid volume and neck circumference, which together explained 68% of the variability in the AHI among subjects.These novel findings suggest that overnight rostral fluid displacement from the legs, related to prolonged sitting, may play a previously unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea in nonobese men that is independent of body weight.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200807-1076oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115179249", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects were patients with definite or highly probable epilepsy whose REEG lacked ED and who later underwent SDEEG. All had wakefulness and at least stage II sleep during both REEG and SDEEG. Patients with ED on REEG were specifically excluded to avoid including patients with activation due merely to the occurrence of sleep. Patient and EEG characteristics were studied, including duration of wakefulness and each sleep stage and timing and characteristics of ED. Fifteen of 29 patients(52%) had activation on SDEEG; exclusively during wakefulness in 1, exclusively during sleep in 6 and in both wakefulness and sleep in 8. Activation rates were not significantly different between wakefulness (9, 60%), stage I (11, 74%) and stage II (11, 74%). EEG characteristics were similar for REEG and SDEEG, except that total EEG duration and stage II sleep were longer in SDEEG than in REEG, which did not influence activation by a logistic regression model (p > 0.05).

The association is less clear in older persons. Most middle-aged hypertensives have systolic/diastolic hypertension, whereas isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is common among persons over 60 years. Mechanistically, only systolic/diastolic hypertension is expected to be associated with SDB, but few studies of SDB and hypertension distinguish systolic/diastolic hypertension from ISH. Prior investigations may have underestimated an association between SDB and systolic/diastolic hypertension in the elderly by categorizing individuals with ISH as simply hypertensive. Methods and Results— We conducted cross-sectional analyses of 6120 participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study, stratified by age: 40 to 59 (n=2477) and ≥60 years. Outcome measures included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; average number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep), systolic/diastolic hypertension (≥140 and ≥90 mm Hg), and ISH (≥140 and &lt;90 mm Hg). With adjustment for covariates, ISH was not associated with SDB in either age category. In those aged&lt;60 years, AHI was significantly associated with higher odds of systolic/diastolic hypertension (AHI 15 to 29.9, OR=2.38 [95% CI 1.30 to 4.38]; AHI ≥30, OR=2.24 [95% CI 1.10 to 4.54]). Among those aged ≥60 years, no adjusted association between AHI and systolic/diastolic hypertension was found. Conclusions— SDB is associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension in those aged &lt;60 years. No association was found between SDB and systolic/diastolic hypertension in those aged ≥60 years or between SDB and ISH in either age category.

Power density in the 0.25-12.0 Hz range showed a declining trend over the first four NREMS episodes, which, depending on the frequency bin, could be approximated by non-linear or linear decay functions.

This negative correlation was highest in the first NREMS episode and diminished progressively over the subsequent NREMS episodes. Within NREMS episodes, the values in the spindle frequency range showed a U-shaped time course, the trough coinciding with a high level of SWA. By contrast, in both the early and late part of the episode the two types of activity changed in the same direction.

They are all characterized by triphasic broad action potentials. They are active only during wakefulness, and their activity is related to a high level of vigilance. During waking states, they display a slow (&lt;10 Hz) tonic, repetitive, irregular firing pattern. Their activity varies in the different waking states, being lowest during quiet waking, moderate during active waking, and highest during attentive waking. They cease firing during quiet waking before the onset of EEG synchronization, the EEG sign of sleep (drowsy state), and remain silent during slow-wave sleep and paradoxical (or rapid eye movement) sleep. They exhibit a pronounced delay in firing during transitions from sleep to wakefulness or remain quiescent during the same transitions if the animals are not fully alert. They either respond with a long delay, or do not respond, to an arousing stimulus if the stimulus does not elicit an overt alert state. These data support the view that the activity of histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons plays an important role, not in the induction of wakefulness per se, but in the maintenance of the high level of vigilance necessary for cognitive processes. Conversely, cessation of their activity may play an important role in both the initiation and maintenance of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2341-06.2006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2032530293", "source": "openalex"}

Yet, a direct link between sleep restriction and alterations in molecular metabolic pathways in any peripheral human tissue has not been shown. Objective: To determine whether sleep restriction results in reduced insulin sensitivity in subcutaneous fat, a peripheral tissue that plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism and balance. Design: Randomized, 2-period, 2-condition, crossover clinical study. Setting: University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center. Participants: Seven healthy adults (1 woman, 6 men) with a mean age of 23.7 years (SD, 3.8) and mean body mass index of 22.8 kg/m2 (SD, 1.6). Intervention: Four days of 4.5 hours in bed or 8.5 hours in bed under controlled conditions of caloric intake and physical activity. Measurements: Adipocytes collected from subcutaneous fat biopsy samples after normal and restricted sleep conditions were exposed to incremental insulin concentrations. The ability of insulin to increase levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), a crucial step in the insulin-signaling pathway, was assessed. Total Akt (tAkt) served as a loading control. The insulin concentration for the half-maximal stimulation of the pAkt–tAkt ratio was used as a measure of cellular insulin sensitivity. Total body insulin sensitivity was assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Results: The insulin concentration for the half-maximal pAkt–tAkt response was nearly 3-fold higher (mean, 0.71 nM [SD, 0.27] vs. 0.24 nM [SD, 0.24]; P = 0.01; mean difference, 0.47 nM [SD, 0.33]; P = 0.01), and the total area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the pAkt–tAkt response was 30% lower (P = 0.01) during sleep restriction than during normal sleep. A reduction in total body insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02) paralleled this impaired cellular insulin sensitivity. Limitation: This was a single-center study with a small sample size.

However, the critical downstream effectors of Hcrt neurons are unknown. Here we use optogenetic, pharmacological, and computational tools to investigate the functional connectivity between Hcrt neurons and downstream noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We found that photoinhibiting LC neurons during Hcrt stimulation blocked Hcrt-mediated sleep-to-wake transitions. In contrast, when LC neurons were optically stimulated to increase membrane excitability, concomitant photostimulation of Hcrt neurons significantly increased the probability of sleep-to-wake transitions compared with Hcrt stimulation alone. We also built a conductance-based computational model of Hcrt-LC circuitry that recapitulates our behavioral results using LC neurons as the main effectors of Hcrt signaling. These results establish the Hcrt-LC connection as a critical integrator-effector circuit that regulates NREM sleep/wake behavior during the inactive period. This coupling of distinct neuronal systems can be generalized to other hypothalamic integrator nuclei with downstream effector/output populations in the brain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1202526109", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117213785", "source": "openalex"}

However, no studies have investigated the efficacy of such a routine independent of behavioral intervention. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a consistent bedtime routine on infant and toddler sleep, as well as maternal mood. 405 mothers and their infant or toddler (ages 7–18 months, n = 206; ages 18–36 months, n = 199) participated in 2 age-specific 3-week studies. Families were randomly assigned to a routine or control group. The first week of the study served as a baseline during which the mothers were instructed to follow their child's usual bedtime routine. In the second and third weeks, mothers in the routine group were instructed to conduct a specific bedtime routine, while the control group continued their child's usual routine. All mothers completed the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) on a weekly basis and a daily sleep diary, as well as completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The bedtime routine resulted in significant reductions in problematic sleep behaviors for infants and toddlers. Significant improvements were seen in latency to sleep onset and in number/duration of night wakings, P < 0.001. Sleep continuity increased and there was a significant decrease in the number of mothers who rated their child's sleep as problematic. Maternal mood state also significantly improved. Control group sleep patterns and maternal mood did not significantly change over the 3-week study period. These results suggest that instituting a consistent nightly bedtime routine, in and of itself, is beneficial in improving multiple aspects of infant and toddler sleep, especially wakefulness after sleep onset and sleep continuity, as well as maternal mood.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/32.5.599", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1951088872", "source": "openalex"}

There is evidence to suggest that the increasing prevalence of arterial hypertension in the past decade might be related both to an increased prevalence of insomnia and to the decline of sleep duration due to modern lifestyle. The aim of this paper is to reconsider both the clinical evidence of the relationship between conditions of sleep loss and of perceived impairment in sleep quality with hypertension and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the biological plausibility of their relationship. Through a systematic search from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO we selected articles, which reported experimental sleep deprivation designs, or studied sleep duration or insomnia and their relationship with blood pressure or hypertension in participants over 18 years. This analysis shows that experimental sleep deprivation, short sleep duration, and persistent insomnia are associated with increased blood pressure and increased risk of hypertension, even after controlling for other risk factors. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association might be related to inappropriate arousal (\"hyperarousal\") due to an overactivation of stress system functions. According this hypothesis, prolonged sleep loss or alterations of sleep quality might act as a neurobiological and physiologic stressor that impair brain functions and contribute to allostatic load, compromising stress resilience and somatic health.

This article summarizes the main findings of these studies and underlines some of the aspects that still need to be investigated. Insomnia complaint is one of the most studied sleep disturbances. Nearly one third of the general population complains of insomnia but a diagnosis is warranted in only 6% to 15% of the population. Excessive sleepiness is also another frequent complaint. However, its definition and method of assessment are so diverse that it is difficult to have a clear estimate of its prevalence in the general population: prevalence rates are ranging between 4% and 26%. Narcolepsy is a rare disorder with a prevalence averaging 0.04% in the general population. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome, often associated with insomnia or excessive sleepiness, is found in approximately 2% to 4% of the general population and has a higher prevalence in men than in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), depending on how it was assessed, varies from a low 1% in Asian countries to a high 19% in Northern European countries. RLS is higher in women and increases with age. Unfortunately, despite the high prevalence, sleep disorders remain poorly identified; less than 20% of individuals with insomnia are correctly diagnosed and treated. The figures are even lower for excessive sleepiness and RLS with less than 10% correctly diagnosed and treated.

Patients and controls were matched for age, sex and body weight. Results Forearm blood flow after acetylcholine infusion was reduced in patients compared with that in controls (peak flows were 6.0 ±0.7 and 9.8±1.5ml/min for 100g, respectively), but there was no difference between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. However, the hypertensive obstructive sleep apnoea group exhibited a reduced flow response to sodium nitroprusside compared with that of their corresponding hypertensive controls. Minimal forearm vascular resistance after acetylcholine infusion and after sodium nitroprusside infusion was higher in obstructive sleep apnoea patients than it was in controls. Conclusions Endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea was reduced independently of hypertension.

We analyzed the nature of long-lasting periods of neuronal silence in SWS and the changes in firing rates related to ocular movements during REM sleep and waking using intracellular recordings from electrophysiologically identified neocortical neurons in nonanesthetized and nonparalyzed cats. We found that the silent periods during SWS are associated with neuronal hyperpolarizations, which are due to a mixture of K + currents and disfacilitation processes. Conventional fast-spiking neurons (presumably local inhibitory interneurons) increased their firing rates during REMs and eye movements in waking. During REMs, the firing rates of regular-spiking neurons from associative areas decreased and intracellular traces revealed numerous, short-lasting, low-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), that were reversed after intracellular chloride infusion. In awake cats, regular-spiking neurons could either increase or decrease their firing rates during eye movements. The short-lasting IPSPs associated with eye movements were still present in waking; they preceded the spikes and affected their timing. We propose that there are two different forms of firing rate control: disfacilitation induces long-lasting periods of silence that occur spontaneously during SWS, whereas active inhibition, consisting of low-amplitude, short-lasting IPSPs, is prevalent during REMs and precisely controls the timing of action potentials in waking.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.98.4.1924", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081548183", "source": "openalex"}

However, actigraphy and sleep diaries may not measure exactly the same phenomenon. Our study aims to determine disagreement between actigraphic and diary estimates of sleep duration, and to investigate possible determinants of this disagreement. This investigation was embedded in the population-based Rotterdam Study. The study population consisted of 969 community-dwelling participants aged 57-97 years. Participants wore an actigraph and kept a sleep diary for, on average, six consecutive nights. Both measures were used to determine total sleep time (TST). In 34% of the participants, the estimated TST in the sleep diaries deviated more than 1 h from actigraphically measured TST. The level of disagreement between diary and actigraphic measures decreased with subjective and actigraphic measures of sleep quality, and increased with male gender, poor cognitive function and functional disability. Actigraphically measured poor sleep was often accompanied by longer subjective estimates of TST, whereas subjectively poor sleepers tended to report shorter TST in their diaries than was measured with actigraphy.

Specific symptoms of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep [DFA] and \"unrefreshing\" sleep), but not a syndromal definition of insomnia, were significant predictors of the development of metabolic syndrome. Loud snoring more than doubled the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and also predicted specific metabolic abnormalities (hyperglycemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). With further adjustment for AHI or the number of metabolic abnormalities at baseline, loud snoring remained a significant predictor of metabolic syndrome, whereas DFA and unrefreshing sleep were reduced to marginal significance.

Evidence is reviewed for the coexistence within the BF of mechanisms that regulate neocortical and limbic system arousal along with mechanisms that promote sleep. Arousal-related functions are mediated by a system of magnocellular cholinergic neurons. BF cholinergic neurons project monosynaptically to the entire neocortex and limbic telencephalon, exert excitatory effects on target cells and participate in the regulation of activated EEG patterns characteristic of waking and REM sleep. Evidence suggests that, within the waking state, the BF cholinergic system modulates processing of sensory information in the neocortex and is involved in cognitive processes. One or more noncholinergic cell types are responsible for the sleep-promoting functions of the BF. Neurons that display elevated discharge rates during transitions from waking to sleep and during nonREM sleep have been recorded in BF sites where electrical stimulation evokes sleep and experimental lesions cause insomnia. BF neurons function to promote sleep, in part, via descending inhibition of caudal hypothalamic and brainstem activating systems. GABAergic neurons located within magnocellular regions of the BF are hypothesized to mediate sleep-promoting actions. Afferents to the BF from hypothalamic and brainstem regions are functionally important for sleep-wake regulation. Thermosensitive inputs from the anterior hypothalamus modulate the activity of BF sleep- and arousal-related cell types. Excitatory effects of brainstem inputs to BF arousal-related cells have been documented. Additional evidence supports a critical role for GABAergic-cholinergic interactions, both within the magnocellular BF and at cortical and diencephalic sites, in the regulation of behavioral state.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/18.6.478", "url": "https://openalex.org/W21412380", "source": "openalex"}

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that sleep is involved in the off‐line reprocessing of recently‐acquired memories. In this review, we summarize the main results obtained in the field of sleep and memory consolidation in both animals and humans, and try to connect sleep stages with the different memory systems. To this end, we have collated data obtained using several methodological approaches, including electrophysiological recordings of neuronal ensembles, post‐training modifications of sleep architecture, sleep deprivation and functional neuroimaging studies. Broadly speaking, all the various studies emphasize the fact that the four long‐term memory systems (procedural memory, perceptual representation system, semantic and episodic memory, according to Tulving's SPI model; Tulving, 1995 ) benefit either from non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) (not just SWS) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, or from both sleep stages. Tulving's classification of memory systems appears more pertinent than the declarative/non‐declarative dichotomy when it comes to understanding the role of sleep in memory. Indeed, this model allows us to resolve several contradictions, notably the fact that episodic and semantic memory (the two memory systems encompassed in declarative memory) appear to rely on different sleep stages. Likewise, this model provides an explanation for why the acquisition of various types of skills (perceptual‐motor, sensory‐perceptual and cognitive skills) and priming effects, subserved by different brain structures but all designated by the generic term of implicit or non‐declarative memory, may not benefit from the same sleep stages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00450.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125031140", "source": "openalex"}

With the advent of portable touchscreen devices, this association may be extending down in age to disrupt the sleep of infants and toddlers, an age when sleep is essential for cognitive development. However, this association has not been demonstrated empirically. This study aims to examine whether frequency of touchscreen use is associated with sleep in infants and toddlers between 6 and 36 months of age. An online survey was administered to 715 parents reporting on child media use (daily exposure to TV and use of touchscreens), sleep patterns (night-time and daytime sleep duration, sleep onset - time to fall asleep, and frequencies of night awakenings). Structural equation models controlling for age, sex, TV exposure and maternal education indicated a significant association between touchscreen use and night-time sleep, daytime sleep and sleep onset. No significant effect was observed for the number of night awakenings. To our knowledge, this is the first report linking the use of touchscreen with sleep problems in infants and toddlers. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the direction of effects and the mechanisms underlying these associations using detailed sleep tracking.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606543422", "source": "openalex"}

Items for the final questionnaire were selected based on the rank order of the frequency × importance product. The rank ordering was similar across strata of disease severity and between sexes. The Calgary SAQLI has 35 questions organized into four domains: daily functioning, social interactions, emotional functioning, and symptoms. A fifth domain, treatment-related symptoms, can be added for clinical intervention trials to record the possible negative impacts of treatment. The SAQLI has a high degree of internal consistency, face validity as judged by content experts and patients, and construct validity as shown by its positive correlations with the SF-36 and the improvement in scores in patients successfully completing a 4-wk trial of continuous positive airway pressure.

A spontaneous and rhythmic alternation of brain state between activated and deactivated electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns was observed. Individual states and their transitions resembled the REM/nREM cycle of natural sleep in their EEG components, evolution, and time frame ( approximately 11 minute period). Other physiological variables such as muscular tone, respiration rate, and cardiac frequency also covaried with forebrain state in a manner identical to sleep. The brain mechanisms of state alternations under urethane also closely overlapped those of natural sleep in their sensitivity to cholinergic pharmacological agents and dependence upon activity in the basal forebrain nuclei that are the major source of forebrain acetylcholine. Lastly, stimulation of brainstem regions thought to pace state alternations in sleep transiently disrupted state alternations under urethane.Our results suggest that urethane promotes a condition of behavioural unconsciousness that closely mimics the full spectrum of natural sleep. The use of urethane anaesthesia as a model system will facilitate mechanistic studies into sleep-like brain states and their alternations. In addition, it could also be exploited as a tool for the discovery of new molecular targets that are designed to promote sleep without compromising state alternations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2079390303", "source": "openalex"}

In 11 refractory hypertensive patients with OSA, the acute effects of CPAP on nocturnal BP were studied during sleep and its longer term effects on 24-h ambulatory BP after 2 months. During a single night9s application, CPAP abolished OSA and reduced systolic BP in stage 2 sleep from 138.3±6.8 to 126.0±6.3 mmHg. There was also a trend towards a reduction in average diastolic BP (from 77.7±4.5 to 72.9±4.5). CPAP usage for 2 months was accompanied by an 11.0±4.4 mmHg reduction in 24-h systolic BP. In addition, both the nocturnal and daytime components of systolic BP fell significantly by 14.4±4.4 and 9.3±3.9 mmHg, respectively. Diastolic BP was reduced significantly at night by 7.8±3.0 mmHg.

Here, we describe sleep and activity in two neighbouring communities, one urban (Milange) and one rural (Tengua), in a region of Mozambique where urbanisation is an ongoing process. The two communities differ in the amount and timing of daily activity and of light exposure, with later bedtimes (≈1 h) associated with more evening and less daytime light exposure seen in the town of Milange. In contrast to previous reports comparing communities with and without electricity, sleep duration did not differ between Milange (7.28 h) and Tengua (7.23 h). Notably, calculated sleep quality was significantly poorer in rural Tengua than in Milange, and poor sleep quality was associated with a number of attributes more characteristic of rural areas, including more intense physical labour and less comfortable sleeping arrangements. Thus, whilst our data support the hypothesis that access to electricity delays sleep timing, the higher sleep quality in the urban population also suggests that some aspects of industrialisation are beneficial to sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05712-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2624885502", "source": "openalex"}

The characteristics of the abnormal REM sleep movements in RBD have, however, not been studied. We interviewed one hundred consecutive non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and their bed partners using a structured questionnaire assessing the presence of RBD. They rated the quality of movements, voice and facial expression during RBD as being better, equal or worse than in awake ON levodopa condition. Night-time sleep and movements were video-monitored during polysomnography in 51 patients to evaluate the presence of bradykinesia, tremor and hypophonia during REM sleep. Fifty-nine patients had clinical RBD with 53/59 bed partners able to evaluate them. All 53 (100%) reported an improvement of at least one component of motor control during RBD. By history, movements were improved in 87% patients (faster, 87%; stronger, 87%; smoother, 51%), speech was better in 77% patients (more intelligible, 77%; louder, 38%; better articulated, 57%) and facial expression was normalized in 47% patients. Thirty-eight per cent of bed partners reported that movements were 'much better', even in the most disabled patients. The video-monitored purposeful movements in REM sleep were also surprisingly fast, ample, coordinated and symmetrical, without obvious sign of parkinsonism. The movements were, however, jerky, violent and often repetitive. While all patients had asymmetrical parkinsonism when awake, most of the time they used the more disabled arm, hand and leg during the RBD (P = 0.04). Movements involved six times as often the upper limbs and the face as the lower limbs (OR: 5.9, P = 0.004). The percentage of time containing tremor EMG activity decreased with sleep stages from 34.9 ± 15.5% during wakefulness, to 3.6 ± 5.7% during non-REM sleep stages 1–2, 1.4 ± 3.0% during non-REM sleep stages 3–4, and 0.06 ± 0.2% during REM sleep (in this last case, it was subclinical tremor). The restored motor control during REM sleep suggests a transient 'levodopa-like' reestablishment of the basal ganglia loop. Alternatively, parkinsonism may disappear by REM sleep-related disjunction between pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems. We suggest the following model: the movements during the RBD would be generated by the motor cortex and would follow the pyramidal tract bypassing the extrapyramidal system. These movements would eventually be transmitted to lower motor neurons because of brainstem lesions interrupting the pontomedullary pathways which mediate the REM sleep atonia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awl363", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990744953", "source": "openalex"}

A Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) was developed using item analysis and factor analysis on items with content validity. SQS, composed of 28 items and six factors, accounted for 62.6% of the total variance. The difference of SQS score between insomniacs and normal subjects confirmed the construct validity ( t = −13.8, P = 0.000). Concurrent validity was identified by the significant correlation of SQS with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( r = 0.72, P = 0.000).

Color vision, olfaction, quantitative motor testing, and indices of depression, personality, and autonomic function were examined. <b>Results: </b> Patients demonstrated significant impairment in color discrimination and olfactory function. Patients had subtle abnormalities on quantitative testing of motor and gait speed. Autonomic symptoms were more common in patients than controls. Abnormalities were heterogeneous, with some patients scoring normally on all domains, whereas others were severely impaired on multiple domains. Dysfunction on tests of olfactory function, color vision, and motor speed were highly correlated, such that patients who performed poorly on one test tended to perform poorly on the others. <b>Conclusions: </b> Many potential early markers of Parkinson disease are significantly abnormal in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. These abnormalities are present in approximately half of the patients, suggesting a heterogenous pathophysiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000203648.80727.5b", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010055704", "source": "openalex"}

Bipolar Disord 2010: 12: 459–472. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S. Objective: Biological rhythm pathways are highlighted in a number of etiological models of bipolar disorder, and the management of circadian instability appears in consensus treatment guidelines. There are, however, significant conceptual and empirical limitations on our understanding of a hypothesised link between circadian, sleep, and emotion regulation processes in bipolar disorder. The aim of this article is to articulate the limits of scientific knowledge in relation to this hypothesis. Methods: A critical evaluation of various literatures was undertaken. The basic science of circadian and sleep processes, their involvement in normal emotion regulation, and the types of evidence suggesting circadian/sleep involvement in bipolar disorder are reviewed. Results: Multiple lines of evidence suggest that circadian and sleep‐wake processes are causally involved in bipolar disorder. These processes demonstrably interact with other neurobiological pathways known to be important in bipolar disorder, but are unique in that they are open to behavioural manipulation. Conclusion: Further research into biological rhythm pathways to bipolar disorder is warranted. Person‐environment feedback loops are fundamental to circadian adaptation, and models of circadian pathogenesis (and treatment) should recognize this complexity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-5618.2010.00843.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123362870", "source": "openalex"}

This schedule produced a sleep onset REM period (SOREMP) after the interruption at a high rate of 71.9%. We succeeded in eliciting six episodes of ISP in the sleep interruptions performed (9.4%). All episodes of ISP except one occurred from SOREMP, indicating a close correlation between ISP and SOREMP. We recorded verbal reports about ISP experiences and recorded the polysomnogram (PSG) during ISP. All of the subjects with ISP experienced inability to move and were simultaneously aware of lying in the laboratory. All but one reported auditory/visual hallucinations and unpleasant emotions. PSG recordings during ISP were characterized by a REM/W stage dissociated state, i.e. abundant alpha electroencephalographs and persistence of muscle atonia shown by the tonic electromyogram. Judging from the PSG recordings, ISP differs from other dissociated states such as lucid dreaming, nocturnal panic attacks and REM sleep behavior disorders. We compare some of the sleep variables between ISP and non-ISP nights.

Whether sleep is disrupted in aMCI and whether sleep disruptions contribute to memory impairment is unknown. We measured sleep physiology and memory for two nights and found that aMCI patients had fewer stage-2 spindles than age-matched healthy adults. Furthermore, aMCI patients spent less time in slow-wave sleep and showed lower delta and theta power during sleep compared to controls. Slow-wave and theta activity during sleep appear to reflect important aspects of memory processing, as evening-to-morning change in declarative memory correlated with delta and theta power during intervening sleep in both groups.

Sleep duration varies widely across the lifespan and shows an inverse relationship with age. Sleep duration recommendations issued by public health authorities are important for surveillance and help to inform the population of interventions, policies, and healthy sleep behaviors. However, the ideal amount of sleep required each night can vary between different individuals due to genetic factors and other reasons, and it is important to adapt our recommendations on a case-by-case basis. Sleep duration recommendations (public health approach) are well suited to provide guidance at the population-level standpoint, while advice at the individual level (eg, in clinic) should be individualized to the reality of each person. A generally valid assumption is that individuals obtain the right amount of sleep if they wake up feeling well rested and perform well during the day. Beyond sleep quantity, other important sleep characteristics should be considered such as sleep quality and sleep timing (bedtime and wake-up time). In conclusion, the important inter-individual variability in sleep needs across the life cycle implies that there is no “magic number” for the ideal duration of sleep. However, it is important to continue to promote sleep health for all. Sleep is not a waste of time and should receive the same level of attention as nutrition and exercise in the package for good health.

Population Tomorrow", "text": "EVER-INCREASING REPORTS LINKING SHORT SLEEP DURATION WITH INCREASED OBESITY HAVE PROMPTED HEATED DEBATES, EDITORIALS, AND MANY NEWS reports. With the current demand for rapid “bench to bedside” translation of research findings, the short sleep-obesity link has been widely disseminated already. The general public, health providers, and policy makers have practical questions: Does sleeping too little make you fat? Can you lose weight by sleeping longer? After nearly 700 studies, what answers can the field of sleep research offer? Cappuccio and colleagues1 have done the heavy lifting for us by gleaning the literature and abstracting data on 634,511 participants from 30 studies. The aims of their report, in this issue of Sleep, were to assess whether evidence solidly supports an association of short sleep duration and obesity, and to quantify the association using pooled data. The meta-analysis results, using dichotomous variables for sleep duration and obesity, show that compared with children sleeping >10 hours, those sleeping 10 or fewer hours/night have 89% greater odds of being obese (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.47−2.43, P 5 hours have 55% greater odds of being obese (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.43−1.68, P < 0.0001). Regression analyses with continuous variables using pooled data on adults predicted that a 1-hour/night increase in sleep was associated with a decrease of 0.35 BMI units. The authors concluded that there is consistent evidence for an increased risk of obesity with short sleep duration, but that a causal link is unproven. More prospective studies incorporating repeated measures of sleep duration and rigorous control for confounders were recommended. The authors' answer to questions about increasing sleep to lose weight would likely be “we do not know yet.” Also in this issue of Sleep is a letter from Horne expressing his consternation that the sleep-obesity link, even if causal, has been overrated in importance.2 In his letter, “Too weighty a link between short sleep and obesity,” he touches on key points common to any risk factor reduction strategy. Horne notes that the prevalence of the “exposure” is low (few people are short sleepers), the effect size is small, and suggests other outcomes of short sleep (e.g., accidents) are worse than a slight weight gain. My guess is that his answer to the individual wondering if they can sleep away their obesity would be “no.” The comprehensive review article by Cappuccio and colleagues1 and the letter to the editor by Horne2 underscore the tough issues in translating study findings into action and provide an opportunity to step outside the clinical box and consider determinants of population health. The leap from published findings to policy has always been contentious, cheered on by advocates and delayed by objective purists waiting for a better model fit.3 In addition to the soundness of findings, other factors weigh in on whether or not policy change and population initiatives are warranted, or if more research is needed. Let us consider the feasibility of increasing sleep to decrease obesity from the broader population perspective, for example, as seen by federal agencies developing Healthy People 2020 (see www.healthypeople.gov)—a program to set goals for improved population health with an emphasis on obesity in children—or policy makers considering regulation of work schedules that curtail sleep duration. Central to the goal of assessing the benefit of risk factor reduction is whether the factor has a causal role in the outcome. Cappuccio et al1 conclude that a causal link has not been proven. But, can this ever really be achieved? Causal inference in epidemiology—much simpler in the previous era of infectious diseases with necessary and sufficient causes—has evolved into a maze of argumentation, rooted in the history and philosophy of science, with no bottom line.4 Earlier schemes and checklists for scientific inferences are flawed in light of the complexity of biologic associations with gene-environment interactions and an ever-changing socioeconomic context. Biomedical scientists, described as “practitioners who use a variety of criteria to evaluate data in conditions that provide less than total certainty” must deal with a gradient in level of certainty for causality. And researchers have differed in where they set the level for the sleep-obesity link, with some concluding that there is sufficient evidence for causality and initiation of prevention strategies.5 With even a modest level of causal evidence, how compelling is the case for increasing sleep duration as a strategy to decrease obesity? Overweight and obesity are high on the list of predictors of poor health; diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, and other significant disorders have been attributed to excess weight.6 Although obesity is reversible, voluntary weight loss is difficult to sustain. Thus, preventing some fraction of obesity prevalence would be a great benefit to population health. With reduction of obesity a worthy goal, can “increased sleep” make enough of a difference? Horne2 is underwhelmed with the magnitude of the sleep-obesity link. Questioning the importance of small effect sizes is not uncommon. Reaction to findings that some risk factor causes an elevation of 3–4 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure with P < 0.001, often goes like this—“yes, it's statistically significant, but is it clinically significant?” What is missing is the consideration of whether the effect is of public health significance. Geoffrey Rose, a British epidemiologist and pioneer in prevention, clarified the distinction between “individual” and “population” in interpreting effect sizes.7 Study findings from samples of individuals are average values that express the mean of a target population; Rose stressed the value of small shifts in those population means toward healthier values. Consider the meta-analysis estimate1 that sleeping one extra hour would lower the average BMI of adults by 0.35 units, equivalent to 1–3 kg of weight depending on height. Clinically important on an individual level? No, but definitely of public health significance. Rose and Day8 demonstrated with data from 32 countries, collected in 1988, that a reduction of just 1 kg in the mean weight of a typical European population (e.g., mean BMI = 25) was equivalent to a decline in the prevalence of overweight from 6% to 4%: a reduction of 33%. This benefit would be more dramatic in the US today, where the BMI distribution has a mean of 28 and a disproportionately extended tail of extreme obesity. Prevalence of the risk factor is an important component in extrapolating the impact of a particular effect size. Horne notes 5% to 8% of adults are short sleepers, and expresses with various comparisons why he believes that the reduction of obesity attributable to increasing sleep would be trivial.2 Citing study findings of a 2-fold increased prevalence of obesity for children sleeping 10 hours/night, he correctly pointed to the less impressive results when expressed as absolute, rather than relative differences: 6% of obese children were short sleepers compared to 3.6% of the non-obese. Stressing that relatively few obese people are short sleepers and few short sleepers are obese, he implies that overall little benefit in terms of obesity could be gained by changing sleep duration. Recall, however, that not all smokers get lung cancer, and lung cancer has causes other than smoking. With a standard formula,9 I calculated the population attributable risk for children and adults, based on exposure prevalence from published data that 5% to 15% of children10 and 5% to 8% of adults are short sleepers2 and the pooled odds ratios1 (1.9 for children and 1.6 for adults). The results indicate that 5% to 13% of the total proportion of obesity in children and 3% to 5% in adults, could be attributable to short sleep. A reduction of at least 5% of the population burden of obesity would be of clear public health significance. Enthusiasm for gambling on a risk reduction strategy with only modest causal evidence should be tempered by the cost-benefit ratio. The benefits of reducing short sleep extend far beyond a reduction in obesity, as Horne pointed out,2 and costs are minimal: loss of an hour or so of wake time among those spending 19 or more hours awake per day. With public health in mind, need we delay attempts to increase sleep duration in short sleepers as a population goal until we have more longitudinal data? Undoubtedly, better studies will be conducted, effect sizes will be more precise, and casual certainty will be fine-tuned. In the meantime, with 700 studies behind us and well summarized by Cappuccio and colleagues,1 certainty that short sleep is not healthy, that short sleepers are more likely to be obese, (with a good chance that short sleep is the culprit in a meaningful number of children and adults), we do have enough to advocate for population-targeted educational initiatives and policies to increase sleep duration as a means of reducing obesity. No, I would not tell an individual that they can sleep away their obesity, but, with a moderate degree of certainty, I expect that if short sleepers increase their sleep time, the population as a whole will be healthier and rank lower in mean BMI. In the words of one renown for his logic, “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one” (Spock, Wrath of Khan, 1982).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/31.5.593", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1894883149", "source": "openalex"}

They were expressed in US dollars ($). The estimated overall cost of inadequate sleep in Australia in 2016–2017 (population: 24.8 million) was $45.21 billion. The financial cost component was $17.88 billion, comprised of as follows: direct health costs of $160 million for sleep disorders and $1.08 billion for associated conditions; productivity losses of $12.19 billion ($5.22 billion reduced employment, $0.61 billion premature death, $1.73 billion absenteeism, and $4.63 billion presenteeism); nonmedical accident costs of $2.48 billion; informal care costs of $0.41 billion; and deadweight loss of $1.56 billion. The nonfinancial cost of reduced well-being was $27.33 billion. The financial and nonfinancial costs associated with inadequate sleep are substantial. The estimated total financial cost of $17.88 billion represents 1.55 per cent of Australian gross domestic product. The estimated nonfinancial cost of $27.33 billion represents 4.6 per cent of the total Australian burden of disease for the year.

The frequency of sleep architecture modifications and circadian rhythm sleep disturbances increases with age. Although around 40% of older adults complain of poor sleep, true sleep disorders are far less prevalent in healthy older adults and are frequently associated with comorbidities. The sleep disorders observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are often similar to (but more intense than) those found in non-demented elderly people. Poor sleep results in an increased risk of significant morbidities and even mortality in demented patients and constitutes a major source of stress for caregivers. The prevalence of primary sleep disorders such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBDs), restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movements (PLMs) and sleep-disordered breathing increases with age. There are no published data on RLS and PLMs in demented persons but RBDs and sleep apnea syndrome have been studied more extensively. In fact, RBDs are suggestive of Lewy body dementia (LBD) and are predictive for neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) shares common risk factors with AD and may even be an integral part of the pathological process in AD. In MCI patients, the hypotheses in which (i) sleep disorders may represent early predictive factors for progression to dementia and (ii) MCI is symptomatic of a non-diagnosed sleep disorder remain to be elucidated. Guidelines for drug and non-drug treatments of sleep disorders in the elderly and in demented patients are also considered in this review. In healthy but frail elderly people and in early-stage AD patients, sleep should be more thoroughly characterized (notably by using standardized interviews and polysomnographic recording).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-010-0052-7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116066807", "source": "openalex"}

The prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was also analysed in relation to variables of lifestyle: physical activity, smoking, consumption of coffee, alcohol intake and sleep pattern. In both migraine and tension-type headache, the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental tension. Other common precipitants were alcohol, weather changes and menstruation. Disappearance or substantial improvement of the headache during pregnancy was more frequent in migraineurs than in tension-type headache sufferers. The age at onset of both migraine and tension-type headache differs between men and women. Female hormones may be an important factor responsible for the sex difference of headache disorders. The level of physical activity showed no association with migraine, but a significantly higher prevalence of tension-type headache in men with exclusively sedentary activity emerged.

Overall patterns in the literature suggest that over-active neurobiological and psychological systems contribute to difficulty sleeping. Even so, mixed results regarding the specific mechanisms linking hyperarousal to sleep disturbance limit current etiological conceptualizations. Similar basal arousal profiles between individuals with high vs low risk for insomnia in the absence of stress exposure suggest that dysregulated stress “response” rather than general hyperarousal may be a more pertinent marker of risk. In this report, we discuss evidence for hyperarousal in insomnia and explore the role of sleep reactivity. A trait characteristic, sleep reactivity is the degree to which stress disrupts sleep, manifesting as difficulty falling and staying asleep. Premorbid sleep reactivity has been shown to identify individuals at risk for future insomnia disorder, such as highly reactive sleepers (whose sleep systems are sensitive to stress) who are at elevated disease risk. Research points to genetics, family history of insomnia, gender, and environmental stress as factors that influence sleep reactivity. Importantly, stress-related cognitive–emotional reactivity (e.g., rumination, worry) may exploit the vulnerability of a highly reactive sleep system. We propose that sleep reactivity and cognitive–emotional reactivity may share a bidirectional relationship, conferring an insalubrious environment for sleep in response to stress. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to identify its neurobiology, characterize its relationship with cognitive–emotional reactivity, and explore the potential clinical utility of sleep reactivity in treatment planning.

One hypothesis for this gender bias is that women with sleep apnea are missed because clinical guidelines for the evaluation and diagnosis of sleep apnea, established primarily on men, are not valid for women. In this investigation, data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, a community-based study of the natural history of sleep apnea, were used to determine whether women with sleep apnea have unique symptoms or complaints. <h3>Methods:</h3> The sample comprised 551 men and 388 women, none of whom had ever been given a diagnosis of sleep apnea. Data on typical sleep apnea symptoms and other factors were obtained by interview and survey. Sleep apnea status was determined from the frequency of apneic and hypopneic events during sleep as recorded by in-laboratory, whole-night polysomnography. The sensitivity and relative predictive power of each symptom or factor for sleep apnea at different severity levels were calculated and compared by gender. <h3>Results:</h3> Regardless of severity level, women with sleep apnea did not report symptoms that differed significantly from those of men with the same level of sleep apnea. For men and women, snoring was the most sensitive and strongest predictor of sleep apnea. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Current clinical indications for sleep apnea evaluation are as appropriate for women as they are for men. Other reasons for the gender disparity in sleep apnea diagnosis, including the possibility that health care providers disregard typical symptoms in women, should be pursued.

Forty-one patients (36 men, 5 women), ranging from nonsnorers to severe OSA ( > 4% O2 dip rate, median 11.1, range 0.4 to 76.5), had polysomnography with microarousal scoring, computerized EEG analysis, autonomic arousal detection, and body movement analysis. All patients received a trial of nCPAP regardless of sleep study outcome. Spearman's correlation analysis showed significant and similar associations between all sleep fragmentation indices with both pretreatment and nCPAP responsive sleepiness. There was no deterioration in sleepiness on nCPAP in the nonsnorers. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, the best predictor of nCPAP responsive subjective and objective sleepiness was body movement index, explaining 38% and 43% of the variance, respectively. Variability in EEG sleep depth, quantified from computerized EEG analysis, was the only other index to contribute to these models. Together these indices explained 44% and 51% of the subjective and objective response to nCPAP, respectively.

To assess knowledge, screening, evaluation, treatment practices, and attitudes regarding sleep disorders in children and adolescents in a large sample of community-based and academic pediatricians. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Participants. Six hundred twenty-six pediatricians in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Instrument. The Pediatric Sleep Survey, a 42-item questionnaire assessing general and specific sleep knowledge categories; clinical screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices for common pediatric sleep disorders; and practitioner attitudes regarding the impact of sleep disorders in the clinical setting and as a public health issue. Results. On the knowledge section, the mean Total Knowledge score for the respondents was 18.1 ± 3.5 out of 30 items, with 23.5% of the sample responding correctly on half or less of the items. Pediatricians scored highest on items relating to developmental and behavioral aspects of sleep and parasomnias, whereas the mean percentage of correct responses was &amp;lt;50% for items relating to sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep movement disorders. Although only 16.5% and 18.2% of the sample reported not screening routinely for sleep disorders in infants and toddlers, this percentage rose to 43.9% in adolescents. Furthermore, only 38.3% regularly question the adolescents themselves about their sleep. Only about one quarter of the respondents screen toddlers and school-aged children for snoring. In evaluating and treating pediatric sleep problems, 53.2% of the sample never or rarely order overnight sleep studies to assess for obstructive sleep apnea and few use alternative treatment strategies, such as continuous positive airway pressure. A quarter of the sample at least occasionally recommends diphenhydramine and almost half suggests a psychological evaluation for children with night terrors. Finally, the percent of pediatricians rating the impact on children of sleep problems in a variety of domains as important or very important ranged from 49.7% (nonintentional injuries) to 92.6% (academic performance). However, only 46% of the sample felt confident or very confident about their own ability to screen for sleep problems, whereas 34.2% and 25.3% similarly rated their ability to evaluate and treat sleep problems in children. Conclusions. The results of this survey suggest that there are still significant gaps among practicing pediatricians both in basic knowledge about pediatric sleep disorders, and in the translation of that knowledge into clinical practice. Despite their acknowledgment of the importance of sleep problems, many pediatricians fail to screen adequately for them, especially in older children and adolescents.

Because of the methodological difficulties in modulating sleep, however, a causal link between specific sleep features and human memory consolidation is lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated specific sleep features during a daytime nap via direct pharmacological intervention. Using zolpidem (Ambien), a short-acting GABA A agonist hypnotic, we show increased sleep spindle density and decreased REM sleep compared with placebo and sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Naps with increased spindles produced significantly better verbal memory and significantly worse perceptual learning but did not affect motor learning. The experimental spindles were similar to control spindles in amplitude and frequency, suggesting that the experimental intervention enhanced normal sleep processes. Furthermore, using statistical methods, we demonstrate for the first time a critical role of spindles in human hippocampal memory performance.

While sleep is recognized as an essential component of this approach, the amount and quality of sleep routinely obtained by elite athletes has not been systematically evaluated. Data were collected from 70 nationally ranked athletes from seven different sports. Athletes wore wrist activity monitors and completed self-report sleep/training diaries for 2 weeks during normal training. The athletes also recorded their fatigue level prior to each training session using a 7-point scale. On average, the athletes spent 08:18 ± 01:12 h in bed, fell asleep at 23:06 ± 01:12 h, woke at 6:48 ± 01:30 h and obtained 06:30 ± 01:24 h of sleep per night. There was a marked difference in the athletes' sleep/wake behaviour on training days and rest days. Linear mixed model analyses revealed that on nights prior to training days, time spent in bed was significantly shorter (p = 0.001), sleep onset and offset times were significantly earlier (p < 0.001) and the amount of sleep obtained was significantly less (p = 0.001), than on nights prior to rest days. Moreover, there was a significant effect of sleep duration on pre-training fatigue levels (p ≤ 0.01). Specifically, shorter sleep durations were associated with higher levels of pre-training fatigue. Taken together, these findings suggest that the amount of sleep an elite athlete obtains is dictated by their training schedule. In particular, early morning starts reduce sleep duration and increase pre-training fatigue levels. When designing schedules, coaches should be aware of the implications of the timing of training sessions for sleep and fatigue. In cases where early morning starts are unavoidable, countermeasures for minimizing sleep loss - such as strategic napping during the day and correct sleep hygiene practices at night - should be considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/07420528.2014.957306", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133579161", "source": "openalex"}

However, the relationship between sleep processes, disease development, disease progression and disease management is often unclear or understudied. Numerous common medical conditions can have an affect on sleep. For example, diabetes or inflammatory conditions such as arthritis can lead to poor sleep quality and induce symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue. It has also been suggested that poor sleep may lead to the development of cardiovascular disease for which an underlying inflammatory component has been proposed. It is therefore important that the development and progression of such disease states are studied to determine whether the sleep effect merely reflects disease progression or whether it may be in some way causally related. Sleep loss can also have consequences on safety related behaviours both for the individuals and for the society, for example the increased risk of accidents when driving while drowsy. Sleep is a complex phenotype and as such it is possible that there are numerous genes which may each have a number of effects that control an individuals sleep pattern.

Employing Fourier-based techniques, the product of the coherence and cross-power of these 2 simultaneous signals was used to generate a spectrographic representation of cardiopulmonary coupling dynamics during sleep. This technique shows that non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults demonstrates spontaneous abrupt transitions between high- and low-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling regimes, which have characteristic electroencephalogram, respiratory, and heart-rate variability signatures in both health and disease. Using the kappa statistic, agreement with standard sleep staging was poor (training set 62.7%, test set 43.9%) but higher with cyclic alternating pattern scoring (training set 74%, test set 77.3%). A sleep spectrogram derived from information in a singlelead electrocardiogram can be used to dynamically track cardiopulmonary interactions.

Here we review evidence for an active system consolidation occurring during sleep. At the beginning of this process is sleep's ability to preserve episodic experiences preferentially encoded in hippocampal networks. Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories, redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them to decontextualized schema-like representations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations regulate the underlying communication: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples coalescing with thalamic spindles mediate the bottom-up transfer of reactivated memory information to extrahippocampal regions. Neocortical slow oscillations exert a supraordinate top-down control to synchronize hippocampal reactivations of specific memories to their excitable up-phase, thus allowing plastic changes in extrahippocampal regions. We propose that reactivations during sleep are a general mechanism underlying the abstraction of temporally stable invariants from a flow of input that is solely structured in time, thus representing a basic mechanism of memory formation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-neuro-062012-170429", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2106011868", "source": "openalex"}

These tasks were selected because they allow dissociation of some important executive processes from non-executive components of cognition. Subjects were randomized to a total sleep deprivation condition or a control condition. Performance on the executive functions task battery was assessed at baseline, after 51 h of total sleep deprivation (or no sleep deprivation in the control group), and following 2 nights of recovery sleep, at fixed time of day (11:00). Performance was also measured repeatedly throughout the experiment on a control task battery, for which the effects of total sleep deprivation had been documented in previously published studies. Six consecutive days and nights in a controlled laboratory environment with continuous behavioral monitoring. Twenty-three healthy adults (age range 22–38 y; 11 women). Twelve subjects were randomized to the sleep deprivation condition; the others were controls. Performance on the control task battery was considerably degraded during sleep deprivation. Overall performance on the modified Sternberg task also showed impairment during sleep deprivation, as compared to baseline and recovery and compared to controls. However, two dissociated components of executive functioning on this task—working memory scanning efficiency and resistance to proactive interference—were maintained at levels equivalent to baseline. On the probed recall task, resistance to proactive interference was also preserved. Executive aspects of performance on the phonemic verbal fluency task showed improvement during sleep deprivation, as did overall performance on this task. Sleep deprivation affected distinct components of cognitive processing differentially. Dissociated non-executive components of cognition in executive functions tasks were degraded by sleep deprivation, as was control task performance. However, the executive functions of working memory scanning efficiency and resistance to proactive interference were not significantly affected by sleep deprivation, nor were dissociated executive processes of phonemic verbal fluency performance. These results challenge the prevailing view that executive functions are especially vulnerable to sleep loss. Our findings also question the idea that impairment due to sleep deprivation is generic to cognitive processes subserved by attention.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/33.1.47", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1604504550", "source": "openalex"}

Studies of patients who underwent adjunctive procedures at the time of MMA (including tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and partial glossectomy) were excluded. <h3>Data Extraction</h3> Three coauthors systematically reviewed the articles and updated the review through March 16, 2015. The PRISMA statement was followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and analyzed from July 1, 2014, to September 23, 2015. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcomes were changes in the AHI and RDI after MMA for each patient. Secondary outcomes included surgical success, defined as the percentage of patients with more than 50% reduction of the AHI to fewer than 20 events/h, and OSA cure, defined as a post-MMA AHI of fewer than 5 events/h. <h3>Results</h3> Forty-five studies with individual data from 518 unique patients/interventions were included. Among patients for whom data were available, 197 of 268 (73.5%) had undergone prior surgery for OSA. Mean (SD) postoperative changes in the AHI and RDI after MMA were −47.8 (25.0) and −44.4 (33.0), respectively; mean (SE) reductions of AHI and RDI outcomes were 80.1% (1.8%) and 64.6% (4.0%), respectively; and 512 of 518 patients (98.8%) showed improvement. Significant improvements were also seen in the mean (SD) postoperative oxygen saturation nadir (70.1% [15.6%] to 87.0% [5.2%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (13.5 [5.2] to 3.2 [3.2];<i>P</i> &lt; .001).

Preoperative AHI of fewer than 60 events/h was the factor most strongly associated with the highest incidence of surgical cure. Nevertheless, patients with a preoperative AHI of more than 60 events/h experienced large and substantial net improvements despite modest surgical cure rates. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Maxillomandibular advancement is an effective treatment for OSA.

The aim of this paper is to report an investigation of the effects of soft music on sleep quality in older community‐dwelling men and women in Taiwan. Background. Sleep is a complex rhythmic state that may be affected by the ageing process. Few studies have focused on the effects of music, a non‐pharmacological method of improving the quality of sleep in older adults. Method. A randomized controlled trial was used with a two‐group repeated measures design. Sixty people aged 60–83 years with difficulty in sleeping were recruited through community leaders and screened using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Those reporting depression, cognitive impairment, medical or environmental problems that might interfere with sleep; and those who used sleeping medications, meditation, or caffeine at bedtime were excluded. Participants listened to their choice among six 45‐minute sedative music tapes at bedtime for 3 weeks. There were five types of Western and one of Chinese music. Sleep quality was measured with the PSQI before the study and at three weekly post‐tests. Groups were comparable on demographic variables, anxiety, depressive symptoms, physical activity, bedtime routine, herbal tea use, napping, pain, and pretest overall sleep quality. Results. Music resulted in significantly better sleep quality in the experimental group, as well as significantly better components of sleep quality: better perceived sleep quality, longer sleep duration, greater sleep efficiency, shorter sleep latency, less sleep disturbance and less daytime dysfunction ( P = 0·04–0·001). Sleep improved weekly, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Conclusion. The findings provide evidence for the use of soothing music as an empirically‐based intervention for sleep in older people.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03281.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981306249", "source": "openalex"}

Secondary aims were to examine demographic variables related to these diagnoses and to examine the frequency of prescriptions for medications potentially used to treat sleep disorders. METHODS: Electronic medical records were reviewed for 154957 patients (0–18 years) seen for a well-child visit in 2007. Information collected included ICD-9 sleep diagnoses, demographic variables, comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders, provider type, and medications. RESULTS: Across all ages, 3.7% of youths had an ICD-9 diagnosis for a sleep disorder. The most-common diagnoses were sleep disorder not otherwise specified, enuresis, and sleep-disordered breathing. Predictors of sleep disorders varied according to developmental age group and included growth parameters, comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorder, and provider type. Potential sleep-related medications were prescribed for 6.1% of the sample subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first to examine comprehensively ICD-9 sleep diagnoses given by primary care providers in a large representative sample of children 0 to 18 years of age. The 3.7% of patients with ICD-9 sleep diagnoses is significantly lower than prevalence rates reported in epidemiological studies, which suggests that primary care providers may be underdiagnosing sleep disorders in children and adolescents. Because sleep disorders are treatable when recognized, the results from this study suggest a significant need for additional education and support for primary care providers in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric sleep disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2009-2725", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2163448503", "source": "openalex"}

Following an adaptation night in the laboratory, healthy young adults were randomly assigned to either a night of total sleep deprivation (SD group; n = 15) or to a night of normal sleep (non‐SD group; n = 14) under controlled laboratory conditions. The following day, subjective reports of mood and sleepiness, objective sleepiness (Multiple Sleep Latency Test and spontaneous oscillations in pupil diameter, PUI), affective reactivity/regulation (pupil dilation responses to emotional pictures), and psychomotor vigilance performance (PVT) were measured. Sleep deprivation had a significant impact on all three domains (affect, sleepiness, and vigilance), with significant group differences for eight of the nine outcome measures. Exploratory factor analyses performed across the entire sample and within the SD group alone revealed that the outcomes clustered on three orthogonal dimensions reflecting the method of measurement: physiological measures of sleepiness and affective reactivity/regulation, subjective measures of sleepiness and mood, and vigilance performance. Sleepiness and affective responses to sleep deprivation were associated (although separately for objective and subjective measures). PVT performance was also independent of the sleepiness and affect outcomes. These findings suggest that objective and subjective measures represent distinct entities that should not be assumed to be equivalent. By including affective outcomes in experimental sleep deprivation research, the impact of sleep loss on affective function and their relationship to other neurobehavioral domains can be assessed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00635.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110812565", "source": "openalex"}

In the present study, we aimed to delineate the frequency and clinical characteristics of post-traumatic SWD, to assess CSF hypocretin-1 levels 6 months after TBI, and to identify risk factors for posttraumatic SWD. A total of 96 consecutive patients were enrolled within the first 4 days after TBI. Six months later, out of 76 TBI patients, who did not die and who did not move to foreign countries, we included 65 patients (86%, 53 males, mean age 39 years) in our study. Patients were examined using interviews, questionnaires, clinical examinations, computed tomography of the brain, laboratory tests (including CSF hypocretin-1 levels, and HLA typing), conventional polysomnography, maintenance of wakefulness and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) and actigraphy. Potential causes of post-traumatic SWD were assessed according to international criteria. New-onset sleep-wake disturbances following TBI were found in 47 patients (72%): subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS; defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale > or = 10) was found in 18 (28%), objective EDS (as defined by mean sleep latency < 5 min on MSLT) in 16 (25%), fatigue (daytime tiredness without signs of subjective or objective EDS) in 11 (17%), post-traumatic hypersomnia 'sensu strictu' (increased sleep need of > or = 2 h per 24 h compared to pre-TBI) in 14 (22%) patients and insomnia in 3 patients (5%). In 28 patients (43% of the study population), we could not identify a specific cause of the post-traumatic SWD other than TBI. Low CSF hypocretin-1 levels were found in 4 of 21 patients 6 months after TBI, as compared to 25 of 27 patients in the first days after TBI. Hypocretin levels 6 months after TBI were significantly lower in patients with post-traumatic EDS. There were no associations between post-traumatic SWD and severity or localization of TBI, general clinical outcome, gender, pathological neurological findings and HLA typing. However, post-traumatic SWD correlated with impaired quality of life. These results suggest that sleep-wake disturbances, particularly EDS, fatigue and hypersomnia are common after TBI, and significantly impair quality of life. In almost one out of two patients, post-traumatic SWD appear to be directly related to the TBI. An involvement of the hypocretin system in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic SWD appears possible.

Plasma LH and T were also measured in one boy during a delayed sleep onset study. Polygraphic monitoring was carried out to identify precisely sleep onset. Wakefulness, and specific sleep stages. In all nine pubertal boys the plasma T concentration fluctuated and was significantly higher during normal nocturnal sleep as compared to daytime waking. This increased T secretion during sleep was temporally linked to the characteristic pubertal sleep augmentation of LH secretion. To define further the relationship of this increased T secretion to sleep, plasma LH and T were also measured in three of the pubertal boys after acute (1-day) reversal of the sleep-wake cycle. One of these boys was also studied after 3 days of sleep-wake cycle reversal. The results of these studies showed that plasma T was now augmented during the reversed daytime sleep period; the mean T concentrations during this period were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than during nocturnal waking in all four studies. Measurement of plasma LH and T in the three sexually mature young men showed episodic secretion of LH and T during both waking and sleep periods; there was no consistent significant augmentation of LH or T secretion during sleep. This study demonstrates that (a) in normal pubertal boys and sexually mature young men plasma T fluctuates episodically; (b) there is marked augmentation of T secretion during sleep in pubertal boys, which is dependent on increased LH secretion; (c) this pubertal LH-T secretory \"program\" is dependent on sleep, since it shifts with delayed sleep onset and reversal of the sleep-wake cycle; and (d) this demonstrable tropic effect of LH on T is evident only during puberty, since sexually mature young men fail to show any consistent relationship between LH and T secretion either awake or asleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci107798", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046659727", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we show that male pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos), a polygynous Arctic breeding shorebird, are able to maintain high neurobehavioral performance despite greatly reducing their time spent sleeping during a 3-week period of intense male-male competition for access to fertile females. Males that slept the least sired the most offspring. Our results challenge the view that decreased performance is an inescapable outcome of sleep loss.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1220939", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066210642", "source": "openalex"}

In diverse animal taxa, poor sleep negatively impacts development, cognitive abilities and longevity. In addition to mammals, sleep has been characterized in genetic model organisms, ranging from the nematode worm to zebrafish, and, more recently, in emergent models with simplified nervous systems such as Aplysia and jellyfish. In addition, evolutionary models ranging from fruit flies to cavefish have leveraged natural genetic variation to investigate the relationship between ecology and sleep. Here, we describe the contributions of classical and emergent genetic model systems to investigate mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. These studies highlight fundamental interactions between sleep and sensory processing, as well as a remarkable plasticity of sleep in response to environmental changes. Understanding how sleep varies throughout the animal kingdom will provide critical insight into fundamental functions and conserved genetic mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Furthermore, identification of naturally occurring genetic variation regulating sleep may provide novel drug targets and approaches to treat sleep-related diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.159533", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2807828646", "source": "openalex"}

Nine healthy adults (4 female, 5 male) slept with a mask glued to the face with medical silicone rubber and breathed from a closed valveless biased flow circuit, including an in-line bag-in-box and a variable soda-lime absorber. Progressive hypoxia was induced by consumption of oxygen and by gradual replacement of circuit volume with nitrogen. Tidal volume was measured by electrical integration of the flow signal from a pneumotach on the box. Arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured with an ear oximeter and end-tidal CO2 tension (PetCO2) was measured continuously and kept constant by variable absorption. Sleep state was identified using standard criteria with 2 channels each of EEG, submental EMG, and EOG. There was marked variability in arousal level both in NREM and REM sleep, with subjects failing to awaken by 70% SaO2, our previously agreed safety limit, on 12 of 26 NREM tests, and 7 of 15 REM tests. During wakefulness, the mean slope +/- SEM of the ventilatory response to hypoxia was 0.68 +/- 0.07 L/min% SaO2 (n = 36, mean PetCO2 = 37.0 mmHg). In NREM sleep, this response decreased to a mean of 0.42 +/- 0.06 L/min/% SaO2 (n = 26, mean PetCO2 = 37.2 mmHg). In REM sleep, the average ventilatory response was further decreased to 0.33 +/- 0.06 L/min/% SaO2 (n = 15, mean PetCO2 = 37.8 mmHg). Analysis of variance showed a significant state-dependent effect on ventilatory response (p less than 0.01). The wake-NREM and wake-REM differences were significantly different (p less than 0.05), but the NREM-REM difference was not (p greater than 0.2). In REM sleep, breath-to-breath variability was marked, and in 2 cases, the response was not significantly different from zero. In all 3 states, the entire ventilatory response was due to increments in tidal volume. We conclude that (1) at normal alveolar CO2 tension, hypoxia is a poor arousal stimulus in humans, both in NREM and REM sleep, and (2) the eucapnic hypoxic response is reduced but present in NREM sleep and similarly reduced but not always present in REM sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/arrd.1982.125.6.632", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1957999332", "source": "openalex"}

We therefore evaluated polysomnographic sleep disturbances in PTSD.A representative cohort of young-adult community residents followed-up for 10 years for exposure to trauma and PTSD was used to select a subset for sleep studies for 2 consecutive nights and the intermediate day. Subjects were selected from a large health maintenance organization and are representative of the geographic area except for the extremes of the socioeconomic status range. The subset for the sleep study was selected from the 10-year follow-up of the cohort (n = 913 [91% of the initial sample]). Eligibility criteria included (1) subjects exposed to trauma during the preceding 5 years; (2) others who met PTSD criteria; and (3) a randomly preselected subsample. Of 439 eligible subjects, 292 (66.5%) participated, including 71 with lifetime PTSD. Main outcomes included standard polysomnographic measures of sleep induction, maintenance, staging, and fragmentation; standard measures of apnea/hypopnea and periodic leg movement; and results of the multiple sleep latency test.On standard measures of sleep disturbance, no differences were detected between subjects with PTSD and control subjects, regardless of history of trauma or major depression in the controls. Persons with PTSD had higher rates of brief arousals from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Shifts to lighter sleep and wake were specific to REM and were significantly different between REM and non-REM sleep (F(1,278) = 5.92; P =.02).We found no objective evidence for clinically relevant sleep disturbances in PTSD. An increased number of brief arousals from REM sleep was detected in subjects with PTSD.

The aim was to identify cut‐off values and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of these values taken separately or combined to diagnose idiopathic RBD patients. Eighty patients presenting with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic RBD and 80 age‐ and gender‐matched normal controls were studied in the sleep laboratory. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to find optimal cut‐off values for three REM sleep EMG parameters. Tonic and phasic EMG activity were measured in the chin, but not in the limbs. Videos were examined during the recording but were not systematically reviewed by the authors. Total correct classification of 81.9% was found for tonic chin EMG density ≥30%; 83.8% for phasic chin EMG density ≥15% and 75.6% for ≥24 leg movements per hour of REM sleep. Five patients did not fulfill any of these three polysomnographic (PSG) criteria. Conversely, one subject of the control group met the PSG criteria for RBD. This study estimates the diagnostic value of a visual scoring method for the diagnosis of idiopathic RBD and establishes cut‐off values to be used in clinical and research set‐ups. For the five RBD patients who did not show chin EMG abnormalities, it cannot be excluded that they had increased phasic EMG activity in the upper limbs and presented visible motor activity. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.23257", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114427578", "source": "openalex"}

Although studies in human epileptic patients have reported that both FRs and ripples (80–200Hz) chiefly occur during non–rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and that ripple oscillations in human hippocampus resemble those found in nonprimate slow wave sleep, quantitative studies of these oscillations previously have not been conducted during polysomnographically defined sleep and waking states. Spontaneous FRs and ripples were detected using automated computer techniques in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy during sleep and waking, and results showed that the incidence of ripples, which are thought to represent normal activity in animal and human hippocampus, was similar between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic temporal lobe, whereas rates of FR occurrence were significantly associated with epileptogenic areas. The generation of both FRs and ripples showed the highest rates of occurrence during NREM sleep. During REM sleep, ripple rates were lowest, whereas FR rates remained elevated and were equivalent to rates observed during waking. The predominance of FRs within the epileptogenic zone not only during NREM sleep, but also during epileptiform‐suppressing desynchronized episodes of waking and REM sleep supports the view that FRs are the product of pathological neuronal hypersynchronization associated with seizure‐generating areas.

Orexin contributes to the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle by increasing arousal levels and maintaining wakefulness. <h3>Objectives</h3> To study cerebrospinal fluid levels of orexin in patients with AD, to evaluate the relationship of orexin cerebrospinal fluid levels with the degree of dementia and the cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers (tau proteins and β-amyloid 1-42), and to analyze potentially related sleep architecture changes measured by polysomnography. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> We conducted a case-control study from August 1, 2012, through May 31, 2013. We included 48 drug-naive AD patients referred to the Neurological Clinic of the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. Based on the Mini-Mental State Examination score, 21 patients were included in mild AD group (score, ≥21), whereas 27 were included in the moderate to severe AD group (score, &lt;21). The control group consisted of 29 nondemented participants of similar age and sex. <h3>Exposure</h3> Laboratory assessment of cerebrospinal fluid levels of orexin, tau proteins, and β-amyloid 1-42 and polysomnographic assessment of sleep variables. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Levels of orexin, tau proteins, and β-amyloid 1-42; macrostructural variables of nocturnal sleep (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep latencies, non-REM and REM sleep stages, and wakefulness after sleep onset); and Mini-Mental State Examination scores. <h3>Results</h3> Patients with moderate to severe AD presented with higher mean (SD) orexin levels compared with controls (154.36 [28.16] vs 131.03 [26.55];<i>P</i> &lt; .01) and with more impaired nocturnal sleep with respect to controls and patients with mild AD. On the other hand, in the global AD group, orexin levels were positively correlated with total tau protein levels (<i>r</i> = 0.32;<i>P</i> = .03) and strictly related to sleep impairment. Finally, cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, was correlated with sleep structure deterioration. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Our results demonstrate that, in AD, increased cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels are related to a parallel sleep deterioration, which appears to be associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, the orexinergic system seems to be dysregulated in AD, and its output and function appear to be overexpressed along the progression of the neurodegenerative process. This overexpression may result from an imbalance of the neurotransmitter networks regulating the wake-sleep cycle toward the orexinergic system promoting wakefulness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.2510", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2015603515", "source": "openalex"}

Standardized residual measures adjusted for age, sex and BMI were analyzed. Multipoint variance components linkage analysis was performed. Association of SNPs to sleep phenotypes was analyzed with both population-based and family-based association tests, with analysis limited to 70,987 autosomal SNPs with minor allele frequency > or =10%, call rate > or =80%, and no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > or = 0.001).Heritability of sleepiness was 0.29, bedtime 0.22, and sleep duration 0.17. Both genotype and sleep phenotype data were available for 749 subjects. Linkage analysis revealed five linkage peaks of LOD >2: four to usual bedtime, one to sleep duration. These peaks include several candidate sleep-related genes, including CSNK2A2, encoding a known component of the circadian molecular clock, and PROK2, encoding a putative transmitter of the behavioral circadian rhythm from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Association tests identified an association of usual bedtime with a non-synonymous coding SNP in NPSR1 that has been shown to encode a gain of function mutation of the neuropeptide S receptor, whose endogenous ligand is a potent promoter of wakefulness. Each copy of the minor allele of this SNP was associated with a 15 minute later mean bedtime.

The propensity of sleep initiation (PSI), as measured by the multiple sleep latency test, remains at a relatively constant level throughout the habitual period of waking or exhibits a midafternoon peak. When waking is extended into the sleep period, PSI rises rapidly within a few hours. In contrast, sleep intensity, as measured by electroencephalographic slow-wave activity during naps, shows a gradual increase during the period of habitual waking. In the two-process model of sleep regulation, it corresponds to the rising limb of the homeostatic Process S. We propose that PSI is determined by the difference between Process S and the threshold H defining sleep onset, which is modulated by the circadian process C. In contrast to a previous version of the model, the parameters of H (amplitude, phase, skewness) differ from those of threshold L, which defines sleep termination. The present model is able to simulate the time course of PSI under baseline conditions as well as following recovery sleep after extended sleep deprivation. The simulations suggest that during the regular period of waking, a circadian process coun teracts the increasing sleep propensity induced by a homeostatic process. Data obtained in the rat indicate that during the circadian period of predominant waking, a circadian process prevents a major intrusion of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/074873048900400205", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013449746", "source": "openalex"}

Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome can influence sleep quality. Previous studies that have examined sleep deprivation and the human gut microbiome have yielded conflicting results. A recent study found that sleep deprivation leads to changes in gut microbiome composition while a different study found that sleep deprivation does not lead to changes in gut microbiome. Accordingly, the relationship between sleep physiology and the gut microbiome remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, we used actigraphy to quantify sleep measures coupled with gut microbiome sampling to determine how the gut microbiome correlates with various measures of sleep physiology. We measured immune system biomarkers and carried out a neurobehavioral assessment as these variables might modify the relationship between sleep and gut microbiome composition. We found that total microbiome diversity was positively correlated with increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time, and was negatively correlated with wake after sleep onset. We found positive correlations between total microbiome diversity and interleukin-6, a cytokine previously noted for its effects on sleep. Analysis of microbiome composition revealed that within phyla richness of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were positively correlated with sleep efficiency, interleukin-6 concentrations and abstract thinking. Finally, we found that several taxa (Lachnospiraceae, Corynebacterium, and Blautia) were negatively correlated with sleep measures. Our findings initiate linkages between gut microbiome composition, sleep physiology, the immune system and cognition.

As a polysomnographic finding, central apneas occur in many pathophysiological conditions. Depending on the cause or mechanism, central apneas may not be clinically significant, for example, those that occur normally at sleep onset. In contrast, central apneas occur in a number of disorders and result in pathophysiological consequences. Central apneas occur commonly in high-altitude sojourn, disrupt sleep, and cause desaturation. Central sleep apnea also occurs in number of disorders across all age groups and both genders. Common causes of central sleep apnea in adults are congestive heart failure and chronic use of opioids to treat pain. Under such circumstances, diagnosis and treatment of central sleep apnea may improve quality of life, morbidity, and perhaps mortality. The mechanisms of central sleep apnea have been best studied in congestive heart failure and hypoxic conditions when there is increased CO2 sensitivity below eupnea resulting in lowering eupneic PCO2 below apneic threshold causing cessation of breathing until the PCO2 rises above the apneic threshold when breathing resumes.

Periodic breathing was the predominant pattern of breathing in all stages of non-rapid eye movement (non-r.e.m.) sleep in hypoxia, but was rarely observed during wakefulness or r.e.m. sleep. Periodic breathing was composed of repetitive oscillations of reproducible cycle length characterized by clusters of breaths with augmented inspiratory effort (VT/TI) and highly variable distribution of breath-to-breath minute ventilation (VE) and tidal volume (VT), which alternated regularly with prolongations of the expiratory pause of the last breath of each cluster (apnea duration = 5-18 sec). Hypoxia-induced periodic breathing was eliminated by: (a) acute restoration of normoxia coincident with a 3-6 torr increase in Pa,CO2; and (b) augmented FI,CO2 (at constant arterial oxygen saturation) which rapidly and reversibly eliminated apneas and stabilized breathing pattern with a less than 2 torr increase in Pa,CO2. If hypocapnia was prevented (by augmented FI,CO2) during acute induction of hypoxia in non-r.e.m. sleep, periodic breathing was also prevented. We propose that the genesis of hypoxia-induced periodic breathing requires the combination of hypoxia and hypocapnia.

Headaches associated with nocturnal sleep have often been perceived as either the cause or result of disrupted sleep. An understanding of the anatomy and physiology of both conditions allows for a clearer understanding of this complex relationship and a more rational clinical and therapeutic approach. Recent biochemical and functional imaging studies in patients with primary headache disorders has lead to the identification of potential central generators which are also important for the regulation of normal sleep architecture. Medical conditions (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea, depression) that may disrupt sleep and lead to nocturnal or morning headache can often be identified on clinical evaluation or by polysomnography. In contrast, primary headache disorders which often occur during nocturnal sleep or upon awakening, such as migraine, cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and hypnic headache, can readily be diagnosed through clinical evaluation and managed with appropriate medication. These disorders, when not associated with co-morbid mood disorders or medications/analgesics overuse, seldom lead to significant sleep disruption. Identifying and classifying the specific headache disorder in patients with both headache and sleep disturbances can facilitate an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Patients with poorly defined nocturnal or awakening headaches should undergo polysomnography to exclude a treatable sleep disturbance, especially in the absence of an underlying psychological disorder or analgesic overuse syndrome. In patients with a well defined primary headache disorder, unless there are compelling historical or examination findings suggestive of a primary sleep disturbance, a formal sleep evaluation is seldom necessary.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-4610.2003.03055.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155291849", "source": "openalex"}

Occurrence of REM sleep and the NREM-REM sleep cycle are probably determined by a balance or interaction between the cholinergic and cholinoceptive REM sleep-on neuronal populations and the monoaminergic REM sleep-off neuronal population. Neural activities producing generalized muscle atonia in REM sleep originate mainly in dorsolateral portions of the pontine reticular formation, descend through the medulla and spinal cord, and inhibit the motoneurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, bringing about postural atonia. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis are pathological, dissociated manifestations of the generalized muscle atonia characteristic REM sleep. Cataplexy is triggered by emotional stimuli, probably through activation of the neural structure generating the muscle atonia of REM sleep. During long-lasting cataplectic attacks, narcoleptic humans often experience sleep paralysis and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations in the latter sleep state. Sleep paralysis is caused by the marked dissociation between level of alertness and muscle atonia that often occurs in SOREM sleep episodes. Frequent SOREM sleep episodes in narcoleptic humans and dogs may occur when some of the neural mechanisms producing wakefulness and/or NREM sleep that normally inhibit the occurrence of REM sleep are abnormally weak, or when neural mechanisms facilitating the occurrence of REM sleep are hypersensitive or hyperactive, or both. Both abnormalities may contribute to the occurrence of SOREM sleep episodes and sleep paralysis, and also to the emotional triggering of cataplexy. Frequent occurrence of SOREM sleep episodes seems to be prerequisite but not sufficient for the occurrence of cataplexy. Some additional neural activities induced by emotion also contribute by inhibiting and/or activating the disturbed neural mechanisms related to SOREM sleep episodes. These abnormalities in neural mechanisms probably involve hypersensitivity or hyperactivity of muscarinic cholinergic and/or cholinoceptive neuronal populations in the pontine and suprapontine structures, and/or abnormally decreased activity of noradrenergic or serotonergic neuronal populations in the pons and/or other brainstem structures. This last monoaminergic neuronal population probably has a gating or inhibiting effect upon the cholinergic and cholinoceptive neuronal populations related to the generation of generalized muscle atonia and REM sleep. In spite of many studies and published reports on REM sleep, as well as on cataplexy and sleep paralysis, we are still far from a complete understanding of the physiological mechanisms producing muscle atonia in REM sleep and of the pathophysiological mechanisms of cataplexy and sleep paralysis--though it is apparent that these mechanisms are closely related.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2404918717", "source": "openalex"}

We followed 74 patients with a DSM‐III‐R diagnosis of alcohol dependence, of whom 36 relapsed to at least some drinking during an average follow‐up interval of 5 months. Univariate analyses revealed that relapsed patients did not differ from abstinent patients at baseline in demographics or psychiatric co‐morbidity, but they had more prior treatment episodes for alcoholism, more difficulty falling asleep, more complaints of abnormal sleep, and, on polysomnography, longer sleep latencies, shorter rapid eye movement sleep latencies, and less stage 4 sleep percentage than abstinent patients. With a series of logistic regression analyses, which controlled for age and gender, we demonstrated that sleep measures improved the prediction model compared with non‐sleep variables alone, and that polysomnography‐measured sleep latency was the most significant predictor variable.

The 78 loci further associate with accelerometer-derived sleep duration, daytime inactivity, sleep efficiency and number of sleep bouts in secondary analysis ( n = 85,499). Loci are enriched for pathways including striatum and subpallium development, mechanosensory response, dopamine binding, synaptic neurotransmission and plasticity, among others. Genetic correlation indicates shared links with anthropometric, cognitive, metabolic, and psychiatric traits and two-sample Mendelian randomization highlights a bidirectional causal link with schizophrenia.

Sleep complaints predict coronary artery disease mortality in males: a 12‐year follow‐up study of a middle‐aged Swedish population. J Intern Med 2002; 251: 207–216. Objectives. Only a few prospective surveys have been performed to investigate the relationship between sleep complaints and coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality. This study was conducted to determine whether sleep complaints in a middle‐aged population predicted total mortality and CAD mortality. Design. A population‐based prospective study. Setting. The County of Dalarna, Sweden. Subjects and methods. In 1983, a random sample of 1870 subjects aged 45–65 years responded to a postal questionnaire (response rate 70.2%) including questions about sleep complaints and various diseases. Mortality data for the period 1983–95 were collected, and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to examine the mortality risks. Results. At 12‐year follow‐up 165 males (18.2%) and 101 females (10.5%) had died. After adjustment for a wide range of important putative risk factors, difficulties initiating sleep (DIS) were related to CAD death in males [relative risk (RR), 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5–6.3; P &lt; 0.01], but not in females. Short or long sleep duration did not influence risk of CAD mortality or total mortality for either gender. Depression in males increased the risk of death attributed to CAD (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1–8.4; P &lt; 0.05) and total mortality (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.5; P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion.

Differences in efficacy and compliance of these treatments are likely to influence improvements in health outcomes.Objectives: To compare health effects after 1 month of optimal CPAP and MAD therapy in OSA.Methods: In this randomized crossover trial, we compared the effects of 1 month each of CPAP and MAD treatment on cardiovascular and neurobehavioral outcomes.Measurements and Main Results: Cardiovascular (24-h blood pressure, arterial stiffness), neurobehavioral (subjective sleepiness, driving simulator performance), and quality of life (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Short Form-36) were compared between treatments. Our primary outcome was 24-hour mean arterial pressure. A total of 126 patients with moderate-severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index [AHI], 25.6 [SD 12.3]) were randomly assigned to a treatment order and 108 completed the trial with both devices. CPAP was more efficacious than MAD in reducing AHI (CPAP AHI, 4.5 ± 6.6/h; MAD AHI, 11.1 ± 12.1/h; P < 0.01) but reported compliance was higher on MAD (MAD, 6.50 ± 1.3 h per night vs. CPAP, 5.20 ± 2 h per night; P < 0.00001). The 24-hour mean arterial pressure was not inferior on treatment with MAD compared with CPAP (CPAP-MAD difference, 0.2 mm Hg [95% confidence interval, −0.7 to 1.1]); however, overall, neither treatment improved blood pressure. In contrast, sleepiness, driving simulator performance, and disease-specific quality of life improved on both treatments by similar amounts, although MAD was superior to CPAP for improving four general quality-of-life domains.Conclusions: Important health outcomes were similar after 1 month of optimal MAD and CPAP treatment in patients with moderate-severe OSA. The results may be explained by greater efficacy of CPAP being offset by inferior compliance relative to MAD, resulting in similar effectiveness.Clinical trial registered with https://www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN 12607000289415).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201212-2223oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143712404", "source": "openalex"}

Despite their proposed function in learning and memory, their role in synaptic plasticity is essentially unknown. We studied the ability of a neuronal firing pattern underlying spindles in vivo to induce synaptic plasticity in neocortical pyramidal cells in vitro. A spindle stimulation pattern (SSP) was extracted from a slow oscillation upstate that was recorded in a cat anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine, which is known to induce a sleep-like state. To mimic the recurrence of spindles grouped by the slow oscillation, the SSP was repeated every 1.5 s (0.6 Hz). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal cells of rat somatosensory cortex with infrared videomicroscopy, and composite EPSPs were evoked within layers II-III. Trains of EPSPs and action potentials simultaneously triggered by the SSP induced an NMDA receptor-dependent short-term potentiation (STP) and an L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). The number of spindle sequences affected the amount of STP-LTP. In contrast, spindle trains of EPSPs alone led to long-term depression. LTP was not consistently induced by a regular firing pattern, a mirrored SSP, or a randomized SSP; however, a synthetic spindle pattern consisting of repetitive spike bursts at 10 Hz reliably induced STP-LTP. Our results show that spindle-associated spike discharges are efficient in modifying excitatory neocortical synapses according to a Hebbian rule. This is in support of a role for sleep spindles in memory consolidation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2149-05.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2003326720", "source": "openalex"}

To understand how intrahippocampal networks interact during REM sleep, we used 96 site silicon probes to record from different hippocampal subregions and compared the patterns of activity during waking exploration and REM sleep. Dentate/CA3 theta and gamma synchrony was significantly higher during REM sleep compared with active waking. In contrast, gamma power in CA1 and CA3–CA1 gamma coherence showed significant decreases in REM sleep. Changes in unit firing rhythmicity and unit-field coherence specified the local generation of these patterns. Although these patterns of hippocampal network coordination characterized the more common tonic periods of REM sleep (∼95% of total REM), we also detected large phasic bursts of local field potential power in the dentate molecular layer that were accompanied by transient increases in the firing of dentate and CA1 neurons. In contrast to tonic REM periods, phasic REM epochs were characterized by higher theta and gamma synchrony among the dentate, CA3, and CA1 regions. These data suggest enhanced dentate processing, but limited CA3–CA1 coordination during tonic REM sleep. In contrast, phasic bursts of activity during REM sleep may provide windows of opportunity to synchronize the hippocampal trisynaptic loop and increase output to cortical targets. We hypothesize that tonic REM sleep may support off-line mnemonic processing, whereas phasic bursts of activity during REM may promote memory consolidation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1227-08.2008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046203847", "source": "openalex"}

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The task force evaluated a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically relevant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that underpin the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations. The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific behavioral and psychological therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adult patients. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength (\"strong\" or \"conditional\"). A \"strong\" recommendation (ie, \"We recommend…\") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A \"conditional\" recommendation is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience, and to strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action. 1. We recommend that clinicians use multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (STRONG). 2. We suggest that clinicians use multicomponent brief therapies for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 3. We suggest that clinicians use stimulus control as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 4.

These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6–8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (∼5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low-level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3981-16.2017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2619879339", "source": "openalex"}

The endogenous somnogen prostaglandin (PG) D2 increases the extracellular level of adenosine under the subarachnoid space of the basal forebrain and promotes physiological sleep. Adenosine is neither stored nor released as a classical neurotransmitter and is thought to be formed inside cells or on their surface, mostly by breakdown of adenine nucleotides. The extracellular concentration of adenosine increases in the cortex and basal forebrain during prolonged wakefulness and decreases during the sleep recovery period. Therefore, adenosine is proposed to act as a homeostatic regulator of sleep and to be a link between the humoral and neural mechanisms of sleep-wake regulation. Both the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) and A2AR are involved in sleep induction. The A2AR plays a predominant role in the somnogenic effects of PGD2. By use of genemanipulated mice, the arousal effect of caffeine was shown to be dependent on the A2AR. On the other hand, inhibition of wake-promoting neurons via the A1R also mediates the sleep-inducing effects of adenosine, whereas activation of A1R in the lateral preoptic area induces wakefulness, suggesting that A1R regulates the sleep-wake cycle in a site-dependent manner. The potential therapeutic applications of agonists and antagonists of these receptors in sleep disorders are briefly discussed.

This study examined sleep between shift types (day, evening, night), and alertness and performance during day and night shifts in 52 intensive care workers. Sleep and wake duration between shifts were evaluated using wrist actigraphs and diaries. Subjective sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) and Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) performance were examined during day shift, and on the first and subsequent night shifts (3 rd , 4 th or 5 th ). Circadian phase was assessed using urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin rhythms. Sleep was most restricted between consecutive night shifts (5.74 ± 1.30 h), consecutive day shifts (5.83 ± 0.92 h) and between evening and day shifts (5.20 ± 0.90 h). KSS and PVT mean reaction times were higher at the end of the first and subsequent night shift compared to day shift, with KSS highest at the end of the first night. On nights, working during the circadian acrophase of the urinary melatonin rhythm led to poorer outcomes on the KSS and PVT. In rotating shift workers, early day shifts can be associated with similar sleep restriction to night shifts, particularly when scheduled immediately following an evening shift. Alertness and performance remain most impaired during night shifts given the lack of circadian adaptation to night work. Although healthcare workers perceive themselves to be less alert on the first night shift compared to subsequent night shifts, objective performance is equally impaired on subsequent nights.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40914-x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2921419167", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods A total of 823 patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 58 years; 597 female patients) reported on sleep difficulties in a prospective study. Results During day 7 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy, 36.6% (n = 301) of the patients with cancer reported insomnia symptoms, and 43% (n = 362) met the diagnostic criteria for insomnia syndrome. Patients with cancer younger than 58 years were significantly more likely to experience either symptoms of insomnia or insomnia syndrome (χ 2 = 13.6; P = .0002). Patients with breast cancer had the highest number of overall insomnia complaints. A significant positive association was found between symptoms of insomnia during cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy (ϕ = .62, P &lt; .0001), showing persistence of insomnia during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. Sixty percent of the patient sample reported that their insomnia symptoms remained unchanged from cycle 1 to cycle 2. Those with insomnia complaints had significantly more depression and fatigue than good sleepers (all P &lt; .0001). Conclusion The proportions of patients with cancer in this sample reporting symptoms of insomnia and meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia syndrome during chemotherapy are approximately three times higher than the proportions reported in the general population.

There is strong evidence that childhood SDB is associated with deficits in behavior and emotion regulation, scholastic performance, sustained attention, selective attention, and alertness. There is also evidence that SDB has minimal association with a child's typical mood, expressive language skills, visual perception, and working memory. Findings have been insufficient to draw conclusions about intelligence, memory, and some aspects of executive functioning. Mechanisms by which SDB might result in neurobehavioral morbidity are being explored, but clinical symptoms such as chronic snoring remain the best predictors of morbidity. Short-term SDB treatment outcome studies are encouraging, but the long-term outcomes are not known. Failing to treat SDB appears to leave children at risk for long-term neurobehavioral deficits.Childhood SDB is associated with neurobehavioral morbidity. Applying commonly used guidelines for causal inference, even in the absence of a much-needed randomized clinical trial, there is strong evidence of association, consistent findings, and specificity of effect. There is suggestive evidence that this association fits the expected temporal pattern and that SDB is a biologically plausible cause of neurobehavioral deficits.

Regional assessment of gray matter development from neuroimaging studies reveals a posteroanterior trajectory of cortical maturation in the first three decades of life (Shaw et al., 2008). Our aim was to test whether this regional cortical maturation is reflected in regional changes of sleep SWA. We evaluated all-night high-density EEG (128 channels) in 55 healthy human subjects (2.4–19.4 years) and assessed age-related changes in NREM sleep topography. As in adults, we observed frequency-specific topographical distributions of sleep EEG power in all subjects. However, from early childhood to late adolescence, the location on the scalp showing maximal SWA underwent a shift from posterior to anterior regions. This shift along the posteroanterior axis was only present in the SWA frequency range and remained stable across the night. Changes in the topography of SWA during sleep parallel neuroimaging study findings indicating cortical maturation starts early in posterior areas and spreads rostrally over the frontal cortex. Thus, SWA might reflect the underlying processes of cortical maturation. In the future, sleep SWA assessments may be used as a clinical tool to detect aberrations in cortical maturation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2532-10.2010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152960647", "source": "openalex"}

It has been assumed that this decrease in non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep consolidation reflects an age‐related attenuation of the sleep homeostatic drive. To test this hypothesis, we measured sleep EEG characteristics (i.e., SWA, sleep spindles) in healthy older volunteers in response to high (sleep deprivation protocol) and low sleep pressure (nap protocol) conditions. Despite the fact that the older volunteers had impaired sleep consolidation and reduced SWA levels, their relative SWA response to both high and low sleep pressure conditions was similar to that of younger persons. Only in frontal brain regions did we find an age‐related diminished SWA response to high sleep pressure. On the other hand, we have clear evidence that the circadian regulation of sleep during the 40 h nap protocol was changed such that the circadian arousal signal in the evening was weaker in the older study participants. More sleep occurred during the wake maintenance zone, and subjective sleepiness ratings in the late afternoon and evening were higher than in younger participants. In addition, we found a diminished melatonin secretion and a reduced circadian modulation of REM sleep and spindle frequency—the latter was phase‐advanced relative to the circadian melatonin profile. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that age‐related changes in sleep are due to weaker circadian regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Our data suggest that manipulations of the circadian timing system, rather than the sleep homeostat, may offer a potential strategy to alleviate age‐related decrements in sleep and daytime alertness levels.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/07420520500545813", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1966147077", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this study was to examine relationships among infant sleep patterns, maternal fatigue, and the development of postpartum depression in women with no major depressive symptomatology at 1 week postpartum . Methods: As part of a population‐based postpartum depression study, 505 women who had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score &lt; 13 at 1 week postpartum completed questionnaires at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum . Results: Mothers exhibiting major depressive symptomatology (EPDS &gt; 12) at 4 and 8 weeks were significantly more likely to report that their baby cried often, be woken up 3 times or more between 10 pm and 6 am , have received less than 6 hours of sleep in a 24‐hour period over the past week, indicate that their baby did not sleep well, and think that their baby's sleep pattern did not allow them to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Consistent with these findings, mothers with an EPDS score &gt; 12 were significantly more likely to respond that they often felt tired . Conclusions: These results suggest that infant sleep patterns and maternal fatigue are strongly associated with a new onset of depressive symptoms in the postpartum period, and provide support for the development of postpartum depression preventive interventions designed to reduce sleep deprivation in the early weeks postpartum.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0730-7659.2005.00368.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2073647183", "source": "openalex"}

Ten subjects (five males and five females) participated in each group. The subjects were healthy and sound sleepers. All sleep recordings were preceded by an adaptation night which aimed at excluding the presence of sleep-related disorders. The recordings were carried out in a partially soundproof recording chamber and in a standard laboratory setting. Arousal indices (AI), defined as the number of arousals per hour of sleep, were calculated for total sleep time (AI/TST) and for all the sleep stages. AI/TST increased linearly with age (r = 0.852; p < 0.00001): teenagers (13.8), young adults (14.7), middle-aged (17.8), elderly (27.1). An age-related positive linear correlation was found also for the arousal indices referred to NREM sleep (r = 0.811; p < 0.00001) and to stages 1 and 2 (r = 0.712; p < 0.00001), while in stages 3 and 4 and in REM sleep, arousal indices showed stable values across the ages. Overall, arousals lasted 14.9 +/- 2.3 seconds, with arousal duration stable across the ages (range of means: 13.3-16.6 seconds) and no relevant differences between NREM sleep (14.6 +/- 2.5 seconds) and REM sleep (16.2 +/- 5 seconds). The paper discusses the impact of age on arousals, the similarities between arousals and the phases d'activation transitoire, and the consideration that arousals are physiological components of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/21.4.361", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2184318380", "source": "openalex"}

On the other hand, epidemiological and interventional studies suggest that OSA increases the cardiovascular risk, and a link between OSA and glucose metabolism has been suggested, via reduced sleep duration and/or quality. Evidence Acquisition: We reviewed the medical literature for key articles through June 2009. Evidence Synthesis: Some endocrine and metabolic conditions (obesity, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary disease, etc.) can be associated with OSA. The pathophysiological mechanisms of OSA in these cases are reviewed. In rare instances, OSA may be improved or even cured by treatment of underlying endocrine disorders: this is the case of hypothyroidism and acromegaly, situations in which OSA is mainly related to upper airways narrowing due to reversible thickening of the pharyngeal walls. However, when irreversible skeletal defects and/or obesity are present, OSA may persist despite treatment of endocrine disorders and may thus require complementary therapy. This is also frequently the case in patients with obesity, even after substantial weight reduction. Conclusions: Given the potential neurocognitive consequences and increased cardiovascular risk associated with OSA, specific therapy such as continuous positive airway pressure is recommended if OSA persists despite effective treatment of its potential endocrine and metabolic causes. “Apropos of sleep, that sinister adventure of all our nights, we might say that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be incomprehensible if we did not know that it is the result of ignorance of the danger.” Charles Baudelaire, in “Fusées, IX”", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-1912", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104719134", "source": "openalex"}

Participants were children (N = 13 988) alive at 1 year and followed up with repeated measures of self-reported AD and sleep through 16 years of age. This study was based on data collected from 1990 to 2008. Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to September 2018.Standardized measure of sleep duration and composite measure of sleep quality, including nighttime awakenings, early morning awakenings, difficulty falling asleep, and nightmares, were repeated at multiple time points between 2 and 16 years of age.The study sample comprised 13 988 children (7220 male [51.6%]) followed up for a median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 11 (5-14) years. Of this total, 4938 children (35.3%) met the definition of having atopic dermatitis between 2 and 16 years of age. Total sleep duration was similar between children with active AD and without AD at all ages, and the average estimated difference across childhood was a clinically negligible difference of 2 minutes less per day for children with AD (95% CI, -4 to 0 minutes). In contrast, children with active AD were more likely to report worse sleep quality at all time points, with a nearly 50% higher odds of experiencing more sleep-quality disturbances (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.66). Children with more severe active disease (quite bad or very bad AD: aOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.98) and with comorbid asthma or allergic rhinitis (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.54 to 2.09) had worse sleep quality.

Morphometric analysis was performed on UA tissue from nonsnoring control subjects (n = 7) and patients with OSA (n = 11) following palatal surgery. As compared with control subjects, inflammatory cells were increased in the muscular layer of patients with OSA, with CD4+ and activated CD25+ T cells (both increased ∼ threefold) predominating. Inflammation was also present in UA mucosa, but with a different pattern consisting of CD8+ (2.8-fold increase) and activated CD25+ (3.2-fold increase) T cell predominance. As ascertained by immunoreactivity for the panneuronal marker PGP9.5, there was a dramatic (5.7-fold) increase in intramuscular nerve fibers in OSA patients compared with control subjects, as well as direct evidence of denervation based on positive immunostaining of the muscle fiber sarcolemmal membrane for the neural cell adhesion molecule in patients with OSA.

Over the past 2 years, we have noted a dramatic increase in the incidence of deformation of the occipital skull in our tertiary referral center. Our patient referral base has not changed appreciably over the past 5 years and patients have been referred from the same primary practitioner base. The timing of this increase correlates closely with the acceptance in our area of recommended changes in sleeping position to supine or side positioning for infants because of the fear of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A total of 51 infants with occipital cranial deformity, with a mean age of 5.5 months at presentation, have been evaluated and treated by a single craniofacial surgeon in the 16-month period from September 1993 to December 1994. Older infants were treated with continuous positioning by the parent keeping the infant off the involved side. Younger infants and those with poor head control were treated with a soft-shell helmet. Mean timing of initial diagnosis and start of treatment was 5.5 months. Mean duration of helmet for positional treatment was 3.8 months. To date, only 3 of 51 patients have required surgical intervention, and other patients demonstrated spontaneous improvement of all measured parameters. Follow up has ranged from 8 to 24 months. We believe that most occipital plagiocephaly deformities are deformations rather than true cranio-synostoses. Despite varying amounts of suture abnormality evidenced on computed tomographic scans, most deformities can be corrected without surgery. In cases where progression of the cranial deformity occurs, despite conservative therapy, surgical intervention should be undertaken at approximately 1 year of age. The almost universal acceptance in the State of North Carolina of positioning neonates on their backs to avoid SIDS, may well increase the incidence of these deformities in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001665-199601000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063231915", "source": "openalex"}

Cytokines including IL1 and TNF partake in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) regulation under physiological and inflammatory conditions. Administration of exogenous IL1 or TNF mimics the accumulation of these cytokines occurring during sleep loss to the extent that it induces the aforementioned symptoms. Extracellular ATP associated with neuro- and glio-transmission, acting via purine type 2 receptors, e.g., the P2X7 receptor, has a role in glia release of IL1 and TNF. These substances in turn act on neurons to change their intrinsic membrane properties and sensitivities to neurotransmitters and neuromodulators such as adenosine, glutamate and GABA. These actions change the network input-output properties, i.e., a state shift for the network. State oscillations occur locally within cortical columns and are defined using evoked response potentials. One such state, so defined, shares properties with whole animal sleep in that it is dependent on prior cellular activity--it shows homeostasis. The cortical column sleep-like state is induced by TNF and is associated with experimental performance detriments. ATP released extracellularly as a consequence of cellular activity is posited to initiate a mechanism by which the brain tracks its prior sleep-state history to induce/prohibit sleep. Thus, sleep is an emergent property of populations of local neural networks undergoing state transitions. Specific neuronal groups participating in sleep depend upon prior network use driving local network state changes via the ATP-cytokine-adenosine mechanism. Such considerations add complexity to finding biochemical markers for sleepiness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.1360", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011324347", "source": "openalex"}

A review from 1985 to 2005 of the English literature reveals several practical findings. Weight loss has additional health benefits and should be routinely recommended to most overweight patients. Presently, there are no widely effective pharmacotherapies for individuals with sleep apnea, with the important exceptions of individuals with hypothyroidism or with acromegaly. Treating the underlying medical condition can have pronounced effects on the apnea/hypopnea index. Stimulant therapy leads to a small but statistically significant improvement in objective sleepiness. Nonetheless, residual sleepiness remains a significant health concern. Supplemental oxygen and positional therapy may benefit subsets of patients, but whether these therapies reduce morbidities as PAP therapy does will require rigorous randomized trials. PAP therapy has set the bar high for successful treatment of sleep apnea and its associated morbidities. Nonetheless, we should strive towards the development of universally effective pharmacotherapies for sleep apnea. To accomplish this, we require a greater knowledge of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying sleep apnea, and we must use this infrastructure of knowledge to design well-controlled, adequately powered studies that examine, not only effects on the apnea/hypopnea index, but also the effects of pharmacotherapies on all health related outcomes shown beneficial with PAP therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/29.8.1036", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101884932", "source": "openalex"}

The converse may also be true, in that metabolic abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance may potentially exacerbate sleep disorders.

Other studies showed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are responsible for the formation of new myelin in both the injured and the normal adult brain, and that glutamate released from neurons, via neuron–OPC synapses, can inhibit OPC proliferation and affect their differentiation into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Because glutamatergic transmission is higher in wake than in sleep, we asked whether sleep and wake can affect oligodendrocytes and OPCs. Using the translating ribosome affinity purification technology combined with microarray analysis in mice, we obtained a genome-wide profiling of oligodendrocytes after sleep, spontaneous wake, and forced wake (acute sleep deprivation). We found that hundreds of transcripts being translated in oligodendrocytes are differentially expressed in sleep and wake: genes involved in phospholipid synthesis and myelination or promoting OPC proliferation are transcribed preferentially during sleep, while genes implicated in apoptosis, cellular stress response, and OPC differentiation are enriched in wake. We then confirmed through BrdU and other experiments that OPC proliferation doubles during sleep and positively correlates with time spent in REM sleep, whereas OPC differentiation is higher during wake. Thus, OPC proliferation and differentiation are not perfectly matched at any given circadian time but preferentially occur during sleep and wake, respectively.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.5102-12.2013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046964445", "source": "openalex"}

Male patients (n=595) with suspected OSAS underwent both nocturnal polysomnography and a 2-h oral glucose-tolerance test with measurements of fasting and postload blood glucose and plasma insulin. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the ratio of fasting glucose to fasting insulin. OSAS was diagnosed in 494 patients, while 101 patients were nonapnoeic snorers. Type-2 diabetes was present in 30.1% of OSAS patients and 13.9% of nonapnoeic snorers. IGT was diagnosed in 20.0% of OSAS patients and 13.9% of nonapnoeic snorers. Fasting and postload blood glucose increased with severity of sleep apnoea. Insulin sensitivity decreased with increasing severity of sleep apnoea. In addition to body mass index and age, the apnoea/hypopnoea index independently influenced postload blood glucose and insulin sensitivity.

Method Twelve white-collar workers on long-term sick leave (&gt;3 months) and 12 healthy controls with high and low scores on the Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) were included. A 1-night polysomnographic recording (after habituation) was carried out at home, and sleepiness and mental fatigue were rated at different times of the day for weekdays and the weekend. Precipitating factors at the time of the illness at work and real life were considered, and different dimensions of occupational fatigue were described. A repeated-measures analysis of variance using two or three within group factors was used to analyze the data. Results The main polysomnographic findings were more arousals and sleep fragmentation, more wake time and stage-1 sleep, lower sleep efficiency, less slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, and a lower delta power density in nonrapid eye movement sleep in the burnout group. The burnout patients showed pronounced sleepiness and mental fatigue at most times of the day for weekdays without reduction during weekends. The precipitating factor was occupational stress (psychiatric interview), and work stress indicators were increased. Conclusions Occupational burnout is characterized by impaired sleep.

Recent findings Poor sleep is increasingly common in children and associations between short sleep duration in early childhood and obesity are consistently found. Less is known about the infancy period, and the findings in adolescents are inconsistent. Sleep timing patterns may also contribute to obesity risk. Variable and shifted sleep schedules and evening chronotypes have recently been linked to adiposity in adults; less is known about children. Further, there is little understanding regarding the mechanisms of association. The timing of eating, dietary intake, obesogenic eating behaviors, and changes in appetite-regulating hormones have been identified as possible mechanisms for sleep–obesity associations and may be promising avenues for future research. Longitudinal and experimental work with children is needed to determine the nature of associations. Summary Beyond sleep duration, sleep timing patterns may contribute to obesity risk.

These results led us to examine whether neurons in the extended VLPO are activated during REM sleep and the connectivity of these neurons with pontine sites implicated in producing REM sleep: the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and locus ceruleus (LC). After periods of dark exposure that triggered enrichment of REM sleep, the number of Fos-positive cells in the extended VLPO was highly correlated with REM but not NREM sleep. In contrast, the number of Fos-positive cells in the VLPO cluster was correlated with NREM but not REM sleep. Sixty percent of sleep-active cells in the extended VLPO and 90% of sleep-active cells in the VLPO cluster in dark-treated animals contained galanin mRNA. Retrograde tracing from the LDT, DRN, and LC demonstrated more labeled cells in the extended VLPO than the VLPO cluster, and 50% of these in the extended VLPO were sleep-active. Anterograde tracing showed that projections from the extended VLPO and VLPO cluster targeted the cell bodies and dendrites of DRN serotoninergic neurons and LC noradrenergic neurons but were not apposed to cholinergic neurons in the LDT.

To improve the definition of the disorder and establish diagnostic criteria with levels of certainty, a consensus conference using formal recommended methodology was held in Bologna in September 2014. It was recommended that the name be changed to sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), reflecting evidence that the attacks are associated with sleep rather than time of day, the seizures may arise from extrafrontal sites, and the motor aspects of the seizures are characteristic. The etiology may be genetic or due to structural pathology, but in most cases remains unknown.

Disrupted sleep is associated with immune system dysfunction, impaired resistance to infection, as well as alterations in nitrogen balance and wound healing. The effects of surgical ICU admission on patients' sleep quality and architecture remain poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to describe the quantity and quality of sleep as well as sleep architecture, as defined by polysomnography (PSG), in patients cared for in the surgical ICU. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was performed at our urban Level I trauma center. A convenience sample of surgical or trauma ICU patients underwent continuous PSG for up to 24 hours to evaluate sleep patterns. A certified sleep technician performed, monitored, and scored all PSG recordings. A single neurologist trained in PSG interpretation reviewed all PSG recordings. χ2 goodness-of-fit analysis was performed to detect differences in the proportion of time spent in stages 1 and 2 (superficial stages), stages 3 and 4 (deep stages), or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep between study patients and healthy historical controls. All PSG recordings were performed greater than 24 hours after the administration of a general anesthetic. Patients with traumatic brain injury were excluded. Results: Sixteen patients were selected to undergo PSG recordings. Median age was 37.5 years (range, 20–83), 81.3% were male patients, 62.5% were injured, and 31.3% were mechanically ventilated. Total PSG recording time was 315 hours (mean, 19.7 hours per patient), total sleep time captured by PSG was 132 hours (mean, 8.28 hours per patient), and there were 6.2 awakenings per hour of sleep measured. ICU patients had an increase in the proportion of time spent in the superficial stages of sleep, and a decrease in the proportion of time spent in the deeper stages of sleep as well as a decrease in REM sleep compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients do achieve measurable sleep while cared for in a surgical ICU setting.

We have examined several parameters of the SB system to improve it as a potential, nonviral vector for gene therapy. Our investigation centered on three features: the carrying capacity of the transposon for efficient integration into chromosomes of HeLa cells, the effects of overexpression of the SB transposase gene on transposition rates, and improvements in the activity of SB transposase to increase insertion rates of transgenes into cellular chromosomes. We found that SB transposons of about 6 kb retained 50% of the maximal efficiency of transposition, which is sufficient to deliver 70–80% of identified human cDNAs with appropriate transcriptional regulatory sequences. Overexpression inhibition studies revealed that there are optimal ratios of SB transposase to transposon for maximal rates of transposition, suggesting that conditions of delivery of the two-part transposon system are important for the best gene-transfer efficiencies. We further refined the SB transposase to incorporate several amino acid substitutions, the result of which led to an improved transposase called SB11. With SB11 we are able to achieve transposition rates that are about 100-fold above those achieved with plasmids that insert into chromosomes by random recombination.

It is suggested that the model may be used to evaluate work/rest schedules in terms of sleep-related safety risks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/07420529709001149", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154812230", "source": "openalex"}

Actigraph-based nocturnal wake minutes and wake bouts were higher than maternal diary reports for all age groups. Daytime naps decreased monotonically across age groups and accounted for most of the difference in 24-hour total sleep over age groups. Children in families with lower socioeconomic status had later rise times, longer time in bed, more nocturnal wake minutes and bouts, and more night-to-night variability in bedtime and sleep period time.

The recurrent episodes of occlusion of upper airways during sleep result in pathophysiological changes that may predispose to vascular diseases, and we postulate that nitric oxide may be one of the mediators involved. This study investigates the levels of circulating nitric oxide (NO), measured as serum nitrites and nitrates, in the early morning in OSA subjects compared with control subjects, and the effect of overnight nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in OSA subjects. Thirty men with moderate to severe OSA (age = 41.9 ± 9.0; apnea-hypopnea index, AHI = 48.0 ± 18.1) were compared with 40 healthy men (age = 40.6 ± 5.4; AHI = 1.4 ± 1.2). Serum nitrite/nitrate levels were significantly lower in OSA subjects (OSA = 38.9 ± 22.9 μ M, control subjects = 63.1 ± 47.5 μ M, p = 0.015). There was significant negative correlation between serum nitrites/nitrates and the following parameters: AHI (r = − 0.389, p = 0.001), oxygen desaturation time (r = − 0.346, p = 0.004), and systolic blood pressure (BP) (r = − 0.335, p = 0.005). Stepwise multiple linear regression with systolic or diastolic BP as the dependent variable identified serum nitrites/nitrates as the only significant correlate. Twenty-two OSA subjects had measurements of serum NO at baseline and after an overnight application nCPAP. There was significant increase in serum NO after nCPAP (baseline = 30.5 ± 14.4 μ M, after nCPAP = 81.0 ± 82.1 μ M, p = 0.01). This study demonstrates, for the first time, that circulating NO is suppressed in OSA, and this is promptly reversible with the use of nCPAP. The findings offer support for nitric oxide being one of the mediators involved in the acute hemodynamic regulation and long-term vascular remodeling in OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.162.6.2002126", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138659796", "source": "openalex"}

The onset of sleep apnea peaks in middle age, and its morbid and mortal sequelae include complications from accidents and cardiovascular events. The pathophysiology of sleep apnea remains obscure. The purpose of this study was to test three separate, albeit closely related, hypotheses. 1) Does sleep apnea contribute to the previously reported changes of plasma cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and leptin levels independently of obesity? 2) Among obese patients, is it generalized or visceral obesity that predisposes to sleep apnea? 3) Is apnea a factor independent from obesity in the development of insulin resistance? Obese middle-aged men with sleep apnea were first compared with nonapneic age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched obese and age-matched lean men. All subjects were monitored in the sleep laboratory for 4 consecutive nights. We obtained simultaneous indexes of sleep, sleep stages, and sleep apnea, including apnea/hypopnea index and percent minimum oxygen saturation. The sleep apneic men had higher plasma concentrations of the adipose tissue-derived hormone, leptin, and of the inflammatory, fatigue-causing, and insulin resistance-producing cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 than nonapneic obese men, who had intermediate values, or lean men, who had the lowest values. Because these findings suggested that sleep apneics might have a higher degree of insulin resistance than the BMI-matched controls, we studied groups of sleep-apneic obese and age- and BMI-matched nonapneic controls in whom we obtained computed tomographic scan measures of total, sc, and visceral abdominal fat, and additional biochemical indexes of insulin resistance, including fasting plasma glucose and insulin. The sleep apnea patients had a significantly greater amount of visceral fat compared to obese controls (<0.05) and indexes of sleep disordered breathing were positively correlated with visceral fat, but not with BMI or total or sc fat. Furthermore, the biochemical data confirmed a higher degree of insulin resistance in the group of apneics than in BMI-matched nonapneic controls. We conclude that there is a strong independent association among sleep apnea, visceral obesity, insulin resistance and hypercytokinemia, which may contribute to the pathological manifestations and somatic sequelae of this condition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.85.3.1151", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4250130254", "source": "openalex"}

We used multisite extra- and intracellular recordings of neocortical, reticular thalamic (RE), and thalamocortical (TC) neurons, including dual impalements of cortical and TC cells. A subsample (40%) of TC cells discharged spike bursts at 2-4 Hz, in close time relation with the spiky, depth-negative field components of SW seizures in related neocortical areas. Full synchronization among TC cells that were resonant with the cortical seizure activity was progressively reached toward the end of the SW paroxysm. The remaining TC cells (60%) were inhibited during the cortical SW seizures. We show that the duration and amplitude of hyperpolarization in TC cells paralleled the extent of cortical EEG paroxysm. Dual intracellular recordings of cortical and TC neurons demonstrate that during the cortical SW seizure, consisting of a tonic depolarization with superimposed paroxysmal spike bursts, the simultaneously recorded TC neurons displayed a tonic hyperpolarization associated with repetitive IPSPs, closely time related with cortical cell bursts. The inhibition of TC cells was presumably mediated by GABAergic RE thalamic neurons. Indeed, simultaneously recorded RE and TC neurons during the cortical SW paroxysm showed that cortical and RE cell excitation was accompanied by corresponding IPSPs in TC cells. We emphasize the progressive development from sleep patterns to some forms of epileptic-like activities. We propose that the inhibitory processes found in a significant number of TC cells during cortical SW seizures may contribute to the loss of consciousness, due to obliteration of synaptic transmission through the thalamus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.15-01-00623.1995", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1533320261", "source": "openalex"}

Poor sleep causes endocrine and metabolic measurable perturbations and is associated with a number of cardiometabolic, psychiatric and social negative outcomes both in adults and children. Nocturnal environmental noise also provokes measurable biological changes in the form of a stress response, and clearly affects sleep architecture, as well as subjective sleep quality. These sleep perturbations are similar in their nature to those observed in endogenous sleep disorders. Apart from these measurable effects and the subjective feeling of disturbed sleep, people who struggle with nocturnal environmental noise often also suffer the next day from daytime sleepiness and tiredness, annoyance, mood changes as well as decreased well-being and cognitive performance. But there is also emerging evidence that these short-term effects of environmental noise, particularly when the exposure is nocturnal, may be followed by long-term adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. Nocturnal environmental noise may be the most worrying form of noise pollution in terms of its health consequences because of its synergistic direct and indirect (through sleep disturbances acting as a mediator) influence on biological systems. Duration and quality of sleep should thus be regarded as risk factors or markers significantly influenced by the environment and possibly amenable to modification through both education and counseling as well as through measures of public health. One of the means that should be proposed is avoidance at all costs of sleep disruptions caused by environmental noise.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.slsci.2014.11.003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016579647", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were randomly allocated in two groups of similar characteristics. Group 1 (n = 37) was asked to improve sleep hygiene and started a weight loss program. Group 2 (n = 68) received, in addition, treatment with CPAP. Both groups were followed through weekly telephone calls and appointments. Sleepiness, other symptoms related to SAHS, daytime function, perceived health status, and quality of life were assessed through questionnaires at inclusion and after 3 mo of treatment. The relief of sleepiness and other SAHS-related clinical symptoms and improvement in perceived health status was much greater in Group 2 receiving CT + CPAP compared with Group 1, only receiving CT. The odds of experiencing a treatment response with CPAP + CT compared with CT alone was 6.52 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.51 to 17.6, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]).

Quality assessment of the reviewed papers was performed to identify flaws in the external and internal validity. Cut‐off criteria for an acceptable external validity were established to select studies for the discussion of prevalence data. A total of 22 publications were included in the review, most of which had methodological problems limiting their external validity. Prevalence data extraction was performed only on eight papers that were consistent as for the sampling strategy and showed only minor external validity problems, but they had some common internal validity flaws related with the definition of sleep bruxism measures. All the selected papers based sleep bruxism diagnosis on proxy reports by the parents, and no epidemiological data were available from studies adopting other diagnostic strategies (e.g. polysomnography or electromyography). The reported prevalence was highly variable between the studies (3·5–40·6%), with a commonly described decrease with age and no gender differences. A very high variability in sleep bruxism prevalence in children was found, due to the different age groups under investigation and the different frequencies of self‐reported sleep bruxism.

Many patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis therapy suffer from sleep disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sleep disorders in a large population of uraemic patients recruited from 20 different dialytic centres in Triveneto. Methods. 883 patients on maintenance dialysis were enrolled in the study. Demographic, lifestyle, renal and dialysis data were recorded. Renal parameters were compared with the database of the Veneto Dialysis Register. Using a self-administered questionnaire we assessed the presence of the following sleep disorders: insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), possible narcolepsy, sleepwalking, nightmares and possible rapid eye movement behaviour disorders (RBD). Moreover, in order to determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances and the possible effect of demographic or clinical data on sleep, we divided our population into two groups: with (SLEEP+) and without (SLEEP−) sleep disorders. Results. The questionnaire revealed the presence of insomnia (69.1%), RLS (18.4%), OSAS (23.6%), EDS (11.8%), possible narcolepsy (1.4%), sleepwalking (2.1%), nightmares (13.3%) and possible RBD (2.3%). Eighty percent demonstrated SLEEP+, having at least one sleep disorder.

Conclusions. The questionnaire showed a high presence of sleep disruption in dialytic populations. Awareness by Italian nephrologists regarding sleep disruption seems to be insufficient.

Measurements of nasal resistance and overnight polysomnographic studies were performed during the ragweed season when the patients complained of nasal obstruction; and 6 to 8 wk later when the symptoms had subsided (control study). During the symptomatic phase, mean (+/- SE) nasal resistance was 4.9 +/- 0.8 cm H2O/L/s, and the patients experienced 1.7 +/- 0.3 obstructive apneas per hour of sleep. In contrast, at the time of the control study, nasal resistance had decreased to 2.5 +/- 0.3 cm H2O/L/s (p less than 0.01); and the rate of obstructive apneas had decreased to 0.7 +/- 0.4 per hour of sleep (p less than 0.005). The duration of these apneas had also decreased from 15.5 +/- 0.8 s to 6.1 +/- 2.9 s (p less than 0.01). Apneas were rarely associated with significant O2 desaturation and were fewer in number than typically seen in a clinically significant sleep apnea syndrome. In male patients there was a direct relationship (r = 0.9) between the change in nasal resistance from symptomatic to control studies and the corresponding change in frequency of obstructive sleep apneas. Coincident with these respiratory changes at the time of the control study was an increase in the amount of slow-wave sleep (p = 0.05) and a small reduction in the frequency of arousals during sleep (p = NS). We conclude that in patients with allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apneas are longer and more frequent during a period of symptomatic nasal obstruction than when symptoms are absent. The results support the concept that a high nasal resistance may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apneas in general.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/arrd.1982.126.4.625", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1915566139", "source": "openalex"}

Altogether, four wearable (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, Garmin Fenix 5S, Garmin Vivosmart 3) and three nonwearable (EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) devices were tested. Sleep/wake summary and epoch-by-epoch agreement measures were compared with PSG.Most devices (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) performed as well as or better than actigraphy on sleep/wake performance measures, while the Garmin devices performed worse. Overall, epoch-by-epoch sensitivity was high (all ≥0.93), specificity was low-to-medium (0.18-0.54), sleep stage comparisons were mixed, and devices tended to perform worse on nights with poorer/disrupted sleep.Consumer sleep-tracking devices exhibited high performance in detecting sleep, and most performed equivalent to (or better than) actigraphy in detecting wake. Device sleep stage assessments were inconsistent. Findings indicate that many newer sleep-tracking devices demonstrate promising performance for tracking sleep and wake.

Current source density (CSD) analysis revealed that the spatial positions of sinks in layers IV, V-VI, and II-III and of the accompanying sources were similar during sleep spindles, HVSs, and thalamic-evoked responses, although their relative strengths and timings differed. The magnitude and relative timing of the multiple pairs of sinks and sources determined the amplitude variability of HVSs and sleep spindles. The presence of temporally shifted dipoles was also supported by the time distribution of unit discharges in different layers. Putative interneurons discharged with repetitive bursts of 300-500 Hz. The spike component of HVSs was associated with fast field oscillations (400-600 Hz \"ripples\"). Discharges of pyramidal cells were phase-locked to the ripples.

According to the majority of the studies, sleep deprivation produces hyperalgesic changes. Furthermore, sleep deprivation can counteract analgesic effects of pharmacological treatments involving opioidergic and serotoninergic mechanisms of action. The heterogeneity of the human data and the exclusive interest in rapid eye movement sleep deprivation in animals so far do not allow us to draw firm conclusions as to whether the hyperalgesic effects are due to the deprivation of specific sleep stages or whether they result from a generalized disruption of sleep continuity.

Indeed, 60 to 70% of people with cognitive impairment or dementia have sleep disturbances, which are linked to poorer disease prognosis. Sleep disturbances in people with dementia have long been recognized and studied; however, in the past 10 years, researchers have begun to study disturbed sleep, including sleep fragmentation, abnormal sleep duration, and sleep disorders, as risk factors for dementia. In this review the authors summarize evidence linking sleep disturbance and dementia. They describe how specific aspects of sleep (e.g., quality, duration) and the prevalence of clinical sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) change with age; how sleep parameters and sleep disorders are associated with the risk of dementia; how sleep can be disturbed in dementia; and how disturbed sleep affects dementia prognosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of identifying and treating sleep problems and disorders in middle-aged and older adults as a strategy to prevent cognitive decline and dementia. The authors also review recent evidence linking sleep disturbances to the pathophysiology underlying dementing conditions, and briefly summarize available treatments for sleep disorders in people with dementia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1604351", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2745910294", "source": "openalex"}

We tested the hypothesis that tonic activation of excitatory chemoreceptor afferents contributes to the elevated sympathetic activity in OSA. Methods and Results —Using a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled design, we examined the effects of chemoreflex deactivation (by comparing effects of breathing 100% oxygen for 15 minutes with effects of breathing room air for 15 minutes) on MSNA, heart rate, blood pressure, and minute ventilation in 14 untreated patients with OSA and in 12 normal subjects matched for age and body mass index. All control subjects underwent overnight polysomnography to exclude the existence of occult OSA. Baseline MSNA was markedly elevated in the patients with OSA compared with the control subjects (44±4 versus 30±3 bursts per minute; P =.01). In both control subjects and patients with OSA, heart rate decreased during administration of 100% oxygen but did not change during administration of room air. By contrast, both MSNA ( P =.008) and mean arterial pressure ( P =.02) were significantly reduced during chemoreflex deactivation by 100% oxygen only in patients with OSA but not in control subjects.

To define the breathing pattern in patients with stroke involving cerebral hemispheres without brainstem lesion and without the prior history of sleep-disordered breathing, we studied 10 patients within 1 year of their stroke. The data collected during polysomnography from the stroke patients were compared with a group of subjects matched for age, body mass index, presence of hypertension, and smoking history without stroke. Patients with stroke had an abnormal sleep architecture with significantly lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when compared with controls. Sleep was fragmented because of the presence of increased respiratory disturbances. Stroke patients had a respiratory disturbance index of 52 +/- 10 events per hour when compared with 3 +/- 1 in controls (p < .05). Majorities of respiratory events were obstructive apneas and were associated with arterial oxygen desaturations and arousals.

Smartphone screen-time (the number of minutes in each hour the screen was on) was measured continuously via smartphone application. For each participant, total and average screen-time were computed over 30-day windows. Average screen-time specifically during self-reported bedtime hours and sleeping period was also computed. Demographics, medical information, and sleep habits (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PSQI) were obtained by survey. Linear regression was used to obtain effect estimates.Total screen-time over 30 days was a median 38.4 hours (IQR 21.4 to 61.3) and average screen-time over 30 days was a median 3.7 minutes per hour (IQR 2.2 to 5.5).

The goal of this study is to test the value of this staging system in a prospective study. Study Design This is a prospective study of two cohorts of patients: one was treated with the benefit of a clinical staging system and the other without. Methods Patients with symptoms of OSAHS were assessed by polysomnography and were staged according to a previously described staging system. The staging system is based on palate position, tonsil size, and body mass index (BMI). The control group was treated without the benefit of staging. All patients in the control group were treated with UPPP only. Patients in the experimental group were treated based on their clinical stage. Patients with stage I disease, regardless of the severity of disease, were treated with UPPP only. Selected patients with stage II and stage III disease were treated with UPPP in addition to a staged tongue‐base reduction using a radiofrequency technique (TBRF). Results Follow‐up at 6 months showed significant improvement compared with a group of patients treated without the benefit of a staging system.

The main feature of the disorder, REM sleep without muscle atonia, has been shown in a variety of diseases; therefore, the disorder might possibly be underestimated. In an open-labeled trial, we treated six consecutive RBD patients over a 6-week period with 3 mg melatonin given within 30 minutes before bedtime. There was a dramatic clinical improvement in five of the six patients within a week which extended beyond the end of treatment for weeks or months. A second polysomnogram performed 6 weeks after the beginning of treatment showed a significant tendency toward normalization of the percentage of REM sleep, a significant reduction of 30-second epochs, scored as REM sleep without muscle atonia, a significant reduction of stage-shifts in REM, and a significant reduction in epochs considered as movement time in REM. All other sleep parameters were not changed consistently. We hypothesize that internal desynchrony might be a part of the underlying pathophysiology in RBD. Our data might give first evidence to the hypothesis that exogenous melatonin, administered to patients with internal desynchrony at the time of the maximal rise of melatonin secretion, might increase the overall amplitude of the circadian pacemaker by reentraining the suprachiasmatic nucleus and thereby restore circadian driven rhythms, one of them being the circadian modulation of REM sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1531-8257(199905)14:3<507::aid-mds1021>3.0.co;2-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049357869", "source": "openalex"}

In addition, sleep-hygiene practices may need to be modified and adapted for this population of children and are often more challenging to implement compared with their healthy counterparts.

The SIESTA project offered the opportunity to analyse interrater reliability (IRR) between experienced scorers from eight European sleep laboratories within a large sample of patients with different (sleep) disorders: depression, general anxiety disorder with and without non‐organic insomnia, Parkinson's disease, period limb movements in sleep and sleep apnoea. The results were based on 196 recordings from 98 patients (73 males: 52.3 ± 12.1 years and 25 females: 49.5 ± 11.9 years) for which two independent expert scorings from two different laboratories were available. Cohen's κ was used to evaluate the IRR on the basis of epochs and intraclass correlation was used to analyse the agreement on quantitative sleep parameters. The overall level of agreement when five different stages were distinguished was κ = 0.6816 (76.8%), which in terms of κ reflects a ‘substantial’ agreement ( Landis and Koch, 1977 ). For different groups of patients κ values varied from 0.6138 (Parkinson's disease) to 0.8176 (generalized anxiety disorder). With regard to (sleep) stages, the IRR was highest for rapid eye movement (REM), followed by Wake, slow‐wave sleep (SWS), non‐rapid eye movement 2 (NREM2) and NREM1. The results of regression analysis showed that age and sex only had a statistically significant effect on κ when the (sleep) stages are considered separately. For NREM2 and SWS a statistically significant decrease of IRR with age has been observed and the IRR for SWS was lower for males than for females. These variations of IRR most probably reflect changes of the sleep electroencephalography (EEG) with age and gender.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2003.00375.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1689369912", "source": "openalex"}

The aims of the current study were to compare ambulatory sleep recordings from consecutively selected patients with RA to those obtained in healthy controls, and to study the relationships between sleep structure and clinical symptoms. Sleep recordings were obtained from 41 out-patients with RA and 19 matched controls. All had clinical examinations and completed different questionnaires. Recordings were scored traditionally and, moreover, the electroencephalography (EEG) was subjected to frequency analysis. For the study of sleep-wake interactions in the patients, a graphical chain model was used. The patients had many sleep-related complaints. An increase in the number of periodic movements of the legs (PML) during sleep was seen in comparison with controls, but otherwise only minor differences were observed in classical sleep stages. Data from frequency analysis showed an increase in alpha (8-12 Hz)-EEG activity in sleep stages non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 2-4 in most sleep cycles. The statistical model demonstrated a complex but independent correlation between morning stiffness, pain and joint tenderness on the one hand, and awakenings, stage NREM2, slow-wave sleep and stage REM on the other, probably reflecting a relationship between sleep patterns and pain in RA. In conclusion, only the increase in PML and alpha-EEG activity distinguished the sleep in RA patients from that of healthy controls. However, the demonstrated interaction between daytime complaints and sleep patterns may increase the understanding and treatment of the disease. In future research, graphical chain models may improve our understanding of complex relationships between multiple variables.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/37.1.71", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104843608", "source": "openalex"}

The diurnal amplitude of leptin was reduced during total sleep deprivation and returned toward normal during the period of recovery sleep.

However, the effects of the selective long-term abolition of histaminergic neurons on the sleep–wake cycle, indispensable in determining their functions, remain unknown. We have compared brain histamine(HA)-immunoreactivity and the cortical-EEG and sleep–wake cycle under baseline conditions or after behavioral or pharmacological stimuli in wild-type (WT) and knock-out mice lacking the histidine decarboxylase gene (HDC−/−). HDC−/−mice showed an increase in paradoxical sleep, a decrease in cortical EEG power in θ-rhythm during waking (W), and a decreased EEG slow wave sleep/W power ratio. Although no major difference was noted in the daily amount of spontaneous W, HDC−/−mice showed a deficit of W at lights-off and signs of somnolence, as demonstrated by a decreased sleep latencies after various behavioral stimuli, e.g., WT-mice placed in a new environment remained highly awake for 2–3 hr, whereas HDC−/−mice fell asleep after a few minutes. These effects are likely to be attributable to lack of HDC and thus of HA. In WT mice, indeed, intraperitoneal injection of α-fluoromethylhistidine (HDC-inhibitor) caused a decrease in W, whereas injection of ciproxifan (HA-H3 receptor antagonist) elicited W. Both injections had no effect in HDC−/−mice. Moreover, PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed the absence of the HDC gene and brain HA-immunoreactive neurons in the HDC−/−mice. These data indicate that disruption of HA-synthesis causes permanent changes in the cortical-EEG and sleep–wake cycle and that, at moments when high vigilance is required (lights off, environmental change… ), mice lacking brain HA are unable to remain awake, a prerequisite condition for responding to behavioral and cognitive challenges. We suggest that histaminergic neurons also play a key role in maintaining the brain in an awake state faced with behavioral challenges.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.22-17-07695.2002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1640809349", "source": "openalex"}

LI produced no slow-wave sleep (SWS--stages 3 + 4 sleep) changes, but was the only condition to produce significant increases in sleep length and in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (stages 1 + 2 + 3 + 4), and a significant decrease in sleep onset time. Although HI and PH produced similar SWS increases, these consisted of significant increases in stage 3 sleep for HI and in stage 4 sleep for PH. No REM sleep parameter was affected under any condition. Self-estimates of presleep tiredness produced no significant findings. It was concluded that a high and sustained rate of body heating for 1-2 h, particularly the inherent rapid rates of core temperature increase and of body dehydration, may trigger a SWS response, and that exercise may simply be a vehicle for these effects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/6.1.36", "url": "https://openalex.org/W205505399", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated measures of sleep and quality of life. Methods: A self‐administered, mail‐in questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a measure of disease severity and the IBD‐Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. Results: The IBD subjects reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation, higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day‐time energy, increased tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score ( r 2 = 0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease status were correlated. Conclusion: The results show that IBD patients have significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare‐up. Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2006.04820.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167987062", "source": "openalex"}

Nonresponders had a higher occurrence of complete or partial circumferential collapse at velum and complete antero-posterior collapse at tongue base or epiglottis in comparison with responders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that among baseline clinical and polysomnographic characteristics (e.g., AHI, body mass index) and sleep endoscopy findings, the presence of complete circumferential collapse at velum, and of complete antero-posterior collapse at tongue base were the only independent predictors of upper airway surgery failure.Drug-induced sleep endoscopy can be used to predict higher likelihood of response to upper airway surgery in OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.23462", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2147347492", "source": "openalex"}

A total of 40 young adults were randomized into four groups: control + caffeine (Cc), control + placebo (Cp), sleep deprived + caffeine (SDc), and sleep deprived + placebo (SDp). Controls slept normally. Caffeine (350 mg) or placebo were given just prior to testing. The task comprised colour photographs of unknown faces and had two components: recognition memory (distinction between previously presented and novel faces), and recency discrimination (temporal memory), when a previously shown face was presented. An interpolated task, self-ordered pointing, acted as a distraction. Caffeine had no effects within control conditions, but significantly reduced subjective sleepiness in SDc. Recognition was unaffected by sleep deprivation, whereas for recency, sleep deprivation groups scored significantly lower than controls. There was no significant improvement of recency with caffeine in the SDc group. Both sleep deprivation groups had poorer insight into their performance with recency.

There is a growing recognition of sex disparities in sleep and rhythm disorders. Understanding how neuroendocrine mediators and sex differences influence sleep and biological rhythms is central to advancing our understanding of sleep-related disorders. While it is known that ovarian steroids affect circadian rhythms in rodents, the role of androgen is less understood. Surprising findings that androgens, acting via androgen receptors in the master \"circadian clock\" within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, modulate photic effects on activity in males point to novel mechanisms of circadian control. Work in aromatase-deficient mice suggests that some sex differences in photic responsiveness are independent of gonadal hormone effects during development. In parallel, aspects of sex differences in sleep are also reported to be independent of gonadal steroids and may involve sex chromosome complement.

The ability to accurately describe changes in sleep state from these oscillations has thus been a major goal of sleep medicine. While numerous studies over the past 50 years have shown sleep to be a continuous, multifocal, dynamic process, long-standing clinical practice categorizes sleep EEG into discrete stages through visual inspection of 30-s epochs. By representing sleep as a coarsely discretized progression of stages, vital neurophysiological information on the dynamic interplay between sleep and arousal is lost. However, by using principled time-frequency spectral analysis methods, the rich dynamics of the sleep EEG are immediately visible-elegantly depicted and quantified at time scales ranging from a full night down to individual microevents. In this paper, we review the neurophysiology of sleep through this lens of dynamic spectral analysis. We begin by reviewing spectral estimation techniques traditionally used in sleep EEG analysis and introduce multitaper spectral analysis, a method that makes EEG spectral estimates clearer and more accurate than traditional approaches. Through the lens of the multitaper spectrogram, we review the oscillations and mechanisms underlying the traditional sleep stages. In doing so, we will demonstrate how multitaper spectral analysis makes the oscillatory structure of traditional sleep states instantaneously visible, closely paralleling the traditional hypnogram, but with a richness of information that suggests novel insights into the neural mechanisms of sleep, as well as novel clinical and research applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.00062.2015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2559819140", "source": "openalex"}

A new classification system that details the type of signals measured by these devices is presented. This proposed system categorizes OOC devices based on measurements of Sleep, Cardiovascular, Oximetry, Position, Effort, and Respiratory (SCOPER) parameters.Criteria for evaluating the devices are also presented, which were generated from chosen pre-test and post-test probabilities. These criteria state that in patients with a high pretest probability of having OSA, the OOC testing device has a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 5 or greater coinciding with an in-lab-polysomnography (PSG)-generated apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, and an adequate sensitivity (at least 0.825).Since oximetry is a mandatory signal for scoring AHI using PSG, devices that do not incorporate oximetry were excluded. English peer-reviewed literature on FDA-approved devices utilizing more than 1 signal was reviewed according to the above criteria for 6 questions. These questions specifically addressed the adequacy of different respiratory and effort sensors and combinations thereof to diagnose OSA. In summary, the literature is currently inadequate to state with confidence that a thermistor alone without any effort sensor is adequate to diagnose OSA; if a thermal sensing device is used as the only measure of respiration, 2 effort belts are required as part of the montage and piezoelectric belts are acceptable in this context; nasal pressure can be an adequate measurement of respiration with no effort measure with the caveat that this may be device specific; nasal pressure may be used in combination with either 2 piezoelectric or respiratory inductance plethysmographic (RIP) belts (but not 1 piezoelectric belt); and there is insufficient evidence to state that both nasal pressure and thermistor are required to adequately diagnose OSA. With respect to alternative devices for diagnosing OSA, the data indicate that peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) devices are adequate for the proposed use; the device based on cardiac signals shows promise, but more study is required as it has not been tested in the home setting; for the device based on end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), it appears to be adequate for a hospital population; and for devices utilizing acoustic signals, the data are insufficient to determine whether the use of acoustic signals with other signals as a substitute for airflow is adequate to diagnose OSA.Standardized research is needed on OOC devices that report LR+ at the appropriate AHI (≥ 5) and scored according to the recommended definitions, while using appropriate research reporting and methodology to minimize bias.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.1328", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2093372772", "source": "openalex"}

Cannabis has been reported by several patient populations to help sleep. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, on sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia (FM), a disease characterized by widespread chronic pain and insomnia. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, active-control, equivalency crossover trial to compare nabilone (0.5–1.0 mg before bedtime) to amitriptyline (10–20 mg before bedtime) in patients with FM with chronic insomnia. Subjects received each drug for 2 wk with a 2-wk washout period. The primary outcome was sleep quality, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain, mood, quality of life, and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects were enrolled and 29 completed the trial (26 women, mean age 49.5 yr). Although sleep was improved by both amitriptyline and nabilone, nabilone was superior to amitriptyline (Insomnia Severity Index difference = 3.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.2–5.3). Nabilone was marginally better on the restfulness (Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire difference = 0.5 [0.0–1.0]) but not on wakefulness (difference = 0.3 [−0.2 to 0.8]). No effects on pain, mood, or quality of life were observed. AEs were mostly mild to moderate and were more frequent with nabilone. The most common AEs for nabilone were dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Nabilone is effective in improving sleep in patients with FM and is well tolerated. Low-dose nabilone given once daily at bedtime may be considered as an alternative to amitriptyline. Longer trials are needed to determine the duration of effect and to characterize long-term safety.

All subjects were scanned in the supine position during awake nasal breathing. Eight-millimeter-thick axial slices were obtained at four anatomic levels from the nasopharynx to the retroglossal region every 0.4 s during a respiratory cycle. Tidal volume measured from an integrated pneumotachograph signal was correlated with slice acquisition during inspiration and expiration to generate loops comparing upper airway area and tidal volume. In all three subject groups and at all anatomic levels studied, there were significant dimensional changes in upper airway caliber during the respiratory cycle. The major findings in this investigation include: (1) the upper airway was significantly smaller in apneic than normal subjects, especially at the retropalatal low and retroglossal anatomic levels; in apneic patients the airway had an anterior-posterior configuration unlike the normal airway, which had a horizontal configuration with the major axis in the lateral direction; (2) in all three subject groups, little airway narrowing occurred in inspiration, suggesting that the action of the upper airway dilator muscles balanced the effects of negative intraluminal pressure. In apneic patients there was more enlargement of the airway in early inspiration, presumably reflecting increased upper airway muscle dilator activity; (3) in expiration, positive airway pressure resulted in expansion of the airway; this expansion was largest in the apneic patients, indicating that the apneic airway was more distensible than the normal airway; (4) at the end of expiration the upper airway narrowed significantly, especially in the apneic patients. Thus the airway in apneic patients may be heading toward a closed position at end-expiration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/148.5.1385", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051307462", "source": "openalex"}

Television and computer game consumption are a powerful influence in the lives of most children. Previous evidence has supported the notion that media exposure could impair a variety of behavioral characteristics. Excessive television viewing and computer game playing have been associated with many psychiatric symptoms, especially emotional and behavioral symptoms, somatic complaints, attention problems such as hyperactivity, and family interaction problems. Nevertheless, there is insufficient knowledge about the relationship between singular excessive media consumption on sleep patterns and linked implications on children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of singular excessive television and computer game consumption on sleep patterns and memory performance of children. METHODS. Eleven school-aged children were recruited for this polysomnographic study. Children were exposed to voluntary excessive television and computer game consumption. In the subsequent night, polysomnographic measurements were conducted to measure sleep-architecture and sleep-continuity parameters. In addition, a visual and verbal memory test was conducted before media stimulation and after the subsequent sleeping period to determine visuospatial and verbal memory performance. RESULTS. Only computer game playing resulted in significant reduced amounts of slow-wave sleep as well as significant declines in verbal memory performance. Prolonged sleep-onset latency and more stage 2 sleep were also detected after previous computer game consumption. No effects on rapid eye movement sleep were observed. Television viewing reduced sleep efficiency significantly but did not affect sleep patterns. CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that television and computer game exposure affect children's sleep and deteriorate verbal cognitive performance, which supports the hypothesis of the negative influence of media consumption on children's sleep, learning, and memory.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-0476", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124582223", "source": "openalex"}

To confirm this subjective impression by objective measurements, we studied a group of 123 patients referred to us because of snoring and suspected OSA, all of whom had nocturnal polysomnography and measurements of external and internal neck circumference. The external neck circumference was measured at the level of the superior border of the cricothyroid cartilage. Internal neck circumferences were calculated from the measurements of pharyngeal, glottic, and tracheal areas obtained by the acoustic reflection technique. Internal pharyngeal circumference was further subdivided into the proximal, middle, and distal thirds. The acoustic technique also permitted us to measure the distance between the teeth and the glottic minimum, which reflects the length of the upper airway. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) correlated only with the external neck circumference, the body mass index, and the internal circumference of the distal pharynx; these three variables accounted for 39% of the variability in AHI. We conclude that the external and internal neck circumferences and the degree of obesity are important predictors of sleep apnea; it is possible that obesity produces its effect via fat in the neck. We speculate that the static pharyngeal size modulated by the dynamic loading of the airway due to the weight of fatty tissue of the neck may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/141.5_pt_1.1228", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090759227", "source": "openalex"}

Cell groups that discharge during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (REM-on) and neurons that slow or cease firing during REM sleep (REM-off) have long been thought to comprise at least two neurochemically distinct populations. The fact that putatively cholinoceptive and/or cholinergic (REM-on) and putatively aminergic (REM-off) cell populations discharge reciprocally over the sleep cycle suggests a causal interdependence. In some brain stem areas these cell groups are not anatomically segregated and may instead be neurochemically mixed (interpenetrated). This finding raises important theoretical and practical issues not anticipated in the original reciprocal-interaction model. The electrophysiological evidence concerning the REM-on and REM-off cell groups suggests a gradient of sleep-dependent membrane excitability changes that may be a function of the connectivity strength within an anatomically distributed neuronal network. The connectivity strength may be influenced by the degree of neurochemical interpenetration between the REM-on and REM-offcells. Recognition of these complexities forces us to revise the reciprocal-interaction model and to seek new methods to test its tenets. Cholinergic microinjection experiments indicate that some populations of REM-on cells can execute specific portions of the REM sleep syndrome or block the generation of REM sleep. This observation suggests that the order of activation within the anatomically distributed generator populations may be critical in determining behavioral outcome. Support for the cholinergic tenets of the reciprocal-interaction model has been reinforced by observations from sleep-disorders medicine. Specific predictions of the reciprocal-interaction model and suggestions for testing these predictions are enumerated for future experimental programs that aim to understand the cellular and molecular basis of the mammalian sleep cycle.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x00046215", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088007780", "source": "openalex"}

Given that limitation, we are presenting an up-to-date review of the current understanding of the relation between sleep and pregnancy.Studies suggest that pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways. There are hormonal changes, physiologic changes, physical factors, and behavioral changes in a pregnant woman-all of which may affect her sleep. They may affect the duration and quality of sleep and lead to a variety of sleep disorders. Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Particular attention may be given to obese pregnant women who would gain more weight during pregnancy or those who develop hypertensive conditions (eg, preeclampsia). Snoring may be more common in women with preeclampsia and the pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep may be enhanced in preeclamptic women when compared with those with obstructive sleep apnea alone. Several investigators have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be common in pregnant women despite the presence of intrinsic mechanisms that seem to be geared towards preventing sleep apnea. However, the exact incidence and prevalence of sleep apnea in pregnant women is uncertain. In addition, it is unclear if criteria that are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to pregnant women. Further investigations are needed to determine if lower thresholds for management of OSA should be used in pregnant women to prevent harm to the fetus.In conclusion, sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy though the full extent of this relation remains undefined. Large, multi-center, prospective studies are needed for better understanding.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00063198-200311000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127492905", "source": "openalex"}

Certain groups of hypothalamic neurons and adjacent groups of basal forebrain neurons produce the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Projections of these GABA neurons inhibit the firing of cells involved in wakefulness. Several groups of neurons have been shown to be inhibited by this action--including neurons containing histamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, hypocretin, and glutamate--and this inhibition promotes sleep. Hypocretin (also called orexin) was discovered in 1998, and its role in sleep and narcolepsy was identified in 2001. Other as-yet undiscovered transmitters are undoubtedly involved in sleep control. The transmitters discussed in this article have been the most thoroughly studied, and many aspects of the role of each of these transmitters in relation to sleep are reasonably well understood.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2278456581", "source": "openalex"}

Daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, and frequent awakenings increased in prevalence with age. All symptoms were related strongly to depression. Symptoms of daytime sleepiness were also related strongly to poor health and limitations in activities of daily living in men and women. In multivariate analysis, men taking benzodiazepines were likely to report difficulty falling asleep and daytime sleepiness, whereas women taking benzodiazepines reported difficulty falling asleep and waking up too early. After accounting for these factors, the only cardiovascular disease independently associated with sleep disturbances was angina. Men and women with confirmed angina were 1.6 times more likely to report trouble falling asleep. Independent relationships between sleep disturbances and cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes were relatively weak and inconsistent, though smokers were less likely to report frequent awakenings.Sleep disturbances are relatively common in older men and women and are associated with poor health, depression, angina, limitations in activities of daily living, and the use of benzodiazepines.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1997.tb00970.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980398586", "source": "openalex"}

Two groups, differing only in the rate and distance they were forced to walk during deprivation by the water wheel method, were recorded continuously (23 hr per day) for one baseline, one deprivation, and two recovery days. During deprivation, microsleeps, increased hippocampal spike rates, and increased amplitude of the EEG recordings all suggested the intrusion of sleep processes. Nonetheless, there was no evidence to support the idea that these animals were not substantially deprived of sleep. No important differences were found in the recovery data of the two groups, even though one group walked three times as far as the other during deprivation. This supports the idea that, in conjunction with large amounts of sleep deprivation, changes in exercise and energy depletion may have little effect on sleep measures. During recovery, increased hippocampal spike rates and bout lengths, as well as increases in EEG amplitude, were interpreted in terms of increased sleep \"intensity.\" High amplitude NREM sleep rebounded firs't, followed by rebounds in both paradoxical sleep and low amplitude NREM sleep. This pattern was compared to patterns previously reported for humans, cats, and rats. Finally, the tendency for some measures to fall below their baseline levels after an initial rebound was discussed in terms of \"sleep inhibition\" and servomechanism theory.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/1.4.369", "url": "https://openalex.org/W120443349", "source": "openalex"}

We sought to determine the effect of a constant lung volume increase on sleep disordered breathing during non-REM sleep. Methods: Twelve subjects with OSA were studied during non-REM sleep in a rigid head-out shell equipped with a positive/negative pressure attachment for manipulation of extrathoracic pressure. The increase in lung volume due to CPAP (at a therapeutic level) was determined with four magnetometer coils placed on the chest wall and abdomen. CPAP was then stopped and the subjects were studied for 1 hour in three conditions (in random order): (1) no treatment (baseline); (2) at \"CPAP lung volume\", with the increased lung volume being reproduced by negative extrathoracic pressure alone (lung volume 1, LV1); and (3) 500 ml above the CPAP lung volume(lung volume 2, LV2).

There is growing evidence that these trends are mechanistically related. The seasonal expression of the thrifty genotype provides a conceptual framework to connect circadian and circannual rhythms, sleep and metabolism. Experimental studies have shown sleep deprivation to decrease leptin, increase ghrelin, increase appetite, compromise insulin sensitivity and raise blood pressure. Habitually short sleep durations could lead to insulin resistance by increasing sympathetic nervous system activity, raising evening cortisol levels and decreasing cerebral glucose utilization that over time could compromise β‐cell function and lead to diabetes. Prolonged short sleep durations could lead to hypertension through raised 24‐h blood pressure and increased salt retention resulting in structural adaptations and the entrainment of the cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies have shown associations between short sleep duration and obesity, diabetes and hypertension. If metabolic changes resulting from sleep restriction function to increase body weight, insulin resistance and blood pressure then interventions designed to increase the amount and improve the quality of sleep could serve as treatments and as primary preventative measures for metabolic disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789x.2009.00663.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155678312", "source": "openalex"}

Design: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Setting: Patients referred from outpatient cardiology clinics of two teaching hospitals. Patients: Sequential sample of nine outpatients with severe, stable congestive heart failure. Interventions: For each patient, sleep studies (after an adaptation night) from two consecutive randomized nights were compared; one study was done while the patient breathed compressed air and the other while the patient breathed oxygen (O2). Compressed air and oxygen were both administered through nasal cannulae at 2 to 3 L/min. Measurements and Main Results: Cheyne-Stokes respiration, defined as periodic breathing with apnea or hypopnea, was found in all patients. Low-flow oxygen significantly reduced the duration of Cheyne-Stokes respiration (50.7% ± 12.0% to 24.2% ± 5.4% total sleep time), mainly during stage 1 NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (21.3% ± 7.1% to 6.7% ± 2.3% total sleep time) with no significant change during stage 2 sleep, slow-wave sleep, or REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Although patients had normal SaO2 (96.0% ± 1.7%) while awake, severe sleep hypoxemia was common; breathing oxygen reduced the amount of time that SaO2 was less than 90% from 22.3% ± 8.0% to 2.41% ± 1.93% of total sleep time. Sleep, disrupted to a variable extent in all patients, improved with oxygen therapy: There was an increase in total sleep time from 275.3 min ± 36.6 to 324.6 min ± 23.3; a reduction in the proportion of stage 1 sleep (27.6% ± 5.8% total sleep time to 15.2% ± 2.6% total sleep time); and a reduction in the number of arousals (30.4/h ± 8.0 to 13.8/h ± 1.9). The apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 30.0 ± 4.7 to 18.9 ± 2.4 with oxygen breathing. Conclusions: In severe, stable congestive heart failure, nocturnal oxygen therapy reduces Cheyne-Stokes respiration, corrects hypoxemia, and consolidates sleep by reducing arousals caused by the hyperpneic phase of Cheyne-Stokes respiration.

Our study sought to evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation interventions on sleep quality. To assess for relative efficacy, comparator groups were restricted to specific active controls (such as evidenced‐based sleep treatments) and nonspecific active controls (such as time/attention‐matched interventions to control for placebo effects), which were analyzed separately. From 3303 total records, 18 trials with 1654 participants were included. We determined the strength of evidence using four domains (risk of bias, directness of outcome measures, consistency of results, and precision of results). At posttreatment and follow‐up, there was low strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions had no effect on sleep quality compared with specific active controls (ES 0.03 (95% CI –0.43 to 0.49)) and (ES –0.14 (95% CI –0.62 to 0.34)), respectively. Additionally, there was moderate strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions significantly improved sleep quality compared with nonspecific active controls at postintervention (ES 0.33 (95% CI 0.17–0.48)) and at follow‐up (ES 0.54 (95% CI 0.24–0.84)).

Obesity in childhood and adolescence is associated with an increased risk of adult obesity and clinically significant consequences affecting the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. Importantly, obesity is additionally complicated by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), occurring in up to 60% of obese children. OSA, which is diagnosed using the gold standard polysomnogram (PSG), is characterised by snoring, recurrent partial (hypopneas) or complete (apneas) obstruction of the upper airway. OSA is frequently associated with intermittent oxyhemoglobin desaturations, sleep disruption, and sleep fragmentation. There is emerging data that OSA is associated with cardiovascular burden including systemic hypertension, changes in ventricular structure and function, arterial stiffness, and metabolic syndromes. Thus, OSA in the context of obesity may independently or synergistically magnify the underlying cardiovascular and metabolic burden. This is of importance as early recognition and treatment of OSA in obese children are likely to result in the reduction of cardiometabolic burden in obese children. This paper summarizes the current state of understanding of obesity-related OSA. Specifically, this paper will discuss epidemiology, pathophysiology, cardiometabolic burden, and management of obese children and adolescents with OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/134202", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059785082", "source": "openalex"}

There is particular uncertainty about the need for, and the effectiveness of, treatment in mild cases. To help define the role of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in mild OSA we undertook a randomized controlled cross-over trial of CPAP in patients with an apnea– hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 – 30 (mean, 12.9 ± 6.3 SD). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure and neurobehavioral function were measured at baseline, after 8 wk of treatment with CPAP, and after 8 wk of treatment with an oral placebo tablet. Twenty-eight of 42 patients enrolled in the study completed both treatment arms. Baseline characteristics were not different between those who completed the study and those who did not complete the study. Patients used CPAP for a mean (SD) of 3.53 (2.13) h per night and the mean AHI on the night of CPAP implementation was 4.24 (2.9). Nasal CPAP improved self-reported symptoms of OSA, including snoring, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and irritability (in-house questionnaire), more than did placebo, but did not improve objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) or subjective (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) measures of daytime sleepiness. We found no benefit of CPAP over placebo in any tests of neurobehavioral function, generic SF-36 (36-item Short Form Medical Outcomes Survey) or sleep-specific (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire) quality of life questionnaires, mood score (Profile of Moods States and Beck Depression Index), or 24-h blood pressure. However, the placebo tablet resulted in a significant improvement in a wide range of functional variables compared with baseline. This placebo effect may account for some of the treatment responses to CPAP observed previously in patients with mild OSA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.165.6.2003166", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146465989", "source": "openalex"}

A review of REM deprivation (REMD) studies in animals shows these reports to be about equally divided in showing that REMD does, or does not, disrupt learning/memory. The studies supporting a relationship between REM sleep and memory have been strongly criticized for the confounding effects of very stressful REM deprivation techniques. The three major classes of antidepressant drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), profoundly suppress REM sleep. The MAOIs virtually abolish REM sleep, and the TCAs and SSRIs have been shown to produce immediate (40–85%) and sustained (30–50%) reductions in REM sleep. Despite marked suppression of REM sleep, these classes of antidepressants on the whole do not disrupt learning/memory. There have been a few reports of patients who have survived bilateral lesions of the pons with few lingering complications. Although these lesions essentially abolished REM sleep, the patients reportedly led normal lives. Recent functional imaging studies in humans have revealed patterns of brain activity in REM sleep that are consistent with dream processes but not with memory consolidation. We propose that the primary function of REM sleep is to provide periodic endogenous stimulation to the brain which serves to maintain requisite levels of central nervous system (CNS) activity throughout sleep. REM is the mechanism used by the brain to promote recovery from sleep. We believe that the cumulative evidence indicates that REM sleep serves no role in the processing or consolidation of memory.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x00004003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081990267", "source": "openalex"}

Low levels of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied through the nose (2.5–15.0 cmH2O) prevented OSA and allowed long periods of stable stage III/IV sleep and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Externally applied complete nasal occlusion while the upper airway was patent resulted in upper airway closure during inspiration which was identified by a sudden deviation of nasal pressure from tracheal or esophageal pressure. The level of upper airway closing pressure (UACP) did not change throughout the occlusion test, suggesting that upper airway dilator muscles do not respond to asphyxia during sleep. The upper airway was more collapsible during stage I/II non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and REM sleep compared with stage III/IV NREM sleep. The pooled mean UACP was 3.1 +/- 0.4 cmH2O in stage I/II NREM, 4.2 +/- 0.2 cmH2O in stage III/IV NREM, and 2.4 +/- 0.2 cmH2O in REM sleep. Nasal occlusion at successively higher levels of CPAP did not alter the level of UACP in stage I/II NREM and REM sleep but resulted in the upper airway becoming more stable in stage III/IV NREM sleep, suggesting a reflex which augments the tone of upper airway dilator muscles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1984.57.2.520", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2279041817", "source": "openalex"}

Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy.Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown.

Thirty‐seven subjects had a polysomnography prior to a work day. After rising they completed the Karolinska Sleep Diary. A factor analysis of the diary yielded two factors: (1) a sleep‐quality index (SQI) related to the initiation and maintenance of sleep, and (2) a second factor related to difficulties waking‐up and to whether sleep was recuperative and sufficient. The strongest predictors (multiple regression) of the sleep quality index was slow‐wave sleep (SWS) and sleep efficiency [and variables related to sleep continuity ‐ total sleep time (TST) and the amount of stage 0]. The obtained results were in agreement with previous laboratory findings. It was concluded that sleep quality seems to be a matter of depth of sleep and sleep continuity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1997.00217.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2092259468", "source": "openalex"}

Fifteen studies were randomized controlled trials. While sleep hygiene interventions provided small to medium effects, the CBT s showed large effects. The variability of the effect sizes was especially large in the relaxation category, ranging from very small to very large effect sizes. Other psychotherapeutic interventions showed medium effects. CBT approaches provided the best effects for the improvement of different sleep variables in college students. Five studies included insomnia patients.

The mechanisms that regulate the need of sleep at the cellular level are largely unknown. The inhibitory neuromodulator, adenosine, is a promising candidate for a sleep-inducing factor: its concentration is higher during wakefulness than during sleep, it accumulates in the brain during prolonged wakefulness, and local perfusions as well as systemic administration of adenosine and its agonists induce sleep and decrease wakefulness. Adenosine receptor antagonists, caffeine and theophylline, are widely used as stimulants of the central nervous system to induce vigilance and increase the time spent awake. Our hypothesis is that adenosine accumulates in the extracellular space of the basal forebrain during wakefulness, increasing the sleep propensity. The increase in extracellular adenosine concentration decreases the activity of the wakefulness-promoting cell groups, especially the cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain. When the activity of the wakefulness-active cells decreases sufficiently sleep is initiated.

Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1299721", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014766248", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1608823", "title": "Sleep Apnea and Body Position during Sleep", "text": "In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, it is believed that body position influences apnea frequency. Sleeping in the lateral decubitus position often results in significantly fewer apneas, and some have recommended sleeping on the side as the major treatment intervention. Previous studies, although calculating apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for supine and lateral decubitus positions, have not taken sleep stage into account. To examine the effect of both sleep stage and body position on apnea duration (AD) and frequency, we determined AHI and AD in all spontaneous body positions during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep by reviewing videotapes and polysomnograms from 11 overnight studies of 7 obese patients with severe sleep apnea. Consistent with previous work, AD was significantly longer in REM then in NREM (32.5 +/- 2.3 s versus 23.5 +/- 1.9 s; p less than 0.05). This difference persisted when adjusting for body position. AHI was greater on the back than on the sides (84.4 +/- 4.9/h versus 73.6 +/- 7.5/h, p less than 0.05), but after accounting for sleep stage, this difference remained only for NREM (103 +/- 4.8/h versus 80.3 +/- 9.2/h, p less than 0.05) and not for REM (83.6 +/- 5.3/h versus 71.1 +/- 4.2/h, p NS). Although reduced, AHI on the sides still remained clinically very high. Body position changed frequently throughout the night, but some patients spent little or no time on their back. We conclude that AD is longer in REM than NREM, regardless of position, and AHI is higher on the back only in NREM. As AHI remains very high on the sides, favoring the lateral decubitus position may not be as beneficial as previously thought in very obese patients. Less obese patients are more likely to benefit by position changes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/11.1.90", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1608823", "source": "openalex"}

Maturational changes in sleep and circadian regulation likely contribute to the development and maintenance of such problems. This review highlights the recent research examining bioregulatory sleep mechanisms during development and provides a model for predicting sleep–wake behavior in young humans. Recent findings Findings demonstrate that circadian and sleep homeostatic processes exhibit maturational changes during the first two decades of life. The developing interaction of both processes may be a key determinant of sleep–wake and crying behavior in infancy. Evidence shows that the dynamics of sleep homeostatic processes slow down in the course of childhood (i.e., sleep pressure accumulates more slowly with increasing age) enabling children to be awake for consolidated periods during the day. Another current topic is the adolescent sleep phase delay, which appears to be driven primarily by maturational changes in sleep homeostatic and circadian processes.

The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale were given to each. Seventy percent of the patients had five or more respiratory disturbances per hour of sleep and 96 percent showed some dementia. Sleep apnea was significantly correlated with all sub‐scales on the dementia rating scale. There were trivial differences in dementia ratings between those with mild‐moderate apnea and those with no apnea. There were significant differences, however, between the latter two groups and those with severe apnea. In particular, items reflecting attention, initiation and perseveration, conceptualization, and memory tasks on the DRS distinguished between those with and without severe sleep apnea. Among those patients with no depression, all patients with severe sleep apnea were also severely demented. Our data suggest that there is a strong relationship between dementia and sleep apnea when the sleep apnea and dementia are severe.

Blood samples were collected at 0600–0630 h on awakening for measurement of plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), total and free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, FSH, PRL, T4, T4-binding globulin, and cortisol. The plasma hormone levels were analyzed in relation to the severity of sleep apnea, as indicated by the desaturation index (the hourly rate of episodes of arterial oxygen desaturation >4% of the stable baseline) and the mean minimal oxygen saturation during the desaturation episodes. In the cross-sectional study plasma IGFI, free and total testosterone, and SHBG levels were significantly lower in relation to the severity of sleep apnea, whereas plasma LH, FSH, PRL, T4, T4-binding globulin, and cortisol were not.

Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites; thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABA(A) receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and--in various combinations--electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations (>100 Hz, \"VFO\"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00983.2004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2147576365", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep characteristics were assessed by polysomnography. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies (from 1130 to 1430 h) with infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose.Sleep duration was shorter in the night with sleep restriction than in the unrestricted night (226 +/- 11 vs. 454 +/- 9 min; P< 0.0001). Sleep restriction did not affect basal levels of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, or endogenous glucose production. Sleep restriction resulted in increased endogenous glucose production during the hyperinsulinemic clamp study compared to the unrestricted night (4.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.2 micromol x kg lean body mass(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.017), indicating hepatic insulin resistance. In addition, sleep restriction decreased the glucose disposal rate during the clamp (32.5 +/- 3.6 vs. 40.7 +/- 5.1 micromol x kg lean body mass(-1) x min(-1); P = 0009), reflecting decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Although the effects of sleep deprivation on our organs have been obscure, recent epidemiological studies have revealed relationships between sleep deprivation and hypertension (HT), coronary heart disease (CHD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). This review article summarizes the literature on these relationships. Because sleep deprivation increases sympathetic nervous system activity, this increased activity serves as a common pathophysiology for HT and DM.

All patients had sundowning behavior and sleep disturbances. After a week of baseline measurements, patients received 2 hours/day of exposure to bright light between 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. for 1 week. During the baseline week, the treatment week, and a posttreatment week, patients were rated by nurses for agitation, sleep-wake patterns, use of restraints, and use of prescribed-as-needed medication. On the last 2 days of each week, patients wore activity monitors. Activity counts were analyzed for circadian rhythmicity.Clinical ratings of sleep-wakefulness on the evening nursing shift improved with light treatment in eight of the 10 patients. The proportion of total daily activity occurring during the nighttime decreased during the light-treatment week. The relative amplitude of the circadian locomotor activity rhythm, a measure of its stability, increased during the light-treatment week. More severe sundowning at baseline predicted greater clinical improvement.Evening bright light pulses may ameliorate sleep-wake cycle disturbances in some patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Long‐acting benzodiazepines (e.g., Flurazepam) often produce daytime somnolence and performance deficits, whereas short‐acting drugs (e.g., triazolam) have been associated with marked rebound insomnia and anterograde memory loss. The authors designed a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of an intermediate‐acting benzodiazepine, estazolam (e.g., ProSom), as well as its side effects. The parameters studied were sleep, daytime performance, and memory. Ten geriatric patients (&gt;60 years of age) with insomnia participated in the study. They received placebo nightly for 2 weeks (baseline), estazolam 1 mg nightly for the next 4 weeks (treatment phase), and placebo again for 2 weeks (withdrawal period). Sleep was monitored by polysomnography the first two nights of each week in a sleep laboratory. Estazolam significantly decreased sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, and wake time after sleep onset. Total sleep time increased an average of 63 minutes the first night of treatment. Significant improvements in wake time after sleep onset and total sleep time also were observed in the fourth week of estazolam treatment. Rebound insomnia occurred on the first withdrawal night only for wake time and total sleep time. By the next night, these sleep parameters returned to baseline. Neither daytime performance nor anterograde memory was adversely affected by estazolam treatment or its withdrawal.

In supine subjects, contiguous transverse 10 mm sections were taken perpendicular to the posterior pharyngeal wall with a 2.1 s scan time. Studies during wakefulness showed that the narrowest section of the pharyngeal airspace was in the region posterior to the soft palate and that the minimal airway cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in the group of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea compared to the group of control subjects without obstructive sleep apnoea. The studies during sleep showed that in all patients, the airspace posterior to the soft palate was a site of obstructive apnoeas. The length of the obstructed segment varied between patients, extending below the level of the soft palate in half the patient group. Airway narrowing and obstruction was due to posterior displacement of the soft palate and the tongue in the majority of patients, although lateral displacement of the pharyngeal walls was also observed. No occlusion was observed in the laryngopharynx although there was narrowing of oro- and laryngopharyngeal apertures below the site of obstruction during obstructive apnoeas.

For awake subjects, AM/FM tones produced larger amplitude responses than did AM tones. Awake and sleeping responses to 30-dB HL AM/FM tones were compared. Response amplitudes were lower during sleep and the extent to which they differed from awake amplitudes was dependent on both carrier and modulation frequencies. Background EEG noise at the stimulus modulation frequency was also reduced during sleep and varied with modulation frequency. A detection efficiency function was used to indicate the modulation frequencies likely to be most suitable for electrical estimation of behavioral threshold. In awake subjects, for all carrier frequencies tested, detection efficiency was highest at a modulation frequency of 45 Hz. In sleeping subjects, the modulation frequency regions of highest efficiency varied with carrier frequency. For carrier frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, and 1 kHz, the highest efficiencies were found in two modulation frequency regions centered on 45 and 90 Hz. For 2 and 4 kHz, the highest efficiencies were at modulation frequencies above 70 Hz. Sleep stage affected both response amplitude and background EEG noise in a manner that depended on modulation frequency.

On selective SWS deprivation (SWSD) nights, when delta waves (indicative of SWS) were detected on EEG, a computer generated tone (maximum 85 decibels) was delivered until delta waves disappeared. Musculoskeletal tender points were measured by dolorimetry; skinfold tenderness was assessed by skin roll procedure; and reactive hyperemia was assessed with a cotton swab test. Subjects completed questionnaires on bodily feelings, symptoms, and mood.On each SWSD night, SWS was decreased significantly with minimal alterations in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and other sleep stages. Subjects showed a 24% decrease in musculoskeletal pain threshold after the third SWSD night. They also reported increased discomfort, tiredness, fatigue, and reduced vigor. The flare response (area of vasodilatation) in skin was greater than baseline after the first, and again, after the third SWSD night. However, the automated program for SWSD did not evoke an alpha EEG sleep pattern.Disrupting SWS, without reducing total sleep or sleep efficiency, for several consecutive nights is associated with decreased pain threshold, increased discomfort, fatigue, and the inflammatory flare response in skin.

The best characterized marker of sleep homeostasis is slow wave activity (SWA), the EEG power between 0.5 and 4 Hz during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. SWA reflects the accumulation of sleep pressure as a function of duration and/or intensity of prior wake: it increases after spontaneous wake and short-term (3–24 h) sleep deprivation and decreases during sleep. However, recent evidence suggests that during chronic sleep restriction (SR) sleep may be regulated by both allostatic and homeostatic mechanisms. Here, we performed continuous, almost completely artifact-free EEG recordings from frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex in freely moving rats ( n = 11) during and after 5 d of SR. During SR, rats were allowed to sleep during the first 4 h of the light period (4S + ) but not during the following 20 h (20S − ). During the daily 20S − most sleep was prevented, whereas the number of short (&lt;20 s) sleep attempts increased. Low-frequency EEG power (1–6 Hz) in both sleep and wake also increased during 20S − , most notably in the occipital cortex. In all animals NREM SWA increased above baseline levels during the 4S + periods and in post-SR recovery. The SWA increase was more pronounced in frontal cortex, and its magnitude was determined by the efficiency of SR. Analysis of cumulative slow wave energy demonstrated that the loss of SWA during SR was compensated by the end of the second recovery day. Thus, the homeostatic regulation of sleep is preserved under conditions of chronic SR.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1002570107", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982978331", "source": "openalex"}

The homeostatic approach assumes that the sleep substance accumulates during waking and dissipates during sleep. Sleep deprivation has been the principal tool for enhancing the level of a sleep substance in a donor animal before testing its hypnogenic effect in a recipient animal. Among the two sleep factors isolated by this approach, Factor S has been identified as a muramyl peptide, whereas the composition of Sleep Promoting Substance (SPS) has not yet been fully clarified. Recently, factors have been obtained from REM sleep deprived donors which are able to antagonize drug-induced REM sleep suppression in recipients. The homeostatic approach can be related to physiological processes underlying sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythms. The non-homeostatic approach to sleep substances is based on the serendipitous discovery of a hypnogenic action. While a number of such substances have been described, their relationship to physiological sleep regulation is unknown. Melatonin has been reported to induce or enhance sleep in animals and man.

Regular snoring was significantly associated with male sex, age 25 or more, obesity, daytime sleepiness or naps, night time awakenings, consuming large amounts of caffeine, and smoking. Breathing pauses during sleep were significantly associated with obstructive airways or thyroid disease, male sex, age 35-44 years, consumption of anxiety reducing drugs, complaints of non-restorative sleep, and consultation with a doctor in the past year. The two breathing symptoms were also significantly associated with drowsiness while driving.

The two samples included 96 white children between 6 months and 4 years of age. In each group, approximately 30% had a sleep problem by the criteria that night waking involving parents or bedtime struggles occurred three or more nights a week for the month preceding the interview, accompanied by conflict or distress. Five experiences distinguished children with sleep problems from those without: an accident or illness in the family, unaccustomed absence of the mother during the day, maternal depressed mood(s), sleeping in the parental bed, and maternal attitude of ambivalence toward the child. These experiences correctly classified 100% of pilot and 83% of validation sample children as having a sleep problem or not. The similarity of findings in the two samples attests to the potential importance of sleep problems as an early childhood symptom.

The present study bridges this research by examining the links among alcohol use, sleep, and academic performance in college students. Method: Personal interview surveys were conducted with a random sample of 236 students (124 women) at a liberal arts college. The interviews measured alcohol consumption, gender, academic class, weekday and weekend bedtimes and rise times, and daytime sleepiness; 95% of the sample granted permission to obtain grade-point average (GPA) and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores from official college records. Results: Ordinary least squares regressions showed that alcohol consumption was a significant predictor of four sleep patterns: the duration of sleep, the timing of sleep, the difference between weekday and weekend nighttime sleep hours (oversleep), and the difference between weekday and weekend bedtimes (bedtime delay). Women and students with late sleep schedules were more apt to report daytime sleepiness. SAT score was the strongest predictor of GPA. However, gender, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness also were significant predictors when other variables were controlled. In addition to alcohol's direct relationship with GPA, mediational analysis indicated that alcohol had indirect effects on sleepiness and GPA, primarily through its effect on sleep schedule.

Arousals are provoked by stimuli generated during upper airway obstruction. Mechanoreceptor stimuli produced during obstructed inspiratory efforts appear to play a major role in mediating the end-apneic arousal response. The sleep disruption resulting from repeated arousals plays a major role in the pathogenesis of most of the consequences of OSA (i.e. neuropsychiatric, respiratory, and cardiovascular) and may contribute to the progression of OSA severity. However, the relative contribution of sleep fragmentation versus hypoxia in producing these complications and the precise mechanisms require further studies to be elucidated. A recently developed animal model of long-term repeated airway occlusion during sleep and a modification of the model to produce isolated sleep fragmentation should provide important new insights in this field. Treatment of the sleep disruption owing to OSA is achieved by minimizing the occurrence of arousal-promoting stimuli.

Using a high-energy focused microwave irradiation method to kill animals and thereby snap-inactivate glycogen-producing and -metabolizing enzymes, we determined, with accuracy and precision, levels of brain glycogen and showed these levels to decrease significantly by approximately 40% in brains of rats deprived of sleep for 12 or 24 hr. Recovery sleep of 15 hr duration after 12 hr of sleep deprivation reversed the decreases in glycogen. Using a novel histochemical method to stain brain glycogen, we found glycogen to be concentrated in white matter; this finding was confirmed biochemically in white matter dissected from rats killed with microwave irradiation. Levels of glycogen, as determined histochemically, were significantly decreased in gray and white matter with sleep deprivation, and these decreases were reversed with recovery sleep.

This hypothesis grew from the observation that AD induces sleep and AD levels increase with wake in the basal forebrain, but surprisingly it still remains untested. Here we directly test whether the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are central to the AD regulation of sleep drive by administering 192–IgG–saporin to lesion the BF cholinergic neurons and then measuring AD levels in the BF. In rats with 95% lesion of the BF cholinergic neurons, AD levels in the BF did not increase with 6 h of prolonged waking. However, the lesioned rats had intact sleep drive after 6 and 12 h of prolonged waking, indicating that the AD accumulation in the BF is not necessary for sleep drive. Next we determined that, in the absence of the BF cholinergic neurons, the selective adenosine A 1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine, administered to the BF, continued to be effective in inducing sleep, indicating that the BF cholinergic neurons are not essential to sleep induction. Thus, neither the activity of the BF cholinergic neurons nor the accumulation of AD in the BF during wake is necessary for sleep drive.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2181-06.2006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2074994595", "source": "openalex"}

The AAP, therefore, is expanding its recommendations from being only SIDS-focused to focusing on a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths including SIDS. The recommendations described in this report include supine positioning, use of a firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, room-sharing without bed-sharing, routine immunization, consideration of a pacifier, and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs.

The results showed approximately equal awakening thresholds during REM periods (the rapid eye movement stage of sleep) and stage 2 (low voltage EEG and 12 to 14 cps “sleep spindles”). Both these stages had lower awakening thresholds than delta sleep (large slow EEG waves). Awakening thresholds became lower with accumulated sleep, independent of sleep stage. There were no significant stage independent relationships between awakening threshold and time since last awakening or time since last body movement, although the latter were varied over a relatively narrow range which limits the generality of these findings.

We measured two-point discrimination (2PD) and vibratory sensation thresholds (VT) in 37 patients with OSA (mean [ ± SE] apnea– hypopnea index [AHI] = 39 ± 5 events/h), 12 nonapneic snorers (SN), and 15 control subjects (CL). Sensory thresholds were determined in the UA and on the lip and hand as control sites. Both 2PD and VT were similar among the three groups at the lip and hand sites but were significantly reduced in the UA of OSA and SN subjects versus CL (p < 0.05). Values for 2PD and VT in the UA of OSA versus SN were not significantly different. Sensory measures were repeated after 6 mo in 23 OSA patients treated with CPAP as well as in 18 untreated patients. Thresholds for 2PD and VT at control sites remained identical in both groups, as did 2PD for the UA. However, VT in the UA showed a significant improvement in treated (4.4 ± 0.2 pre-CPAP versus 3.8 ± 0.2 mm post-CPAP, p < 0.05) but not untreated patients.

Automated sleep scoring is crucial, since the large volume of data should be analyzed visually by the sleep specialists which is burdensome, time-consuming tedious, subjective, and error prone. Therefore, automated sleep stage classification is a crucial step in sleep research and sleep disorder diagnosis. In this paper, a robust system, consisting of three modules, is proposed for automated classification of sleep stages from the single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). In the first module, signals taken from Pz-Oz electrode were denoised using multiscale principal component analysis. In the second module, the most informative features are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then, statistical values of DWT subbands are calculated. In the third module, extracted features were fed into an ensemble classifier, which can be called as rotational support vector machine (RotSVM). The proposed classifier combines advantages of the principal component analysis and SVM to improve classification performances of the traditional SVM. The sensitivity and accuracy values across all subjects were 84.46% and 91.1%, respectively, for the five-stage sleep classification with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.88. Obtained classification performance results indicate that, it is possible to have an efficient sleep monitoring system with a single-channel EEG, and can be used effectively in medical and home-care applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tim.2018.2799059", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2793841943", "source": "openalex"}

Experimental sleep restriction has been shown to raise blood pressure and heart rate. Insufficient sleep on a chronic basis can raise average 24-hour blood pressure and lead to structural adaptations that entrain the cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated blood pressure equilibrium and increase the risk for hypertension. Disruptions in the timing and duration of sleep could also disrupt circadian rhythmicity and autonomic balance, which can increase the prevalence of the nondipping pattern, disturb diurnal rhythm of cardiac output, and increase blood pressure variability. Short sleep duration has been found to be associated with higher blood pressure and hypertension in both cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies. The association appears stronger in middle-aged adults and in women. Experimental sleep extension has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. The observed association between sleep duration and hypertension raises the hypothesis that interventions to extend sleep and improve sleep quality could serve as effective primary, secondary, and tertiary preventive measures for hypertension.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpu071", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2111031733", "source": "openalex"}

The initial observations obtained in isolated subjects revealed that the period of the endogenous circadian pacemaker regulating sleep is of approximately 25 hours. More recent studies, however, in which a more rigorous control of subjects' behavior was exerted, particularly over lighting conditions, have shown that the true periodicity of the endogenous pacemaker deviates from 24 hours by a few minutes only. Besides sleep propensity, the circadian pacemaker has been shown to regulate sleep consolidation, sleep stage structure, and electroencephalographic activities. The pattern of light exposure throughout the 24 hours appears to participate in the entrainment of the circadian pacemaker to the geophysical day-night cycle. Melatonin, the pineal hormone produced during the dark hours, participates in communicating both between the environmental light-dark cycle and the circadian pacemaker, and between the circadian pacemaker and the sleep-wake-generating mechanism. In contrast to prevailing views that have placed great emphasis on homeostatic sleep drive, recent data have revealed a potent circadian cycle in the drive for wakefulness, which is generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This drive reaches a peak during the evening hours just before habitual bedtime.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.277", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151596523", "source": "openalex"}

The increase in steady-state arterial PCO2 accompanying sleep is shown to be inversely related to the ventilatory response to CO2. Chemical control of respiration becomes less stable during the light stage of sleep, despite a reduction in chemoresponsiveness, due to a concomitant increase in \"plant gain\" (i.e., responsiveness of blood gases to ventilatory changes). The withdrawal of the \"wakefulness drive\" during sleep onset represents a strong perturbation to respiratory control: higher magnitudes and rates of withdrawal of this drive favor instability. These results may account for the higher incidence of periodic breathing observed during light sleep and sleep onset. Periodic ventilation can also result from repetitive alternations between sleep onset and arousal. The potential for instability is further compounded if the possibility of upper airway occlusion is also included. In systems with high controller gains, instability is mediated primarily through chemoreflex overcompensation. However, in systems with depressed chemoresponsiveness, rapid sleep onset and large blood gas fluctuations trigger repetitive episodes of arousal and hyperpnea alternating with apneas that may or may not be obstructive. Between these extremes, more complex patterns can arise from the interaction between chemoreflex-mediated oscillations of shorter-cycle-duration (approximately 36 s) and longer-wavelength (approximately 60-80 s) state-driven oscillations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1991.70.5.2014", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097207628", "source": "openalex"}

While measures of sleep latency, continuous encephalographical/electro-oculographical (EEG/EOG) recording and performance tests are useful indicators of sleepiness in the laboratory and clinic, they are not easily implemented in large, real-life field studies. Subjective ratings of sleepiness, which are easily applied and unobtrusive, are an alternative, but whether they measure sleepiness sensitively, reliably and validly remains uncertain. This review brings together research relevant to these issues. It is focused on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), which is a nine-point Likert-type scale. The diurnal pattern of sleepiness is U-shaped, with high KSS values in the morning and late evening, and with great stability across years. KSS values increase sensitively during acute total and repeated partial sleep deprivation and night work, including night driving. The effect sizes range between 1.5 and 3. The relation to driving performance or EEG/EOG indicators of sleepiness is highly significant, strongly curvilinear and consistent across individuals. High (>6) KSS values are associated particularly with impaired driving performance and sleep intrusions in the EEG. KSS values are also increased in many clinical conditions such as sleep apnea, depression and burnout. The context has a strong influence on KSS ratings. Thus, physical activity, social interaction and light exposure will reduce KSS values by 1-2 units. In contrast, time-on-task in a monotonous context will increase KSS values by 1-2 units. In summary, subjective ratings of sleepiness as described here is as sensitive and valid an indicator of sleepiness as objective measures, and particularly suitable for field studies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.12158", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1971328201", "source": "openalex"}

Although sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been implicated as a risk factor for MetS in adults, its association with SDB in adolescents is unknown.Objectives: To define the association of SDB with MetS in adolescents.Methods: Standardized measurements of SDB, anthropometry and bioassays, were made in 270 adolescents, aged 13.6 ± 0.7 years. MetS was identified if threshold levels were exceeded in three of five areas: waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and glucose levels.Measurements and Main Results: Although 70% of children with SDB (apnea–hypopnea index ⩾ 5) were overweight and 59% had MetS, 16% of children without SDB had MetS. Twenty-five percent of those with MetS had SDB. After adjusting for age, race, sex, and preterm status, children with SDB had a 6.49 (95% confidence interval, 2.52, 16.70) increased odds of MetS compared with children without SDB. Indices of SDB stress associated with MetS included respiratory event frequency, degree of oxygen desaturation, and sleep efficiency. Analyses of individual metabolic parameters showed that, after adjustment for body mass index, SDB was associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting insulin levels.Conclusions: A majority of adolescents with SDB are overweight and meet criteria for MetS.

Vgontzas AN, Bixler EO, Chrousos GP (Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Metabolic disturbances in obesity versus sleep apnoea: the importance of visceral obesity and insulin resistance (Minisymposium). J Intern Med 2003; 254: –. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a very prevalent disorder particularly amongst middle‐aged, obese men, although its existence in women as well as in lean individuals is increasingly recognized. Despite the early recognition of the strong association between OSA and obesity, and OSA and cardiovascular problems, sleep apnoea has been treated as a ‘local abnormality’ of the respiratory track rather than as a ‘systemic illness’. In 1997, we first reported that the pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)‐6 and tumour necrosis factor‐ α (TNF α ) were elevated in patients with disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and proposed that these cytokines were mediators of daytime sleepiness. Also, we reported a positive correlation between IL‐6 or TNF α plasma levels and the body mass index (BMI). In subsequent studies, we showed that IL‐6, TNF α , leptin and insulin levels were elevated in sleep apnoea independently of obesity and that visceral fat, was the primary parameter linked with sleep apnoea. The association of OSA with insulin resistance and diabetes type 2 has been confirmed since then in several epidemiological and clinical studies. Furthermore, our findings that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, a condition associated with hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance) were much more likely than controls to have sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and daytime sleepiness support the pathogenetic role of insulin resistance in OSA. Other findings that support the view that sleep apnoea and sleepiness may be manifestations of a serious metabolic disorder, namely the Metabolic or Visceral Obesity Syndrome, include: obesity without sleep apnoea is associated with daytime sleepiness; PCOS and diabetes type 2 are independently associated with EDS after controlling for SDB, obesity and age; and increased prevalence of sleep apnoea in postmenopausal women, with hormonal replacement therapy associated with a significantly reduced risk for OSA. In conclusion, accumulating evidence provides support to our model of the bi‐directional, feedforward, pernicious association between sleep apnoea, sleepiness, inflammation and insulin resistance, all promoting atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01177.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975324052", "source": "openalex"}

Analyses were performed by quartile of total testosterone and categorically defined low vs. higher total testosterone (<250 ng/dl vs. > or =250 ng/dl). Lifestyle and body size were covariates.Total testosterone levels were unrelated to age or duration of sleep. Men with lower testosterone levels had lower sleep efficiency, with increased nocturnal awakenings and less time in slow-wave sleep as well as a higher apnea-hypopnea index and more sleep time with O(2) saturation levels below 90%. Low testosterone levels were associated with overweight, and all significant associations were attenuated or absent after adjusting for body mass index or waist circumference. In a post hoc analysis in men with higher body mass index (>27 kg/m2), testosterone was significantly associated with more periods awake after sleep onset and lower sleep efficiency.Low total testosterone levels are associated with less healthy sleep in older men.

Recipients of fluid from normal dogs remained alert. The hypnotoxic factor was said to be nondialyzable and thermolabile. The Pieron phenomenon was reinvestigated in 1939 by Schnedorf and Ivy,2 who reported positive results in 9 out of 20 trials. The experimental conditions involved severe stress to both donor and recipient animals. Donor animals were deprived of for 7-16 days and the technique of transferring relatively large quantities of CSF from donor to normal recipient without anesthesia undoubtedly involved severe trauma to the experimental animals. For these and other reasons, Schnedorf and Ivy questioned the relevance of the Pieron phenomenon to inormal sleep, although they were conivinced that the phenomenon was real. MVtonnier el al.3' 4 have recenitly reported that electrical stimulationl of ceniters in the thalamus of rabbits causes release of a dialyzable sleep-promoting factor in cerebral venous blood. The role of this substance in the iniitiation of normal is unknown, as is its relation to the nondialyzable material described by Pieron.

By contrast, poor or disordered sleep is related to impairment of cognitive and psychological functioning and worsened physical health. These associations are well documented not only in adults but also in children and adolescents. Importantly, adolescence is hallmarked by dramatic maturational changes in sleep and its neurobiological regulation, hormonal status, and many psychosocial and physical processes. Thus, the role of sleep in mental and physical health during adolescence and in adolescent patients is complex. However, it has so far received little attention. This review first presents contemporary views about the complex neurobiology of sleep and its functions with important implications for adolescence. Second, existing complex relationships between common adolescent somatic/organic, sleep-related, and psychiatric disorders and certain sleep alterations are discussed. It is concluded that poor or altered sleep in adolescent patients may trigger and maintain many psychiatric and physical disorders or combinations of these conditions, which presumably hinder recovery and may cross into later stages of life. Therefore, timely diagnosis and management of sleep problems appear critical for growth and development in adolescent patients.

We hypothesized that SWA is high at sleep onset because it reflects the occurrence, during the previous waking period, of widespread synaptic potentiation in cortical and subcortical areas. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently showed that the more rats explore, the stronger is the cortical expression of BDNF during wakefulness, and the larger is the increase in SWA during the subsequent sleep period. There is compelling evidence that BDNF plays a causal role in synaptic potentiation, and exogenous application of BDNF in vivo is sufficient to induce long-term increases in synaptic strength. We therefore performed cortical unilateral microinjections of BDNF in awake rats and measured SWA during the subsequent sleep period. SWA during NREM sleep was higher in the injected hemisphere relative to the contralateral one. The effect was reversible within 2 h, and did not occur during wakefulness or rapid eye movement sleep. Asymmetries in NREM SWA did not occur after vehicle injections. Furthermore, microinjections, during wakefulness, of a polyclonal anti-BDNF antibody or K252a, an inhibitor of BDNF TrkB receptors, led to a local SWA decrease during the following sleep period. These effects were also reversible and specific for NREM sleep. These results show a causal link between BDNF expression during wakefulness and subsequent sleep regulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.5510-07.2008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013825587", "source": "openalex"}

Methods This observational study was conducted in the adult ICU of a tertiary referralhospital in Australia, enrolling 57 patients. Polysomnography (PSG) was performedover a 24-hour period to assess the quantity (total sleep time: hh:mm) and quality(percentage per stage, duration of sleep episode) of patients' sleep while in ICU.Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria were used to categorise sleep. Interrater checkswere performed. Sound pressure and illuminance levels and care events weresimultaneously recorded. Patients reported on their sleep quality in ICU using theRichards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire and the Sleep in Intensive CareQuestionnaire. Data were summarised using frequencies and proportions or measuresof central tendency and dispersion as appropriate and Cohen's Kappa statistic wasused for interrater reliability of the sleep data analysis. Results Patients' median total sleep time was 05:00 (IQR: 02:52 to 07:14). The majority ofsleep was stage 1 and 2 (medians: 19 and 73%) with scant slow wave and REM sleep.The median duration of sleep without waking was 00:03. Sound levels were high(mean Leq 53.95 dB(A) during the day and 50.20 dB(A) at night) and illuminancelevels were appropriate at night (median &lt;2 lux) but low during the day(median: 74.20 lux). There was a median 1.7 care events/h. Patients' meanself-reported sleep quality was poor. Interrater reliability of sleep staging washighest for slow wave sleep and lowest for stage 1 sleep. Conclusions The quantity and quality of sleep in intensive care patients are poor and may berelated to noise, critical illness itself and treatment events that disturb sleep.The study highlights the challenge of quantifying sleep in the critical caresetting and the need for alternative methods of measuring sleep.

Repeated episodes of apnea and hypopnea may result in desaturation and arousals, which could adversely affect left ventricular function. The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on sleep-disordered breathing and its consequences in heart failure patients. Methods and Results —The author prospectively studied 29 male patients whose initial polysomnograms showed 15 or more episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI). Twenty-one patients had predominately central and 8 patients obstructive sleep apnea. All were treated with CPAP during the subsequent night. In 16 patients, CPAP resulted in virtual elimination of disordered breathing.

In contrast, in patients whose sleep apnea did not respond to CPAP, ventricular arrhythmias did not change significantly. Conclusions —In 55% of patients with heart failure and sleep apnea, first-night nasal CPAP eliminates disordered breathing and reduces ventricular irritability.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.101.4.392", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2091052434", "source": "openalex"}

A total of 124 (104 male, 20 female) elite athletes (mean ± s: age 22.2 ± 3.0 years) from five individual sports and four team sports participated in this study. Participants' sleep/wake behaviour was assessed using self-report sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors for a minimum of seven nights (range 7-28 nights) during a typical training phase. Mixed-effects analyses of variances were conducted to compare the differences in the sleep/wake behaviour of athletes from two sport types (i.e. individual and team). Overall, this sample of athletes went to bed at 22:59 ± 1.3, woke up at 07:15 ± 1.2 and obtained 6.8 ± 1.1 h of sleep per night. Athletes from individual sports went to bed earlier, woke up earlier and obtained less sleep (individual vs team; 6.5 vs 7.0 h) than athletes from team sports. These data indicate that athletes obtain well below the recommended 8 h of sleep per night, with shorter sleep durations existing among athletes from individual sports.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2014.932016", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987151381", "source": "openalex"}

A longitudinal study was undertaken to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbance among elderly people in an inner London community and its association with demographic variables, depression, dementia and disability. Those aged 65 years and over living at home were interviewed using a validated and reliable semi-structured interview schedule. A total of 705 people were interviewed in 1987-88 and 524 were re-interviewed in 1990. Subjective sleep disturbance was found to be common (33% and 43%, respectively). Sleep disturbance was associated with being a woman, being unmarried, living alone, disability, and current and future depression, but not with dementia or older age. The best predictor of future depression in elderly people who were not depressed was current sleep disturbance. In the presence of current sleep disturbance, the traditional predictors of depression--being a woman, having a disability, being unmarried, living alone and being older--did not contribute further. This study has shown that sleep disorder is associated with pathology.

However, the possibility that inflammatory processes may underlie this constellation of symptoms has not been examined.Women (N = 103) who had recently finished primary treatment (ie, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) for early-stage breast cancer completed self-report scales and provided blood samples for determination of plasma levels of inflammatory markers: soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor II (sTNF-RII), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and C-reactive protein.Symptoms were elevated at the end of treatment; greater than 60% of participants reported clinically significant problems with fatigue and sleep, and 25% reported elevated depressive symptoms. Women treated with chemotherapy endorsed higher levels of all symptoms and also had higher plasma levels of sTNF-RII than women who did not receive chemotherapy (all P < .05). Fatigue was positively associated with sTNF-RII, particularly in the chemotherapy-treated group (P < .05). Depressive symptoms and sleep problems were correlated with fatigue but not with inflammatory markers.This study confirms high rates of behavioral symptoms in breast cancer survivors, particularly those treated with chemotherapy, and indicates a role for TNF-α signaling as a contributor to postchemotherapy fatigue.

Chronotype, an attribute that reflects individual preferences in the timing of sleep and other behaviors, is a continuum from morningness to eveningness. The importance of chronotype in relation to obesity is mostly unknown. Evening types tend to have unhealthy eating habits and suffer from psychological problems more frequently than Morning types, thus we hypothesized that eveningness may affect health parameters in a cohort of obese individuals reporting sleeping less than 6.5 hours per night. Methodology and Principal Findings Baseline data from obese (BMI: 38.5±6.4 kg/m2) and short sleeping (5.8±0.8 h/night by actigraphy) participants (n = 119) of the Sleep Extension Study were analyzed (www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT00261898). Assessments included the Horne and Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire, a three-day dietary intake diary, a 14-day sleep diary, 14 days of actigraphy, and measurements of sleep apnea. Twenty-four hour urinary free cortisol, 24 h urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, morning plasma ACTH and serum cortisol, fasting glucose and insulin, and lipid parameters were determined. Eveningness was associated with eating later in the day on both working and non-working days. Progression towards eveningness was associated with an increase in BMI, resting heart rate, food portion size, and a decrease in the number of eating occasions and HDL-cholesterol. Evening types had overtly higher 24 h urinary epinephrine and morning plasma ACTH levels, and higher morning resting heart rate than Morning types. In addition, Evening types more often had sleep apnea, independent of BMI or neck circumference. Conclusions Eveningness was associated with eating later and a tendency towards fewer and larger meals and lower HDL-cholesterol levels. In addition, Evening types had more sleep apnea and higher stress hormones. Thus, eveningness in obese, chronically sleep-deprived individuals compounds the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056519", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2092312897", "source": "openalex"}

Studies in both humans and rats suggest that sleep deprivation may activate the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis, one of the main neuroendocrine stress systems. However, few attempts have been made to examine how sleep loss affects the HPA axis response to subsequent stressors. Furthermore, most studies applied short‐lasting total sleep deprivation and not restriction of sleep over a longer period of time, as often occurs in human society. Using the rat as our model species, we investigated: (i) the HPA axis activity during and after sleep deprivation and (ii) the effect of sleep loss on the subsequent HPA response to a novel stressor. In one experiment, rats were subjected to 48 h of sleep deprivation by placing them in slowly rotating wheels. Control rats were placed in nonrotating wheels. In a second experiment, rats were subjected to an 8‐day sleep restriction protocol allowing 4 h of sleep each day. To test the effects of sleep loss on subsequent stress reactivity, rats were subjected to a 30‐min restraint stress. Blood samples were taken at several time points and analysed for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone. The results show that ACTH and corticosterone concentrations were elevated during sleep deprivation but returned to baseline within 4 h of recovery. After 1 day of sleep restriction, the ACTH and corticosterone response to restraint stress did not differ between control and sleep deprived rats. However, after 48 h of total sleep deprivation and after 8 days of restricted sleep, the ACTH response to restraint was significantly reduced whereas the corticosterone response was unaffected. These results show that sleep loss not only is a mild activator of the HPA axis itself, but also affects the subsequent response to stress. Alterations in HPA axis regulation may gradually appear under conditions of long total sleep deprivation but also after repeated sleep curtailment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0007-1331.2002.00790.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2131575045", "source": "openalex"}

This effect is mediated in part by a modulation of the hippocampus by the amygdala. Sleep plays a role in the consolidation of declarative memory. We examined the impact of sleep and lack of sleep on the consolidation of emotional (negative and positive) memories at the macroscopic systems level. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we compared the neural correlates of successful recollection by humans of emotional and neutral stimuli, 72 h after encoding, with or without total sleep deprivation during the first post-encoding night. In contrast to recollection of neutral and positive stimuli, which was deteriorated by sleep deprivation, similar recollection levels were achieved for negative stimuli in both groups. Successful recollection of emotional stimuli elicited larger responses in the hippocampus and various cortical areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, in the sleep group than in the sleep deprived group. This effect was consistent across subjects for negative items but depended linearly on individual memory performance for positive items. In addition, the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex were functionally more connected during recollection of either negative or positive than neutral items, and more so in sleeping than in sleep-deprived subjects. In the sleep-deprived group, recollection of negative items elicited larger responses in the amygdala and an occipital area than in the sleep group. In contrast, no such difference in brain responses between groups was associated with recollection of positive stimuli. The results suggest that the emotional significance of memories influences their sleep-dependent systems-level consolidation. The recruitment of hippocampo-neocortical networks during recollection is enhanced after sleep and is hindered by sleep deprivation. After sleep deprivation, recollection of negative, potentially dangerous, memories recruits an alternate amygdalo-cortical network, which would keep track of emotional information despite sleep deprivation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050282", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2161213203", "source": "openalex"}

Furthermore, we wanted to identify possible risk factors to these phenomena. Detailed information on somnolence and sleep during daytime, as well as sleep benefit (SB) on awakening, was collected through a questionnaire among 245 patients with PD. Daytime somnolence was graded in groups of no somnolence, mild daytime sleepiness, and EDS. In addition, the occurrence of somnolence in the patients with PD was compared with the occurrence among control groups of patients with diabetes mellitus and of healthy elderly subjects. The correlations between EDS and SB and various motor- and non-motor symptoms of PD were evaluated. Among the patients with PD, 15.5% experienced EDS, significantly more than in the patients with diabetes mellitus (4%) and the healthy control subjects (1%). The frequency of mild daytime sleepiness was similar (10%) in patients with PD and control subjects. The patients with EDS had significantly higher staging of PD, were more disabled, and showed a higher frequency of cognitive decline compared with the patients without somnolence. They also had been using levodopa for a longer time and had more hallucinations. The occurrence of nocturnal sleeping problems and the use of sleeping pills was similar in the two groups, as was the mean age at examination, duration of PD, and presence of fluctuations and dyskinesias. SB was found in 42.2% of the patients with PD. These patients had been using levodopa for significantly longer and had significantly more fluctuations and dyskinesias compared with the patients without SB.

RESULTS: Descriptive analyses showed that 88.9% of patients reported as least one problem with disturbed sleep. Correlation analyses showed that greater sleep disturbance was associated with greater pain, disability, depression and physical symptoms, and less daily uptime. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that sleep disturbance predicted disability, daily uptime and physical symptoms independent of pain or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disruption is usually considered to be a consequence of the pain experience.

We hypothesized that the cortically generated slow rhythm would appear in the thalamus in conjunction with delta and spindle oscillations arising from intrinsic and network properties of thalamic neurons. Intracellular recordings have been obtained in anesthetized cats from RE (n = 51) and cortically projecting (n = 240) thalamic neurons. RE cells were physiologically identified by cortically evoked high-frequency spike bursts and depolarizing spindle oscillations. Thalamocortical cells were recognized by backfiring from appropriate neocortical areas, spindle- related cyclic IPSPs, and hyperpolarization-activated delta oscillation consisting of rhythmic low-threshold spikes (LTSs) alternating with afterhyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs). The slow rhythm (0.3–0.5 Hz) was recorded in 65% of RE neurons. In approximately 90% of oscillating cells, the rhythm consisted of prolonged depolarizations giving rise to trains of single action potentials. DC hyperpolarization increased the synaptic noise and, in a few cells, suppressed the long-lasting depolarizing phase of the slow rhythm, without blocking the fast EPSPs. In approximately 10% of oscillating neurons, the hyperpolarizing phase of the oscillation was much more pronounced, thus suggesting that the slow rhythm was produced by inhibitory sculpturing of the background firing. The slow oscillation was associated with faster rhythms (4–8 Hz) in the same RE neuron. The slow rhythm of RE neurons was closely related to EEG wave complexes recurring with the same frequency, and its strong dependency upon a synchronized state of cortical EEG was observed during shifts in EEG patterns at different levels of anesthesia. In 44% of thalamocortical cells the slow rhythm of depolarizing sequences was apparent and it could coexist with delta or spindle oscillations in the same neuron. The occurrence of the slowly recurring depolarizing envelopes was delayed by the hyperpolarizing spindle sequences or by the LTS-AHP sequences of delta oscillation. The hyperpolarization-activated delta potentials that tended to dampen after a few cycles were grouped in sequences recurring with the slow rhythm. We finally propose a unified scenario of the genesis of the three major sleep rhythms: slow, delta, and spindle oscillations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.13-08-03284.1993", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4296162586", "source": "openalex"}

In the present study, the authors determined lipid peroxidation in patients with OSAS and the effect of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Fourteen male patients with severe OSAS (59+/-5 apnoea x h(-1)) (+/-SEM) and 13 healthy nonsmoking, male volunteers of similar age were studied.

Patients with OSAS showed higher TBARs (28.1+/-2.8 versus 20.0+/-1.8 nmol x malondialdehyde x mgLDL protein(-1), p=0.02) and shorter lag phase values (83.8+/-3.4 versus 99.7+/-3.4 min, p=0.005) than controls.

Whether diurnal or nocturnal, sleep onset and a reduction in core temperature occur together. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep episodes are also accompanied by core and brain cooling. Thermoregulatory behaviours, like nest building and curling up, accompany this circadian temperature decline in preparation for sleeping. This could be a matter of simply comfort as animals seek warmth to compensate for lower temperatures. However, in both humans and other mammals, direct skin warming can shorten sleep-latency and promote NREM sleep. We discuss the evidence that body cooling and sleep are more fundamentally connected and that thermoregulatory behaviours, prior to sleep, form warm microclimates that accelerate NREM directly through neuronal circuits. Paradoxically, this warmth might also induce vasodilation and body cooling. In this way, warmth seeking and nesting behaviour might enhance the circadian cycle by activating specific circuits that link NREM initiation to body cooling. We suggest that these circuits explain why NREM onset is most likely when core temperature is at its steepest rate of decline and why transitions to NREM are accompanied by a decrease in brain temperature. This connection may have implications for energy homeostasis and the function of sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00336", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2940903564", "source": "openalex"}

Performance decrements were less in the 10‐min condition and least in the 2.5‐hr sleep condition. Performance under baseline and total sleep loss conditions was used to predict performance during the sleep deprivation condition using four sleep stage rules. Total time asleep and total time asleep minus stage 1 predicted performance poorly. Total SWS plus REM predicted performance best but could not differentiate the 10‐min and 2.5‐hr conditions.

Thirty children (17.3%) had epilepsy. A total sleep problem score and six factors indicative of the most common areas of sleep disorder in childhood were obtained. Of the children in our study, 23% had a pathological total sleep score, in comparison with 5% of children in the general population. Difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep-wake transition, and sleep breathing disorders were the most frequently identified problems. Active epilepsy was associated with the presence of a sleep disorder (odds ratio [OR]=17.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-115.3), as was being the child of a single-parent family (OR=3.9, 95% CI 1.3-11.6).

Population-weighted, logistic regression, with backwards-stepwise selection, examined which nutrients were associated with sleep symptoms.

Conclusions Sleep disturbance is a common consequence of TBI, but much more research is required to elucidate the nature and extent of this relation. Research needs to focus on (1) uncovering the specific types, causes, and severity of TBI that most often lead to sleep problems; (2) the specific consequences of sleep disturbance in this population (eg, impaired physical or cognitive recovery); and (3) the most effective strategies for the treatment of sleep-wake abnormalities in this population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/htr.0b013e3181a0b281", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090555468", "source": "openalex"}

A key role was shown for the reciprocal interaction between sleep-promoting growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and sleep-impairing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Changes in the GHRH : CRH ratio result in changes of sleep-endocrine activity. It is thought that the change of this ratio in favour of CRH contributes to aberrations of sleep during ageing and depression (shallow sleep, blunted GH and elevated cortisol). Besides GHRH, ghrelin and galanin enhance slow wave sleep. Somatostatin is another sleep-impairing factor. Neuropeptide Y acts as a CRH antagonist and induces sleep onset. There are hints that CRH promotes rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). In animals prolactin enhances REMS. In humans vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) appears to play a role in the temporal organization of sleep as, after VIP, the non-REMS-REMS cycle decelerated. Cortisol appears to enhance REMS.

We hypothesized that similar endocrine alterations occur even after a single night of sleep restriction. In a balanced order, nine healthy normal-weight men spent three nights in our sleep laboratory separated by at least 2 weeks: one night with a total sleep time of 7 h, one night with a total sleep time of 4.5 h and one night with total sleep deprivation (SD). On a standard symptom-rating scale, subjects rated markedly stronger feelings of hunger after total SD than after 7 h sleep (3.9 +/- 0.7 versus 1.7 +/- 0.3; P = 0.020) or 4.5 h sleep (2.2 +/- 0.5; P = 0.041).

While energy saving can be achieved by adopting renewable energy resources or improving design of certain hardware (e.g., power amplifier) to make it more energy-efficient, the cost of purchasing, replacing, and installing new equipment (including manpower, transportation, disruption to normal operation, as well as associated energy and direct cost) is often prohibitive. By comparison, approaches that work on the operating protocols of the system do not require changes to current network architecture, making them far less costly and easier for testing and implementation. In this survey, we first present facts and figures that highlight the importance of green mobile networking and then review existing green cellular networking research with particular focus on techniques that incorporate the concept of the \"sleep mode\" in base stations. It takes advantage of changing traffic patterns on daily or weekly basis and selectively switches some lightly loaded base stations to low energy consumption modes. As base stations are responsible for the large amount of energy consumed in cellular networks, these approaches have the potential to save a significant amount of energy, as shown in various studies. However, it is noticed that certain simplifying assumptions made in the published papers introduce inaccuracies. This review will discuss these assumptions, particularly, an assumption that ignores the effect of traffic-load-dependent factors on energy consumption.

To assess the relationship between slow-wave activity (SWA) and cortical maturation, we acquired sleep EEG and magnetic resonance imaging data in children and adolescents between 8 and 19 years. We observed a tight relationship between sleep SWA and a variety of indexes of cortical maturation derived from magnetic resonance (MR) images. Specifically, gray matter volumes in regions correlating positively with the activity of slow waves largely overlapped with brain areas exhibiting an age-dependent decrease in gray matter. The positive relationship between SWA and cortical gray matter was present also for power in other frequency ranges (theta, alpha, sigma, and beta) and other vigilance states (theta during rapid eye movement sleep). Our findings indicate a strong relationship between sleep EEG activity and cortical maturation. We propose that in particular, sleep SWA represents a good marker for structural changes in neuronal networks reflecting cortical maturation during adolescence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhq129", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116116967", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep stage classification refers to identifying the various stages of sleep and is a critical step in an effort to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders. The aim of this paper is to survey the progress and challenges in various existing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal-based methods used for sleep stage identification at each phase; including pre-processing, feature extraction and classification; in an attempt to find the research gaps and possibly introduce a reasonable solution. Many of the prior and current related studies use multiple EEG channels, and are based on 30 s or 20 s epoch lengths which affect the feasibility and speed of ASSC for real-time applications. Thus, in this paper, we also present a novel and efficient technique that can be implemented in an embedded hardware device to identify sleep stages using new statistical features applied to 10 s epochs of single-channel EEG signals. In this study, the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database was used. The proposed methodology achieves an average classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 89.06%, 98.61% and 93.13%, respectively, when the decision tree classifier is applied.

A better understanding of the risk factors for obesity is therefore a critical global health concern, and human biologists can play an important role in identifying these risk factors in various populations. The objective of this review is to present the evidence that inadequate sleep may be a novel risk factor associated with increased vulnerability to obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease. Experimental studies have found that short‐term sleep restriction is associated with impaired glucose metabolism, dysregulation of appetite, and increased blood pressure. Observational studies have observed cross‐sectional associations between short sleep duration (generally &lt;6 h per night) and increased body mass index or obesity, prevalent diabetes, and prevalent hypertension. Some studies also reported an association between self‐reported long sleep duration (generally &gt;8 h per night) and cardiometabolic disease. A few prospective studies have found a significant increased risk of weight gain, incident diabetes, and incident hypertension associated with inadequate sleep. Given the potential link between inadequate sleep and obesity, a critical next step is to identify the social, cultural, and environmental determinants of sleep, which would help to identify vulnerable populations. Future human biology research should consider variation in sleep characteristics among different populations and determine whether the associations between sleep and obesity observed in Western populations persist elsewhere. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.22219", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067625286", "source": "openalex"}

Design Population‐based cross‐sectional study. Setting Six clinical sites in the United States. Participants Two thousand nine hundred nine community‐dwelling men aged 67 and older who were not selected on the basis of sleep problems or cognitive impairment. Measurements Predictors were measured using in‐home polysomnography: sleep architecture, nocturnal hypoxemia (any sleep time with arterial oxygen saturation &lt;80%), apnea–hypopnea index ( AHI ), and arousal index. Cognitive outcomes were measured using the modified Mini‐Mental State Examination (3 MS ), Trail‐Making Test Part B ( TMT ‐B), and the Digit Vigilance Test ( DVT ). Results Analyses adjusted for age, race, education, body mass index, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use showed that participants who spent less percentage of time in rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep had lower levels of cognition; participants in the lowest quartile (&lt;14.8%) took an average of 5.9 seconds longer on the TMT ‐B and 20.1 seconds longer on the DVT than those in the highest quartile (≥23.7%). Similarly, greater percentage of time spent in Stage 1 sleep was related to poorer cognitive function. Participants in the highest quartile of Stage 1 sleep (≥8.6%) had worse cognitive scores on average than those in the lowest quartile (&lt;4.0%). Those with nocturnal hypoxemia took an average of 22.3 seconds longer to complete the DVT than those without, but no associations were found with 3 MS or the TMT ‐B.

A variety of scales have been applied to the evaluation of PD sleep and wakefulness, but only a small number have been assessed specifically for clinimetric properties in the PD population. The movement disorder society has commissioned this task force to examine these scales and to assess their use in PD. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of sleep scales in PD and to determine which scales qualified for a detailed critique. The task force members, all of whom have extensive experience in assessing sleep in PD reviewed each of the scales using a structured proforma. Scales were categorized into recommended, suggested and listed according to predefined criteria. A total of 48 potential scales were identified from the search and reviewed. Twenty‐nine were excluded because they did not meet review criteria or were variations of scales already included, leaving 19 scales that were critiqued and rated by the task force based on the rating criteria. Only six were found to meet criteria for recommendation or suggestion by the task force: the PD sleep scale (PDSS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) are recommended for rating overall sleep problems to screen and to measure severity, the SCOPA‐sleep (SCOPA) is recommended for rating overall sleep problems both to screen and to measure severity, and for rating daytime sleepiness; the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is recommended for rating daytime sleepiness to screen and to measure severity; the inappropriate sleep composite score (ISCS) is suggested for rating severe daytime sleepiness or sleep attacks to screen and to measure severity; and the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) is suggested for rating sleepiness and to measure severity at a specific moment. The task force does not recommend the development of new scales, but emphasizes the need for educational efforts to train physicians in sleep interview techniques and polysomnography. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.23190", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101683457", "source": "openalex"}

After eliminating duplicates and in compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 articles qualified for systematic review, with 8 providing quantitative data for meta-analysis. In reference to polysomnography (PSG), nonsleep-staging Fitbit models tended to overestimate total sleep time (TST; range from approximately 7 to 67 mins; effect size=-0.51, P<.001; heterogenicity: I2=8.8%, P=.36) and sleep efficiency (SE; range from approximately 2% to 15%; effect size=-0.74, P<.001; heterogenicity: I2=24.0%, P=.25), and underestimate wake after sleep onset (WASO; range from approximately 6 to 44 mins; effect size=0.60, P<.001; heterogenicity: I2=0%, P=.92) and there was no significant difference in sleep onset latency (SOL; P=.37; heterogenicity: I2=0%, P=.92). In reference to PSG, nonsleep-staging Fitbit models correctly identified sleep epochs with accuracy values between 0.81 and 0.91, sensitivity values between 0.87 and 0.99, and specificity values between 0.10 and 0.52. Recent-generation Fitbit models that collectively utilize heart rate variability and body movement to assess sleep stages performed better than early-generation nonsleep-staging ones that utilize only body movement. Sleep-staging Fitbit models, in comparison to PSG, showed no significant difference in measured values of WASO (P=.25; heterogenicity: I2=0%, P=.92), TST (P=.29; heterogenicity: I2=0%, P=.98), and SE (P=.19) but they underestimated SOL (P=.03; heterogenicity: I2=0%, P=.66). Sleep-staging Fitbit models showed higher sensitivity (0.95-0.96) and specificity (0.58-0.69) values in detecting sleep epochs than nonsleep-staging models and those reported in the literature for regular wrist actigraphy.Sleep-staging Fitbit models showed promising performance, especially in differentiating wake from sleep. However, although these models are a convenient and economical means for consumers to obtain gross estimates of sleep parameters and time spent in sleep stages, they are of limited specificity and are not a substitute for PSG.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2196/16273", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2980985183", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Sixty‐six parents of TD children, 53 parents of children with autism, and 52 parents of children with AD completed a survey on their child's sleep patterns, the nature and severity of any sleep problems and success of any treatment attempted. Results The results showed high prevalence of sleep problems with significantly more problems reported in the autism and AD groups (TD = 50%, autism = 73%, AD = 73%), with no significant differences between groups on severity or type of sleep problem. Children with AD were significantly more likely to be sluggish and disoriented after waking and had a higher Behavioral Evaluation of Disorders of Sleep (BEDS) total score compared to the other two groups. The autism and AD groups reported significantly better treatment success for medication compared to the TD group. The autism group reported significantly better success for behavioural treatment compared to the AD group.

My objective is to describe a surgical procedure for splinting the lateral pharyngeal walls in patients with OSAHS and report the initial results.Prospective randomized pilot study performed in an academic tertiary center as part of a doctoral thesis.Ten adults with OSAHS, originally selected for treatment with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, underwent the lateral pharyngoplasty procedure, which consists of a microdissection of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle within the tonsillar fossa, sectioning of this muscle, and suturing of the created laterally based flap of that muscle to the same-side palatoglossus muscle. In addition, a palatopharyngeal Z-plasty is performed to prevent retropalatal collapse.Lateral pharyngoplasty improved sleep and daytime symptoms related to OSAHS. After at least 6 months of follow-up, the median apnea-hypopnea index decreased from 41.2 to 9.5 (P =.009) and the median total sleep time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and in stages 3 plus 4 non-REM sleep increased from 14.1% to 22.1% (P =.059) and from 5.3% to 16.3% (P =.037), respectively. Also, there was statistically significant improvement in snoring, daytime sleepiness, and overall impact of the disease on quality of life.

Recent studies have mapped the locations of putative sleep-promoting neurons in the POA using c-Fos immunostaining techniques and confirmed these findings with electrophysiological methods. Segregated groups of sleep-active neurons have been localized in the ventrolateral POA (vlPOA) and median preoptic nucleus (MnPN). MnPN and vlPOA sleep-active neurons express the inhibitory transmitter, GABA. In vlPOA neurons, GABA is co-localized with a second inhibitory transmitter, galanin. Descending projections from these sites terminate in putative arousal-promoting cell groups, including histaminergic, serotonergic, orexinergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. These findings suggest the hypothesis that non-REM sleep occurs as a consequence of GABAergic and galaninergic inhibition of arousal-promoting neurons resulting from activation of vlPOA and MnPN sleep-promoting neurons. In support of this hypothesis, it was shown that putative sleep-promoting and arousal-promoting neurons exhibit reciprocal changes in discharge across the sleep-wake cycle and that GABA release in wake-promoting sites increases during nonREM sleep. In addition, some POA sleep-active neurons are warm-sensitive. Local POA warming inhibits discharge of multiple arousal-promoting neuronal groups. POA warming, unit recording, and lesion studies also show that POA regulates the amount of delta EEG activity within nonREM sleep, and index of the depth of sleep. Finally, there is evidence that arousal systems inhibit vlPOA and MnPN neurons and the POA hypnogenic mechanism. Mutually-inhibitory interactions between sleep-promoting and arousal-promoting systems are hypothesized to form a functional sleep-wake switch.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2741/1159", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035973001", "source": "openalex"}

Review of the Frequency of Seizures in Different Sleep Stages", "text": "Since the formal characterization of sleep stages, there have been reports that seizures may preferentially occur in certain phases of sleep. Through ascending cholinergic connections from the brainstem, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is physiologically characterized by low voltage fast activity on the electroencephalogram, REMs, and muscle atonia. Multiple independent studies confirm that, in REM sleep, there is a strikingly low proportion of seizures (~1% or less). We review a total of 42 distinct conventional and intracranial studies in the literature which comprised a net of 1458 patients. Indexed to duration, we found that REM sleep was the most protective stage of sleep against focal seizures, generalized seizures, focal interictal discharges, and two particular epilepsy syndromes. REM sleep had an additional protective effect compared to wakefulness with an average 7.83 times fewer focal seizures, 3.25 times fewer generalized seizures, and 1.11 times fewer focal interictal discharges. In further studies REM sleep has also demonstrated utility in localizing epileptogenic foci with potential translation into postsurgical seizure freedom. Based on emerging connectivity data in sleep, we hypothesize that the influence of REM sleep on seizures is due to a desynchronized EEG pattern which reflects important connectivity differences unique to this sleep stage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/932790", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068598659", "source": "openalex"}

In contrast, OSA in prepubertal children does not appear to correlate with the magnitude of such metabolic derangements.Objectives: To further establish the potential mechanistic role of OSA in metabolic regulation in prepubertal children.Methods: Fasting glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and serum lipid concentrations were determined during the initial polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA and 6–12 months after adenotonsillectomy in both obese and nonobese children.Measurements and Main Results: Sixty-two children with OSA (37 obese and 25 nonobese), age 7.40 ± 2.6 years (mean ± SD) completed the study. After adenotonsillectomy, significant improvements in apnea–hypopnea index and sleep fragmentation occurred, particularly among nonobese children. In nonobese children, adenotonsillectomy was associated with mild increases in body mass index z scores, no changes in either fasting glucose or insulin, significant increases in high-density lipoprotein and reciprocal decreases in low-density lipoprotein, and reductions in plasma C-reactive protein and apolipoprotein B levels. In obese children, adenotonsillectomy did not result in body mass index or glucose changes, but was associated with marked improvements in all other measures.Conclusions: OSA does not appear to induce insulin resistance in nonobese pediatric patients but seems to play a significant role in obese patients. The significant improvements in lipid profiles, C-reactive protein, and apolipoprotein B after adenotonsillectomy in the two groups suggest a pathogenic role for OSA in lipid homeostasis and systemic inflammation independent of the degree of adiposity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200711-1670oc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146062521", "source": "openalex"}

When multiple similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, blood pressure, mortality, cardiovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, quality of life, and harms. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 110 studies were included (N = 46 188). No RCTs compared screening with no screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of the multivariable apnea prediction score followed by home portable monitor testing for detecting severe OSA syndrome (AHI ≥30 and ESS score &gt;10) was AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but the studies oversampled high-risk participants and those with OSA and OSA syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated screening tools to report calibration or clinical utility for improving health outcomes. Meta-analysis found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with sham was significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], −33.8 [95% CI, −42.0 to −25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), excessive sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, −2.0 [95% CI, −2.6 to −1.4]; 22 trials, 2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, −2.4 points [95% CI, −3.9 to −0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood pressure (WMD, −1.3 points [95% CI, −2.2 to −0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 participants). CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life (Cohen d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 participants). Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs were also associated with reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse effects of CPAP and MADs included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, among others. In cohort studies, there was a consistent association between AHI and all-cause mortality. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce AHI, ESS scores, and blood pressure.

A total of 128 obstructive apneas [72 from stage 2 non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and 56 from rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep] were analyzed. Each apnea was comprised of an obstructive period (OP) followed by a hyperventilation period, which was normally associated with an arousal. Heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) (determined with an electrical impedance system), radial artery blood pressures (BP), esophageal pressure nadir, and arterial O2 saturation during each OP and hyperventilation period were calculated for NREM and REM sleep. During stage 2 NREM sleep, the lowest HR always occurred during the first third of the OP, and the highest was always seen during the last third. In contrast, during REM sleep the lowest HR was always noted during the last third of the OP. There was an inverse correlation when the percentage of change in HR over the percentage of change in SV during an OP was considered. The HR and SV changes during NREM sleep allowed maintenance of a near-stable CO during OPs. During REM sleep, absence of a compensatory change in SV led to a significant drop in CO. Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP always increased during the studied OPs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1992.72.2.583", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2180942072", "source": "openalex"}

Fortunately, cognitive‐behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I) has been shown to be an effective treatment in this population. However, it is rarely implemented given its limited availability. To address this barrier, we examined the ability of an easily accessible online CBT‐I program to improve insomnia symptoms in cancer survivors. Methods : Twenty‐eight cancer survivors with insomnia were randomly assigned to either an Internet insomnia intervention ( n = 14) or to a waitlist control group ( n = 14). The online program, Sleep Healthy Using The Internet, delivers the primary components of CBT‐I (sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse prevention). Pre‐ and post‐assessment data were collected via online questionnaires and daily sleep diaries. Results : Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post‐assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity ( F 1,26 = 22.8; p &lt;0.001), sleep efficiency ( F 1,24 = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency ( F 1,24 = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep ( F 1,24 = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening ( F 1,24 = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue ( F 1,26 = 13.88; P = 0.001). Although other group × time interactions were not significant, overall adjusted effect sizes for all sleep variables as well as for fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life ranged from small to large. Conclusions : CBT‐I delivered through an interactive, individually tailored Internet intervention may be a viable treatment option for cancer survivors experiencing insomnia.

The first phase of this study used an 82-item, 20-minute telephone survey to elicit information regarding the impact of sleep disturbances on a convenience sample of 150 patients. Of these patients, 44% reported a sleep problem during the month before the interview. Significant relations included these: report of sleep problems prediagnosis over the past month (x = 5.82; p = 0.02), duration of sleep medication use and frequency of sleep problem (r = 0.58; p = 0.05), age and severity of sleep problems (r = 0.38; p = 0.05), and frequency and severity of the sleep problem over the past month (r = 0.21; p < 0.10). Communication with health care providers occurred in 16.6% of patients reporting a sleep disturbance. The second phase of this study explored the type, frequency, and severity of sleep problems and perceptions of causation, support, and methods of coping with the sleep problem. A qualitative approach to the problem was used in this phase. A one-time telephone interview of 42 patients, derived from a convenience sample, revealed a 45% prevalence of sleep problems a month before the interview. A qualitative analysis of the responses suggested that sleep problems are related to experiences of other symptoms and perceptions of cancer and treatment. Content analysis of the responses identified the following categories: figuring out the reason, seeking help, seeking support and relation to the overall cancer experience.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00002820-199904000-00006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1997412653", "source": "openalex"}

The present study was therefore conducted to clarify the relationship between depression and sleep disturbances, in particular the relationship between depression and both sleep duration and subjective sleep sufficiency, using a large sample representative of the general population. Method: The survey was conducted in June 2000, using self-administered questionnaires, targeting a population that was selected randomly from among 300 communities throughout Japan. Among the respondents, data from 24,686 individuals aged 20 years or older were analyzed. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to assess the presence of depression. Sleep status, including sleep duration, subjective sleep sufficiency, and the presence or absence of insomnia symptoms, was evaluated. Results: Those whose sleep duration was less than 6 hours and those whose sleep duration was 8 hours or more tended to be more depressed than those whose sleep duration was between 6 and 8 hours. Thus, sleep duration exhibited a U-shaped association with symptoms of depression. As subjective sleep sufficiency decreased, symptoms of depression increased, indicating a linear inverse-proportional relationship. Conclusion: The fact that sleep duration and subjective sleep sufficiency exhibited different relationships with symptoms of depression indicates that these 2 sleep parameters each have their own significance with regard to depression. These findings may be useful in the medical management of mental diseases.†‹", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v67n0204", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2004013249", "source": "openalex"}

Participants included 14,589 adult males, aged 20–93 yrs, referred to the sleep clinics with suspected sleep apnoea or diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Altogether, 372 deaths were recorded after a median follow-up of 4.6 yrs. The crude all-cause mortality rate was 5.55/1,000 patient yrs, increasing with apnoea severity. Cox proportional analysis revealed that both respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and body mass index significantly influenced all-cause mortality hazard but there was no interaction between them. Males with respiratory disturbance index &gt;30 had a significantly higher mortality hazard rate than the reference group of males with RDI ≤10. Comparing mortality rates of males with moderate/severe sleep apnoea to the general population revealed that only males aged &lt;50 yrs showed an excess mortality rate. The hazard of mortality in sleep apnoea increases with apnoea severity as indexed by respiratory disturbance index. Moderate and severe levels of sleep apnoea are moderately associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, in comparison with the general population, particularly in males aged &lt;50 yrs.

Sleep in mammals is a dynamic process involving different stages of sleep intensity, and these are typically associated with measurable changes in brain activity (Blake and Gerard, 1937; Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Webb and Agnew, 1971). Evidence for different sleep stages in invertebrates remains elusive, even though it has been well established that many invertebrate species require sleep (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2003). Here we used electrophysiology and arousal-testing paradigms to show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transitions between deeper and lighter sleep within extended bouts of inactivity, with deeper sleep intensities after ∼15 and ∼30 min of inactivity. As in mammals, the timing and intensity of these dynamic sleep processes in flies is homeostatically regulated and modulated by behavioral experience. Two molecules linked to synaptic plasticity regulate the intensity of the first deep sleep stage. Optogenetic upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate during the day increases sleep intensity at night, whereas loss of function of a molecule involved in synaptic pruning, the fragile-X mental retardation protein, increases sleep intensity during the day. Our results show that sleep is not homogenous in insects, and suggest that waking behavior and the associated synaptic plasticity mechanisms determine the timing and intensity of deep sleep stages in Drosophila.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0061-13.2013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2015738937", "source": "openalex"}

Objective: To investigate whether OSA is a risk factor for cardiovascular death in women and assess whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is associated with a change in risk. Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: 2 sleep clinics in Spain. Patients: All women consecutively referred for suspected OSA between 1998 and 2007. Intervention: Every woman had a diagnostic sleep study. Women with an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) less than 10 were the control group. Obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed when the AHI was 10 or higher (classified as mild to moderate [AHI of 10 to 29] or severe [AHI ≥30]). Patients with OSA were classified as CPAP-treated (adherence ≥4 hours per day) or untreated (adherence <4 hours per day or not prescribed). Participants were followed until December 2009. Measurements: The end point was cardiovascular death. Results: 1116 women were studied (median follow-up, 72 months [interquartile range, 52 to 88 months]). The control group had a lower cardiovascular mortality rate (0.28 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.91]) than the untreated groups with mild to moderate OSA (0.94 per 100 person-years [CI, 0.10 to 2.40]; P = 0.034) or severe OSA (3.71 per 100 person-years [CI, 0.09 to 7.50]; P < 0.001).

In many mammalian species rapid eye movement sleep is characterized by the suppression or depression of thermoregulatory responses to thermal loads. In human adults, however, rapid eye movement sleep is not as thermally altered as in other mammals. The experimental evidence shows that the interaction between thermoregulatory and sleep processes occurs at the level of the preoptic-hypothalamic thermostat.

In CHF patients with OSA, chronic nightly CPAP treatment abolishes OSA and improves left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. We hypothesized that one mechanism whereby CPAP improves cardiac function in CHF patients with OSA is by lowering LV afterload during sleep.Eight pharmacologically treated CHF patients with OSA were studied during overnight polysomnography. BP and esophageal pressure (Pes) (ie, intrathoracic pressure) were recorded before the onset of sleep and during stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep before, during, and after CPAP application. OSA was associated with an increase in systolic BP (from 120.4+/-7.8 to 131.8+/-10.6 mm Hg, P<0.05) and systolic LVPtm (from 124.4+/-7.7 to 137.2+/-10.8 mm Hg, P<0.05) from wakefulness to stage 2 sleep.

By alleviating OSA, CPAP reduces LV afterload and heart rate, unloads inspiratory muscles, and improves arterial oxygenation during stage 2 sleep.

One hypothesis is that short and/or long sleep duration is associated with a proinflammatory state, which could increase risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This hypothesis has been largely explored in the context of experimental sleep deprivation studies which have attempted to demonstrate changes in proinflammatory markers following acute sleep loss in the laboratory. Despite the controlled environment available in these studies, samples tend to lack generalization to the population at large and acute sleep deprivation may not be a perfect analog for short sleep. To address these limitations, population based studies have explored associations between proinflammatory markers and habitual sleep duration. This review summarizes what is known from experimental and cross-sectional studies about the association between sleep duration, cardiovascular disease, and proinflammatory biomarkers. First, the association between sleep duration with both morbidity and mortality, with a focus on cardiovascular disease, is reviewed. Then, a brief review of the potential role of proinflammatory markers in cardiovascular disease is presented. The majority of this review details specific findings related to specific molecules, including tumor necrosis factor-&alpha;, interleukins-1, -6, and -17, C-reactive protein, coagulation molecules, cellular adhesion molecules, and visfatin.

Method: A cross-sectional telephone survey was carried out between 1994 and 1999 in the general population of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. A total of 18,980 randomly selected subjects aged 15 to 100 years and representative of the general population of their respective countries participated in the study. The questionnaire included a series of questions about sleep quality, breathing-related sleep disorder symptoms, mental disorders, and medical conditions. Data are presented using point prevalence. Results: 2.1% of the subjects were found with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at the time of the interview, and 2.5% had some other type of DSM-IV breathing-related sleep disorder diagnosis. The association of DSM-IV breathing-related sleep disorder diagnosis and major depressive disorder diagnosis was found in 0.8% of the sample. As many as 18% of individuals with a major depressive disorder diagnosis also have a DSM-IV breathing-related sleep disorders diagnosis, and 17.6% of subjects with a DSM-IV breathing-related sleep disorders diagnosis have a major depressive disorder diagnosis. Multivariate models showed that even after controlling for obesity and hypertension, the odds of having a DSM-IV breathing-related sleep disorders diagnosis was 5.26 for individuals with a major depressive disorder diagnosis. Conclusion: About 800 of 100,000 individuals have both a breathing-related sleep disorder and a major depressive disorder. The identification of 1 of these 2 disorders should prompt the investigation of the other disorder since nearly a fifth of them have the other disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v64n1009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019038214", "source": "openalex"}

A novel anterior mandibular positioner (AMP) has been developed with an adjustable hinge that allows progressive advancement of the mandible. The objective of this prospective crossover study was to compare efficacy, side effects, patient compliance, and preference between AMP and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in patients with symptomatic mild to moderate OSA. METHODS: Twenty four patients of mean (SD) age 44.0 (10.6) years were recruited with a mean (SD) body mass index of 32.0 (8.2) kg/m2, Epworth sleepiness score 10.7 (3.4), and apnoea/hypopnoea index 26.8 (11.9)/hour. There was a two week wash-in and a two week wash-out period and two treatment periods (AMP and nCPAP) each of four months. Efficacy, side effects, compliance, and preference were evaluated by a questionnaire and home sleep monitoring. RESULTS: One patient dropped out early in the study and three refused to cross over so treatment results are presented on the remaining 20 patients. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was lower with nasal CPAP 4.2 (2.2)/hour than with the AMP 13.6 (14.5)/hour (p &lt; 0.01). Eleven of the 20 patients (55%) who used the AMP were treatment successes (reduction of AHI to &lt; 10/hour and relief of symptoms), one (5%) was a compliance failure (unable or unwilling to use the treatment), and eight (40%) were treatment failures (failure to reduce AHI to &lt; 10/hour and/or failure to relieve symptoms). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) who used nCPAP were treatment successes, six (30%) were compliance failures, and there were no treatment failures. There was greater patient satisfaction with the AMP (p &lt; 0.01) than with nCPAP but no difference in reported side effects or compliance. CONCLUSIONS: AMP is an effective treatment in some patients with mild to moderate OSA and is associated with greater patient satisfaction than nCPAP.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.52.4.362", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160238191", "source": "openalex"}

Parental interviews were conducted for each infant who died and for four controls matched for age and date of interview. <b>Setting</b>: Three regions in England with a total population of 17 million people. <b>Subjects</b>: 195 babies who died and 780 matched controls. <b>Results</b>: Prone and side sleeping positions both carried increased risks of death compared with supine when adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestation, birth weight, exposure to smoke, and other relevant factors in the sleeping environment (multivariate odds ratio = 9.00 (95% confidence interval 2.84 to 28.47) and 1.84 (1.02 to 3.31), respectively). The higher incidence of side rather than prone sleeping led to a higher population attributable risk (side 18.4%, prone 14.2%). More of the infants who died were found with bed covers over their heads (21.58; 6.21 to 74.99). The use of a dummy had an apparent protective effect (0.38; 0.21 to 0.70). Bed sharing for the whole night was a significant risk factor for infants whose mothers smoked (9.25; 2.31 to 34.02). No protective effect of breast feeding could be identified on multivariate analysis. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study confirms the importance of certain risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome and identifies others—for example, covers over the head, side sleeping position—which may be amenable to change by educating and informing parents and health care professionals. <h3>Key messages</h3> This large case-control study is the first after the national campaign to reduce the risk of the syndrome The risk of sudden infant death is increased by prone or side sleeping position; loose bedding (particularly duvets), which can slip over the baby9s head; and bed sharing by mothers who smoke The risk may be reduced by supine sleeping position; placing the baby with feet at the foot of the cot (“feet to foot”); ensuring that bedding is securely tucked in; and avoiding the use of duvets", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.313.7051.191", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1520213918", "source": "openalex"}

We found that the only brainstem area from which a high amount of PS was induced by carbachol applications with short latencies, less than 5 minutes, is the mediodorsal pontine tegumentum, namely the LC alpha and peri-LC alpha, where ChAT-and TH- immunoreactive neurons are intermingled. Injections in an area immediately ventral to the peri-LC alpha induced physiological states resembling PS but lacking certain electrophysiological (PS-like) and behavioral components of PS (dissociated states I and II). The weak PS induction following carbachol administration in the anteromedial part of the FTG was due to the spread of the drug toward the efficient site since the latencies to PS onset were in the range of 20 to 60 minutes. No effects on PS generation were obtained after carbachol microinjections in the LC and the laterocaudal part of the FTG, while carbachol injections in the X area or in the bulbar FTG or FTM resulted in the increase of waking and the decrease of PS. In addition to these effects on PS induction, we also found that carbachol induced: 1) stereotyped PGO-like bursts when injected in the ventral part of the FTG and the rostral part of the FTM, 2) postural atonia with very short latencies, less than two minutes, when injected in the LC alpha and peri-LC alpha; and 3) hippocampal theta waves of 3-5 Hz persisting during light slow wave sleep (S1) when injected in and around the LC alpha and peri-LC alpha and in some points of the mediocaudal part of the FTG. These results support the hypothesis that PS is generated by highly localized neuronal populations and suggest that the mediodorsal pontine tegmentum (namely the nuclei LC alpha and peri-LC alpha) may represent a cholinoceptive PS generator.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1568822448", "source": "openalex"}

Hence, it is not ideal for high-throughput screening. To address this deficiency, a method of assessment of sleep and wakefulness in mice has been developed based on assessment of activity/inactivity either by digital video analysis or by breaking infrared beams in the mouse cage. It is based on the algorithm that any episode of continuous inactivity of ≥40 s is predicted to be sleep. The method gives excellent agreement in C57BL/6J male mice with simultaneous assessment of sleep by EEG/EMG recording. The average agreement over 8,640 10-s epochs in 24 h is 92% ( n = 7 mice) with agreement in individual mice being 88–94%. Average EEG/EMG determined sleep per 2-h interval across the day was 59.4 min. The estimated mean difference (bias) per 2-h interval between inactivity-defined sleep and EEG/EMG-defined sleep was only 1.0 min (95% confidence interval for mean bias −0.06 to +2.6 min). The standard deviation of differences (precision) was 7.5 min per 2-h interval with 95% limits of agreement ranging from −13.7 to +15.7 min. Although bias significantly varied by time of day ( P = 0.0007), the magnitude of time-of-day differences was not large (average bias during lights on and lights off was +5.0 and −3.0 min per 2-h interval, respectively). This method has applications in chemical mutagenesis and for studies of molecular changes in brain with sleep/wakefulness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00139.2006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2147496694", "source": "openalex"}

In animals, activation of host defense mechanisms increases non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep amount and intensity, which, in turn, are thought to support host defense, or the body's ability to defend itself against challenges to its immune system. In humans, the evidence is conflicting. Therefore, we investigated the effects of three placebo-controlled doses of endotoxin on host response, including nocturnal sleep in healthy volunteers. Administered before nocturnal sleep onset, endotoxin dose dependently increased rectal temperature, heart rate, and the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, and cortisol. The lowest dose reliably increased circulating levels of cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors, but it did not affect rectal temperature, heart rate, or cortisol. This subtle host defense activation increased deep NREM sleep amount, often referred to as slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), and intensity (delta power). Conversely, the highest dose of endotoxin disrupted sleep. Whereas it is well established that the endocrine and thermoregulatory systems are very sensitive to endotoxin, this study shows that human sleep-wake behavior is even more sensitive to activation of host defense mechanisms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.2000.278.4.r947", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1880976932", "source": "openalex"}

Both analyses concurred in finding that SD-related lapses differ from lapses of equivalent duration after a normal night's sleep by (1) reduced ability of frontal and parietal control regions to raise activation in response to lapses, (2) dramatically reduced visual sensory cortex activation, and (3) reduced thalamic activation during lapses that contrasted with elevated thalamic activation during nonlapse periods. Despite these differences, the fastest responses after normal sleep and after SD elicited comparable frontoparietal activation, suggesting that performing a task while sleep deprived involves periods of apparently normal neural activation interleaved with periods of depressed cognitive control, visual perceptual functions, and arousal. These findings reveal for the first time some of the neural consequences of the interaction between efforts to maintain wakefulness and processes that initiate involuntary sleep in sleep-deprived persons.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0733-08.2008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2085211455", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional analyses. SETTING: Six U.S. communities. PARTICIPANTS: Polysomnography was performed on 2,911 participants of the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Sleep Study (mean age±standard deviation 76.38±5.53; body mass index 27.17±3.8 kg/m 2 ). MEASUREMENTS: Three outcomes were assessed: sleep‐disordered breathing (respiratory disturbance index ≥15), obstructive apnea (obstructive apnea index ≥5), and central apnea (central apnea index ≥5). RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate–severe sleep‐disordered breathing was estimated to be 21.4% to 26.4%. Multivariable logistic regression models demonstrated that age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) per 5‐year increase =1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15–1.34), obesity (AOR=2.54, 95% CI=2.09–3.09), Asian versus Caucasian race (AOR=2.14, 95% CI=1.33–3.45), snoring (AOR=2.01, 95% CI=1.62–2.49), sleepiness (AOR=1.41, 95% CI=1.11–1.79), hypertension (AOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06–1.50), cardiovascular disease (AOR=1.24, 95% CI=1.19–1.29), and heart failure (AOR=1.81, 1.31–2.51) were independently associated with sleep‐disordered breathing; snoring (AOR=2.10, 95% CI=1.67–2.70), age (AOR per 5‐year increase=1.27, 95% CI=1.18–1.38), obesity (AOR=1.48, 95% CI=1.21–1.82), and heart failure (AOR=1.60, 95% CI=1.15–2.24) were associated with obstructive apnea; and age (AOR=1.33, 1.17–1.50) and heart failure (AOR=1.88, 95% CI=1.17–3.04) were associated with central apnea. CONCLUSION: Regardless of definition, a high prevalence of sleep disorders is observed in community‐dwelling older men. Qualitatively similar associations were observed between sleep disorders and snoring, obesity, and comorbidities, as reported for middle aged populations.

The patients were retrospectively classified as having hypersomnia (N=20), insomnia (N=69), and no sleep disturbance (N=24). The SADS suicide subscale was used to rate the severity of active suicidality. Results: The patients with hypersomnia and insomnia had significantly (p<.05) higher scores on the SADS suicide subscale than those without sleep disturbance. We also found that the patients with insomnia and hypersomnia were significantly (p<.001) more likely to become suicidal than the others.

The survey was repeated five times at 2 year intervals. Ninety-three subjects answered the questionnaire each time. Subjective sleep need was assessed by the indicated wish for more sleep. The wish for more sleep was very pronounced, varying between 54.3% and 74.5% across the years. Individual consistency, however, was low since only 14.5% of the adolescents indicated the wish for more sleep in each survey, emphasizing the state dependency of this variable. Within each total sample, subjects with the wish for more sleep (MSL) and with sufficient sleep (SSL) were compared. Subjective sleep need was consistently validated by a syndrome of morning-tiredness. In the last two surveys, there was reduced time in bed (TIB) on weekdays in MSL subjects and longer TIB during vacation in surveys 2 through 5. Furthermore, MSL subjects more often showed irregular sleep habits. The previous sleep history of the MSL subjects in the last survey indicated that concomitants of the wish for more sleep were already experienced earlier in adolescence. The desired sleep duration of these subjects was 1.7 h longer than their current sleep on weekdays, an amount they had not obtained on weekdays since early adolescence. It is concluded that a substantial proportion of the adolescents seem to have had difficulties adapting to the general sleep time reduction occurring in adolescence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/11.4.378", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2306008940", "source": "openalex"}

In contrast, central sleep apnoea (CSA) is rare in the general population. Although their pathogenesis is multifactorial, the prevalence of both OSA and CSA is increased in patients with fluid retaining states, especially heart failure, where they are associated with increased mortality risk. This observation suggests that fluid retention may contribute to the pathogenesis of both OSA and CSA. According to this hypothesis, during the day fluid accumulates in the intravascular and interstitial spaces of the legs due to gravity, and upon lying down at night redistributes rostrally, again owing to gravity. Some of this fluid may accumulate in the neck, increasing tissue pressure and causing the upper airway to narrow, thereby increasing its collapsibility and predisposing to OSA. In heart failure patients, with increased rostral fluid shift, fluid may additionally accumulate in the lungs, provoking hyperventilation and hypocapnia, driving below the apnoea threshold, leading to CSA. This review article will explore mechanisms by which overnight rostral fluid shift, and its prevention, can contribute to the pathogenesis and therapy of sleep apnoea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2012.245159", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1520388755", "source": "openalex"}

These include the light-dark and social cycles, a circadian hypothalamic oscillator oscillating virtually independently of behavior, and a homeostatic oscillator driven primarilyby sleep-wake behavior. Both internal oscillators contribute to variation in many aspects of sleep and wakefulness (e.g., sleep timing and duration, REM sleep, non-REM sleep, REM density, sleep spindles, slow-wave sleep, electroencephalographic oscillations during wakefulness and sleep, and performance parameters, including attention and memory). The relative contribution of the oscillators varies greatly between these variables. Sleep and performance cannot be predicted by either oscillator independently but critically depend on their phase relationship and amplitude. The homeostatic oscillator feeds back onto the central pacemaker or its outputs. Thus, the amplitude of observed circadian variation in sleep and performance depends on how long we have been asleep or awake. During entrainment to external 24-h cycles, the opposing interplay between circadian and homeostatic changes in sleep propensity consolidates sleep and wakefulness. Some physiological correlates and mediators of both the circadian process (e.g., melatonin and hypocretin rhythms) and the homeostat (e.g., EEG, slow-wave activity, and adenosine release) have been established, offering targets for the development of countermeasures for circadian sleep and performance disorders. Interindividual differences in sleep timing, duration, and morning or evening preference are associated with changes of circadianor sleep homeostatic processes or both. Molecular genetic correlates, including polymorphisms in clock genes, of some of these interindividual differences are emerging.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730405278292", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036345267", "source": "openalex"}

This can introduce tedium and a loss of novelty, which may be the key to the test's subsequent sensitivity to sleep loss, and why it may need only a few minutes administration before sleep loss effects are apparent. There is little evidence to show that any of these tests are actually affected by sleep loss if given de novo, without practice, but using a non‐sleep deprived control group. Although the sleep deprivation literature advocates that short, novel and stimulating tests would not be expected to be sensitive to sleep loss, recent sleep loss findings using neuropsychological tests focussing on the prefrontal cortex, indicate that such tests may challenge this maxim. Twenty healthy young adults were randomly assigned to two groups: nil sleep deprivation (control), and 36h continuous sleep deprivation (SD). Two, novel, interesting and short (6 min) language tests, known (by brain imaging) to have predominantly a PFC focus, were given, once, towards the end of SD: (i) the Haylings test – which measures the capacity to inhibit strong associations in favour of novel responses, and (ii) a variant of the word fluency test – innovation in a verb‐to‐noun association. Subjects were exhorted to do their best. Compared with control subjects both tasks were significantly impaired by SD. As a check on the effects on the Haylings test, a repeat study was undertaken with 30 more subjects randomly divided as before. The outcome was similar.

The accuracy and kappa coefficients of six-state classification are 87.5% and 0.81, respectively.

METHODS: Three hundred fifty-nine mother/child pairs participated in a prospective birth cohort study. Sleep questionnaires were administered to mothers when children were 6, 12, 24, and 36 months old. Sleep variables included parent response to a nonspecific query about the presence/absence of a sleep problem and 8 specific sleep outcome domains: sleep onset latency, sleep maintenance, 24-hour sleep duration, daytime sleep/naps, sleep location, restlessness/vocalization, nightmares/night terrors, and snoring. RESULTS: Prevalence of a parent-reported sleep problem was 10% at all assessment intervals. Night wakings and shorter sleep duration were associated with a parent-reported sleep problem during infancy and early toddlerhood (6–24 months), whereas nightmares and restless sleep emerged as associations with report of a sleep problem in later developmental periods (24–36 months). Prolonged sleep latency was associated with parent report of a sleep problem throughout the study period. In contrast, napping, sleep location, and snoring were not associated with parent-reported sleep problems. Twenty-one percent of children with sleep problems in infancy (compared with 6% of those without) had sleep problems in the third year of life. CONCLUSIONS: Ten percent of children are reported to have a sleep problem at any given point during early childhood, and these problems persist in a significant minority of children throughout early development.

Respiratory periodicity at altitude reflects alternating respiratory stimulation by hypoxia and subsequent inhibition by hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia.

These novel guidelines for children of the early years embrace the natural and intuitive integration of movement behaviours across the whole day (24-h period). The development process was guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. Four systematic reviews (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, combined behaviours) examining the relationships within and among movement behaviours and several health indicators were completed and interpreted by a Guideline Development Panel. The systematic reviews that were conducted to inform the development of the guidelines, and the framework that was applied to develop the recommendations, followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Complementary compositional analyses were performed using data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey to examine the relationships between movement behaviours and indicators of adiposity. A review of the evidence on the cost effectiveness and resource use associated with the implementation of the proposed guidelines was also undertaken. A stakeholder survey (n = 546), 10 key informant interviews, and 14 focus groups (n = 92 participants) were completed to gather feedback on draft guidelines and their dissemination. The guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations as to the combinations of light-, moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and sleep that infants (<1 year), toddlers (1–2 years) and preschoolers (3–4 years) should achieve for a healthy day (24 h). Proactive dissemination, promotion, implementation, and evaluation plans were prepared to optimize uptake and activation of the new guidelines. These guidelines represent a sensible evolution of public health guidelines whereby optimal health is framed within the balance of movement behaviours across the whole day, while respecting preferences of end-users. Future research should consider the integrated relationships among movement behaviours, and similar integrated guidelines for other age groups should be developed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4859-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2770656318", "source": "openalex"}

Although each session was preceded by an adaptation night, data from the first night were discarded. Polysomnography was taken on ambulatory 8‐channel Oxford Medilog MR‐9000 II ® recorders. Standard electroencephalogram (EEG), electro‐oculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings were scored visually with the PhiTools ERA © software. The main finding of the study was that during Ramadan sleep latency is increased and sleep architecture modified. Sleep period time and total sleep time decreased in BR and ER. The proportion of non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep increased during Ramadan and its structure changed, with an increase in stage 2 proportion and a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS) duration. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration and proportion decreased during Ramadan. These changes in sleep parameters were associated with a delay in the occurrence of the acrophase of Tre and an increase in nocturnal Tre during Ramadan.

The amplitude of the circadian rhythm of Tre was decreased during Ramadan. The effects of Ramadan fasting on nocturnal sleep, with an increase in sleep latency and a decrease in SWS and REM sleep, and changes in Tre, were attributed to the inversion of drinking and meal schedule, rather than to an altered energy intake which was preserved in this study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00269.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160998248", "source": "openalex"}

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based characterizations of sleep stage progression contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep. Several prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable discrimination of sleep stages in order to make it possible to perform sleep studies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in specialized clinical facilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which can be uncomfortable or difficult for subjects to position. Those that have utilized single EEG channels which contain less sleep information, have showed poor classification performance. We have taken advantage of Rectifier Neural Network for feature detection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data learning to optimize classification performance with single electrode recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous recording of the electroocuolgram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people (with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical algorithm for automated sleep classification than existing approaches using vertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration with neural network deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home sleep studies practical.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2017.2733220", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2539353608", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 79 children who reported total sleep problem T scores in the clinical range, only 13.9% (11/79) discussed sleep with their general practitioner within the previous 12 months. Regression analyses revealed an age related decrease in problems with sleep-wake transition and sleep related obstructive breathing; sleep hyperhydrosis, initiating and maintaining sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness did not significantly decrease with age. No significant gender differences were observed.Results suggest that chronic sleep problems in Australian children are significantly under-reported by parents during general practice consultations despite a relatively high frequency across all age groups.

HR changes during sleep were dependent on the subject's initial autonomic HR control level. The evidence from 3 healthy subjects, who were studied under baseline conditions, propranolol (a sympatholytic agent), atropine (a parasympathetic depressant), and propranolol plus atropine, showed that the HR decrease during stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 is caused by augmented parasympathetic input. The HR increase during REM sleep is due to a reduction in parasympathetic control.

We found that the degree of laryngeal stimulation required to produce arousal and coughing was higher in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep than in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Stimuli that failed to cause arousal from SWS often produced a single expiratory effort, or brief apnea (1--2 s) and bradycardia.

Therefore, direct, voluntary attempts to control sleep may actually exacerbate and perpetuate insomnia. To date, no reliable scale has been available to test this hypothesis directly. Moreover, while sleep effort is a core International Classification of Sleep Disorders – Revised criterion for psychophysiological insomnia, clinicians lack a reliable measure with which to assess the construct. In this initial scale validation study, we present psychometric data for the Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale based on a relatively small but representative sample of patients with insomnia and good sleepers.

Although fevers have been investigated for many years, sleep responses to infectious challenge have only recently been investigated. Inoculation of animals with bacterial, viral, protozoan and fungal organisms result in complex sleep responses dependent upon the microbial agent and route of administration. The general pattern is characterized by an initial robust increase in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) followed by a period of NREMS inhibition. REMS is inhibited after infectious challenge. The sleep responses are accompanied by fever but the two responses are, in part, independent from each other. Sleep responses, like fevers, may be beneficial to host defense although this area is relatively uninvestigated. Microbial products likely responsible for sleep and fever responses include bacterial muramyl peptides and endotoxin, and viral double stranded RNA. These microbial products induce sleep and fever responses in animal models. The exact mechanism of how these structurally diverse microbial products elicit sleep and fever remain unknown; however these substances share the ability to induce cytokine production. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor, acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and interferon-α (IFN-α) are somnogenic whether given directly into brain or intravenously. Other cytokines lack somnogenic activity, e.g., IL-2, IL-6, IFNβ and basic FGF. The somnogenic actions of cytokines probably involve growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and nitric oxide. Anti-GHRH or inhibition of NO production inhibits normal sleep and inhibits IL-1-induced sleep. In conclusion, cytokines are likely key mediators of fever and sleep responses to infection. The microbial-cytokine altered sleep likely results from an amplification of physiological sleep mechanisms which include cytokines, several neuropeptides and neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1615/critrevimmunol.v14.i3-4.70", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2024033128", "source": "openalex"}

The sensitivity and specificity of partial channel and partial time PSGs appeared most promising as replacements for full PSG in patients suspected of obstructive SA. Clinical prediction rules (multivariate models) were also promising. Studies of portable sleep monitors, radiologic or morphologic features, and focused questionnaires were too heterogeneous to be meta-analyzed.

The purpose of this study was to document, in a population of apneic subjects, the site(s) of narrowing and closing pressure of the hypotonic pharynx. We endoscopically examined the pharynx in 45 OSA patients during sleep while they received nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CRAP), which produces hypotonia of pharyngeal muscles. Intrapharyngeal images and pressures were obtained at the end of expiration during single-breath tests (SBT). The fractional narrowing (FN) of each pharyngeal segment (nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) was calculated as the relative change in area when nasal airway pressure was reduced from a pressure that held the pharynx fully distended to the pressure at which the airway closed. The frequency distribution of FN for the nasopharynx was skewed toward larger values, and the frequency was relatively evenly distributed for the oropharynx and hypopharynx. A site having FN greater than 0.75 was defined as a site of primary narrowing, and a site showing FN 0.25 to 0.75 was defined as a site of secondary narrowing. The nasopharynx was a site of primary narrowing in 80% of patients, and two or more sites of narrowing were commonly observed (82%). Four categories of combined narrowing were identified: (1) primary narrowing only at the nasopharynx (18%); (2) primary narrowing at the nasopharynx plus other sites of secondary narrowing (40%); (3) primary narrowing at the nasopharynx plus other sites of primary narrowing (22%); and (4) other patterns (20%). Closing pressures ranged from -2 to 8 cm H2O, and 85% of values were equal to or greater than 0 cm H2O.

Early studies of urinary and plasma catecholamines indirectly suggested sympathetic over activity carried to daytime, non-apneic conditions. Later intra-neuronal recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity directly demonstrated both acute and diumal (non-apneic) sympathetic over activity. Most importantly, diurnal sympathetic over activity has been shown to diminish with adequate treatment of apnea using nasal CPAP. Norepinephrine and angiotensin II are both released with increased peripheral sympathetic activity and are parallel vascular growth-promoting factors. Thus, one would expect alterations in vascular structure and function in a state of chronic sympathetic over activity. While changes in peripheral vascular structure have not been demonstrated in hypertension of sleep apnea, changes in peripheral vascular responsiveness have. There is reduced response to acetylcholine and isoproterenol vasodilation, and to norepinephrine and angiotensin vasoconstriction in humans with sleep apnea. Some of these vascular reactivity changes are shown to reversed with chronic nasal CPAP treatment. Finally, complimentary to the above evidence in humans, there is indirect evidence of sympathetic over activity as well as differences in vascular reactivity in intermittent hypoxia challenged rats. We have made significant strides in the past 15-20 years towards understanding systemic hypertension related to sleep apnea, especially the role of the sympathetic nervous system. Future research will need to look at exact mechanism of sympathetic nervous system over activity, particularly how central nervous system pathways may undergo facilitation, leading to daytime over activity. Furthermore, the mechanisms of sustained hypertension in sleep apnea patients is almost certainly of multiple etiologies. There is no marker for separating sleep apnea patients with hypertension derived solely from intermittent hypoxia from other secondary causes.

The clinical relevance of OSA resides in its association with significant morbidities that affect the cardiovascular, neurocognitive, and metabolic systems. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently reiterated its recommendations that children with symptoms and signs suggestive of OSA should be investigated with polysomnography (PSG), and treated accordingly. However, treatment decisions should not only be guided by PSG results, but should also integrate the magnitude of symptoms and the presence or absence of risk factors and signs of OSA morbidity. The first-line therapy in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy is adenotonsillectomy, although there is increasing evidence that medical therapy, in the form of intranasal steroids or montelukast, may be considered in mild OSA. In this review, we delineate the major concepts regarding the pathophysiology of OSA, its morbidity, diagnosis, and treatment.

PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane were searched without language restriction. Prospective cohort studies of adults with at least a 1-year follow-up duration were included. Habitual sleep duration or symptoms of insomnia were assessed as baseline exposure, and the outcome was incidence of hypertension. Subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess heterogeneity, and Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. Eleven studies (17 cohorts) were included. Short sleep duration, sleep continuity disturbance (SCD), early-morning awakening (EMA) and combined symptoms of insomnia increased the risk of hypertension incidence (the relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.21 (1.05–1.40) for short sleep duration, 1.20 (1.06–1.36) for SCD, 1.14 (1.07–1.20) for EMA and 1.05 (1.01–1.08) for combined insomnia symptoms). Less evidence exists to support conclusions about the association between long sleep duration or difficulty falling asleep (DFA) and hypertension incidence. No obvious heterogeneity or publication biases were found. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that short sleep duration and single/combined symptoms of insomnia (except DFA) are associated with an increased risk of hypertension incidence. It is important to consider sleep duration and insomnia during hypertension prevention and treatment.

Daytime energy levels increased in 39 (78%) patients and remained unchanged or worsened in 11 (22%). In review of the polysomnographic data, the group overall did not have significant changes in respiratory disturbance index (RDI) or lowest oxygen saturation levels (LSaO(2)). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) levels required to correct OSA decreased after nasal surgery (P < 0.01). Patients with mild OSA showed significant worsening in RDI (P < 0.05), whereas LSaO(2) levels were improved in the group with moderate OSA (P < 0.05). In patients with severe OSA neither the RDI levels nor the LSaO(2) changed, but CPAP levels required to alleviate the obstruction after surgery were reduced (P < 0.01).Most patients report improvement in nasal and sleep symptoms after correction of nasal airway obstruction. However, nasal surgery alone does not consistently improve OSA when measured objectively. Depending on the severity of OSA, nasal airway reconstruction may contribute to a decrease in CPAP level and improvement in oxygen saturation.

These symptoms are known to be related to the host gut microbiota. Mice were exposed to SF for 4 weeks and then allowed to recover for 2 weeks. Taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiota were obtained prospectively, and conventionalization experiments were performed in germ-free mice. Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and inflammation, as well as circulating measures of inflammation, were assayed. Effect of fecal water on colonic epithelial permeability was also examined. Chronic SF-induced increased food intake and reversible gut microbiota changes characterized by the preferential growth of highly fermentative members of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and a decrease of Lactobacillaceae families. These lead to systemic and visceral white adipose tissue inflammation in addition to altered insulin sensitivity in mice, most likely via enhanced colonic epithelium barrier disruption. Conventionalization of germ-free mice with SF-derived microbiota confirmed these findings. Thus, SF-induced metabolic alterations may be mediated, in part, by concurrent changes in gut microbiota, thereby opening the way for gut microbiome-targeted therapeutics aimed at reducing the major end-organ morbidities of chronic SF.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep35405", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2531542945", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep problems often follow a chronic course, persisting long after servicemembers return home from combat deployments, with consequences for their reintegration and the readiness and resiliency of the force. Therefore, it is critical to understand the role of sleep problems in servicemembers' health and functioning and the policies and programs available to promote healthy sleep. This study provides the first comprehensive review of sleep-related policies and programs across the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), along with a set of actionable recommendations for DoD, commanders, researchers, and medical professionals who treat U.S. servicemembers. The two-year multimethod study also examined the rates and correlates of sleep problems among post-deployed servicemembers, finding negative effects on mental health, daytime impairment, and perceived operational readiness. The research reviewed evidence-based interventions to treat sleep disturbances among servicemembers and veterans and exposed several individual- and system-level barriers to achieving healthy sleep.

Attempts to automate this process have been hampered by the complexity of PSG signals and physiological heterogeneity between patients. Deep neural networks, which have recently achieved expert-level performance for other complex medical tasks, are ideally suited to PSG scoring, given sufficient training data.We used a combination of deep recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RCNN) for supervised learning of clinical labels designating sleep stages, sleep apnea events, and limb movements. The data for testing and training were derived from 10 000 clinical PSGs and 5804 research PSGs.When trained on the clinical dataset, the RCNN reproduces PSG diagnostic scoring for sleep staging, sleep apnea, and limb movements with accuracies of 87.6%, 88.2% and 84.7% on held-out test data, a level of performance comparable to human experts. The RCNN model performs equally well when tested on the independent research PSG database. Only small reductions in accuracy were noted when training on limited channels to mimic at-home monitoring devices: frontal leads only for sleep staging, and thoracic belt signals only for the apnea-hypopnea index.By creating accurate deep learning models for sleep scoring, our work opens the path toward broader and more timely access to sleep diagnostics. Accurate scoring automation can improve the utility and efficiency of in-lab and at-home approaches to sleep diagnostics, potentially extending the reach of sleep expertise beyond specialty clinics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocy131", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2904418346", "source": "openalex"}

PGD2 was infused into the lateral or the third ventricle of the cerebrum slowly and continuously for 6 hr in the light period. Infusion of PGD2 into the lateral ventricle at 15-2250 pmol/min induced natural sleep as identified by electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, body temperature, heart rate, and animal behavior. Although sensitivity to PGD2 was slightly different among individual animals, the amount of total sleep time increased maximally up to 3- to 4-fold over the control level. PGD2 infused into the third ventricle induced effects similar to those observed for the lateral ventricular route, but infusion into the third ventricle was about 1000 times more effective than infusion into the lateral ventricle. In three monkeys, PGD2 increased the amount of sleep in a dose-dependent manner. Bell-shaped dose-response curves were observed for the other two monkeys. Infusion of prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha into the lateral ventricle caused sedation but slightly reduced the amount of slow-wave sleep and produced increases in heart rate and body temperature. These findings suggest that endogenous PGD2 may be involved in the regulation of sleep by acting on the brain structures surrounding the third ventricle in the rhesus monkey.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.85.11.4082", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066270109", "source": "openalex"}

Morning bright light delayed the peak of the activity rhythm (acrophase) and increased the mean activity level (mesor). In addition, subjects in the morning bright light group had improved activity rhythmicity during the 10 days of treatment.Increasing exposure to morning bright light delayed the acrophase of the activity rhythm and made the circadian rhythm more robust. These changes have the potential to be clinically beneficial because it may be easier to provide nursing care to patients whose circadian activity patterns are more socially acceptable.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1532-5415.2002.50060.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1997496350", "source": "openalex"}

Sleep deprivation is associated with an increase in food consumption and appetite. However, the brain regions that are most susceptible to sleep deprivation-induced changes when processing food stimuli are unknown. Our objective was to examine brain activation after sleep and sleep deprivation in response to images of food. Twelve normal-weight male subjects were examined on two sessions in a counterbalanced fashion: after one night of total sleep deprivation and one night of sleep. On the morning after either total sleep deprivation or sleep, neural activation was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in a block design alternating between high- and low-calorie food items. Hunger ratings and morning fasting plasma glucose concentrations were assessed before the scan, as were appetite ratings in response to food images after the scan. Compared with sleep, total sleep deprivation was associated with an increased activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex in response to food images, independent of calorie content and prescan hunger ratings. Relative to the postsleep condition, in the total sleep deprivation condition, the activation in the anterior cingulate cortex evoked by foods correlated positively with postscan subjective appetite ratings. Self-reported hunger after the nocturnal vigil was enhanced, but importantly, no change in fasting plasma glucose concentration was found. These results provide evidence that acute sleep loss enhances hedonic stimulus processing in the brain underlying the drive to consume food, independent of plasma glucose levels. These findings highlight a potentially important mechanism contributing to the growing levels of obesity in Western society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2011-2759", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2021469987", "source": "openalex"}

A committee comprised of members of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, American Thoracic Society, and American College of Chest Physicians systematically evaluated data on the use of these devices and developed practice parameters.Three categories of portable monitoring (PM) devices were reviewed with regard to assessing the probability of identifying an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of greater or less than 15 in attended and unattended settings. Type 2 (minimum of seven channels, including EEG, EOG, chin EMG, ECG or heart rate, airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen saturation), Type 3 (minimum of four channels, including ventilation or airflow (at least two channels of respiratory movement, or respiratory movement and airflow), heart rate or ECG and oxygen saturation) and Type 4 (most monitors of this type measure a single parameter or two parameters) devices were evaluated, and in-laboratory, attended polysomnography was used as a reference.(1) Insufficient evidence is available to recommend the use of Type 2 PM devices in attended or unattended settings. (2) Type 3 PM devices appear to be capable of being used in an attended setting to increase or to decrease the probability that a patient has an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 15. (3) The use of Type 3 PM devices in an unattended setting is not recommended to rule in, rule out, or both rule in and rule out a diagnosis of OSA. (4) There is some evidence that the use of Type 3 PM devices in an attended in-laboratory setting may be acceptable to both rule in and rule out a diagnosis of OSA if certain limitations are in place. These limitations include manually scoring the records, using the devices only in patients without significant comorbid conditions, having an awareness that symptomatic patients with a negative study should have a Type 1 study, and not using these devices for titrating positive airway pressure or conducting split-night studies. (5) The use of Type 4 PM devices in attended or unattended settings is not recommended.Type 3 and 4 PM devices cannot score sleep and, therefore, do not meet some current Medicare guidelines. The use of PM devices is not recommended for general-population screening or in the absence of a pretest probability of the patient having a diagnosis of OSA, for complaints other than those associated with OSA, without review of raw data during interpretation, by physicians without familiarity with their use and limitations, and without trained personnel to perform technical scoring. Future research should address the use of PM devices in patients with comorbid conditions; non-White patients and women; larger, better-controlled studies; studies focused on the use of Type 2 and 3 devices; studies focusing on decision making and outcomes rather than simple classification using arbitrary cutoffs; and studies that seek to elucidate cost-effectiveness data on the use of PM devices.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/26.7.907", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138481777", "source": "openalex"}

The study group consisted of 413 medical students, ages 19-33 years, at the University of Tartu. Each was asked to complete two questionnaires: the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q), containing 28 questions, and the Questionnaire on Sleep and Daytime Habits, with 25 questions. The anxiety and depression subscales from the EST-Q were applied. From the study group, 21.9% students had symptoms of anxiety, and 30.6% had symptoms of depression. The frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms was higher in females. In regression and multiple regression analysis, we determined which sleep problems were related to emotional symptoms. The associations were different for men and women. In women, anxiety remained significantly related to waking up because of nightmares and feeling tired in the morning; depressive symptoms were related to difficulties in getting to sleep at night, waking up because of nightmares and nocturnal eating habits, daytime sleepiness, and sleepiness during school lessons. In men, significant relations were clear only for depression: difficulties in falling asleep at night before an exam and subjective sleep quality. The study demonstrated that a high percentage of medical students had emotional symptoms.

To what extent the cerebellum sleeps and to what extent sleep is critical for the cerebellum-dependent memory formation and consolidation remain to be elucidated. The cerebellum shows sleep stage–dependent activity and its malfunctions can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle, leading to sleep disorders. The cerebral cortex and cerebellum strongly interact during both the awake state and sleep, and such interactions during sleep also contribute to consolidation of memories. Given the sleep stage–dependent character of cerebellar activity and of the neocortical–cerebellar interactions, the role of this activity and these interactions for memory consolidation might strongly depend on the precise sleep stage and sleep architecture. We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders. In this review, we evaluate how sleep and cerebellar processing may influence one another and highlight which scientific routes and technical approaches could be taken to uncover the mechanisms underlying these interactions.

Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders. In this review, we evaluate how sleep and cerebellar processing may influence one another and highlight which scientific routes and technical approaches could be taken to uncover the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Sleep is an important brain function that supports cognitive processes such as memory retrieval, learning, attention, language processing, decision making, and even creativity [1Diekelmann S. Born J. The memory function of sleep.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Diekelmann S. Sleep for cognitive enhancement.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar]. As a consequence, the neuronal circuitries and cellular mechanisms that underlie the transitions between wakefulness and sleep or between various sleep stages have been investigated thoroughly and have led to models about how such state transitions occur [3Saper C.B. et al.Sleep state switching.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1023-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 4Brown R.E. et al.Control of sleep and wakefulness.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 1087-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar]. To date, based on polysomnographic (see Glossary) measurements, sleep can be subdivided into rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement stages 1–3 (NREM1–3; Figure 1A) [5Berry R. et al.The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology, and Technical Specifications Version 2.2. American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2015Google Scholar]. Up to this point, sleep research has mainly focused on how these states correlate across the neocortical and subcortical structures, whereas cerebellar activity has been largely ignored. This neglect is intriguing, because malfunction of the cerebellum does not only impair motor control and motor memory formation [6Krakauer J.W. Shadmehr R. Consolidation of motor memory.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7De Zeeuw C.I. et al.Spatiotemporal firing patterns in the cerebellum.Nat.

Clin. 2014; 32: 893-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar]. Furthermore, decades of behavioral and physiological research has shown the positive impact of sleep on episodic memory formation. To what extent sleep is also critical for cerebellum-dependent procedural memory formation and motor control, however, is still under fervent debate. The cerebellum is well connected with the cerebrum and the neuronal circuitry underlying sleep–wake regulation (Box 1) . In addition, many cerebellar neurons express clock genes associated with control of the circadian rhythm (Box 2). Nevertheless, a marked dearth of data exists on the relation between cerebellar processing and various sleep stages. It remains unclear whether the cerebellum enters sleep, and if so, whether cerebellar activity continues to change in line with the REM and NREM sleep stages and whether cerebellar activity may itself affect the process of sleep. Here, we review and evaluate studies of the neuronal activity of the cerebellum as well as its interactions with the cerebral cortex during sleep, address the question of how malfunctioning of the cerebellum may affect sleep, and, finally, ask to what extent sleep may affect cerebellum-dependent memory formation and memory consolidation.Box 1Neuromodulators Influencing the Wake–Sleep NetworkDistinct neuronal networks and related afferent pathways with specific monoaminergic neurotransmitters are involved in regulation of wake–sleep stages. Many of these neurotransmitters influence cerebellar activity (Figure I), but their role in regulation of cerebellar processing during sleep has been neglected. Cell populations known to project to the cerebellum and to alter the state of arousal include the cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, orexinergic, and dopaminergic inputs. Injections of such monoamines or agonists of their receptors into the cerebellum can facilitate wakefulness and/or consolidation of various tasks, further supporting a role for neuromodulators during sleep-related cerebellum-dependent consolidation [102Barik S. De Beaurepaire R. Dopamine D3 modulation of locomotor activity and sleep in the nucleus accumbens and in lobules 9 and 10 of the cerebellum in the rat.Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol.

Most, if not all, of the monoaminergic systems also have widespread impact on other parts of the brain involved in sleep control. For example, the noradrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic neurons control the GABAergic galanin-containing neurons of the ventrolateral and median preoptic nucleus that become active during NREM [3Saper C.B. et al.Sleep state switching.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1023-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar], while orexinergic neurons can stabilize the switch between the wake–sleep-promoting networks [3Saper C.B. et al.Sleep state switching.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1023-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 10de Andrés I. et al.Functional anatomy of non-REM sleep.Front. Neurol. 2011; 2: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar].Box 2Clock and Wake–Sleep-Related Genes in the CerebellumThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which controls and modulates the circadian rhythm, interacts with both the wake- and sleep-promoting networks [3Saper C.B. et al.Sleep state switching.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1023-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar]. Genes that regulate the rhythmicity of neurons in the SCN are called clock genes. Several clock genes, including Arntl, Nr1d1, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, and Cry1, have also been found in the Purkinje cell and granular cell layer of the cerebellum [132Rath M.F. et al.Circadian oscillators in the mouse brain: molecular clock components in the neocortex and cerebellar cortex.Cell Tissue Res. 2014; 357: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 133Honma S. et al.Circadian oscillation of BMAL1, a partner of a mammalian clock gene clock, in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.Biochem.

Their expression pattern follows that of the SCN, but with a delay of 5 h [132Rath M.F. et al.Circadian oscillators in the mouse brain: molecular clock components in the neocortex and cerebellar cortex.Cell Tissue Res. 2014; 357: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 134Rath M.F. et al.Circadian oscillations of molecular clock components in the cerebellar cortex of the rat.Chronobiol. Int. 2012; 29: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. Even in vitro the cerebellum is able to express near-24-h rhythms and these rhythms can be shifted by shifting 'mealtime' exposure [135Mendoza J. et al.The cerebellum harbors a circadian oscillator involved in food anticipation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar]. However, rhythmic clock gene expression in the cerebellum is affected in response to SCN lesioning, suggesting that the cerebellum needs input from external brain areas to maintain its rhythmicity [134Rath M.F. et al.Circadian oscillations of molecular clock components in the cerebellar cortex of the rat.Chronobiol. Int. 2012; 29: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 136Mordel J. et al.The output signal of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and circadian rhythmicity.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58457Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. In addition to clock genes, the cerebellum also expresses various other genes showing circadian patterns; these include at least 106 sleep-related transcripts and 117 wake-related transcripts [137Cirelli C. et al.Extensive and divergent effects of sleep and wakefulness on brain gene expression.Neuron. 2004; 41: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar]. The genes that showed increased expression during sleep in both the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei were involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and membrane trafficking and maintenance. Distinct neuronal networks and related afferent pathways with specific monoaminergic neurotransmitters are involved in regulation of wake–sleep stages. Many of these neurotransmitters influence cerebellar activity (Figure I), but their role in regulation of cerebellar processing during sleep has been neglected.

Even in vitro the cerebellum is able to express near-24-h rhythms and these rhythms can be shifted by shifting 'mealtime' exposure [135Mendoza J. et al.The cerebellum harbors a circadian oscillator involved in food anticipation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar]. However, rhythmic clock gene expression in the cerebellum is affected in response to SCN lesioning, suggesting that the cerebellum needs input from external brain areas to maintain its rhythmicity [134Rath M.F. et al.Circadian oscillations of molecular clock components in the cerebellar cortex of the rat.Chronobiol. Int. 2012; 29: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 136Mordel J. et al.The output signal of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and circadian rhythmicity.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58457Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. In addition to clock genes, the cerebellum also expresses various other genes showing circadian patterns; these include at least 106 sleep-related transcripts and 117 wake-related transcripts [137Cirelli C. et al.Extensive and divergent effects of sleep and wakefulness on brain gene expression.Neuron. 2004; 41: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar]. The genes that showed increased expression during sleep in both the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei were involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and membrane trafficking and maintenance. Classically, sleep has been characterized by identifying distinct phenomena at the level of the cerebral cortex. As such, sleep has been subdivided into two core sleep stages, REM and NREM sleep, which cyclically alternate throughout the night. The characteristic sleep phenomena include K-complexes, spindles and slow waves in the various phases of NREM sleep, and theta waves during REM sleep [1Diekelmann S. Born J. The memory function of sleep.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Riedner B.A. et al.Temporal dynamics of cortical sources underlying spontaneous and peripherally evoked slow waves.Prog. Brain Res. 2011; 193: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar]. Cerebellar activity during sleep was first detailed in the early 1970s. This activity was found to not only reflect the intrinsic activity of cerebellar neurons but also the activity of their afferents [7De Zeeuw C.I. et al.Spatiotemporal firing patterns in the cerebellum.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Marchesi G.F. Strata P. Climbing fibers of cat cerebellum: modulation of activity during sleep.Brain Res. 1970; 17: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Marchesi G.F. Strata P. Mossy and climbing fiber activity during phasic and tonic phenomena of sleep.Pflugers Arch. 1971; 323: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar]. In addition to sparsely distributed monoaminergic inputs [15Schweighofer N. et al.Cerebellar aminergic neuromodulation: towards a functional understanding.Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 44: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar] (Box 1), the cerebellum receives two major afferents, the climbing fibers, originating from the inferior olive, and the mossy fibers, originating from a wide variety of sources in the brain stem [7De Zeeuw C.I. et al.Spatiotemporal firing patterns in the cerebellum.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar] (see Figure IC in Box 1). The climbing fibers and mossy fiber–parallel fiber system converge on Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons, which form the output of the cerebellar cortex and cerebellum as a whole, respectively. Whereas activity in climbing fibers elicits so-called complex spikes in Purkinje cells, that of mossy fibers and parallel fibers modulates Purkinje cells' simple spike activity (for review, see [7De Zeeuw C.I. et al.Spatiotemporal firing patterns in the cerebellum.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar]). In cats, both climbing fibers and mossy fibers show relatively low and high levels of activity during NREM and REM, respectively [13Marchesi G.F. Strata P. Climbing fibers of cat cerebellum: modulation of activity during sleep.Brain Res. 1970; 17: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Marchesi G.F. Strata P. Mossy and climbing fiber activity during phasic and tonic phenomena of sleep.Pflugers Arch. 1971; 323: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar], revealing the existence of sleep-stage-dependent cerebellar activity. In the cerebral cortex, NREM sleep can be subdivided into lighter sleep stages NREM1–2 and deep slow-wave sleep (SWS). K-complexes are single slow waves occurring typically in NREM stage 2, while more continuous slow waves occur in what is considered deep sleep or stage 3 NREM sleep [12Riedner B.A. et al.Temporal dynamics of cortical sources underlying spontaneous and peripherally evoked slow waves.Prog. Brain Res. 2011; 193: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar]. They have a peak frequency of less than 1 Hz and together they are the highest-amplitude waves a healthy human brain can produce, caused by large groups of neurons simultaneously alternating between a hyperpolarized down state in which the neurons are inactive, and a depolarized up -state with irregular neuronal firing that may resemble the waking state [16Steriade M. et al.A novel slow (< 1 Hz) oscillation of neocortical neurons in vivo: depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3252-3265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. These slow waves appear to be a cortically generated phenomenon, as isolated cerebral cortex preparations still produce slow waves [17Steriade M. et al.Intracellular analysis of relations between the slow (< 1 Hz) neocortical oscillation and other sleep rhythms of the electroencephalogram.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3266-3283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Timofeev I. et al.Origin of slow cortical oscillations in deafferented cortical slabs.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 1185-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Timofeev I. Steriade M. Low-frequency rhythms in the thalamus of intact-cortex and decorticated cats.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 4152-4168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Slow waves can occur in separate cortical areas but may also involve multiple cortical regions simultaneously. Spindles, which typically present as short bursts of activity at a frequency of 10–15 Hz, probably originate in the thalamus from an interaction between the intrinsic GABAergic cells of the reticular nucleus and the glutamatergic thalamocortical cells [20Steriade M. et al.Thalamic Oscillations and Signaling. John Wiley & Sons, 1990Google Scholar]. At the level of the cortex, the end result is a characteristic waxing and waning spindle -like morphology. In the cerebellum, local field potentials (LFPs) have been recorded during NREM sleep in humans since the 1970s. The fastigial and dentate nuclei of naïve epileptic patients implanted with electrodes in their cerebellar nuclei regions showed synchronous spike discharges during NREM and minor sharp potentials during REM activity [21Niedermeyer E. Uematsu S. Electroencephalographic recordings from deep cerebellar structures in patients with uncontrolled epileptic seizures.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1974; 37: 355-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar] (Figure 1B). NREM sleep-related synchronized slow waves in the fastigial nucleus turned out to be sharper than those in the dentate nucleus, suggesting region-specific sleep-related cerebellar activity [22Zhou H. et al.Cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies.Elife. 2014; 2014: 1-18Google Scholar]. Initially, clean electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of the cerebellum could only be obtained with such invasive recordings during and/or after neurosurgery [23Teixeira M.J. et al.Deep brain stimulation of the dentate nucleus improves cerebellar ataxia after cerebellar stroke.Neurology. 2015; 85: 2075-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 24Kros L. et al.Controlling cerebellar output to treat refractory epilepsy.Trends Neurosci. 2015; 38: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Dalal S.S. et al.Oscillatory activity of the human cerebellum: the intracranial electrocerebellogram revisited.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2013; 37: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar], because external EEG recordings were often contaminated with signals from the visual cortex and/or neck muscles [26Muthukumaraswamy S.D. High-frequency brain activity and muscle artifacts in MEG/EEG: a review and recommendations.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar]. Moreover, identifying cerebellar signaling on the basis of external EEG and magnetic encephalographic data in humans was also complicated by the central location of the cerebellum and the difficulties in solving the inverse problem for estimating the current source of the EEG/magnetic encephalographic signals [27Grech R. et al.Review on solving the inverse problem in EEG source analysis.J. Neuroeng. Rehabil. 2008; 5: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar]. New approaches involving combinations of techniques, such as combined analyses of EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data, partly resolved these issues. A combination of fMRI and EEG recordings indicated that cerebellar signals during NREM1 are lower compared with those during wakefulness [28Diedrichsen J. et al.Advances in functional imaging of the human cerebellum.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2010; 23: 382-387PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kaufmann C. et al.Brain activation and hypothalamic functional connectivity during human non-rapid eye movement sleep: an EEG/fMRI study.Brain. 2006; 129: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar]. Since cerebellar fMRI signals largely reflect mossy and parallel fiber activity [28Diedrichsen J. et al.Advances in functional imaging of the human cerebellum.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2010; 23: 382-387PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kaufmann C. et al.Brain activation and hypothalamic functional connectivity during human non-rapid eye movement sleep: an EEG/fMRI study.Brain. 2006; 129: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar], these fMRI studies support the notion that mossy fibers derived from the pons also contribute to cerebellar NREM sleep stages by decreasing their excitatory drive. The results of PET studies combined with EEG recordings also pointed toward decreased cerebellar activity during the transition from pre -sleep wakefulness to SWS [30Braun A.

The two-sided nature of the human K-complex.Neuroimage. 2012; 59: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar] and sleep spindles [36Schabus M. et al.Hemodynamic cerebral correlates of sleep spindles during human non-rapid eye movement sleep.Proc.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]). The level of slow wave density associated with fMRI bold signals in the cerebellum was positively correlated with its gray matter volume as measured with voxel-based morphometry [37Dang-Vu T.T. et al.Spontaneous neural activity during human slow wave sleep.Proc.

Indeed, in both fMRI and PET studies, the reported changes in cerebellar activation have been mainly localized in the larger lobules IV, V, VI, and VII [29Kaufmann C. et al.Brain activation and hypothalamic functional connectivity during human non-rapid eye movement sleep: an EEG/fMRI study.Brain. 2006; 129: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Braun A.

This review article is based on the first 100 patients, half of whom were visually impaired or blind. Children with neurological, neuropsychiatric, and developmental disabilities are predisposed to chronic sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Disorders such as blindness, deaf-blindness, mental retardation, autism, and central nervous system diseases, among others, diminish the ability of these individuals to perceive and interpret the multitude of cues for synchronizing their sleep with the environment. Melatonin, which benefitted slightly over 80% of our patients, appears to be a safe, inexpensive, and a very effective treatment of sleep-wake cycle disorders. The oral dose of fast release melatonin taken at bed-time ranged from 2.5 mg to 10 mg. Side effects or the development of tolerance have not been observed. Since the causes of sleep difficulties are extremely variable, not all children are candidates for treatment. For successful melatonin treatment, clinical experience is required, and the influences of other health problems and medications need to be considered. Further clinical and laboratory research in this field is imperative because melatonin treatment offers enormous health, emotional, social, and economic benefits to society, especially since multidisabled children with chronic sleep difficulties do not respond well to current therapeutic regimes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-079x.1996.tb00286.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1538674470", "source": "openalex"}

The programme aimed to develop nursing leadership skills, to enhance patient care and to improve practitioner self-management. To ensure the programme reflects the needs of the individuals and the group as a whole, a range of teaching and learning methods were employed. The programme included Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), FIERCE training, training on self-management techniques and change, group coaching and a workbook which supported the programme with self-reflection exercises. The programme was underpinned by the Clinical Leadership Competency Framework (NHS Leadership Academy, 2011) to ensure optimisation of leadership potential. <h3>Method</h3> Focus groups were used to gather information from the participants regarding their understanding of leadership and how they felt about themselves as leaders. <h3>Results</h3> Prior to the programme participants felt that the traits of a leader and the relationship between leader and follower were of paramount importance. There was also an acknowledgement from the participants that they did not self-identify as leaders in their role. Following the leadership programme further focus groups were used to evaluate the programme. Participants felt they had increased their confidence around their leadership skills and the programme had helped them to understand themselves and others more which they felt led to better team working which consequently increased resilience. Questionnaires were also used to demonstrate change in individuals with most showing an improvement in their confidence, self-management and team working. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Overall, the evaluation of the leadership programme was extremely positive with the only suggested improvement to shorten the one-year programme to intensify the experience.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.309.6948.167", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981467048", "source": "openalex"}

Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected using an intrathecal catheter at defined times to compare cerebral Aβ42 concentrations between evening and morning.A night of unrestricted sleep led to a 6% decrease in Aβ42 levels of 25.3 pg/mL (95% CI [0.94, 49.6], P = .04), whereas sleep deprivation counteracted this decrease. When accounting for the individual trajectories of Aβ42 over time, a difference of 75.8 pg/mL of Aβ42 was shown between the unrestricted sleep and sleep deprivation group (95% CI [3.4, 148.4], P = .04). The individual trajectories of evening and morning Aβ42 concentrations differed between the unrestricted sleep and sleep deprivation groups (P = .04) in contrast to stable Aβ40, tau, and total protein levels.Sleep deprivation, or prolonged wakefulness, interferes with a physiological morning decrease in Aβ42.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2043406251", "title": "The Grand Mai épilepsies and the Sleeping‐Waking Cycle", "text": "SUMMARY Side by side with the usual classification of minor fits into cortical Jacksonian seizures, rhinencephalic psychomotor fits and centrencephalic fits of the petit mal triad we find another classification of major seizures which is governed by their dependence on or independence of the sleep‐waking cycle. Under this aspect three types of course may be described: (1) grand mal épilepsies with attacks predominantly following waking and during the period of relaxation following work (“Feierabend”), the so‐called awakening epilepsies; (2) grand mal épilepsies with attacks mainly after falling asleep or before waking, the so‐called sleep epilepsies; (3) grand mal épilepsies with irregular dispersed attacks, the so‐called diffuse epilepsies. As a rule these types remain constant even in cases of considerable duration. Transitions occur from awakening epilepsy to sleep epilepsy or to diffuse epilepsy and from sleep epilepsy to diffuse epilepsy, but not vice versa . The described types differ in the following clinical features: 90% of awakening epilepsies are cryptogenetic, have a ratio of heredity of 12.5%, and generally start first between the ages of 10 and 25; where they are found in combination they are mostly linked with the petit mal triad; the intervals between fits are to a large extent irregular; the fits themselves are in most cases precipitated by lack of sleep and consumption of alcohol. Seventy‐seven percent of sleep epilepsies are cryptogenetic, have a ratio of heredity of 7.7%, and there is no predilection for a particular age; where combined they are mostly linked with psychomotor fits; the intervals between fits are to a large extent regular; the fits themselves are but rarely caused by external circumstances. Diffuse epilepsies are mainly symptomatic (53%), have a ratio of heredity of 3.8% and there is no predilection for a particular age; where combined they are mostly linked with psychomotor fits or Jacksonian seizures; the intervals between fits are to a large extent irregular; the fits themselves are precipitated by a variety of factors whose common denominator is found by acute disturbances of the cerebral circulation. Clinical and electroencephalographical investigations have revealed fundamental differences in the sleep behaviour of patients suffering from awakening or from sleep epilepsies, whereas patients suffering from diffuse epilepsies show no special characteristic in this respect. The differences in sleep patterns apply to the quality – insofar as both achieve their deep sleep maxima at different times in the course of the sleep – as well as to the quantity, since patients with sleep epilepsy sleep too much, i.e ., have too much deep sleep whilst patients with epilepsy on awakening sleep too little, i.e ., have too much shallow sleep. To this corresponds a different behaviour during consciousness, which is correlated electroencephalographically in the case of sleep épilepsies – excepting abnormalities peculiar to the disease – with a regular basic rhythm of a constant frequency; in the case of awakening epilepsies, however, it is correlated with a variable EEG, i.e ., unstable in frequency and disturbed in rhythm. Patients with sleep and patients with awakening epilepsy further differ in their psychical behaviour, in their somatic condition, in their vegetative functions, in their development during puberty and in their instinctive behaviour. The author reported in detail on the investigations by Christian and Ganshirt dealing with their EEG‐findings on pure and combined grand mal epilepsies in waking as well as in sleep. They have shown that sleep epilepsies have generally a normal standard EEG with few general abnormalities and hardly react to hyperventilation, whereas in natural sleep they show considerable increase of specific attack potentials, which never consist of spike‐wave‐complexes, but almost exclusively of bilaterally symmetrical or synchronised steep outbursts or temporal peaks. In the case of awakening epilepsies however we discern very frequently general abnormalities already in the standard EEG, as well as diffuse or paroxysmal dysrhythmia or specific attack potentials, which are yet increased during hyperventilation and represent almost exclusively only 3–4/sec spikes and waves or multi‐spikes‐waves. The increase of specific attack findings between the EEG during waking and the sleep EEG amounts to 1: 1.2 in the case of awakening epilepsies and 1: 10 in the case of sleep epilepsies. Diffuse epilepsies are closer to sleep epilepsies as regards their little reaction to hyperventilation, but closer to awakening epilepsies as regards their low rate of increase in specific attack potentials during sleep (1: 1.5). As for the question of the cerebral localisation, which was investigated on the basis of 141 patients with grand mal epilepsies following circumscribed brain injuries and locatable brain tumours, a relationship was found to be probable insofar as frontal brain injuries lead mainly to sleep epilepsy but parietal brain injuries mainly to diffuse epilepsy. No correlations could be established where awakening epilepsies and other localisations are concerned. The biological antagonism between awakening epilepsy and sleep epilepsy is reflected in a different response to antiepileptic drugs. Sleep epilepsies respond well to hydantoins and badly to phenobarbitone, awakening epilepsies respond well to phenobarbitone and only poorly to hydantoins. No particular differences in the effectiveness of mysoline have been shown when adminstered to either type. For diffuse epilepsies there is no medicament of outstanding effectiveness. RÉSUMÉ A côté de la classification usuelle des crises mineures en brusques crises corticales Jacksonniennes, crises psychomotrices rhinencéphaliques et crises centrencéphaliques de la triade du petit mal, nous trouvons une autre classification de crises majeures que gouverne leur indépendance ou leur dépendance du cycle de l'épilepsie sommeil‐vigile. Ainsi présentés on peut décrire trois types de cours de la maladie: (1) épilepsies de grand mal dont les crises surviennent en prédominance après le réveil et pendant la période de relaxation qui fait suite au travail (Feierabend“), ces épilepsies sont dites épilepsies du réveil; (2) épilepsies de grand mal dont les crises se produisent principalement apres que le patient se soit endormi ou avant son réveil: épilepsies dites en sommeil; (3) épilepsies de grand mal avec crises se dispersant irrégulièrement, épilepsies dites épilepsies diffuses. Selon la règle, ces types restent constants même dans les cas de très longue durée. II survient des transitions de l'épilepsie du réveil à l'épilepsie en sommeil ou à l'épilepsie diffuse, et de l'épilepsie en sommeil à l'épilepsie diffuse, mais non vice versa . Les types décrits différent selon les traits cliniques suivants: 90% des épilepsies à l'état du réveil sont cryptogénétiques, elles sont héréditaires en une proportion de 12.5% et débutent généralement entre 10 et 25 ans; quand on les trouve en combinaison, elles sont le plus souvent en rapport avec la triade du petit mal; les intervalles entre les crises sont fortement irréguliers; les crises mêmes sont, dans la plupart des cas, précipitées par un besoin de sommeil ou une consommation d'alcool. Soixantedix‐sept pour cent d'épilepsies à l'état de sommeil sont cryptogénétiques, elles sont héréditaires en 7.7% des cas et ne montrent aucune prédilection pour un âge quelconque; quand elles sont combinées, elles sont le plus souvent unies à des crises psychomotrices; les intervalles entre les crises sont en forte mesure réguliers; les crises mêmes ne sont que rarement causées par des circonstances externes. Les épilepsies diffuses sont principalement symptomatiques (53%), leur pourcentage d'hérédité est de 3.8% et elles ne montrent point de prédilection pour un âge quelconque; quand elles sont combinées, elles sont souvent unies à des crises psychomotrices ou des crises Jacksonniennes; les intervalles entre les crises sont fortement irréguliers; les crises mêmes sont précipitées par des facteurs variés dont le dénominateur commun est situé dans un trouble aigu de la circulation cérébrale. Des recherches cljniques et encéphalographiques ont révélé des différences fondamentales dans le comportement du sommeil des malades souffrant d'épilepsies du réveil ou à l'état de sommeil tandis que les épilepsies diffuses ne présentent aucune caractéristique spéciale sous ce rapport. Les différences entre les types du sommeil s'appliquent à la qualité– pour autant que les deux genres achèvent leurs maximums de profond sommeil à différents moments du cours du sommeil – tout aussi bien qu'à la quantité puisque les épileptiques en sommeil dorment trop, c'est‐à‐dire dorment trop d'un sommeil profond, tandis que les épileptiques dont les crises surviennent pendant le réveil dorment trop peu, c'est‐à‐dire qu'ils ont trop de sommeil léger. II correspond à ceci un comportement différent durent l'état conscient, ce qui est en correlation avec l'encéphalogramme en cas d'épilepsie en sommeil – exception faite des anomalies propres à la maladie – avec un rythme de base régulier de fréquence constante; toutefois, en cas d'épilepsie du réveil ce rapport s'établit avec un E.E.G. variable, c'est‐à‐dire de fréquence instable et de rythme troublé. Les malades avec épilepsie en sommeil et ceux avec épilepsie à l'état de veille diffèrent de plus dans leur comportement psychique, dans leur condition somatique, dans leurs fonctions végétatives, dans leur développement au cours de la puberté et dans leur comportement instinctif. L'auteur rapporte en détail les recherches de Christian et Gänshirt qui communiquent leurs découvertes faites dans l'E.E.G. sur les épilepsies pures et combinées de grand mal en épilepsies en vigile tout comme en sommeil. Ils ont démontré que les épilepsies en sommeil ont le plus souvent un standard normal d'E.E.G. avec peu d'anomalies et qu'elles réagissent à peine à l'hyperventilation tandis que, lors de sommeil naturel, elles présentent une augmentation considérable de potentiels de crises spécifiques lesquels ne consistent jamais en des complexes de pointes ondes, mais presque exclusivement en fortes bouffées bilatéralement symétriques ou synchronisées, ou en pointes temporales. Dans les cas d'épilepsie du réveil, toutefois, nous pouvons discerner déjà, très fréquemment, dans l'E.E.G. standard des anomalies générates et aussi des dysrythmies diffuses ou paroxysmales ou des potentiels spécifiques de crises, lesquels sont encore augmentés par l'hyperventilation et ne représented presque exclusivement que des pointes‐ondes de 3–4/sec ou des ondes multi‐pointes. L'augmentation des constatations de crise spécifique qui se produit entre l'E.E.G. à l'état de veille et l'E.E.G. du sommeil comprend 1:1.2 dans les cas d'épilepsies à l'état de veille et 1:10 dans les cas d'épilepsie en sommeil. Les épilepsies diffuses se rapprochent plus des épilepsies en sommeil en ce qui concerne leur légère réaction à l'hyperventilation mais elles sont plus rapprochées de l'épilepsie en vigile en ce qui regarde le peu d'élevation de leur taux d'augmentation en potentiels spécifiques de crises durant le sommeil (1:1.5). Quant a la question de la localisation cérébrale, que nous avons étudiée sur une base de 141 malades ayant des épilepsies de grand mal provenant de lésions cérébrales circonscrites et de tumeurs cérébrates susceptibles de localisation, nous avons trouvé la probabilité d'un rapport pour autant qu'un traumatisme du cerveau frontal conduit principalement à l'épilepsie en sommeil, mais qu'un traumatisme pariétal provoque principalement une épilepsie diffuse. II n'a pu etre établi de corrélation quand il s'agit d'épilepsie en vigile ou de localisations autres. L'antagonisme biologique entre l'épilepsie en vigile et l'épilepsie en sommeil est démontré par différentes réactions à des médicaments antiépileptiques. L'épilepsie pendant le sommeil réagit favorablement à des hydantoines et mal au phénobarbitone; en vigile, l'épilepsie réagit bien au phénobarbitone et mal aux médicaments à l'hydantoine. Des différences particulières dans l'efficacité de la mysoline n'ont pas été observées dans l'administration à l'un ou l'autre type. Quant aux épilepsies diffuses, il n'y a pas de médicaments d'efficacité spéciale. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Der geläufigen Einteilung der kleinen Anfälle in kortikale Jackson‐Anfälle, rhinence‐phale psychomotorische Anfälle und centrencephale Anfälle der Petit‐mal‐Trias wird eine Einteilung der grossen Anfälle zur Seite gestellt, die sich nach der Abhängigkeit oder Unabhängigkeit der grossen Anfälle vom Schlaf‐Wachrhytmus richtet. Unter diesem Aspekt lassen sich 3 Verlaufsformen beschreiben: (1) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit Anfällen vorwiegend nach dem Erwachen und während der Entspannungssituation nach der Arbeit (“urn Feierabend”), sog. Aufwachepilepsien; (2) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit Anfällen vorwiegend nach dem Einschlafen und vor dem Aufwachen, sog. Schlafepilepsien; (3) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit unregelmässiger Anfallsverteilung, sog. diffuse Epilepsien. In der Regel bleiben diese Formen auch bei längerem Krankheitsverlauf konstant. Überg̈ange können erfolgen von Aufwach‐ in Schlafoder in diffuse Epilepsien und von Schlaf‐ in diffuse Epilepsien, jedoch nicht in umgekehrter Richtung. Die beschriebenen Formen unterscheiden sich in folgenden klinischen Eigenschaften: Aufwach‐Epilepsien sind zu 90% kryptogen, haben eine Hereditätsquote von 12.5% und beginnen meist zwischen dem 10. und 25. Jahr; in Kombination sind sie meist mit Anfällen der Petit‐mal‐Trias verknüpft; die Anfälle selbst werden vorwiegend durch Schlafdefizit und Alkohol ausgelöst. Schlafepilepsien sind zu 77% kryptogen und zu 23% symptomatisch mit einer Hereditätsquote von 7.7%,; sie haben kein Prädilektionsalter; in Kombination sind sie meist mit psychomotorischen Anfällen verknüpft; die Anfallsintervalle sind weitgehend regelmässig; die Anfälle selbst werden nur selten durch exogene Umstände ausgelöst. Diffuse Epilepsien sind vorwiegend symptomatisch (53%) mit einer Hereditätsquote von 3,8%; sie haben kein Prädilektionsalter; in Kombination treten sie meist mit psychomotorischen Anfällen oder mit Jackson‐Anfällen auf; die Anfallsintervalle sind unregelmässig; die Anfälle selbst werden durch verschiedenartige Faktoren ausgelöst, deren gemeinsamer Nenner in akuten Regulationsstörungen der Gehirndurchblutung zu suchen ist. Klinische und elektroencephalographische Untersuchungen lassen fundamentale Unterschiede im Schlafverhalten bei Aufwach‐ und bei Schlaf‐Epileptikern erkennen, während Kranke mit einer diffusen Epilepsie in dieser Hinsicht keine charakteristischen Abweichungen bieten. Die Unterschiede betreffen sowohl die Qualität des Schlafs – insofern als beide ihre Tiefschlaf‐Maxima zu verschiedenen Zeiten während des Schlafverlaufs erreichen –, als auch die Quantität, da Patienten mit einer Schlaf‐epilepsie zu viel schlafen, d.h. zu lange tief und Patienten mit einer Aufwachepilepsie zu wenig, d.h. zu lange flach schlafen. Dem entspricht ein verschiedenes Wachverhalten, das elektroencephalographisch bei Schlaf‐Epileptikern – abgesehen von anfallsspezifischen Veränderungen – mit einem regelmässigen, frequenzkonstanten Grundrhythmus und bei Aufwach‐Epileptikern mit einem frequenzlabilen, dysrhythmi‐schen EEG korreliert ist. Kranke mit Aufwach‐ und Kranke mit Schlaf‐Epilepsien unterscheiden sich ferner in ihrem psychischen Verhalten, in ihrer körperlichen Konstitution, ihren vegetativen Funktionen, ihrer Pubertätsentwicklung und ihrem Triebverhalten. Ausführlich referiert werden die EEG‐Untersuchungen von Christian und Gänshirt bei reinen und kombinierten Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien im Wachen wie im Schlaf, die zeigen, dass Schlaf‐Epilepsien meist ein unauffälliges Standard‐EEG mit wenig Allgemeinveränderungen bieten, auf Hyperventilation kaum, im natürlichen Schlaf dagegen mit einer erheblichen Zunahme anfalls‐spezifischer Potentiale reagieren, bei denen es sich nie um spike‐wave‐Komplexe, sondern fast nur um bilateral‐symmetrische oder synchronisierte steile Ausbrüche oder steile Spitzen handelt. Aufwach‐Epilepsien bieten dagegen sehr häufig schon im Standard‐EEG Allgemeinveränderungen, diffuse oder paroxysmale Dysrhythmien oder spezifische Anfallspotentiale, die auf Hyperventilation noch zunehmen und fast ausschliesslich nur 3–4/sec spike‐waves und multi‐spike‐waves darstellen. Der Zuwachs anfallsspezifischer Befunde vom Wach‐zum‐Schlaf‐EEG beträgt bei Aufwach‐Epilepsien 1: 1.2 und bei Schlaf‐Epilepsien 1: 10. Diffuse Epilepsien stehen hinsichtlich ihrer geringen Reaktion auf Hyperventilation den Schlaf‐Epilepsien näher und hinsichtlich ihrer geringen Zuwachsrate anfallsspezifischer Befunde im Schlaf (1: 1.5) den Aufwach‐Epilepsien. Eine hirnlokalisatorische Beziehung liess sich auf Grund von Untersuchungen an 141 Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien nach lokalisierten Hirnverletzungen und ‐Tumoren insofern wahrscheinlich machen, als Stirnhirnschädigungen vorwiegend zu Schlaf‐Epilepsien und Parietalhirnverletzungen vorwiegend zu diffusen Epilepsien führen. Für Aufwach‐Epilepsien und für andere Lokalisationen liessen sich keine Korrelationen ermitteln. Der biologische Antagonismus zwischen Aufwach‐ und Schlaf‐Epilepsien spiegelt sich in einer unterschiedlichen Ansprechbarkeit auf Antiepileptika wieder. Schlaf‐Epilepsien sprechen gut auf Hydantoine und schlecht auf Luminal, Aufwach‐Epilepsien gut auf Luminal und nur mässig auf Hydantoine an. Für Mylepsin ergibt sich keine signifikante Wirkungsdifferenz. Bei diffusen Epilepsien ist kein Medikament optimal indiziert.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1962.tb05235.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043406251", "source": "openalex"}

However, the effects of partial sleep deprivation on the cardiovascular system are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated 13 healthy male volunteers (age: 31 ± 2 yr) monitoring sleep diary and wrist actigraphy during their daily routine for 12 nights. The subjects were randomized and crossover to 5 nights of control sleep (&gt;7 h) or 5 nights of partial sleep deprivation (&lt;5 h), interposed by 2 nights of unrestricted sleep. At the end of control and partial sleep deprivation periods, heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), serum norepinephrine, and venous endothelial function (dorsal hand vein technique) were measured at rest in a supine position. The subjects slept 8.0 ± 0.5 and 4.5 ± 0.3 h during control and partial sleep deprivation periods, respectively ( P &lt; 0.01). Compared with control, sleep deprivation caused significant increase in sympathetic activity as evidenced by increase in percent low-frequency (50 ± 15 vs. 59 ± 8) and a decrease in percent high-frequency (50 ± 10 vs. 41 ± 8) components of HRV, increase in low-frequency band of BPV, and increase in serum norepinephrine (119 ± 46 vs. 162 ± 58 ng/ml), as well as a reduction in maximum endothelial dependent venodilatation (100 ± 22 vs. 41 ± 20%; P &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, 5 nights of partial sleep deprivation is sufficient to cause significant increase in sympathetic activity and venous endothelial dysfunction. These results may help to explain the association between short sleep and increased cardiovascular risk in epidemiological studies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.01604.2011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987176556", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2143008299", "title": "The Hypotonic Upper Airway in Obstructive Sleep Apnea", "text": "The structural properties of the upper airway determine its collapsibility during periods of muscle hypotonia. Both rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and increases in nasal pressure (PN) produce hypotonia, which persists even after nasal pressure is abruptly reduced. To determine the factors that influence the collapsibility of the hypotonic airway, the critical pressure (Pcrit) and nasal resistance upstream to the site of pharyngeal collapse (RN) were measured in the first three breaths after abrupt reductions in PN during non-REM and REM sleep. PN was reduced abruptly from 15.2 ± 3.2 cm H2O (mean ± SD) for three breaths in 19 apneic patients. Upper-airway pressure–flow relationships were analyzed to determine Pcrit for each breath in non-REM and REM sleep. We found that Pcrit rose (collapsibility increased, p < 0.001) and RN fell (p = 0.02) between the first and third breath after the decrease in PN, whereas no difference in Pcrit was detected between sleep stages. In six patients, genioglossus-muscle electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded. Peak phasic activity rose between the first and third breath (p = 0.03), but tonic and peak phasic EMG activity fell in REM as compared with non-REM sleep (p < 0.001). We conclude that the hypotonic upper airway becomes most collapsible by the third breath after an abrupt decrease in PN, regardless of sleep stage and despite an increase in genioglossus-muscle activity. Our findings suggest that predominantly mechanical rather than neuromuscular factors modulate the properties of the pharynx after abrupt reductions in nasal pressure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.157.4.9706067", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143008299", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we tackle the task as a sequence-to-sequence classification problem that receives a sequence of multiple epochs as input and classifies all of their labels at once. For this purpose, we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network named SeqSleepNet (source code is available at http://github.com/pquochuy/SeqSleepNet). At the epoch processing level, the network consists of a filterbank layer tailored to learn frequency-domain filters for preprocessing and an attention-based recurrent layer designed for short-term sequential modeling. At the sequence processing level, a recurrent layer placed on top of the learned epoch-wise features for long-term modeling of sequential epochs. The classification is then carried out on the output vectors at every time step of the top recurrent layer to produce the sequence of output labels. Despite being hierarchical, we present a strategy to train the network in an end-to-end fashion. We show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an overall accuracy, macro F1-score, and Cohen's kappa of 87.1%, 83.3%, and 0.815 on a publicly available dataset with 200 subjects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2019.2896659", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2893892260", "source": "openalex"}

Brainstem structures responsible for the pathogenesis of RBD are also implicated in cortical activation. To verify the hypothesis that electroencephalogram (EEG) activation will be impaired in RBD, we performed quantitative analyses of waking and REM sleep EEG in 15 idiopathic RBD patients and 15 age‐ and gender‐matched healthy subjects. During wakefulness, RBD patients showed a considerably higher θ power in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions with a lower β power in the occipital region. The dominant occipital frequency was significantly lower in RBD. During REM sleep, β power in the occipital region was lower in RBD. This study shows for the first time an impaired cortical activation during both wakefulness and REM sleep in idiopathic RBD, despite an absence of changes on sleep architecture compared with controls. EEG slowing in these patients may represent an early sign of central nervous system dysfunction, perhaps paralleled by subclinical cognitive deficits. The topographical distribution of EEG slowing and possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the known association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders.

Intranasal corticosteroids have been advanced as a nonsurgical therapeutic alternative for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, particularly for patients with mild disease, and aims at reducing the size of hypertrophic adenotonsillar tissue. METHODS. Of 71 possible candidates, 62 children with polysomnographically diagnosed mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were recruited onto a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial of intranasal budesonide (32 μg per nostril at bedtime) or placebo for 6 weeks followed by an additional 6-week treatment in the alternative treatment arm after allowing for a 2-week washout period. Polysomnographic assessment and radiographs for assessment of adenoid size were performed after completion of each phase. RESULTS. There were significant improvements in both polysomnographic measures (sleep latency, slow-wave sleep, and rapid-eye-movement sleep), in the magnitude of respiratory disturbance (apnea/hypopnea index, nadir pulse oxygen saturation), and in adenoid size among the 48 children who completed the treatment phase compared with 32 children who received placebo in their initial arm, with normalization of sleep measures in 54.1% of the treated children. Furthermore, discontinuation of treatment for 8 weeks for 25 children revealed a sustained duration of the initial treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS. A 6-week treatment with intranasal budesonide effectively reduced the severity of mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the magnitude of the underlying adenoidal hypertrophy, and this effect persisted for at least 8 weeks after cessation of therapy. These findings justify the use of topical steroids as the initial therapeutic option in otherwise healthy children with mild obstructive sleep apnea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-3398", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983580599", "source": "openalex"}

Their control could reduce the burden of heart disease across populations. Several drugs are used to control hypertension, but the only consistently effective treatment of OSA is continuous positive airway pressure. The identification of a drug capable of improving OSA and hypertension simultaneously would provide a novel approach in the treatment of both diseases. Methods/Design This is a randomized double-blind clinical trial, comparing the use of chlorthalidone with amiloride versus amlodipine as a first drug option in patients older than 40 years of age with stage I hypertension (140 to 159/90 to 99 mmHg) and moderate OSA (15 to 30 apneas/hour of sleep). The primary outcomes are the variation of the number of apneas per hour and blood pressure measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The secondary outcomes are adverse events, somnolence scale (Epworth), ventilatory parameters and C reactive protein levels. The follow-up will last 8 weeks. There will be 29 participants per group. The project has been approved by the ethics committee of our institution. Discussion The role of fluid retention in OSA has been known for several decades. The use of diuretics are well established in treating hypertension but have never been appropriately tested for sleep apnea. As well as testing the efficacy of these drugs, this study will help to understand the mechanisms that link hypertension and sleep apnea and their treatment.

To further this understanding, subjects free of pain and sleep problems need to be studied in order to assess their response to pain during sleep, defined as a behavioral and a physiological state in which sensory processing is altered. (For example, while auditory perception remains active, other sensory inputs are facilitated, attenuated, or suppressed (Velluti, 1997)). The present study provides data on polygraphic responses to cool (24°C), warm (37°C), and heat pain (>46°C) stimuli applied to shoulder skin during different sleep stages: the lighter sleep stage 2, the deep stages 3&4, and REM sleep. Based on evidence from eight subjects, we found that nociceptive heat stimulation evokes a moderate level of cortical arousal during sleep. Specifically, in comparison to the response induced by a warm 37°C non-nociceptive control stimulation, the percentage of cortical arousal responses to heat pain stimuli (>46°C) was statistically greater in the lighter sleep stage 2 (48.3%) than in the deeper stages 3&4 (27.9%). A nocifensive behavioral-motor response was associated with only 2.5% of the 351 heat pain stimuli. Two other markers of sleep quality–sleep stage shift and awakening–were not influenced by the thermal stimuli. None of the subjects demonstrated any burns in the morning following the thermal stimulations applied during sleep. We conclude that the processing of nociceptive inputs is attenuated across sleep stages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3959(99)00213-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2062572862", "source": "openalex"}

After incidental encoding of emotional and neutral pictures, one-half of the subjects were allowed to sleep, whereas the others were totally sleep deprived, on the first postencoding night. During subsequent retest, functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions taking place 3 d and 6 months later, subjects made recognition memory judgments about the previously studied and new pictures. Between these retest sessions, all participants slept as usual at home. At 6 month retest, recollection was associated with significantly larger responses in subjects allowed to sleep than in sleep-deprived subjects, in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) and the precuneus, two areas involved in memory retrieval, as well as in the extended amygdala and the occipital cortex, two regions the response of which was modulated by emotion at encoding. Moreover, the functional connectivity was enhanced between the vMPFC and the precuneus, as well as between the extended amygdala, the vMPFC, and the occipital cortex in the sleep group relative to the sleep-deprived group.

We tested the impact of short wavelength light (460 nm) on sleep EEG power spectra and sleep architecture. We hypothesized that its acute action on sleep is similar in magnitude to reported effects for polychromatic light at higher intensities and stronger than longer wavelength light (550 nm). The sleep EEGs of eight young men were analyzed after 2-h evening exposure to blue (460 nm) and green (550 nm) light of equal photon densities (2.8 x 10(13) photons x cm(-2) x s(-1)) and to dark (0 lux) under constant posture conditions. The time course of EEG slow-wave activity (SWA; 0.75-4.5 Hz) across sleep cycles after blue light at 460 nm was changed such that SWA was slightly reduced in the first and significantly increased during the third sleep cycle in parietal and occipital brain regions. Moreover, blue light significantly shortened rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration during these two sleep cycles. Thus the light effects on the dynamics of SWA and REM sleep durations were blue shifted relative to the three-cone visual photopic system probably mediated by the circadian, non-image-forming visual system. Our results can be interpreted in terms of an induction of a circadian phase delay and/or repercussions of a stronger alerting effect after blue light, persisting into the sleep episode.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00478.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014930533", "source": "openalex"}

Children in the control group received usual clinical care. <b>Main outcome measures</b> At three and six months after randomisation: severity of ADHD symptoms (parent and teacher ADHD rating scale IV—primary outcome), sleep problems (parent reported severity, children’s sleep habits questionnaire, actigraphy), behaviour (strengths and difficulties questionnaire), quality of life (pediatric quality of life inventory 4.0), daily functioning (daily parent rating of evening and morning behavior), working memory (working memory test battery for children, six months only), and parent mental health (depression anxiety stress scales). <b>Results</b> Intervention compared with control families reported a greater decrease in ADHD symptoms at three and six months (adjusted mean difference for change in symptom severity −2.9, 95% confidence interval −5.5 to −0.3, P=0.03, effect size −0.3, and −3.7, −6.1 to −1.2, P=0.004, effect size −0.4, respectively). Compared with control children, intervention children had fewer moderate-severe sleep problems at three months (56% <i>v</i> 30%; adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.59; P&lt;0.001) and six months (46% <i>v</i> 34%; 0.58, 0.32 to 1.0; P=0.07). At three months this equated to a reduction in absolute risk of 25.7% (95% confidence interval 14.1% to 37.3%) and an estimated number needed to treat of 3.9. At six months the number needed to treat was 7.8. Approximately a half to one third of the beneficial effect of the intervention on ADHD symptoms was mediated through improved sleep, at three and six months, respectively. Intervention families reported greater improvements in all other child and family outcomes except parental mental health. Teachers reported improved behaviour of the children at three and six months. Working memory (backwards digit recall) was higher in the intervention children compared with control children at six months. Daily sleep duration measured by actigraphy tended to be higher in the intervention children at three months (mean difference 10.9 minutes, 95% confidence interval −19.0 to 40.8 minutes, effect size 0.2) and six months (9.9 minutes, −16.3 to 36.1 minutes, effect size 0.3); however, this measure was only completed by a subset of children (n=54 at three months and n=37 at six months). <b>Conclusions</b> A brief behavioural sleep intervention modestly improves the severity of ADHD symptoms in a community sample of children with ADHD, most of whom were taking stimulant medications. The intervention also improved the children’s sleep, behaviour, quality of life, and functioning, with most benefits sustained to six months post-intervention.

Uniform criteria by which to diagnose a clinically significant degree of CSR-CSA have yet to be established. CSR-CSA is caused by respiratory control system instability characterized by a tendency to hyperventilate. Central apnea occurs when Pa(CO(2)) falls below the threshold for apnea during sleep due to ventilatory overshoot. Patients with CSR-CSA are generally hypocapnic, with a Pa(CO(2)) closer than normal to the apneic threshold such that even slight augmentation in ventilation drives Pa(CO(2)) below threshold and triggers apnea. Factors contributing to hyperventilation in HF include stimulation of pulmonary irritant receptors by pulmonary congestion, increased chemoreceptor sensitivity, reduced cerebrovascular blood flow, and recurrent arousals from sleep. Controversy remains as to whether CSR-CSA is simply a reflection of HF severity, or whether it exerts unique adverse effects on prognosis. The main adverse influence of CSR-CSA on cardiovascular function appears to be excessive sympathetic nervous system activity due to apnea-related hypoxia and arousals from sleep. A number of studies have examined the potential relationship between CSR-CSA and mortality in HF. Most reported that CSR-CSA was associated with an increased risk for mortality, but these studies were small. Further research is therefore needed to elucidate mechanisms which contribute to the pathogenesis of CSR-CSA, and to determine whether its treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HF.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1513/pats.200708-129mg", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011621610", "source": "openalex"}

To identify and model the effects of sleep loss and fatigue on resident–physicians' professional lives and personal well-being. Method. In 2001–02, 149 residents at five U.S. academic health centers and from six specialties (obstetrics–gynecology, emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery) were recruited for the study. Residents were all in good standing in their programs. In a mixed-methods design, focus groups consisted of an average of seven (range, three to 14) individuals in the same year of training and residency program, for a total of 60 interns and 89 senior residents. Trained moderators conducted focus groups using a standardized, semistructured discussion guide. Participants also completed a 30-item quantitative questionnaire assessing sleepiness and workplace sleep attitudes that included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Results. Residents described multiple adverse effects of sleep loss and fatigue on learning and cognition; job performance, including professionalism and task performance; and personal life, including personal well-being and relationships with spouse or significant other and family. Only 16% of the sample scored within the \"normal\" range on the ESS; 84% scored in the range for which clinical intervention is indicated. Sleepiness was consistent across institution, specialty, years of training, age, gender, marital status, and having children. Conclusions. More residents perceived that sleep loss and fatigue had major impact on their personal lives during residency, leaving many personal and social activities and meaningful personal pleasures deferred or postponed.

Schizophrenics had decreased sleep continuity comparable to delusional depressives. Slow-wave sleep percent was similar to that seen in healthy controls, as was the intranight temporal distribution of EEG delta activity. However, schizophrenics showed diminished delta counts per minute of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and a decreased total delta wave count. In contrast, depressives showed diminished slow-wave sleep percent compared with controls, greatly decreased delta activity (more so than did the schizophrenics), and an altered temporal distribution of delta activity, as evidenced by a shift of delta activity from the first to the second NREM period. Minutes of slow-wave sleep in the schizophrenics was inversely correlated with the severity of negative symptoms independent of the effects of age and the presence of depression. The schizophrenics showed normal REM latency and first REM period duration, in contrast to the depressives. These findings, reviewed in the historical context of sleep physiologic studies of schizophrenia over the past 30 years, suggest that young, never-medicated schizophrenics do not show the characteristic constellation of abnormalities in the first NREM-REM cycle seen in patients with major depression. However, decreased slow-wave sleep should be investigated as a possible marker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800130038006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020669188", "source": "openalex"}

In two experiments, we addressed the question of whether this effect extends to daytime naps. In the first experiment we assessed free recall of a list of 30 words after a 60 min retention interval that was either filled with daytime napping or waking activity. Memory performance was significantly enhanced after napping as opposed to waking but was not correlated with time spent in slow wave sleep or total sleep time within the napping condition. The second experiment was designed to clarify the role of total sleep time and therefore included an additional third group, which was allowed to nap for no longer than 6 min on average. In comparing word recall after conditions of no napping (waking), short napping, and long napping, we found superior recall for both nap conditions in contrast to waking as well as for long naps in contrast to short naps. These results demonstrate that even an ultra short period of sleep is sufficient to enhance memory processing. We suggest that the mere onset of sleep may initiate active processes of consolidation which – once triggered – remain effective even if sleep is terminated shortly thereafter.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00622.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129077422", "source": "openalex"}

Efforts to automate this process have shown promising results, but automatic systems are generally evaluated on private databases, not allowing accurate cross‐validation with other systems. In lacking a common benchmark, the relative performances of different systems are not compared easily and advances are compromised. To address this fundamental methodological impediment to sleep study, we propose an open‐access database of polysomnographic biosignals. To build this database, whole‐night recordings from 200 participants [97 males (aged 42.9 ± 19.8 years) and 103 females (aged 38.3 ± 18.9 years); age range: 18–76 years] were pooled from eight different research protocols performed in three different hospital‐based sleep laboratories. All recordings feature a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and an electroencephalography ( EEG ) montage of 4–20 channels plus standard electro‐oculography ( EOG ), electromyography ( EMG ), electrocardiography ( ECG ) and respiratory signals. Access to the database can be obtained through the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies ( MASS ) website ( http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS ), and requires only affiliation with a research institution and prior approval by the applicant's local ethical review board. Providing the research community with access to this free and open sleep database is expected to facilitate the development and cross‐validation of sleep analysis automation systems. It is also expected that such a shared resource will be a catalyst for cross‐centre collaborations on difficult topics such as improving inter‐rater agreement on sleep stage scoring.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.12169", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983256092", "source": "openalex"}

Participants reported sleep duration in 1998-2000 and 2002-2004, and all stroke cases were recorded until March 31, 2009. For the meta-analysis, we searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for prospective studies published until May 2014, and pooled effect estimates using a weighted random-effect model.After 9.5 years of follow-up, 346 cases of stroke occurred. Long sleep was significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 1.98]) after adjustment for all covariates. The association remained robust among those without preexisting diseases and those who reported sleeping well. The association for short sleep was smaller (and not statistically significant) (HR = 1.18 [95% CI 0.91, 1.53]). There was a higher stroke risk among those who reported persistently long sleep or a substantial increase in sleep duration over time, compared to those reporting persistently average sleep. These were compatible with the pooled HRs from an updated meta-analysis, which were 1.15 (1.07, 1.24) and 1.45 (1.30, 1.62) for short and long sleep duration, respectively.This prospective study and meta-analysis identified prolonged sleep as a potentially useful marker of increased future stroke risk in an apparently healthy aging population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000001371", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135549297", "source": "openalex"}

Experimental data suggest that sleep is required for clearance of waste products from brain metabolism. This has, however, never been verified in humans. The primary aim of the present study was to examine in vivo whether one night of total sleep deprivation affects molecular clearance from the human brain. Secondarily, we examined whether clearance was affected by subsequent sleep. Multiphase MRI with standardized T1 sequences was performed up to 48 h after intrathecal administration of the contrast agent gadobutrol (0.5 ml of 1 mmol/ml), which served as a tracer molecule. Using FreeSurfer software, we quantified tracer enrichment within 85 brain regions as percentage change from baseline of normalized T1 signals. The cerebral tracer enrichment was compared between two cohorts of individuals; one cohort (n = 7) underwent total sleep deprivation from Day 1 to Day 2 (sleep deprivation group) while an age and gender-matched control group (n = 17; sleep group) was allowed free sleep from Day 1 to Day 2. From Day 2 to 3 all individuals were allowed free sleep. The tracer enriched the brains of the two groups similarly. Sleep deprivation was the sole intervention. One night of sleep deprivation impaired clearance of the tracer substance from most brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, white matter and limbic structures, as demonstrated on the morning of Day 2 after intervention (sleep deprivation/sleep). Moreover, the impaired cerebral clearance in the sleep deprivation group was not compensated by subsequent sleep from Day 2 to 3. The present results provide in vivo evidence that one night of total sleep deprivation impairs molecular clearance from the human brain, and that humans do not catch up on lost sleep.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa443", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3145545686", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2048468809", "title": "Marked Decrease in Sleepiness in Patients with Sleep Apnea by Etanercept, a Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Antagonist", "text": "The proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6, are elevated in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and have been proposed as mediators of excessive daytime sleepiness in humans. We tested the effects of etanercept, a medication that neutralizes TNFα and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in eight obese male apneics. These patients participated in a pilot, placebo-controlled, double-blind study during which nighttime polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test, and fasting blood glucose and plasma levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, insulin, and adiponectin were obtained. There was a significant and marked decrease in sleepiness by etanercept, which increased sleep latency during the multiple sleep latency test by 3.1 ± 1.0 min (P < 0.05) compared with placebo. Also, the number of apneas/hypopneas per hour was reduced significantly by the drug compared with placebo (52.8 ± 9.1 vs. 44.3 ± 10.3; adjusted difference, −8.4 ± 2.3; P < 0.05). Furthermore, IL-6 levels were significantly decreased after etanercept administration compared with placebo (3.8 ± 0.9 vs. 1.9 ± 0.4 pg/ml; adjusted difference, −1.9 ± 0.5; P < 0.01). However, no differences were observed in etanercept vs. placebo in the levels of fasting blood glucose and plasma C-reactive protein, insulin, and adiponectin. We conclude that neutralizing TNFα activity is associated with a significant reduction of objective sleepiness in obese patients with OSA. This effect, which is about 3-fold higher than the reported effects of continuous positive airway pressure on objective sleepiness in patients with OSA (0.9 vs. 3.1 min), suggests that proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA/sleepiness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2003-031929", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048468809", "source": "openalex"}

Waking not rested, waking too early, trouble falling asleep, daytime napping, nocturnal waking, and difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep are among the chief sleep complaints of older adults. The consequences of poor sleep include difficulty sustaining attention, slowed response time, difficulty with memory, and decreased performance. Both medical and psychiatric conditions as well as the medications used to treat them lead to sleep complaints in older adults. Circadian rhythm disturbances and primary sleep disorders may also result in sleep complaints. Appropriate treatment may be dictated by severity of symptoms and concurrent medications. Efficacious pharmacologic interventions are the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszop-iclone. Two new agents, ramelteon, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in adults with insomnia, and immediate release and modified release indiplon, which is currently under investigation, have been effective in clinical trials. Cognitive-behavioral therapy alone and in combination with medication have been effective in improving sleep in older adults.

All night polysomnographic recordings were obtained while each patient slept in a private surgical ward room through two nights before and five or six nights after operation. Anesthesia included thiopental, N2O, isoflurane, and fentanyl. Postoperative analgesia was provided with parenteral morphine. Other aspects of care were routine. Nocturnal sleep was markedly disturbed after both surgical procedures. Throughout the operative night and subsequent one or two nights, sleep was highly fragmented with the usual recurring cycles of sleep stages completely disrupted. Slow wave sleep was suppressed and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep virtually eliminated. During the following 2-4 nights, as other aspects of sleep recovered, REM sleep reappeared and then increased to greater than the preoperative amount. This increased REM sleep was marked by a heavy density of eye movement activity along with frequent patient reports of unusually distressing dreams or vivid nightmares. It is concluded that anesthesia with upper abdominal surgery leads to a severe disruption of nocturnal sleep followed by the release of highly intense REM sleep about the middle of the first postoperative week.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-199007000-00009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094950559", "source": "openalex"}

In some cases the changes in MT act as chemical signals that trigger photoperiodic induction of breeding and other seasonal phenomena. It is unclear whether, and to what extent changes in daylength modify the duration of human MT secretion. To address this question, I investigated whether the duration of human MT secretion could be altered by artificial photoperiods. I exposed eight healthy volunteers to a conventional \"summer\" photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h darkness for 1 week and to a \"winter\" photoperiod of 10 h light and 14 h darkness for 4 weeks. As occurs in animals, the duration of nocturnal MT secretion in human beings was longer after exposure to the short photoperiod (12.5 +/- 1.8 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.8 h, t = 3.778, P less than 0.01). The duration of the sleep-phase (recorded by electroencephalogram) was also longer (11.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 7.7 +/- 0.2 h, t = 11.754, P less than 0.001). Whether such changes would lead to significant seasonal changes in human physiology and behavior under natural lighting conditions may be worthy of further investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem-73-6-1276", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038215683", "source": "openalex"}
