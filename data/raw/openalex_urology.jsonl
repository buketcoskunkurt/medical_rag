Methods: A comprehensive search was done to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of tadalafil for LUTS/BPH with placebos. Meta-analytical techniques were applied to evaluate the differences in the study results. Results: Eight studies were identified and analyzed. Compared with placebo, tadalafil was associated with significant improvements in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (mean difference = -2.19, p &lt; 0.00001) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score (mean difference = +4.66, p &lt; 0.00001), despite the concomitant presence of erectile dysfunction. Significant differences were also observed in the IPSS irritative and obstructive subscores, IPSS quality of life index and BPH impact index. After pooling four doses (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg), tadalafil failed to produce a significant outcome in maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax) (mean difference = +0.26 ml/s, p = 0.14), but 5 mg of tadalafil significantly improved Qmax (mean difference = +0.63 ml/s, p = 0.04). No significant difference was detected in the incidence of serious adverse events (risk ratio = 1.00, p = 1.00) after tadalafil treatment. Conclusions: Tadalafil showed good efficacy and safety for improving LUTS and erectile dysfunction in men with BPH, and 5 mg of tadalafil significantly improved Qmax.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000351405", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038693293", "source": "openalex"}

A standardized data-collection form was used to review all inpatient and outpatient charts of the 395 women identified. Variables examined included age, ethnicity, height, weight, vaginal parity, smoking history, medical history, and surgical history, including the preoperative evaluation, procedure performed, and details of all prior procedures. Analysis included calculation of age-specific and cumulative incidences and determination of the number of primary operations compared with repeat operations performed for prolapse or incontinence.The age-specific incidence increased with advancing age. The lifetime risk of undergoing a single operation for prolapse or incontinence by age 80 was 11.1%. Most patients were older, postmenopausal, parous, and overweight. Nearly half were current or former smokers and one-fifth had chronic lung disease. Reoperation was common (29.2% of cases), and the time intervals between repeat procedures decreased with each successive repair.Pelvic floor dysfunction is a major health issue for older women, as shown by the 11.1% lifetime risk of undergoing a single operation for pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, as well as the large proportion of reoperations. Our results warrant further epidemiologic research in order to determine the etiology, natural history, and long-term treatment outcomes of these conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(97)00058-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2015635389", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1964043583", "title": "Urinary Creatinine Concentrations in the U.S. Population: Implications for Urinary Biologic Monitoring Measurements", "text": "Biologic monitoring (i.e., biomonitoring) is used to assess human exposures to environmental and workplace chemicals. Urinary biomonitoring data typically are adjusted to a constant creatinine concentration to correct for variable dilutions among spot samples. Traditionally, this approach has been used in population groups without much diversity. The inclusion of multiple demographic groups in studies using biomonitoring for exposure assessment has increased the variability in the urinary creatinine levels in these study populations. Our objectives were to document the normal range of urinary creatinine concentrations among various demographic groups, evaluate the impact that variations in creatinine concentrations can have on classifying exposure status of individuals in epidemiologic studies, and recommend an approach using multiple regression to adjust for variations in creatinine in multivariate analyses. We performed a weighted multivariate analysis of urinary creatinine concentrations in 22,245 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) and established reference ranges (10th–90th percentiles) for each demographic and age category. Significant predictors of urinary creatinine concentration included age group, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and fat-free mass. Time of day that urine samples were collected made a small but statistically significant difference in creatinine concentrations. For an individual, the creatinine-adjusted concentration of an analyte should be compared with a \"reference\" range derived from persons in a similar demographic group (e.g., children with children, adults with adults). For multiple regression analysis of population groups, we recommend that the analyte concentration (unadjusted for creatinine) should be included in the analysis with urinary creatinine added as a separate independent variable. This approach allows the urinary analyte concentration to be appropriately adjusted for urinary creatinine and the statistical significance of other variables in the model to be independent of effects of creatinine concentration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.7337", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964043583", "source": "openalex"}

To present a summary of the 2022 RCC guideline, which is based on a standardised methodology including systematic reviews (SRs) and provides transparent and reliable evidence for the management of RCC. For the 2022 update, a new literature search was carried out with a cutoff date of May 28, 2021, covering the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The data search focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective or controlled comparator-arm studies, SRs, and meta-analyses. Evidence synthesis was conducted using modified GRADE criteria as outlined for all the EAU guidelines. All chapters of the RCC guideline were updated on the basis of a structured literature assessment, and clinical practice recommendations were developed. The majority of the studies included were retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts and were based on single- or multi-institution data or national registries. The exception was systemic treatment of metastatic RCC, for which there are several large RCTs, resulting in recommendations that are based on higher levels of evidence. The 2022 RCC guidelines have been updated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the highest methodological standards. These guidelines provide the most reliable contemporary evidence base for the management of RCC in 2022. The European Association of Urology panel for guidelines on kidney cancer has thoroughly evaluated the research data available to establish up-to-date international standards for the care of patients with kidney cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2022.03.006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220685687", "source": "openalex"}

Methods A developmental version of the questionnaire was produced following systematic literature review and views of an expert committee and patients. Several studies were undertaken to evaluate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, including content, construct and convergent validity, reliability and sensitivity to change. Results The ICIQ was easily completed, with low levels of missing data (mean 1.6%). It was able to discriminate among different groups of individuals, indicating good construct validity. Convergent validity was acceptable, with most items demonstrating ‘moderate’ to ‘strong’ agreement with other questionnaires. Reliability was good, with ‘moderate’ to ‘very good’ stability in test‐retest analysis and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95. Items identified statistically significant reductions in symptoms from baseline following surgical and conservative treatment. Item reduction techniques were used to determine the final version and scoring scheme, which also demonstrated good psychometric properties. Conclusions The final ICIQ comprises three scored items and an unscored self‐diagnostic item. It allows the assessment of the prevalence, frequency, and perceived cause of urinary incontinence, and its impact on everyday life. The ICIQ is a brief and robust questionnaire that will be of use in outcomes and epidemiological research as well as routine clinical practice. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.20041", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2060139124", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: The panel searched the MEDLINE data base for all articles through 1993 on surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence. Outcomes data were extracted from articles accepted after panel review. The data were then meta-analyzed to produce outcome estimates for alternative surgical procedures. Results: The data indicate that after 48 months retropubic suspensions and slings appear to be more efficacious than transvaginal suspensions, and also more efficacious than anterior repairs. The literature suggests higher complication rates when synthetic materials are used for slings. Conclusions: The panel found sufficient acceptable long-term outcomes data (longer than 48 months) to conclude that surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence is effective, offering a long-term cure in a significant percentage of women. The evidence supports surgery as initial therapy and as a secondary form of therapy after failure of other treatments for stress urinary incontinence. Retropubic suspensions and slings are the most efficacious procedures for long-term success (based on cure/dry rates). However, in the panel's opinion retropubic suspensions and sling procedures are associated with slightly higher complication rates, including longer convalescence and postoperative voiding dysfunction.

The Massachusetts Male Aging Study was a community based, random sample observational survey of noninstitutionalized men 40 to 70 years old conducted from 1987 to 1989 in cities and towns near Boston, Massachusetts. Blood samples, physiological measures, socio-demographic variables, psychological indexes, and information on health status, medications, smoking and lifestyle were collected by trained interviewers in the subject’s home. A self-administered sexual activity questionnaire was used to characterize erectile potency. The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate and complete impotence was 52%. The prevalence of complete impotence tripled from 5 to 15% between subject ages 40 and 70 years. Subject age was the variable most strongly associated with impotence. After adjustment for age, a higher probability of impotence was directly correlated with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, associated medications, and indexes of anger and depression, and inversely correlated with serum dehydroepiandrosterone, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and an index of dominant personality. Cigarette smoking was associated with a greater probability of complete impotence in men with heart disease and hypertension. We conclude that impotence is a major health concern in light of the high prevalence, is strongly associated with age, has multiple determinants, including some risk factors for vascular disease, and may be due partly to modifiable para-aging phenomena. © 1994 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byChen T, Li S and Eisenberg M

Materials and Methods: A cohort of 2,115 men 40 to 79 years old was randomly selected from an enumeration of the Olmsted County, Minnesota population (55% response rate). Participants completed a previously validated baseline questionnaire that assessed symptom severity, and voided into a portable urometer to measure peak urinary flow rates. A 25% random subsample underwent transrectal sonographic imaging of the prostate to determine prostate volume. Followup was performed through a retrospective review of community medical records to determine the occurrence of acute urinary retention in the subsequent 4 years. Results: During the 8,344 person-years of followup 57 men had a first episode of acute urinary retention (incidence 6.8/1,000 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2, 8.9). Among men with no to mild symptoms (American Urological Association symptom index score 7 or less) the incidence of acute urinary retention increased from 2.6/1,000 person-years among men 40 to 49 years old to 9.3/1,000 person-years among men 70 to 79 years old. By contrast, rates increased from 3.0/1,000 person-years for men 40 to 49 years old to 34.7/1,000 person-years among men 70 to 79 years old among men with moderate to severe symptoms (American Urological Association symptom index score greater than 7). Men with depressed peak urinary flow rate (less than 12 ml. per second) were at 4 times the risk of acute urinary retention compared with men with urinary flow rates greater than 12 ml. per second (95% CI 2.3, 6.6). Men with an enlarged prostate (greater than 30 ml.) experienced a 3-fold increase in risk (95% CI 1.0, 9.0, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Lower urinary tract symptoms, depressed peak urinary flow rates, enlarged prostates and older age are associated with an increased risk of acute urinary retention in community dwelling men. These findings may help to identify men at increased risk of acute urinary retention in whom closer evaluation may be warranted.

The sample provided 80% power to detect unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.4 for diagnoses of 5% prevalence per 1-SD change in BPA concentration, or standardized regression coefficients of 0.075 for liver enzyme concentrations, at a significance level of P &lt; .05.<h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3>Chronic disease diagnoses plus blood markers of liver function, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and lipid changes.<h3>Results</h3>Higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with cardiovascular diagnoses in age-, sex-, and fully adjusted models (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.63; P = .001 with full adjustment). Higher BPA concentrations were also associated with diabetes (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.60; P &lt; .001) but not with other studied common diseases. In addition, higher BPA concentrations were associated with clinically abnormal concentrations of the liver enzymes γ-glutamyltransferase (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.46; P &lt; .001) and alkaline phosphatase (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-1.85; P = .002).<h3>Conclusion</h3>Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, may be associated with avoidable morbidity in the community-dwelling adult population.Published online September 16, 2008 (doi:10.1001/jama.300.11.1303).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.300.11.1303", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2108900261", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, we examined the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and all-cause mortality and mortality caused by cardiovascular (CV) disease and non-CV disease in the general population.In the period 1997 to 1998, all inhabitants of the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, aged between 28 and 75 years (n=85 421) were sent a postal questionnaire collecting information about risk factors for CV disease and CV morbidity and a vial to collect an early morning urine sample for measurement of urinary albumin concentration (UAC). The vital status of the cohort was subsequently obtained from the municipal register, and the cause of death was obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Of these 85 421 subjects, 40 856 (47.8%) responded, and 40 548 could be included in the analysis. During a median follow-up period of 961 days (maximum 1139 days), 516 deaths with known cause were recorded. We found a positive dose-response relationship between increasing UAC and mortality. A higher UAC increased the risk of both CV and non-CV death after adjustment for other well-recognized CV risk factors, with the increase being significantly higher for CV mortality than for non-CV mortality (P=0.014). A 2-fold increase in UAC was associated with a relative risk of 1.29 for CV mortality (95% CI 1.18 to 1.40) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.21) for non-CV mortality.Urinary albumin excretion is a predictor of all-cause mortality in the general population. The excess risk was more attributable to death from CV causes, independent of the effects of other CV risk factors, and the relationship was already apparent at levels of albuminuria currently considered to be normal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.0000031732.78052.81", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123831918", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1991274401", "title": "Postoperative Urinary Retention", "text": "Urinary retention is common after anesthesia and surgery, reported incidence of between 5% and 70%. Comorbidities, type of surgery, and type of anesthesia influence the development of postoperative urinary retention (POUR). The authors review the overall incidence and mechanisms of POUR associated with surgery, anesthesia and analgesia. Ultrasound has been shown to provide an accurate assessment of urinary bladder volume and a guide to the management of POUR. Recommendations for urinary catheterization in the perioperative setting vary widely, influenced by many factors, including surgical factors, type of anesthesia, comorbidities, local policies, and personal preferences. Inappropriate management of POUR may be responsible for bladder overdistension, urinary tract infection, and catheter-related complications. An evidence-based approach to prevention and management of POUR during the perioperative period is proposed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31819f7aea", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991274401", "source": "openalex"}

Setting A tertiary referral Urogynaecology unit at King's College Hospital, London Design The questionnaire was designed following six different pilot studies; in this study it was tested for validity and reliability using standard psychometric techniques. The questionnaire was used in 293 consecutive women referred for investigation of urinary incontinence. Results The questionnaire was shown to be reliable both by test‐retest analysis and by measurement of its internal consistency. The construct of the questionnaire and the answers by respondents confirmed its face and content validity. Criterion validity was measured by correlation with scores obtained on a validated generic measure of quality of life, the Short Form 36. Women with detrusor instability had greater quality of life impairment than women with other urodynamic diagnoses. Conclusion The questionnaire was easy for the women to use and was a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of quality of life in women with urinary incontinence. It will be useful for the rapid appraisal and follow up of women with urinary incontinence in many different clinical settings, including the evaluation of new treatments of urinary incontinence in controlled clinical trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11006.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023110392", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2133306969", "title": "The Female Urinary Microbiome: a Comparison of Women with and without Urgency Urinary Incontinence", "text": "Bacterial DNA and live bacteria have been detected in human urine in the absence of clinical infection, challenging the prevailing dogma that urine is normally sterile. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a poorly understood urinary condition characterized by symptoms that overlap urinary infection, including urinary urgency and increased frequency with urinary incontinence. The recent discovery of the urinary microbiome warrants investigation into whether bacteria contribute to UUI. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to classify bacterial DNA and expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) techniques to isolate live bacteria in urine collected by using a transurethral catheter from women with UUI and, in comparison, a cohort without UUI. For these cohorts, we demonstrated that the UUI and non-UUI urinary microbiomes differ by group based on both sequence and culture evidences. Compared to the non-UUI microbiome, sequencing experiments revealed that the UUI microbiome was composed of increased Gardnerella and decreased Lactobacillus. Nine genera (Actinobaculum, Actinomyces, Aerococcus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Gardnerella, Oligella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were more frequently cultured from the UUI cohort. Although Lactobacillus was isolated from both cohorts, distinctions existed at the species level, with Lactobacillus gasseri detected more frequently in the UUI cohort and Lactobacillus crispatus most frequently detected in controls. Combined, these data suggest that potentially important differences exist in the urinary microbiomes of women with and without UUI, which have strong implications in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of UUI. Importance: New evidence indicates that the human urinary tract contains microbial communities; however, the role of these communities in urinary health remains to be elucidated. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a highly prevalent yet poorly understood urinary condition characterized by urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. Given the significant overlap of UUI symptoms with those of urinary tract infections, it is possible that UUI may have a microbial component. We compared the urinary microbiomes of women affected by UUI to those of a comparison group without UUI, using both high-throughput sequencing and extended culture techniques. We identified statistically significant differences in the frequency and abundance of bacteria present. These differences suggest a potential role for the urinary microbiome in female urinary health.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01283-14", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133306969", "source": "openalex"}

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children by age, gender, race, and circumcision status.MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles about pediatric urinary tract infection. Search terms included urinary tract infection, cystitis, pyelonephritis, prevalence and incidence. We included articles in our review if they contained data on the prevalence of UTI in children 0-19 years of age presenting with symptoms of UTI. Of the 51 articles with data on UTI prevalence, 18 met all inclusion criteria. Two evaluators independently reviewed, rated, and abstracted data from each article.Among infants presenting with fever, the overall prevalence (and 95% confidence interval) of UTI was 7.0% (CI: 5.5-8.4). The pooled prevalence rates of febrile UTIs in females aged 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, and >12 months was 7.5%, 5.7%, 8.3%, and 2.1% respectively. Among febrile male infants less than 3 months of age, 2.4% (CI: 1.4-3.5) of circumcised males and 20.1% (CI: 16.8-23.4) of uncircumcised males had a UTI. For the 4 studies that reported UTI prevalence by race, UTI rates were higher among white infants 8.0% (CI: 5.1-11.0) than among black infants 4.7% (CI: 2.1-7.3). Among older children (<19 years) with urinary symptoms, the pooled prevalence of UTI (both febrile and afebrile) was 7.8% (CI: 6.6-8.9).Prevalence rates of UTI varied by age, gender, race, and circumcision status.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2136066292", "title": "Identification of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin as a Novel Early Urinary Biomarker for Ischemic Renal Injury", "text": "ABSTRACT. Acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to ischemic injury remains a common and potentially devastating problem. A transcriptome-wide interrogation strategy was used to identify renal genes that are induced very early after renal ischemia, whose protein products might serve as novel biomarkers for ARF. Seven genes that are upregulated >10-fold were identified, one of which (Cyr61) has recently been reported to be induced after renal ischemia. Unexpectedly, the induction of the other six transcripts was novel to the ARF field. In this study, one of these previously unrecognized genes was further characterized, namely neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), because it is a small secreted polypeptide that is protease resistant and consequently might be readily detected in the urine. The marked upregulation of NGAL mRNA and protein levels in the early postischemic mouse kidney was confirmed. NGAL protein expression was detected predominantly in proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive proximal tubule cells, in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution that co-localized with markers of late endosomes. NGAL was easily detected in the urine in the very first urine output after ischemia in both mouse and rat models of ARF. The appearance of NGAL in the urine was related to the dose and duration of renal ischemia and preceded the appearance of other urinary markers such as N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and β2-microglobulin. The origin of NGAL from tubule cells was confirmed in cultured human proximal tubule cells subjected to in vitro ischemic injury, where NGAL mRNA was rapidly induced in the cells and NGAL protein was readily detectable in the culture medium within 1 h of mild ATP depletion. NGAL was also easily detectable in the urine of mice with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, again preceding the appearance of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and β2-microglobulin. The results indicate that NGAL may represent an early, sensitive, noninvasive urinary biomarker for ischemic and nephrotoxic renal injury.

Materials and Methods: The time from operation until urinary continence was achieved was determined by chart review and questionnaire in 581 patients who were continent before undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1983 and 1994. Using univariate and multivariate analyses of data gathered prospectively, we examined risk factors associated with incontinence in these patients. Results: The actuarial rate of urinary continence at 24 months was 91 percent for the entire patient populations and 95 percent for those treated after 1990. Many factors were associated with the risk of incontinence in univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (patient age and weight, degree of obstructive voiding symptoms, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, clinical stage, intraoperative blood loss, resection of neurovascular bundles, postoperative anastomotic stricture and technique of vesicourethral anastomosis). However, in a multivariate analysis the factors that were independently associated with increased chance of regaining continence were decreasing age, a modification in the technique of anastomosis (introduced in 1990), preservation of both neurovascular bundles and absence of an anastomotic stricture. With introduction of the new surgical technique in 1990 the median time to continence decreased from 5.6 to 1.5 months and the rate of continence at 24 months increased from 82 to 95 percent. Conclusions: While the risk of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy is related to the uncontrollable factor of patient age, it is also sensitive to the surgical technique used.

Its ability to contract over a large length interval and to relax determines the bladder function during filling and micturition. These processes are regulated by several external nervous and hormonal control systems, and the detrusor contains multiple receptors and signaling pathways. Functional changes of the detrusor can be found in several clinically important conditions, e.g., lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction. The aim of this review is to summarize and synthesize basic information and recent advances in the understanding of the properties of the detrusor smooth muscle, its contractile system, cellular signaling, membrane properties, and cellular receptors.

The prevalence of incontinence known to the health and social service agencies was 0.2% in women and 0.1% in men aged 15-64 and 2.5% in women and 1.3% in men aged 65 and over. The postal survey, to which 89% of the people whose correct address was known replied, showed a prevalence of urinary incontinence of 8.5% in women and 1.6% in men aged 15-64 and 11.6% in women and 6.9% in men aged 65 and over. Nulliparous women had a lower prevalence than those who had had one, two, or three babies, but within the parity range of one to three there were no differences in prevalence. The prevalence was appreciably increased in women who had had four or more babies. Incontinence was moderate or severe in a fifth of those who reported it in the postal survey, of whom less than a third were receiving health or social services for the condition. Incontinence is a common symptom, and many unrecognised cases appear to exist.

Among men who were potent before surgery, the proportion of men reporting impotence at 18 or more months after surgery varied according to whether the procedure was nerve sparing (65.6% of non–nerve-sparing, 58.6% of unilateral, and 56.0% of bilateral nerve–sparing). At 18 or more months after surgery, 41.9% reported that their sexual performance was a moderate-to-large problem. Both sexual and urinary function varied by age (39.0% of men aged &lt;60 years vs 15.3%-21.7% of older men were potent at ≥18 months [P&lt;.001]; 13.8% of men aged 75-79 years vs 0.7%-3.6% of younger men experienced the highest level of incontinence at ≥18 months [P = .03]), and sexual function also varied by race (38.4% of black men reported firm erections at ≥18 months vs 25.9% of Hispanic and 21.3% of white men; P = .001).ConclusionsOur study suggests that radical prostatectomy is associated with significant erectile dysfunction and some decline in urinary function.

Few prevalence studies used current ICS LUTS symptom definitions and to our knowledge no studies exist that estimate total worldwide prevalence of reported LUTS symptoms. One of the primary goals of this analysis was to estimate current and future worldwide prevalence of LUTS among adults. Our estimation model suggests that LUTS are highly prevalent worldwide, with an increasing burden predicted over time. OBJECTIVE • To estimate and predict worldwide and regional prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), overactive bladder (OAB), urinary incontinence (UI) and LUTS suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction (LUTS/BOO) in 2008, 2013 and 2018 based on current International Continence Society symptom definitions in adults aged ≥20 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS • Numbers and prevalence of individuals affected by each condition were calculated with an estimation model using gender‐ and age‐stratified prevalence data from the EPIC study along with gender‐ and age‐stratified worldwide and regional population estimates from the US Census Bureau International Data Base. RESULTS • An estimated 45.2%, 10.7%, 8.2% and 21.5% of the 2008 worldwide population (4.3 billion) was affected by at least one LUTS, OAB, UI and LUTS/BOO, respectively. By 2018, an estimated 2.3 billion individuals will be affected by at least one LUTS (18.4% increase), 546 million by OAB (20.1%), 423 million by UI (21.6%) and 1.1 billion by LUTS/BOO (18.5%). • The regional burden of these conditions is estimated to be greatest in Asia, with numbers of affected individuals expected to increase most in the developing regions of Africa (30.1–31.1% increase across conditions, 2008–2018), South America (20.5–24.7%) and Asia (19.7–24.4%). CONCLUSIONS • This model suggests that LUTS, OAB, UI and LUTS/BOO are highly prevalent conditions worldwide. Numbers of affected individuals are projected to increase with time, with the greatest increase in burden anticipated in developing regions. • There are important worldwide public‐health and clinical management implications to be considered over the next decade to effectively prevent and manage these conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2010.09993.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1575778540", "source": "openalex"}

Among them are the abundant and widely distributed disulfide-linked cationic antimicrobial peptides found in both the plant and animal kingdoms. Generally, these peptides exhibit a broad range of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. Plants produce many cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides including thionins, plant defensins, and the cysteine rich Ib-AMP 1–4 (1Zhang Y. Lewis K. FEMS Microbiol.

In insects, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are produced in the fat body (functional homologue of the mammalian liver) and transcriptionally induced and released into the hemolymph in response to infection or injury. These include insect defensins, heliomicin, drosomycin, and thanatin (4Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol.

Vandenbulcke F. Noel T. Romestand B. Beauvillain J.C. Salzet M. Roch P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2759-2769PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, similar antimicrobial peptides include α- and β-defensins and protegrins (9Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Like the insect fat body, the vertebrate liver is also centrally involved in innate immune response to infection. The “acute phase” response to infection or inflammation is a pattern of increased hepatic synthesis of many secreted proteins involved in host defense and the selective suppression of synthesis of other secreted proteins. In contrast to the abundant fat body-derived antimicrobial peptides of insects, no vertebrate antimicrobial peptides originating in the liver have been described to date. In this work, we report the discovery of a novel hepatic antimicrobial peptide, hepcidin, whose processed form is found in urine. Cationic peptides were extracted from pooled urine of one to five healthy donors using methods that we described previously for the isolation of human β-defensin-1 (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, urine was filtered to remove cells and extracted with the weak cation exchange matrix CM Macroprep (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Cationic peptides were eluted with 5% acetic acid and further purified by RP-HPLC1 (Waters Model 626; Waters, Milford, MA) on a Vydac C18 column (218TP510) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile (ACN) gradient of 4% ACN increment/min for 5 min and washed with 20% ACN for 5 min, followed by a 0.5% ACN increment/min for the last 30 min (12Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HPLC peak fractions were analyzed by acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and peptide masses were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS (UCLA Mass Spectrometry Facility (Los Angeles, CA) or Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA)). Purified hepcidin was modified by reduction and carboxymethylation before amino acid sequencing. Lyophilized peptide was resuspended in reduction and alkylation buffer (0.5 m Tris buffer, pH 8, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 20 mm EDTA) to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reduction was accomplished by the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (DTT), and the solution was overlaid with N2 gas and then incubated at 52 °C for 2.5 h. Fresh DTT (500-molar excess) was added and incubated for an additional hour at 52 °C. The solution was cooled to room temperature for 10 min, and iodoacetamide freshly dissolved in reduction and alkylation buffer was added to a final concentration of 3-fold molar excess over DTT and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of DTT (1500-fold molar excess of the peptide). The peptide was then purified on a C18 RP-HPLC column equilibrated in 0.1% h-heptafluorobutyric acid (v/v). Peptides were eluted using linear ACN gradients at a flow rate of 3 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 230 and 280 nm as follows: 1% ACN increment/min for 20 min, followed by a 0.5% increment/min for the last 60 min. HPLC fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 5% acetic acid, and the peak fraction (32–35% ACN) was submitted for amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation at the UCLA Peptide Sequencing Facility. CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was dissolved either in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, alone or in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of trifluoroethylene:phosphate buffer. Peptide solutions were scanned in 0.1 mm light path demountable cells over a 270 nm to 185 nm wavelength range at 10 nm/min and a sample interval of 0.2 nm. An initial search of the protein data base showed no homology of hepcidin to any known protein. Therefore, the primary amino acid sequence was reverse translated and searched against the GenBankTM human EST data base using the BLAST (tblastn) nucleic acid search program (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60239) Google Scholar). A matching cDNA clone (American Type Culture Collection yb44e08.r1, clone 74054; GenBankTM accession number T48277) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The plasmid clone was transformed and amplified in Bluescript Escherichia coli(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Valencia, CA). The sequence of the 5′ end of the cDNA was determined using Marathon-Ready cDNA from a liver library (CLONTECH). The gene-specific primers for hepcidin are antisense (for 5′-RACE) 5′-CCCAAGACCTATGTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGTCTGGCTGTCCCACTGCTGG-3′ and sense (for 3′ RACE) 5′-CATGTTCCAGAGGCGAAGG-3′. PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR product was sequenced using an ABI Prism DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the UCLA Sequencing Facility. The Omiga program (Oxford Molecular Co.) was used to analyze and search for potential consensus sites within the gene. The hepcidin cDNA clone and the gene-specific primers above were used in the PCR reaction to generate a 173-base pair product from a segment of the coding region. The PCR product was used to probeCLONTECH organ blot membranes as described previously (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The organ blots contained poly(A) selected human mRNA from spleen, thymus, appendix, peripheral blood leukocyte, bone marrow, fetal liver, heart, brain, placenta, lung, adult liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, stomach, thyroid, spinal cord, lymph node, trachea, adrenal gland, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon. Frozen normal human liver blocks obtained from the UCLA Human Tissue Resource Center (Los Angeles, CA) were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 0.1 g of tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) RNA was separated from the total RNA preparation using a Qiagen Oligotex mRNA isolation kit. Purified poly(A) RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel (Bio-Rad) containing 3.3% formalin in 10 mm NaPO4, transferred onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and hybridized with a radioactive probe as described above. The 20- and 25-amino acid forms of hepcidin (Hepc20 and Hepc25), each of which was homogeneous by electrophoretic and mass spectrum analysis, were quantified by UV absorbance at 215 and 220 nm using the formula concentration (mg/ml) = (A 215 −A 225) × 0.144, and they were tested for antimicrobial activity against bacterial strains (E. coliML35p, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus) and yeast (Candida albicans) in a CFU assay as described previously (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Culture densities were measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm for bacterial strains and at 450 nm for yeast and then resuspended to a final concentration of 106 CFU/ml. AnA 620 reading of 0.2 corresponds to 107 CFU/ml for the staphylococcal and streptococcal strains and 5 × 107 CFU/ml for E. coli. AnA 450 reading of 1.0 is equivalent to 2.86 × 107 CFU/ml for C. albicans. The organisms were incubated with various concentrations of peptide at 37 °C with constant shaking for 1, 3, and 24 h. Surviving microbes were plated in triplicate on trypticase soy broth plates (Microdiagnostic Products Inc., Lombard, IL) using a spiral plating system (Spiral Biotech, Bethesda, MD). In some experiments, the assay medium was supplemented with 100 mm NaCl to mimic higher salt conditions characteristic of blood plasma. The two human clinical isolates of filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus andAspergillus niger used in this assay were a generous gift from Dr. Dexter Howard (UCLA Department of Microbiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Spores were harvested as described previously (15Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 69: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar). The glycerol stocks of spores from each strain were utilized in a spectrophotometric germination assay as follows: spores were diluted to a concentration of 1.25 × 104 /ml in culture medium (half-strength potato dextrose broth (BBL), 10 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml cefotaxime (Life Technologies, Inc.). Eighty μl of each spore suspension was placed in sterile flat-bottomed polystyrene 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY), and 20 μl of peptide or peptide diluent (water) was added to yield a final spore concentration of 104 /ml. The plate was incubated at 30 °C in a humidified chamber in the dark. Germination was microscopically monitored for the appearance of hyphae using a light microscope. After 48 h, the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using a SpectraMAX250 EIA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To test for activity in high salt conditions, the assay medium was supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. To determine whether the effect of hepcidin was fungicidal or fungistatic, spores were incubated in the presence of Hepc20 and Hepc25 at the highest concentrations necessary to inhibit germination as described above. After 48 h at 30 °C, the well contents were transferred to sterile microfuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant containing the peptides was removed, and the spore pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of fresh media and transferred into a new 96-well plate. The spores were incubated for an additional 48 h at 30 °C and then analyzed for germination as described above. If no hyphae were observed, then the effect of hepcidin was judged to be fungicidal. K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection leukemic cell line CCL-243) were cultured in RPMI 1640 withl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 48 h and then washed and resuspended to 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 media. A volume of 50 μl of cells was aliquoted into sterile flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY). Various concentrations of 10× peptide stocks were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 12–16 h. Viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Peptide synthesis reagents including Fmoc amino acids (AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA) and coupling solvents (PE Biosystems, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to synthesize Hepc20 peptide on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using double coupling for all residues. The scale of synthesis was 0.25 mmol using a FastMocTM strategy (16Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar) with PS-PEG resin (PE Perceptive Biosystems, Connecticut Path, MA). After cleavage, the crude synthetic peptide (sHEP) was resuspended in reducing buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.02 mEDTA, and 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.07) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (w/v), homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated in a 50 °C sonicating water bath for 30 min. The resuspended peptide was reduced by adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.01 m, overlaying with N2gas, and then incubating in a 50 °C water bath overnight. The reduced peptide was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, desalted with 15% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 40% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 40% ACN fraction was lyophilized and then further purified by RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column using the same gradient program as described above in purification of the native peptide from urine. The major peak was lyophilized, resuspended to 0.03 mg/ml with distilled H2O, adjusted to pH 7.5 with ammonium hydroxide, and then air-oxidized in an open vessel at room temperature with stirring for 18 h. The refolded peptide was then purified on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge followed by RP-HPLC as described for the reduced peptide. Cationic proteins were extracted from urine using a weak cation exchange resin and then further purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1), and hepcidin peaks were identified by characteristically migrating bands in Coomassie Blue-stained acid-urea PAGE. The fractions corresponding to the hepcidin peptides eluted between 24% and 30% acetonitrile. The identity of each peptide in peaks A andB of Fig. 1 was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and amino acid sequencing. The peptides were 20 and 25 amino acids long (Hepc20 and Hepc25, respectively) and differed by amino-terminal truncation but preserved the cysteine-rich domain (Fig.2). Mass analysis identified the peptide in peak C of Fig. 1 as the 22-amino acid form (Hepc22). The mass data (Table I) indicate that all 8 cysteine residues are connected by disulfide bonds. In urine, Hepc20 and Hepc25 are the major forms, whereas Hepc22 is a minor species. Collectively, the concentration of hepcidin ranges between 10 and 30 μg/liter (4–12 nm) in urine from normal donors. The remaining large peaks visible in Fig. 1 had previously been identified as variably amino-terminal-truncated forms of another antimicrobial peptide, human β-defensin-1 (11Valore E.V. Park C.H.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar).Figure 2Amino acid sequence of hepcidin and proposed cysteine connectivity. Purified hepcidin was carboxymethylated and then sequenced by Edman degradation. The three processed forms differ by amino-terminal truncation as denoted by arrows. The proposed cysteine linkage pattern is 1-4, 2-8, 3-7, and 5-6, as shown. The cationic residues are indicated by asterisks(∗).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICharacteristics of hepcidin peaks A-CHPLC peakAmino acid residuesMALDI-TOF massCalculated average massApproximate concentration in normal urineDaDaμg/lA2021922191.7710B2527892789.4010C2224362436.064 Open table in a new tab The CD spectra (Fig.3) in phosphate-buffered saline solution (100 mm sodium chloride and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and the structure-promoting solvent system trifluoroethanol-20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (trifluoroethylene:buffer, 1:1, v:v), were consistent with a structure that has a series of β-turns, loops, and distorted β-sheets. Membranes preloaded with human organ tissue poly(A) selected mRNA were probed with a 173-base pair probe generated by PCR from the cDNA clone. mRNA was found to be highly expressed in fetal and adult liver, with a much lower signal detected in the heart and spinal cord (Fig.4). A fourth membrane loaded with prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon was also probed, but no signal was detected (data not shown). A weak mRNA signal corresponding to 2.37 kilobases was seen in fetal and adult liver and spinal cord but was not further analyzed. Although the peptide was found in the urine, the mRNA was not detectable in the kidney or the bladder. A search of the protein data base revealed no sequence homology to any known peptides. Using the primary sequence of the peptide, the BLAST (tblastn) nucleic acid search program of the human EST data base identified a cDNA clone that spans the region of the peptide from Asp40 to Thr84(I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone 74054; DNA GenBankTMaccession number T48277; EST yb44e08) (17Hillier L.D. Lennon G. Becker M. Bonaldo M.F. Chiapelli B. Chissoe S. Dietrich N. DuBuque T. Favello A. Gish W. Hawkins M. Hultman M. Kucaba T. Lacy M. Le M. Le N. Mardis E. Moore B. Morris M. Parsons J. Prange C. Rifkin L. Rohlfing T. Schellenberg K. Marra M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 807-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). An identical genomic sequence match was found on human chromosome 19 (GenBankTMaccession number AD000684; locus CH19R30879). In addition, a search of EST data bases found matches to cDNA sequences from the liver of pig, rat, mouse, flounder, and the long-jawed mudsucker (Fig.5). All of the matches are to peptides that have yet to be isolated and characterized. The similarity is strongest in the region that corresponds to the peptides isolated from urine, namely, residues Arg55 to Thr84. The PCR products of the 5′ RACE reaction were sequenced and compared with the genomic sequence (Fig.6). The mRNA, 0.4 kilobase in length (GenBankTM accession numbers AAG23966 for cDNA and P81172 for the corresponding hepcidin precursor), matched the estimated size on the Northern blot. The gene consists of three exons and two introns, and the third exon encodes the sequence of the peptides found in urine. The putative unprocessed peptide encoded by all three exons would be 84 amino acid residues long. A potential signal-peptide cleavage site between Gly24 and Ser25 would generate a 60-amino acid propeptide species. Consensus sites for myristylation sites and phosphorylation sites occur on Gly44 and Thr24, respectively. In addition, a potential furin cleavage site is found at Arg59 (18Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Since our initial studies, additional human EST sequences have appeared in the GenBankTM data bases (GenBankTMaccession numbers AI937227, AI829866, and AI797446) with minor sequence variations in the noncoding regions. The colony-forming unit assay (19Porter E.M. van Dam E. Valore E.V. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of purified hepcidin forms against various microbial strains. In the initial screen, all the strains were tested against 30 μm Hepc20 and Hepc25 (Hepc22 was not tested because it is present in small concentrations in the urine). Both peptides were antimicrobial against E. coliML35p and, to a lesser extent, against S. epidermidis,S. aureus, C. albicans, and group BStreptococcus, but both were inactive againstPseudomonas aeruginosa (Fig.7). A dose-response CFU assay performed against E. coli and S. epidermidis showed that both hepcidin peptides were microbicidal at the highest concentration of 30 μm against both strains (data not shown). In this assay and in the initial screen, Hepc20 was more active than Hepc25; however, both peptides were inhibited by the addition of 100 mm NaCl to the assay mixture. Spores of two human pathogenic strains of A. fumigatus and A. niger were subjected to a germination assay (Fig.8). Hepc20 was more potent than Hepc25 against both strains. Hepc20 was antifungal against A. niger, where no hyphae were detected after 48 h at 20 μm, but 40 μm was required against the more resistant strain, A. fumigatus. Hepc25 only retarded spore germination in A. niger at the highest concentration of 40 μm and was ineffective against A. fumigatus at the same concentration. Neither peptide was active in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. We assessed fungicidal activity by following germination after removal of the antifungal peptides and additional incubation in fresh media. No germination was observed after 48 h. At the highest concentrations, Hepc20 was fungicidal against both strains, as indicated by the lack of spore germination in fresh medium. Hepc25 did not exhibit fungicidal activity at any concentration used in this assay. To test for cytotoxic effects of hepcidin, K562 cells were assessed for viability after incubation with Hepc20 and Hepc25, using trypan blue as an indicator of membrane integrity. At the highest concentration of 30 μm, cells incubated for 15 h in the presence of Hepc20 or Hepc25 were 88% and 74% viable, respectively. When cells were treated with 30 μmhuman α-defensin HNP-1, only 9% viable cells remained at the end of the incubation period. Thus, hepcidin is not cytotoxic at a concentration that is ∼3000-fold higher than that found in the urine. Crude synthetic material was completely reduced with DTT and purified by RP-HPLC. The major HPLC peaks were analyzed by AU-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. As expected, the peptide migrated more slowly upon reduction. The gain of 8 Da corresponding to eight additional hydrogen atoms in MALDI-MS confirmed that the synthetic peptide was completely reduced. The reduced peptide was refolded by air oxidation and compared with the native peptide. The synthetic Hepc20 had identical AU-PAGE migration, eluted identically in C18 RP-HPLC, and had an identical electrospray mass and antimicrobial activity against E. coliin a CFU assay compared with native Hepc20. We report here the first member of a new vertebrate family of small antimicrobial peptides that contain 8 cysteine residues and are active against both bacteria and fungi. Hepcidin mRNA encodes a larger precursor and is found primarily in the liver, but the peptides were first discovered in and isolated from urine. The native peptide was purified from human urine by cation exchange chromatography and RP-HPLC and characterized by amino acid sequencing, MALDI-TOF-MS, and CD spectroscopy. The human hepcidin forms, 2–3 kDa in size, have an overall charge of +3 at neutral pH and are only 20–25 amino acids in length (8 of these amino acids are cysteine residues (∼30% cysteine)). Mass spectrometry data confirm all 8 cysteines to be engaged in four intramolecular disulfide bonds. The symmetric arrangement of pairs of cysteines around a cationic segment (HRSK) resembles that of antimicrobial protegrins and tachyplesins, peptides that have a two-strand β-sheet structure stabilized by interstrand disulfide bonds. Based on this similarity and on preliminary molecular models, we propose the following cysteine connectivity pattern: 1-4, 2-8, 3-7, and 5-6 (Fig. 2). This arrangement of disulfide bonds exhibits three possible β-turns and provides a fold with the least steric hindrance among the side chains. The proposed disulfide connectivity pattern makes the hepcidin structure similar to the “cystine knot” class of antimicrobial peptides (20Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7159-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cDNA structure suggests that the peptide is translated as an 84-amino acid prepropeptide that is amino-terminally processed to the 20- to 25-amino acid peptide (Fig. 6). A strong consensus sequence (score = 16.45 using the PC Gene program) for a signal sequence cleavage site is located between Gly24 and Ser25 that would produce a 60-residue propeptide. Another likely processing site is carboxyl-terminal to Arg59, a consensus site for the subtilisin/kexin family of mammalian propeptide processing enzymes (propeptide convertases) with a preference for cleavage after the paired basic residues Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg. Among other functions, the propeptide convertases cleave propeptides to generate one or more bioactive peptides from a single precursor (18Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The abundance of propeptide convertases in the liver may explain our inability to isolate the larger propeptide from native sources (liver tissue, bile, and blood serum). The small size of hepcidin, its conservation between animal species, and its compact folding pattern may account for our difficulties in producing a useful antibody. A search of the protein data base revealed no homology to hepcidin in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, searching the EST data base revealed liver cDNA homologues in pig, rat, mouse, flounder, and the long-jawed mudsucker (Fig. 5). All 8 cysteine residues are conserved with particularly strong sequence similarity in residues 60–84 that encompass the processed forms isolated from the urine. It is noteworthy that the putative propeptide convertase cleavage sites are also conserved. In humans, the paired basic residues are Arg-Arg, whereas the other homologues have the same recognition sequence or an alternative recognition sequence of Lys-Arg. It is possible that if the proregion is cleaved from the precursor as a single peptide, it could also have a biological function. To test this possibility, the proregion (Ser25-Arg59) was synthesized, and an antibody reactive with the synthetic peptide was produced (Research Genetics). Preliminary data utilizing the synthetic propiece peptide have shown that it exhibits an antibacterial activity equally potent to that of Hepc20 and Hepc25 (data not shown). However, a Western blot analysis capable of detecting 500 ng of the synthetic peptide did not detect the propiece peptide in cationic extracts of urine, serum, liver extract, and bile (data not shown), making it unlikely that this form is stable and abundant. Acid liver extracts did contain a peptide with a mass identical to Hepc25 that eluted at the same acetonitrile concentration as Hepc25 from urine. While this study was under review, we noted an interim report that an antimicrobial peptide identical to Hepc25, LEAP-1, was isolated from human plasma ultrafiltrate (22Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J. Schulz A. Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Adermann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The presence of Hepc25 in ultrafiltrate suggests that the peptide originating in the liver reaches the kidney in blood plasma. Hepcidin may be the functional homologue of the insect defensin-like peptide drosomycin. Hepcidin is expressed in human liver, whereas drosomycin is found in the fat body (the liver equivalent) ofDrosophila; both peptides have four disulfide bonds, and both are potent antifungal peptides. In parallel studies, Pigeonet al. 2Pigeon, C., Ilyin, G., Courselaud, B., Leroyer, P., Turlin, B., Brissot, P., and Loreal, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,7811–7819 identified a murine hepcidin as a hepatic mRNA inducible in vivo by iron overload and lipopolysaccharide. The ability of lipopolysaccharide to increase hepcidin mRNA in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes is consistent with the proposed role of hepcidin in inflammation and host defense. Like hepcidin, drosomycin is expressed constitutively but is also inducible upon microbial challenge. Like drosomycin, both Hepc20 and Hepc25 forms inhibit spore germination in the two pathogenic strains of Aspergillus tested. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether hepcidin, like the cysteine-rich antimicrobial defensins (23Yang D. Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J. Shogan J. Anderson M. Schroder J.M. Wang J.M. Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J.

Participants were evaluated on 2 occasions approximately 3 years apart. Of the participants 58% reported urine loss at some time and 30.7% reported incontinence on a regular basis at least once per month. During 3 years the cumulative incidence of regular incontinence in previously continent women was 8.0%. Among those with regular incontinence 64.9% said the volume of loss was 1 or 2 drops, while 35.1% reported that they needed to change their garments. Only 25.5% of the patients had sought treatment. Continence status was significantly related to body mass index and race but not to patient age, parity, caffeine or alcohol intake, smoking, physical activity, prior gynecological surgery or several psychological variables. The results indicate that urinary incontinence is common among middle-aged women. That few seek treatment suggests a need for more information about women's attitudes toward incontinence and more attention to this problem by health care providers. © 1991 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byStewart W, Hirsh A, Kirchner H, Clarke D, Litchtenfeld M and Minassian V (2018) Urinary Incontinence Incidence: Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Factors that Explain VariationJournal of Urology, VOL. 191, NO. 4, (996-1002), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2014.Botlero R, Davis S, Urquhart D and Bell R (2011) Incidence and Resolution Rates of Different Types of Urinary Incontinence in Women: Findings From a Cohort StudyJournal of Urology, VOL. 185, NO. 4, (1331-1337), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2011.Subak L, Richter H and Hunskaar S (2009) Obesity and Urinary Incontinence: Epidemiology and Clinical Research UpdateJournal of Urology, VOL. 182, NO. 6S, (S2-S7), Online publication date: 1-Dec-2009.Dooley Y, Kenton K, Cao G, Luke A, Durazo-Arvizu R, Kramer H and Brubaker L (2018) Urinary Incontinence Prevalence: Results From the National Health and Nutrition Examination SurveyJournal of Urology, VOL. 179, NO. 2, (656-661), Online publication date: 1-Feb-2008.Fenner D, Trowbridge E, Patel D, Fultz N, Miller J, Howard D and DeLancey J (2018) Establishing the Prevalence of Incontinence Study: Racial Differences in Women's Patterns of Urinary IncontinenceJournal of Urology, VOL. 179, NO. 4, (1455-1460), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2008.Thom D, van den Eeden S, Ragins A, Wassel-Fyr C, Vittinghof E, Subak L and Brown J (2018) Differences in Prevalence of Urinary Incontinence by Race/EthnicityJournal of Urology, VOL. 175, NO. 1, (259-264), Online publication date: 1-Jan-2006.TEO R, YISA S, MAYNE C and TINCELLO D (2018) A COMPARISON OF URODYNAMIC DIAGNOSES AND DETRUSOR MUSCLE FUNCTION IN WHITE AND SOUTH INDIAN ASIAN WOMENJournal of Urology, VOL. 174, NO. 1, (184-186), Online publication date: 1-Jul-2005.LANDIS J, KAPLÅN S, SWIFT S and VERSI E (2018) Efficacy of Antimuscarinic Therapy for Overactive Bladder With Varying Degrees of Incontinence SeverityJournal of Urology, VOL. 171, NO. 2, (752-756), Online publication date: 1-Feb-2004.GARNETT S and ABRAMS P (2018) The Natural History Of The Overactive Bladder Ana Detrusor Overactivity.

Materials and Methods: We assess 143 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux that stopped spontaneously or was a surgically corrected for functional bowel and/or bladder disorders, including bladder instability, constipation and infrequent voiding, termed the dysfunctional elimination syndromes. Results: Dysfunctional elimination syndromes were present in 66 of 143 children (43%) thought to have primary vesicoureteral reflux. Of these 66 patients 54 (82%) had a breakthrough urinary tract infection and underwent reimplantation compared to only 18% without the syndromes. Of 70 children who had a breakthrough urinary tract infection dysfunctional elimination syndromes were present in 54 (77%) and absent in 16 (23%). Of the remaining 73 patients who did not have a breakthrough infection dysfunctional elimination syndromes were present in 12 (16%) and absent in 61 (84%). In children with dysfunctional elimination syndromes the resolution of reflux that was 1 grade less severe required an average of 1.6 years longer. After the disappearance of reflux, urinary tract infection developed in 18 children, including 14 (78%) with dysfunctional elimination syndromes. Unsuccessful surgical outcomes involving persistent, recurrent and contralateral reflux occurred only in children with dysfunctional elimination syndromes. Conclusions: Dysfunctional elimination syndromes are common and are often unrecognized in children with primary reflux. These syndromes are associated with delayed reflux resolution and an increased rate of breakthrough urinary tract infection, which leads to reimplantation surgery. Dysfunctional elimination syndromes also adversely affect the results of reimplantation and represent a risk for recurrent urinary tract infection after resolves. The evaluation and management of dysfunctional elimination syndromes should be an integral part of the treatment of every child with vesicoureteral reflux. Effective evaluation and treatment may be made cost-effective by decreasing the followup, the number of breakthrough urinary tract infections and the number of children requiring reimplantation.

Virulence factors of recognized importance in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) include adhesins (P fimbriae, certain other mannose-resistant adhesins, and type 1 fimbriae), the aerobactin system, hemolysin, K capsule, and resistance to serum killing. This review summarizes the virtual explosion of information regarding the epidemiology, biochemistry, mechanisms of action, and genetic basis of these urovirulence factors that has occurred in the past decade and identifies areas in need of further study. Virulence factor expression is more common among certain genetically related groups of E. coli which constitute virulent clones within the larger E. coli population. In general, the more virulence factors a strain expresses, the more severe an infection it is able to cause. Certain virulence factors specifically favor the development of pyelonephritis, others favor cystitis, and others favor asymptomatic bacteriuria. The currently defined virulence factors clearly contribute to the virulence of wild-type strains but are usually insufficient in themselves to transform an avirulent organism into a pathogen, demonstrating that other as-yet-undefined virulence properties await discovery. Virulence factor testing is a useful epidemiological and research tool but as yet has no defined clinical role. Immunological and biochemical anti-virulence factor interventions are effective in animal models of UTI and hold promise for the prevention of UTI in humans.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.4.1.80", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990731735", "source": "openalex"}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Data were collected using a postal survey which was sent to 29 500 community‐dwelling women aged ≥ 18 years in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. Subjects were asked about the type of urinary incontinence they had experienced and their treatment behaviour. RESULTS Of the women who responded, 35% reported involuntary loss of urine in the preceding 30 days; stress urinary incontinence was the most prevalent type. The lowest prevalence was in Spain (23%), while the prevalence was 44%, 41% and 42% for France, Germany and the UK, respectively. About a quarter of women with urinary incontinence in Spain (24%) and the UK (25%) had consulted a doctor about it; in France (33%) and Germany (40%) the percentages were higher. Overall, &lt; 5% of the women had ever undergone surgery for their condition. While pads were used by half of the women, there were some differences among the countries. CONCLUSIONS Millions of women in Europe have urinary incontinence; the consultation and treatment rates were low in the European countries included in this study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2003.04609.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013470197", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3184192997", "title": "Practice Parameter: The Diagnosis, Treatment, and Evaluation of the Initial Urinary Tract Infection in Febrile Infants and Young Children", "text": "To formulate recommendations for health care professionals about the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and young children (ages 2 months to 2 years).Comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature, supplemented with consensus opinion of Subcommittee members.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Quality Improvement selected a Subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in the fields of epidemiology and informatics, infectious diseases, nephrology, pediatric practice, radiology, and urology to draft the parameter. The Subcommittee, the AAP Committee on Quality Improvement, a review panel of office-based practitioners, and other groups within and outside the AAP reviewed and revised the parameter.The Subcommittee identified the population at highest risk of incurring renal damage from UTI-infants and young children with UTI and fever. A comprehensive bibliography on UTI in infants and young children was compiled. Literature was abstracted in a formal manner, and evidence tables were constructed. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed to assess various strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation.The overall problem of managing UTI in children between 2 months and 2 years of age was conceptualized as an evidence model. The model depicts the relationship between the steps in diagnosis and management of UTI. The steps are divided into the following four phases: 1) recognizing the child at risk for UTI, 2) making the diagnosis of UTI, 3) short-term treatment of UTI, and 4) evaluation of the child with UTI for possible urinary tract abnormality. Phase 1 represents the recognition of the child at risk for UTI. Age and other clinical features define a prevalence or a prior probability of UTI, determining whether the diagnosis should be pursued. Phase 2 depicts the diagnosis of UTI. Alternative diagnostic strategies may be characterized by their cost, sensitivity, and specificity. The result of testing is the division of patients into groups according to a relatively higher or lower probability of having a UTI. The probability of UTI in each of these groups depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but also on the prior probability of the UTI among the children being tested. In this way, the usefulness of a diagnostic test depends on the prior probability of UTI established in Phase 1. Phase 3 represents the short-term treatment of UTI. Alternatives for treatment of UTI may be compared, based on their likelihood of clearing the initial UTI. Phase 4 depicts the imaging evaluation of infants with the diagnosis of UTI to identify those with urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Children with VUR are believed to be at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections, resulting in hypertension and renal failure. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy or surgical procedures such as ureteral reimplantation may prevent progressive renal damage. Therefore, identifying urinary abnormalities may offer the benefit of preventing hypertension and renal failure. Because the consequences of detection and early management of UTI are affected by subsequent evaluation and long-term management and, likewise, long-term management of patients with UTI depends on how they are detected at the outset, the Subcommittee elected to analyze the entire process from detection of UTI to the evaluation for, and consequences of, urinary tract abnormalities. The full analysis of these data can be found in the technical report. History of the literature review along with evidence-tables and a comprehensive bibliography also are available in the report.

The normal prostate reaches 20 plus or minus 6 gm. in men between 21 and 30 years old, and this weight remains essentially constant with increasing age unless benign prostatic hyperplasia develops. The prevalence of pathological benign prostatic hyperplasia is only 8 per cent at the fourth decade; however, 50 per cent of the male population has pathological benign prostatic hyperplasia when they are 51 to 60 years old. The average weight of a prostate that is recognized at autopsy to contain benign prostatic hyperplasia is 33 plus or minus 16 gm. Only 4 per cent of the prostates in men more than 70 years old reach sizes greater than 100 gm. An analysis of a logistic growth curve of benign prostatic hyperplasia lesions removed at prostatectomy indicates that the growth of benign prostatic hyperplasia is initiated probably before the patient is 30 years old. The early phase of benign prostatic hyperplasia growth (men between 31 and 50 years old) is characterized by a doubling time for the tumor weight of 4.5 years. In the mid phase of benign prostatic hyperplasia growth (men between 51 and 70 years old) the doubling time is 10 years, and increases to more than 100 years in patients beyond 70 years old. © 1984 by

In addition the effects of age, hormones, and iatrogenically induced scar tissue on these structures, are discussed specifically with regard to understanding the proper basis for treatment of urinary incontinence. According to the Theory stress and urge symptoms may both derive, for different reasons from the same anatomical defect, a lax vagina. This laxity may be caused by defects within the vaginal wall itself, or its supporting structures i.e. ligaments, muscles, and their connective tissue insertions. The vagina has a dual function. It mediates (transmits) the various muscle movements involved in bladder neck opening and closure through three separate closure mechanisms. It also has a structural function, and prevents urgency by supporting the hypothesized stretch receptors at the proximal urethra and bladder neck. Altered collagen/elastin in the vaginal connective tissue and/or its ligamentous supports may cause laxity. This dissipates the muscle contraction, causing stress incontinence, and/or activation of an inappropriate micturition reflex, (“bladder instability”) by stimulation of bladder base stretch receptors. The latter is manifested by symptoms of frequency, urgency, nocturia with or without urine loss.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0412.1990.tb08027.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1895721865", "source": "openalex"}

Ten to twenty percent of women and up to 77% of women residing in nursing homes have urinary incontinence, yet only 25% seek or receive treatment. <h3>Observations</h3> This review summarizes the evaluation and therapeutic options for women affected by urinary incontinence. The initial assessment should focus on understanding the effect of incontinence on quality of life, the patient's goals and preferences for treatment, the results of previous treatments, and the presence of concomitant conditions, such as advanced pelvic organ prolapse, that may require referral. Infection and hematuria need to be ruled out. In the absence of urinary infection or serious underlying pathology (such as cancer or serious neurologic disease) associated with urinary incontinence, the clinician should initiate unsupervised pelvic muscle exercises and lifestyle modifications appropriate to the patient to reduce her symptoms. These recommendations can include weight loss, adequate hydration, avoidance of excessive fluids, and regular voiding intervals that reduce urgency incontinence episodes. Urgency incontinence medications, with timely reassessment of symptoms, can be started without extensive evaluation. Specialist treatments for urgency incontinence include onabotulinumtoxinA and percutaneous or implanted neuromodulators. Stress incontinence surgery, the midurethral sling, is associated with symptom improvement in 48% to 90% of women and has low rates of mesh complications (&lt;5%). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Urinary incontinence is common in women, although few seek care despite many effective treatment options. Clinicians should prioritize urinary incontinence detection, identify and treat modifiable factors, incorporate patient preference into evaluation and treatment, initiate conservative and medical therapy, and refer to specialists when underlying pathology is identified or conservative measures are ineffective.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.12137", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2766947181", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we used LC-MS/MS to profile the proteome of human urinary exosomes. Overall, the analysis identified 1132 proteins unambiguously, including 177 that are represented on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database of disease-related genes, suggesting that exosome analysis is a potential approach to discover urinary biomarkers. We extended the proteomic analysis to phosphoproteomic profiling using neutral loss scanning, and this yielded multiple novel phosphorylation sites, including serine-811 in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter, NCC. To demonstrate the potential use of exosome analysis to identify a genetic renal disease, we carried out immunoblotting of exosomes from urine samples of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bartter syndrome type I, showing an absence of the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter 2, NKCC2.

Materials and Methods: Primary outcome variables were obtained from voiding diaries. After baseline evaluation candidates who satisfied inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. Test stimulation results determined eligibility for randomization into a stimulation (treatment) or delay (control) group. The stimulation group included 34 patients who underwent implantation and were followed for 6 months. The delay group comprised 42 patients who received standard medical therapy for 6 months and then were offered implantation. The stimulation group completed a therapy evaluation test (on versus off) after 6 months. Results: At 6 months the number of daily incontinence episodes, severity of episodes and absorbent pads or diapers replaced daily due to incontinence were significantly reduced in the stimulation compared to the delay group (all p <0.0001). Of the 34 stimulation group patients 16 (47%) were completely dry and an additional 10 (29%) demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in incontinence episodes 6 months after implantation. Efficacy appeared to be sustained for 18 months. During the therapy evaluation test the group returned to baseline levels of incontinence when stimulation was inactivated. Urodynamic testing confirmed that sacral nerve stimulation did not adversely affect voiding function. Complications included implantable pulse generator site pain in 15.9% of the patients, implant site pain in 19.1% and lead migration in 7.0%. Surgical revision was required in 32.5% of patients with implants to resolve a complication. There were no reports of permanent injury or nerve damage. Conclusions: Sacral nerve stimulation is safe and effective in treating refractory urinary urge incontinence. References 1 United States Department of Health and Human Services.

To evaluate the frequency of urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection in children with chronic constipation and report on the resolution of these with treatment of the underlying constipation. Methods. We evaluated the frequency of urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection in 234 chronic constipated and encopretic children before, and at least 12 months after, the start of treatment for constipation. Results. Twenty-nine percent complained of daytime urinary incontinence and 34% of nighttime urinary incontinence. Urinary tract infection was present in 11% and was more commonly present in girls than in boys (33% vs 3%). Vesicoureteral reflux was present in four and megacystis in four of the 25 children who had a voiding cystourethrogram because of urinary tract infection. One girl who came in had constipation and acute urinary retention. The treatment for constipation consisted of disimpaction and maintenance treatment, which included the prevention of reaccumulation of stools and reconditioning to normal bowel habits through timed toilet sitting. Follow-up, at least 12 months after start of treatment for constipation, revealed that the constipation was relieved successfully in 52%. Relief of constipation resulted in disappearance of daytime urinary incontinence in 89% and nighttime urinary incontinence in 63% of patients, and disappearance of recurrent urinary tract infections in all patients who had no anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract. Conclusion. Urinary symptoms were found in a significant number of children who had functional constipation and encopresis. With treatment of the constipation, most patients became clean and dry and further recurrence of urinary tract infections was prevented.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.100.2.228", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995469149", "source": "openalex"}

We address meaningful points that may help optimize clinical results in patients with an orthotopic bladder substitute. Materials and Methods: The review involved an objective evaluation of the basic science literature of functional, structural and physiological characteristics of gastrointestinal tissue as a substitute for bladder. Potential problems that may be associated with particular parts of the gut for use in reconstruction are discussed. We also summarize the clinical results and complications of orthotopic reconstruction. Results: In the last 10 years the paradigm for choosing urinary diversion has changed substantially: In 2002 all patients undergoing cystectomy were neobladder candidates. It is critically important to understand the phenomenon of maturation. The motor and pharmacological response of the implanted gut changes dramatically toward that of the bladder. Structural and ultrastructural changes in the ileal mucosa lead to a primitive epithelium similar to urothelium. The need for reflux prevention is not the same as in ureterosigmoidostomy conduit or continent diversion. Reflux prevention in neobladders is even less important than in a normal bladder. When using nonrefluxing techniques, the risk of obstruction is at least twice that after direct anastomosis. Kidney function is not impaired by diversion if stenosis is recognized and managed. Patient health status is more influenced by underlying disease than by diversion. Complications of neobladders are actually similar to or lower than the true rates after conduit formation, in contrast to the popular view that conduits are simple and safe. Some degree of nocturnal leakage is a consistent finding in most reports despite a technically sound operation. The precise pathogenesis of urinary retention requiring clean intermittent catheterization remains uncertain. There are new complications, such as neobladder rupture and mucous tamponade. Conclusions: Orthotopic reconstruction has passed the test of time. In these patients life is similar to that in individuals with a native lower urinary tract. Until a better solution is devised orthotopic bladder reconstruction remains the best option for patients requiring cystectomy.

The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-1330", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2095918352", "source": "openalex"}

The population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, as enumerated by the Rochester Epidemiology Project, formed the sampling base for this study. Men between 40 and 79 years old with no history of prostate or other urological surgery, and who also were free of conditions associated with neurogenic bladder were invited to participate. A previously validated questionnaire was completed by the subject. Urine flow measures, current medications and family histories of urinary disease were also obtained. Nonresponse corrected scores for a composite of obstructive symptoms showed moderate to severe symptomatology among 13% of the men 40 to 49 years old and 28% of those older than 70 years. Prostatism is a highly prevalent symptom complex among unselected men in the community. The specific urinary symptoms of nocturia, weak stream, restarting, urgency and sensation of incomplete emptying are strongly age-related and, therefore, may be predictive of a prostatic disease process.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-5347(17)35405-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W100997517", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2106445408", "title": "Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion, Mortality, and Cardiovascular Events", "text": "The optimal range of sodium intake for cardiovascular health is controversial.We obtained morning fasting urine samples from 101,945 persons in 17 countries and estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion (used as a surrogate for intake). We examined the association between estimated urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the composite outcome of death and major cardiovascular events.The mean estimated sodium and potassium excretion was 4.93 g per day and 2.12 g per day, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the composite outcome occurred in 3317 participants (3.3%). As compared with an estimated sodium excretion of 4.00 to 5.99 g per day (reference range), a higher estimated sodium excretion (≥ 7.00 g per day) was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.30), as well as increased risks of death and major cardiovascular events considered separately. The association between a high estimated sodium excretion and the composite outcome was strongest among participants with hypertension (P=0.02 for interaction), with an increased risk at an estimated sodium excretion of 6.00 g or more per day. As compared with the reference range, an estimated sodium excretion that was below 3.00 g per day was also associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.44). As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome.In this study in which sodium intake was estimated on the basis of measured urinary excretion, an estimated sodium intake between 3 g per day and 6 g per day was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events than was either a higher or lower estimated level of intake. As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2148342716", "title": "Discovery of Urinary Biomarkers", "text": "A myriad of proteins and peptides can be identified in normal human urine. These are derived from a variety of sources including glomerular filtration of blood plasma, cell sloughing, apoptosis, proteolytic cleavage of cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, and secretion of exosomes by epithelial cells. Mass spectrometry-based approaches to urinary protein and peptide profiling can, in principle, reveal changes in excretion rates of specific proteins/peptides that can have predictive value in the clinical arena, e.g. in the early diagnosis of disease, in classification of disease with regard to likely therapeutic responses, in assessment of prognosis, and in monitoring response to therapy. These approaches have potential value, not only in diseases of the kidney and urinary tract but also in systemic diseases that are associated with circulating small protein and peptide markers that can pass the glomerular filter. Most large scale biomarker discovery studies reported thus far have used one of two approaches to identify proteins and peptides whose excretion in urine changes in specific disease states: 1) two-dimensional electrophoresis with mass spectrometric and/or immunochemical identification of proteins and 2) top-down mass spectrometric methods (SELDI-TOF-MS and capillary electrophoresis-MS). These studies have been chiefly in the areas of nephrology, urology, and oncology. We review these applications, focusing on two areas of progress, viz. in bladder cancer and in acute rejection of renal transplants. Progress has been limited so far. However, with the advent of powerful LC-MS/MS methods along with methods for quantifying LC-MS/MS output, there is hope for an accelerated discovery and validation of disease biomarkers in urine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.r600004-mcp200", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148342716", "source": "openalex"}

Each year, more than 1 million patients in U.S. acute-care hospitals and extended-care facilities acquire such an infection; the risk with short-term catheterization is 5% per day. CAUTI is the second most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection, and studies suggest that patients with CAUTI have an increased institutional death rate, unrelated to the development of urosepsis. Novel urinary catheters impregnated with nitrofurazone or minocycline and rifampin or coated with a silver alloy-hydrogel exhibit antiinfective surface activity that significantly reduces the risk of CAUTI for short-term catheterizations not exceeding 2-3 weeks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3201/eid0702.010240", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159668600", "source": "openalex"}

As biofilm ultimately develops on all of these devices, the major determinant for development of bacteriuria is duration of catheterization. While the proportion of bacteriuric subjects who develop symptomatic infection is low, the high frequency of use of indwelling urinary catheters means there is a substantial burden attributable to these infections. Catheter-acquired urinary infection is the source for about 20% of episodes of health-care acquired bacteremia in acute care facilities, and over 50% in long term care facilities. The most important interventions to prevent bacteriuria and infection are to limit indwelling catheter use and, when catheter use is necessary, to discontinue the catheter as soon as clinically feasible. Infection control programs in health care facilities must implement and monitor strategies to limit catheter-acquired urinary infection, including surveillance of catheter use, appropriateness of catheter indications, and complications. Ultimately, prevention of these infections will require technical advances in catheter materials which prevent biofilm formation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-2994-3-23", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129028806", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty-eight patients suffered from genuine stress incontinence as objectively verified and 12 patients had symptoms and signs of both urge and stress incontinence. Thirty-nine (78%) patients were completely cured from their stress incontinence symptoms.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2037728383", "title": "Urinary Concentrations of Bisphenol A and 4-Nonylphenol in a Human Reference Population", "text": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, which are used in baby bottles, as protective coatings on food containers, and for composites and sealants in dentistry. 4-Nonylphenol (NP) is used to make nonylphenol ethoxylates, nonionic surfactants applied as emulsifying, wetting, dispersing, or stabilizing agents in industrial, agricultural, and domestic consumer products. The potential for human exposure to BPA and NP is high because of their widespread use. We measured BPA and NP in archived urine samples from a reference population of 394 adults in the United States using isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The concentration ranges of BPA and NP were similar to those observed in other human populations. BPA was detected in 95% of the samples examined at concentrations > or = 0.1 microg/L urine; the geometric mean and median concentrations were 1.33 microg/L (1.36 microg/g creatinine) and 1.28 microg/L (1.32 microg/g creatinine), respectively; the 95th percentile concentration was 5.18 microg/L (7.95 microg/g creatinine). NP was detected in 51% of the samples examined > or = 0.1 microg/L. The median and 95th percentile concentrations were < 0.1 microg/L and 1.57 microg/L (1.39 microg/g creatinine), respectively. The frequent detection of BPA suggests widespread exposure to this compound in residents of the United States. The lower frequency of detection of NP than of BPA could be explained by a lower exposure of humans to NP, by different pharmacokinetic factors (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination), by the fact that 4-n-nonylphenol--the measured NP isomer--represents a small percentage of the NP used in commercial mixtures, or a combination of all of the above. Additional research is needed to determine the best urinary biomarker(s) to assess exposure to NP. Despite the sample population's nonrepresentativeness of the U.S. population (although sample weights were used to improve the extent to which the results represent the U.S. population) and relatively small size, this study provides the first reference range of human internal dose levels of BPA and NP in a demographically diverse human population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.7534", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037728383", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in 281 men were randomly assigned (1:1) to 5 mg tadalafil for 6 weeks, followed by dose escalation to 20 mg for 6 weeks or 12 weeks of placebo. Results: Tadalafil significantly improved the mean change from baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score at 6 weeks (5 mg tadalafil −2.8 vs placebo −1.2) and at 12 weeks (5/20 mg tadalafil −3.8 vs placebo −1.7). Larger changes were observed with inclusion of the placebo run-in at 12 weeks (5/20 mg tadalafil −7.1 vs placebo −4.5). Significant improvements were also seen in the International Prostate Symptom Score irritative and obstructive domains, the International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life index, a question about urinary symptom improvement and the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (significant at 12 weeks) vs placebo. International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain scores significantly improved in the 56% of men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia who were sexually active and had erectile dysfunction. Changes in uroflowmetry parameters were similar in the placebo and tadalafil groups. Commonly reported (2% or greater) treatment emergent adverse events were \"erection increased,\" dyspepsia, back pain, headache, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (each 5.1% or less). No change in post-void residual volume was seen with tadalafil treatment. Conclusions: Tadalafil once daily was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant symptomatic improvement for lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tadalafil also improved erectile function in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction. References 1 : Urologic diseases in America project: benign prostatic hyperplasia.

We included women aged 18-89 years and estimated age-specific incidence rates and cumulative incidence (lifetime risk) of SUI surgery, POP surgery, and either incontinence or prolapse surgery with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated lifetime risk until the age of 80 years to be consistent with prior studies.From 2007 to 2011, we evaluated 10,177,480 adult women who were followed for 24,979,447 person-years. Among these women, we identified 65,397 incident, or first, SUI and 57,755 incident prolapse surgeries. Overall, we found that the lifetime risk of any primary surgery for SUI or POP was 20.0% (95% CI 19.9-20.2) by the age of 80 years. Separately, the cumulative risk for SUI surgery was 13.6% (95% CI 13.5-13.7) and that for POP surgery was 12.6% (95% CI 12.4-2.7). For age-specific annual risk, SUI demonstrated a bimodal peak at age 46 years and then again at age 70-71 years with annual risks of 3.8 and 3.9 per 1,000 women, respectively. For POP, the risk increased progressively until ages 71 and 73 years when the annual risk was 4.3 per 1,000 women.Based on a U.S. claims and encounters database, the estimated lifetime risk of surgery for either SUI or POP in women is 20.0% by the age of 80 years.III.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000000286", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2402471166", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were recruited between November 2004 and February 2006, and the study was completed May 2006.Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 222), 4 mg of tolterodine ER (n = 217), 0.4 mg of tamsulosin (n = 215), or both tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin (n = 225) for 12 weeks.Patient perception of treatment benefit, bladder diary variables, International Prostate Symptom Scores, and safety and tolerability were assessed.A total of 172 men (80%) receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin reported treatment benefit by week 12 compared with 132 patients (62%) receiving placebo (P<.001), 146 (71%) receiving tamsulosin (P=.06 vs placebo), or 135 (65%) receiving tolterodine ER (P=.48 vs placebo). Patients receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin compared with placebo experienced significant reductions in urgency urinary incontinence (-0.88 vs -0.31, P=.005), urgency episodes without incontinence (-3.33 vs -2.54, P=.03), micturitions per 24 hours (-2.54 vs -1.41, P<.001), and micturitions per night (-0.59 vs -0.39, P.02). Patients receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin demonstrated significant improvements on the total International Prostate Symptom Score (-8.02 vs placebo, -6.19, P=.003) and QOL item (-1.61 vs -1.17, P=.003). All interventions were well tolerated. The incidence of acute urinary retention requiring catheterization was low (tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin, 0.4%; tolterodine ER, 0.5%; tamsulosin, 0%; and placebo, 0%).These results suggest that treatment with tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin for 12 weeks provides benefit for men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms including overactive bladder.

The present document serves as a stand-alone terminology update reflecting refinement and current advancement of knowledge on pediatric LUT function. Methods A variety of worldwide experts from multiple disciplines within the ICCS leadership who care for children with LUT dysfunction were assembled as part of the standardization committee. A critical review of the previous ICCS terminology document and the current literature was performed. Additionally, contributions and feedback from the multidisciplinary ICCS membership were solicited. Results Following a review of the literature over the last 7 years, the ICCS experts assembled a new terminology document reflecting current understanding of bladder function and LUT dysfunction in children using the resources from the literature review, expert opinion and ICCS member feedback. Conclusions The present ICCS terminology document provides a current and consensus update to the evolving terminology and understanding of LUT function in children. Neurourol.

This is a narrative review aimed at acting as an introduction to the epidemiology and burden of UTIs. This review is based on relevant literature according to the experience and expertise of the authors. The prevalence of UTI increases with age, and in women aged over 65 is approximately double the rate seen in the female population overall. Etiology in this age group varies by health status with factors such as catheterization affecting the likelihood of infection and the pathogens most likely to be responsible. In younger women, increased sexual activity is a major risk factor for UTIs and recurrence within 6 months is common. In the female population overall, more serious infections such as pyelonephritis are less frequent but are associated with a significant burden of care due to the risk of hospitalization. Healthcare-associated UTIs (HAUTIs) are the most common form of healthcare-acquired infection. Large global surveys indicate that the nature of pathogens varies between the community and hospital setting. In addition, the pathogens responsible for HAUTIs vary according to region making adequate local data key to infection control. UTIs create a significant societal and personal burden, with a substantial number of medical visits in the United States every year being related to UTIs. European data indicate that recurrent infections are related to increased absenteeism and physician visits. In addition, quality of life measures are significantly impacted in women suffering from recurrent UTIs. Data suggest that nonantimicrobial prophylactic strategies offer an opportunity to reduce both the rate of UTIs and the personal burden experience by patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1756287219832172", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2943512397", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1502228150", "title": "Neural Control of the Lower Urinary Tract", "text": "This article summarizes anatomical, neurophysiological, pharmacological, and brain imaging studies in humans and animals that have provided insights into the neural circuitry and neurotransmitter mechanisms controlling the lower urinary tract. The functions of the lower urinary tract to store and periodically eliminate urine are regulated by a complex neural control system in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral autonomic ganglia that coordinates the activity of smooth and striated muscles of the bladder and urethral outlet. The neural control of micturition is organized as a hierarchical system in which spinal storage mechanisms are in turn regulated by circuitry in the rostral brain stem that initiates reflex voiding. Input from the forebrain triggers voluntary voiding by modulating the brain stem circuitry. Many neural circuits controlling the lower urinary tract exhibit switch-like patterns of activity that turn on and off in an all-or-none manner. The major component of the micturition switching circuit is a spinobulbospinal parasympathetic reflex pathway that has essential connections in the periaqueductal gray and pontine micturition center. A computer model of this circuit that mimics the switching functions of the bladder and urethra at the onset of micturition is described. Micturition occurs involuntarily in infants and young children until the age of 3 to 5 years, after which it is regulated voluntarily. Diseases or injuries of the nervous system in adults can cause the re-emergence of involuntary micturition, leading to urinary incontinence. Neuroplasticity underlying these developmental and pathological changes in voiding function is discussed. © 2015 American Physiological Society.

Two laboratory studies (A, B) and one field study (C) were conducted to determine if urine color (Ucol) indicates hydration status accurately and to clarify the interchangeability of Ucol, urine osmolality (Uosm), and urine specific gravity (Usg) in research. Ucol, Uosm, and Usg were not significantly correlated with plasma osmolality, plasma sodium, or hematocrit. This suggested that these hematologic measurements are not as sensitive to mild hypohydration (between days) as the selected urinary indices are. When the data from A, B, and C were combined, Ucol was strongly correlated with Usg and Uosm. It was concluded that (a) Ucol may be used in athletic/industrial settings or field studies, where close estimates of Usg or Uosm are acceptable, but should not be utilized in laboratories where greater precision and accuracy are required, and (b) Uosm and Usg may be used interchangeably to determine hydration status.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsn.4.3.265", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165129567", "source": "openalex"}

Sodium excretion ranged from 0.2 mmol/24 h (Yanomamo Indians, Brazil) to 242 mmol/24 h (north China). In individual subjects (within centres) it was significantly related to blood pressure. Four centres found very low sodium excretion, low blood pressure, and little or no upward slope of blood pressure with age. Across the other 48 centres sodium was significantly related to the slope of blood pressure with age but not to median blood pressure or prevalence of high blood pressure. Potassium excretion was negatively correlated with blood pressure in individual subjects after adjustment for confounding variables. Across centres there was no consistent association.

Initial appropriate empirical treatment requires a good knowledge of epidemiological data. In this review, the most recent global epidemiological data of UTIs have been summarized. Recent findings Community-associated UTI (CAUTI) prevalence is 0.7% and the main risk factors are age, history of UTI, sexual activity and diabetes. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli and resistance rates to common antibiotics depend very much on the geographical location. The lowest observed resistance was for fosfomycin (range: 0–2.9%), nitrofurantoin (range: 0–4.4%) and mecillinam (range: 0–4%). Healthcare-associated UTI (HAUTI) frequency among HCAIs is 12.9 (confidence interval: 10.2–16%), 19.6 and 24% in the United States, Europe and developing countries, respectively. In urology departments, the prevalence is 5.1%. Resistance to almost all antibiotics in HAUTIs is above 20% and there is a significant geographical variation. Community onset HAUTIs bacterial spectrum is similar to hospital onset HAUTIs and different from CAUTIs. Summary It is challenging to provide with an exact frequency of UTIs.

We randomly assigned 338 overweight and obese women with at least 10 urinary-incontinence episodes per week to an intensive 6-month weight-loss program that included diet, exercise, and behavior modification (226 patients) or to a structured education program (112 patients). The mean (+/-SD) age of the participants was 53+/-11 years. The body-mass index (BMI) (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and the weekly number of incontinence episodes as recorded in a 7-day diary of voiding were similar in the intervention group and the control group at baseline (BMI, 36+/-6 and 36+/-5, respectively; incontinence episodes, 24+/-18 and 24+/-16, respectively). The women in the intervention group had a mean weight loss of 8.0% (7.8 kg), as compared with 1.6% (1.5 kg) in the control group (P<0.001). After 6 months, the mean weekly number of incontinence episodes decreased by 47% in the intervention group, as compared with 28% in the control group (P=0.01). As compared with the control group, the intervention group had a greater decrease in the frequency of stress-incontinence episodes (P=0.02), but not of urge-incontinence episodes (P=0.14). A higher proportion of the intervention group than of the control group had a clinically relevant reduction of 70% or more in the frequency of all incontinence episodes (P<0.001), stress-incontinence episodes (P=0.009), and urge-incontinence episodes (P=0.04). A 6-month behavioral intervention targeting weight loss reduced the frequency of self-reported urinary-incontinence episodes among overweight and obese women as compared with a control group. A decrease in urinary incontinence may be another benefit among the extensive health improvements associated with moderate weight reduction.

As a consequence, characterization of the variations of the urine metabolome under basal conditions becomes critical in order to avoid confounding effects in cohort studies. Such physiological information is however very scarce in the literature and in metabolomics databases so far. Here we studied the influence of age, body mass index (BMI), and gender on metabolite concentrations in a large cohort of 183 adults by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We implemented a comprehensive statistical workflow for univariate hypothesis testing and modeling by orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS), which we made available to the metabolomics community within the online Workflow4Metabolomics.org resource. We found 108 urine metabolites displaying concentration variations with either age, BMI, or gender, by integrating the results from univariate p-values and multivariate variable importance in projection (VIP). Several metabolite clusters were further evidenced by correlation analysis, and they allowed stratification of the cohort. In conclusion, our study highlights the impact of gender and age on the urinary metabolome, and thus it indicates that these factors should be taken into account for the design of metabolomics studies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00354", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2341820027", "source": "openalex"}

They facilitate adherence to mucosal surfaces and inflammatory cells in vitro, but their contribution to virulence has not been defined. This study presents evidence that type 1 fimbriae increase the virulence of Escherichia coli for the urinary tract by promoting bacterial persistence and enhancing the inflammatory response to infection. In a clinical study, we observed that disease severity was greater in children infected with E. coli O1:K1:H7 isolates expressing type 1 fimbriae than in those infected with type 1 negative isolates of the same serotype. The E. coli O1:K1:H7 isolates had the same electrophoretic type, were hemolysin-negative, expressed P fimbriae, and carried the fim DNA sequences. When tested in a mouse urinary tract infection model, the type 1-positive E. coli O1:K1:H7 isolates survived in higher numbers, and induced a greater neutrophil influx into the urine, than O1:K1:H7 type 1-negative isolates. To confirm a role of type 1 fimbriae, a fimH null mutant (CN1016) was constructed from an O1:K1:H7 type 1-positive parent. E. coli CN1016 had reduced survival and inflammatogenicity in the mouse urinary tract infection model. E. coli CN1016 reconstituted with type 1 fimbriae (E. coli CN1018) had restored virulence similar to that of the wild-type parent strain. These results show that type 1 fimbriae in the genetic background of a uropathogenic strain contribute to the pathogenesis of E. coli in the urinary tract.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.18.9827", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999823179", "source": "openalex"}

Nerve sparing radical prostatectomy was performed in men deemed appropriate candidates. Recovery of erections sufficient for intercourse and urinary continence were analyzed controlling for patient age, pathological tumor stage and the performance of unilateral or bilateral nerve sparing surgery in men followed for a minimum of 18 months. Erections were regained in 149 of 236 preoperatively potent men (63%) treated with bilateral and 24 of 59 (41%) treated with unilateral nerve sparing surgery. Recovery of erections correlated with patient age and pathological tumor stage in patients treated with bilateral nerve sparing surgery. Continence was regained in 409 of 435 patients (94%) and did not correlate with patient age, tumor stage or nerve sparing surgery. Anatomical radical retropubic prostatectomy can be performed with favorable results in preserving potency and urinary continence. Better results are achieved in younger men with organ confined cancer. © 1993 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByAtala A (2018)

Materials and Methods: We identified 1,057 patients who underwent radical cystectomy with conduit urinary diversion using ileum or colon at our institution from 1980 to 1998 with complete followup information. Patients were followed for long-term clinical outcomes and analyzed for the incidence of diversion specific complications. Results: A total of 844 patients died at a median of 4.1 years (range 0.1 to 28.1) following cystectomy. Median followup of the surviving 213 patients was 15.5 years (range 0.3 to 29.1). There were 643 (60.8%) patients with 1,453 complications directly attributable to the urinary diversion performed with a mean of 2.3 complications per patient. Bowel complications were the most common, occurring in 215 patients (20.3%), followed by renal complications in 213 (20.2%), infectious complications in 174 (16.5%), stomal complications in 163 (15.4%) and urolithiasis in 162 (15.3%). The least common were metabolic abnormalities, which occurred in 135 patients (12.8%), and structural complications, which occurred in 122 (11.5%). Increasing age at cystectomy (HR 1.21, p <0.001), increasing Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (HR 1.23, p = 0.02) and recent era of surgery (HR 1.68, p <0.001) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of complications. Conclusions: Conduit urinary diversion is associated with a high overall complication rate but a low reoperation rate. Long-term followup of these patients is necessary to closely monitor for potential complications from the urinary diversion that can occur decades later. References 1 : Cancer statistics, 2009.

Conversely, mean serum cystatin did not differ between these two groups. A multivariate analysis of covariance showed that lean mass was significantly related to serum and urinary creatinine but not with cystatin, even after adjustment for protein/meat intake and physical activity.Cystatin C may represent a more adequate alternative to assess renal function in individuals with higher muscle mass when mild kidney impairment is suspected.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.02870707", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109355833", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: A total of 90 patients with transitional cell carcinoma provided voided urine samples at least 5 days postoperatively. NMP22 was determined using a commercial test kit. At initial cystoscopic examination 3 to 6 months later the disease status was recorded, and the NMP22 values before and after transurethral resection of bladder tumor were compared. Results: Of 125 followup cystoscopic examinations (60 patients had 1, 26 had 2, 3 had 3 and 1 had 4 recurrences) transitional cell carcinoma was pathologically confirmed in 33. No malignancy was present at 79 examinations (if tumor was seen endoscopically, pathological evaluation indicated atypia, dysplasia or no abnormality). NMP22 values in these 2 populations were significantly different (malignancy median 20.81 units per ml. and no malignancy median 5.72 units per ml., Mann-Whitney U test for differences between 2 medians p = 0.00005). Of the 33 recurrences 23 (70 percent) had NMP22 values greater than the reference range (10 units per ml.). Additionally, NMP22 identified all 6 subjects (100 percent) who had invasive disease 3 to 6 months later. Of 72 patients with NMP22 less than 10 units per ml. 62 (86 percent) had no malignancy at subsequent cystoscopy. Conclusions: NMP22 was highly predictive of tumor status at followup cystoscopy. This quantitative, noninvasive assay, with high negative predictive value (86 percent) and sensitivity to detect malignancy (100 percent for invasive disease and 70 percent overall), may be a helpful adjunct to cytology and endoscopy for monitoring disease status after endoscopic tumor resection.

Materials and Methods: At 23 centers a total of 203 children were included in the study, including 128 girls and 75 boys 1 to younger than 2 years. Vesicoureteral reflux grade III in 126 cases and IV in 77 was detected after a febrile urinary tract infection (194) after prenatal screening (9). Voiding cystourethrography and dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy were done before randomization and after 2 years. The febrile urinary tract infection rate was analyzed by the intent to treat principle. Results: We noted a total of 67 febrile recurrences in 42 girls and a total of 8 in 7 boys (p = 0.0001). There was a difference in the recurrence rate among treatment groups in girls with febrile infection in 8 of 43 (19%) on prophylaxis, 10 of 43 (23%) with endoscopic therapy and 24 of 42 (57%) on surveillance (p = 0.0002). In girls the recurrence rate was associated with persistent reflux after 2 years (p = 0.0095). However, reflux severity (grade III or IV) at study entry did not predict recurrence. Conclusions: In this randomized, controlled trial there was a high rate of recurrent febrile urinary tract infection in girls older than 1 year with dilating vesicoureteral reflux at study entry but not in boys. Antibiotic prophylaxis and endoscopic treatment decreased the infection rate. References 1 : Relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infection and renal damage in children.

The purpose of this study was to analyze prospectively whether the urinary albumin-to -creatinine (A/C) ratio can independently predict ischemic heart disease (IHD) in a population-based cohort. In 1983, urinary albumin and creatinine levels were measured, along with the conventional atherosclerotic risk factors, in 2085 consecutive participants without IHD, renal disease, urinary tract infection, or diabetes mellitus. The participants were followed up until death, emigration, or December 31, 1993. IHD was defined as a hospital discharge diagnosis or cause of death including the diagnoses ICD-8 and 410 to 414. Seventy-nine individuals developed IHD during the 21 130 person-years of follow-up. They were characterized by a preponderance of males and higher age, body mass index, blood pressure, lipoproteins, and proportion of current smokers. Microalbuminuria was defined as an A/C ratio) &gt;90 percentile (&gt;0.65 mg/mmol). When adjusted for other risk factors, the relative risk of IHD associated with microalbuminuria was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.9, P =0.002), and the 10-year disease-free survival decreased from 97% to 91% ( P &lt;0.0001) when microalbuminuria was present. An interaction between microalbuminuria and smoking was observed, and the presence of microalbuminuria more than doubled the predictive effect of the conventional atherosclerotic risk factors for development of IHD. It is concluded that microalbuminuria is not only an independent predictor of IHD but also substantially increases the risk associated with other established risk factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.atv.19.8.1992", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149734505", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2162916526", "title": "Pharmacology of the Lower Urinary Tract: Basis for Current and Future Treatments of Urinary Incontinence", "text": "The lower urinary tract constitutes a functional unit controlled by a complex interplay between the central and peripheral nervous systems and local regulatory factors. In the adult, micturition is controlled by a spinobulbospinal reflex, which is under suprapontine control. Several central nervous system transmitters can modulate voiding, as well as, potentially, drugs affecting voiding; for example, noradrenaline, GABA, or dopamine receptors and mechanisms may be therapeutically useful. Peripherally, lower urinary tract function is dependent on the concerted action of the smooth and striated muscles of the urinary bladder, urethra, and periurethral region. Various neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adenosine triphosphate, nitric oxide, and neuropeptides, have been implicated in this neural regulation. Muscarinic receptors mediate normal bladder contraction as well as at least the main part of contraction in the overactive bladder. Disorders of micturition can roughly be classified as disturbances of storage or disturbances of emptying. Failure to store urine may lead to various forms of incontinence, the main forms of which are urge and stress incontinence. The etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders remain incompletely known, which is reflected in the fact that current drug treatment includes a relatively small number of more or less well-documented alternatives. Antimuscarinics are the main-stay of pharmacological treatment of the overactive bladder syndrome, which is characterized by urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. Accepted drug treatments of stress incontinence are currently scarce, but new alternatives are emerging. New targets for control of micturition are being defined, but further research is needed to advance the pharmacological treatment of micturition disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1124/pr.56.4.4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162916526", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: To assess currently marketed antimicrobial urinary catheters for preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI). Data Sources: Electronic databases, conference proceedings, bibliographies, trialists, and catheter manufacturers (search dates, 1966 to June 2005). Study Selection: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of nitrofurazone-coated or silver alloy–coated antimicrobial urinary catheter use for less than 30 days; no language restriction. Data Extraction: Study design, study sample, inclusion and exclusion criteria, allocation, blinding, UTI definition, ascertainment methods, and proportion developing symptomatic UTI (primary end point) or bacteriuria (secondary end point) were extracted by using a structured data collection instrument. Data Synthesis: Twelve qualifying trials (13 392 total participants or catheters) were identified. They compared nitrofurazone-coated silicone (n = 3) or silver-coated latex (n = 9) catheters with silicone or latex catheters. No study addressed symptomatic UTI. All trials suggested protection against bacteriuria with test catheter use. However, effect size varied considerably and postrandomization exclusions were very common. Effect size was greatest in trials of nitrofurazone-coated catheters (all post-1995) and in pre-1995 silver alloy–coated catheter trials and was smallest in post-1995 silver alloy–coated catheter trials. Control group bacteriuria rate, control catheter type (latex vs. silicone), and patient sample (urology vs. other) also predicted effect size. Few studies addressed secondary bloodstream infection, mortality, costs, or microbial resistance. Short-term adverse effects were minimal. Limitations: The study was limited by the number, size, and quality of studies and by lack of the following: intention-to-treat analyses, data on clinical end points, and trials comparing nitrofurazone-coated with silver alloy–coated catheters. Conclusions: According to fair-quality evidence, antimicrobial urinary catheters can prevent bacteriuria in hospitalized patients during short-term catheterization, depending on antimicrobial coating and several other variables. Older data probably lack current relevance. Cost implications and effect on infectious complications remain undefined.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-144-2-200601170-00009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990229031", "source": "openalex"}

This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P > or = 0.20 for all interactions).Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed the records of 100 patients and mailed a questionnaire to those without recent followup. Results: Overall 84 patients were continent, including 36 with the original artificial urinary sphincter in place who were dry at a median followup of 11 years and 27 in whom the device was successfully replaced due to mechanical failure who were previously continent for a median of 7 years. In 21 patients it was removed due to infection or erosion and reimplantation was successful 3 to 6 months later or they remained dry without another artificial urinary sphincter. Of the male patients with a bulbar and bladder neck sphincter 92% and 84%, respectively, were continent at 10 years as well as 73% of the females. Device survival was 66% at 10 years. Overall 37% of the prostheses were removed due to infection or erosion in the 10-year period with the highest risk in females (56%) and lowest in males with a bulbar sphincter (23%). Conclusions: The artificial urinary sphincter is effective long-term treatment for incontinence in male patients. In female patients the risk of erosion is high, although overall long-term continence is satisfactory. References 1 : Treatment of urinary incontinence by an implantable prosthetic sphincter.

We compared sensory nerve provocative ability of sodium versus potassium, and determined whether intravesical potassium sensitivity discriminates patients with interstitial cystitis from normal subjects and those with other sensory disorders of the bladder. Materials and Methods: A total of 231 patients with interstitial cystitis and 41 normal subjects underwent intravesical challenge with 40 ml. water and then 40 ml. of 40 mEq./100 ml. potassium chloride. Subjective responses of urgency or pain stimulation were recorded on a scale of 0 to 5. In 19 normal subjects potassium absorption was measured at baseline, after injury of the bladder mucus with protamine, after heparin treatment to reverse mucus damage and then for a final time. These subjects simultaneously recorded the symptoms of sensory urgency and pain at baseline, after protamine and after heparin. Another group of normal volunteers underwent a challenge with sodium versus potassium to determine which cation was more provocative. Patients with bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), detrusor instability, and acute and chronic urinary tract infection but no current infection were also evaluated for potassium sensitivity. Results: Neither normal subjects nor patients with interstitial cystitis reacted to water administered intravesically. There was marked sensitivity to intravesical potassium in 75% of patients with interstitial cystitis versus 4% of controls (p <0.01). Only 1 patient with BPH responded to potassium and none of the 5 with chronic urinary tract infection responded. All 4 patients (100%) with a current acute urinary tract infection reacted positively to the potassium challenge. Of 16 patients with detrusor instability 25% responded. Normal subjects had minimal sensitivity to potassium before (11%) and markedly increased sensitivity after (79%) protamine treatment, and these symptoms were reversed by heparin in 42%. Potassium absorption directly correlated with symptoms (0.4, 3.0 and 1.3 mEq. before and after protamine, and after heparin reversal, respectively). In regard to sodium versus potassium provocation, potassium was far more provocative for causing urgency after protamine (10 versus 90%). Neither group underwent provocation before protamine. Conclusions: Chronic diffusion of urinary potassium into the bladder interstitium may induce sensory symptoms, damage tissue and be a major toxic factor in the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis. Intravesical potassium sensitivity is a reliable method for detecting abnormal epithelial permeability. It discriminates between patients with interstitial cystitis and normal subjects with intact epithelial function, and it is a useful diagnostic test for interstitial cystitis. Potassium sensitivity correlates with increased potassium absorption in normal subjects, and potassium is far more provocative than sodium. Potassium sensitivity is also present in acute urinary tract infection and occasionally detrusor instability but not in BPH or chronic urinary tract infections.

Clinical behavioral disorders and subclinical psychological symptoms are reviewed. Aspects of screening, assessment, counseling and in severe cases treatment are outlined, and recommendations are formulated. Materials and Methods: Relevant publications on psychological and psychiatric aspects are reviewed. The recommendations passed several rounds of consensus finding, and were circulated among International Children's Continence Society members and external experts. Results: In addition to subclinical effects on self-esteem, quality of life and distress, the rate of comorbid clinical behavioral disorders is increased. In fact, 20% to 30% of children with nocturnal enuresis, 20% to 40% with daytime urinary incontinence and 30% to 50% with fecal incontinence fulfill the criteria for ICD-10 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV psychiatric disorders. These concomitant disturbances require assessment and counseling, and in severe cases treatment. They have a negative effect on compliance and outcome if not addressed and left untreated. Conclusions: Because the comorbidity rate is high, screening for psychological symptoms is recommended for all children in all settings with enuresis and/or daytime urinary and/or fecal incontinence. Standardized, validated questionnaires are recommended. In addition to clinical observation and history, a short screening questionnaire can be used as a first step. If problem behaviors are present a longer broadband questionnaire is recommended. If problem items in the clinical range are noted, a full child psychiatric or psychological assessment is recommended.

A survey, consisting of a multi-stage probability sample of 13,912 households, was done in Washtenaw County, Michigan to estimate these prevalences. A total of 1,955 senior citizens 60 or more years old was interviewed. The prevalences of urinary incontinence, difficult bladder emptying and irritative bladder symptoms were 18.9, 22.1 and 11.8 per cent, respectively, in men, and 37.7, 10.8 and 17.4 per cent, respectively, in women. Urinary incontinence was significantly more prevalent among all respondents with bladder emptying and irritative symptoms than those without such symptoms (p less than 0.001). The frequency of voiding was significantly increased among respondents with incontinence, or emptying or irritative symptoms compared to asymptomatic respondents (p less than 0.001). These survey data are of importance to senior citizens, care providers and governmental agencies. © 1986 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 136Issue 5November 1986Page: 1021-1025 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 1986 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Ananias C.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2109504141", "title": "The Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms questionnaire: development and psychometric testing", "text": "Objective To develop a questionnaire that is sensitive to changes in the symptomatology of the female lower urinary tract, particularly urinary incontinence, providing an instrument that can characterize symptom severity, impact on quality of life and evaluate treatment outcome. Patients, subjects and methods Items covering as wide a range of urinary symptoms as possible were devised after consultation with clinicians and a health scientist, a literature review and discussion with patients. Additional items assessed the degree of ‘bother’ that symptoms were causing. Eighty‐five women with clinical symptoms attending for urodynamic assessment and 20 women with nonewere asked to self‐complete the questionnaire. The instrument's validity was assessed by interviewing patients and measuring levels of missing data, comparing symptom scores between clinical and non‐clinical populations and comparison with frequency/volume charts and data from pad tests. The instrument's reliability was assessed by measuring both internal consistency and stability, using a 2‐week test‐retest analysis. Results The questionnaire was completed by the patients with a mean of only 2% of items missing; most questions were easily understood. Construct validity was good, with the instrument easily differentiating clinical and non‐clinical populations. Criterion validity, as tested against frequency/volume charts and pad‐test data, was acceptable, with Kappa coefficients of 0.29–0.79 for frequency/volume data and Spearman rank correlations of 0.50–0.97 and 0.31–0.67 for frequency/volume and pad‐test data, respectively. The reliability of the instrument was good; a Cronbach's alpha of 0.78 indicated that the symptom questions had high internal consistency, while stability was excellent, with 78% of symptoms and problems answered identically on two occasions, and Spearman rank correlations of 0.86 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion The instrument has good psychometric validity and reliability. The stability demonstrated at baseline and the ability to differentiate clearly between community and clinical populations suggest that it should be ideal for measuring changes following therapeutic intervention. The addition of life‐impact items and a ‘bother’ factor may provide the opportunity to identify those women who wish treatment for their symptoms; this dimension requires further exploration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1996.00186.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109504141", "source": "openalex"}

Enteric bacteria (in particular, Escherichia coli) remain the most frequent cause of UTIs, although the distribution of pathogens that cause UTIs is changing. More important is the increase in resistance to some antimicrobial agents, particularly the resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole seen in E. coli. Physicians distinguish UTIs from other diseases that have similar clinical presentations with use of a small number of tests, none of which, if used individually, have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Among the diagnostic tests, urinalysis is useful mainly for excluding bacteriuria. Urine culture may not be necessary as part of the evaluation of outpatients with uncomplicated UTIs, but it is necessary for outpatients who have recurrent UTIs, experience treatment failures, or have complicated UTIs, as well as for inpatients who develop UTIs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1086/383029", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165186144", "source": "openalex"}

Appropriate core clinical categories and a subclassification were developed to give a numeric coding to each definition. An extensive process of 22 rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus).A Terminology Report for male lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms and dysfunction, encompassing around 390 separate definitions/descriptors, has been developed. It is clinically-based with the most common diagnoses defined. Clarity and user-friendliness have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in male lower urinary tract and pelvic floor dysfunction. Male-specific imaging (ultrasound, radiology, CT, and MRI) has been a major addition whilst appropriate figures have been included to supplement and help clarify the text.A consensus-based Terminology Report for male lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms and dysfunction has been produced aimed at being a significant aid to clinical practice and a stimulus for research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.23897", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2913863236", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: A total of 177 patients with urinary retention refractory to standard therapy were enrolled in the study. Greater than 50% improvement in baseline voiding symptoms during a 3 to 7-day percutaneous test stimulation qualified a patient for surgical implantation of an InterStim∥ Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota. system. Of the patients who qualified for implantation 37 were randomly assigned to a treatment and 31 to a control group. Patients in the treatment group underwent early surgical implantation of the sacral nerve stimulation system, while implantation was delayed in the control group for 6 months. Followup evaluations, including voiding diary analysis and temporary deactivation of the stimulator at 6 months, were conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after implantation in the treatment group, and after 3 and 6 months in the control group. Results: Compared to the control group, patients implanted with the InterStim system had statistically and clinically significant reductions in the catheter volume per catheterization (p <0.0001). Of the patients treated with implants 69% eliminated catheterization at 6 months and an additional 14% had a 50% or greater reduction in catheter volume per catheterization. Therefore, successful results were achieved in 83% of the implant group with retention compared to 9% of the control group at 6 months. Temporary inactivation of sacral nerve stimulation therapy resulted in a significant increase in residual volumes (p <0.0001) but effectiveness of sacral nerve stimulation was sustained through 18 months after implant. Conclusions: Results of this prospective, randomized clinical study demonstrate that sacral nerve stimulation is effective for restoring voiding in patients with retention who are refractory to other forms of treatment.

Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved, multicenter registered trial randomized women with refractory urge incontinence, detrusor overactivity incontinence and 6 or greater urge incontinence episodes in 3 days to botulinum toxin A or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. Refractory was defined as inadequate symptom control after 2 or more attempts at pharmacotherapy and 1 or more other first line therapies for detrusor overactivity incontinence. The primary outcome measure was time to failure, as evidenced by a Patient Global Impression of Improvement score of 4 or greater at least 2 months after injection, or changes in treatment (initiation or increase) at any time after injection. Safety data, including increased post-void residual volume, defined as more than 200 ml irrespective of symptoms, was obtained at specified time points. Results: Approximately 60% of the women who received botulinum toxin A had a clinical response based on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. The median duration of their responses was 373 days, significantly longer than the 62 days or less for placebo (p <0.0001). In the botulinum toxin A group increased post-void residual urine (12 of 28 women or 43%) and urinary tract infection in those with increased post-void residual urine (9 of 12 or 75%) exceeded expected ranges. Further injections were stopped after 43 patients were randomized, including 28 to botulinum toxin A and 15 to placebo. Conclusions: Local injection of 200 U botulinum toxin A was an effective and durable treatment for refractory overactive bladder. However, a transient post-void residual urine increase was experienced in 43% of patients. Botulinum toxin A for idiopathic overactive bladder is still under investigation.

To more precisely define the role of CAUTI in patients' symptoms, a subset of 1034 patients, 89 of whom developed CAUTI with more than 10<sup>3</sup>colony-forming units per milliliter, who did not have another potentially confounding site of infection besides the urinary tract, was analyzed. <h3>Outcome Measures</h3> Presence of fever, symptoms commonly associated with community-acquired urinary tract infection, and peripheral leukocytosis. <h3>Results</h3> There were 235 new cases of nosocomial CAUTI during the study period. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic; only 123 infections (52%) were detected by patients' physicians using the hospital laboratory. In the subset analysis, there were no significant differences between patients with and without CAUTI in signs or symptoms commonly associated with urinary tract infection—fever, dysuria, urgency, or flank pain—or in leukocytosis. Only 1 of the 235 episodes of CAUTI that were prospectively studied was unequivocally associated with secondary bloodstream infection. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Whereas CAUTls are a major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the hospital, they are rarely symptomatic and infrequently cause bloodstream infection. Symptoms referable to the urinary tract, fever, or peripheral leukocytosis have little predictive value for the diagnosis of CAUTI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.160.5.678", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153529759", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects had to have urodynamic evidence of bladder dysfunction, be ambulatory, and not have dementia.Intervention.—Subjects were randomized to 4 sessions (8 weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment, drug treatment (with oxybutynin chloride, possible range of doses, 2.5 mg daily to 5.0 mg 3 times daily), or a placebo control condition.Main Outcome Measures.—Reduction in the frequency of incontinent episodes as determined by bladder diaries, and patients' perceptions of improvement and their comfort and satisfaction with treatment.Results.—For all 3 treatment groups, reduction of incontinence was most pronounced early in treatment and progressed more gradually thereafter. Behavioral treatment, which yielded a mean 80.7% reduction of incontinence episodes, was significantly more effective than drug treatment (mean 68.5% reduction; P=.04) and both were more effective than the placebo control condition (mean 39.4% reduction; P&lt;.001 and P=.009, respectively). Patient-perceived improvement was greatest for behavioral treatment (74.1% \"much better\" vs 50.9% and 26.9% for drug treatment and placebo, respectively). Only 14.0% of patients receiving behavioral treatment wanted to change to another treatment vs 75.5% in each of the other groups.Conclusion.—Behavioral treatment is a safe and effective conservative intervention that should be made more readily available to patients as a first-line treatment for urge and mixed incontinence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.280.23.1995", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171846085", "source": "openalex"}

We performed a meta-analysis of the existing literature pertaining to endoscopic treatment to allow comparison with reports of open surgical correction. Materials and Methods: We searched all peer reviewed articles published through 2003 pertaining to endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. A total of 63 articles were double reviewed by 9 pediatric urologists, and the data were tabulated on data retrieval sheets. A mixed effects logistic regression model was used to obtain overall estimates of event probabilities (eg reflux resolution, ureteral obstruction) together with their 95% confidence intervals. Individual study estimates were obtained with overall estimate and observation characteristics using empirical Bayes calculations. Differences between or among specific groups were assessed using the F-test. Results: The database included 5,527 patients and 8,101 renal units. Following 1 treatment the reflux resolution rate (by ureter) for grades I and II reflux was 78.5%, grade III 72%, grade IV 63% and grade V 51%. If the first injection was unsuccessful, the second treatment had a success rate of 68%, and the third treatment 34%. The aggregate success rate with 1 or more injections was 85%. The success rate was significantly lower for duplicated (50%) vs single systems (73%), and neuropathic (62%) vs normal bladders (74%). The success rate was similar among children and adults. Following a previous failed open reimplantation endoscopic treatment was successful in 65% of patients. After endoscopic treatment with variable followup pyelonephritis developed in 0.75% of patients and cystitis in 6%. There were few reports of renal scarring following treatment. Conclusions: Endoscopic treatment provides a high rate of success in children with reflux that decreases with increasing grade, although multiple treatments may be necessary. Future reports of endoscopic therapy should include rates of urinary tract infection and renal scarring.

However, evidence concerning its effectiveness in grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux is lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of urinary tract infection in young children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. Materials and Methods: Children 1 month to 3 years old with grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux were assigned randomly to receive daily cotrimoxazole or no treatment, and followed for 18 months. A urinary tract infection constituted an exit criterion. Infection-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Results: A total of 225 children were enrolled in the study. Distribution of gender, age at inclusion and reflux grade were similar between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of urinary tract infection between the 2 groups (17% vs 26%, p = 0.2). However, a significant association was found between treatment and patient gender (p = 0.017). Prophylaxis significantly reduced urinary tract infection in boys (p = 0.013), most notably in boys with grade III vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.042). Conclusions: These data suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce the overall incidence of urinary tract infection in children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. However, such a strategy may prevent further urinary tract infection in boys with grade III reflux. References 1 : Controlled trial of prophylactic treatment in childhood urinary-tract infection.

Materials and Methods: The RRISK is a population based cohort study of 2,109 randomly selected middle-aged and older women. Incontinence and other variables were assessed by self-report questionnaires and in person interviews. Labor and delivery and surgical data were abstracted from medical records archived since 1946. Logistic regression was used to estimate the OR with 95% CIs for incontinence while adjusting for covariates. Results: The age adjusted prevalence of weekly incontinence was highest among Hispanic women, followed by white, black and Asian-American women (36%, 30%, 25% and 19%, respectively, p <0.001). Type of incontinence also differed among groups, with weekly stress incontinence prevalence being 18%, 15%, 8% and 8% (p <0.001), and weekly urge incontinence prevalence being 10%, 9%, 14% and 7% (p <0.001). After adjustment for age, parity, hysterectomy, estrogen use, body mass, menopausal status and diabetes, the risk of stress incontinence remained significantly lower in black (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23–0.57) and Asian-American (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.86) women compared to white women. In contrast, the risk of urge incontinence was similar in black (adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.79–1.81) and Asian-American (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52–1.43) women compared to white women. Conclusions: Significant differences in the adjusted risk of stress incontinence among Hispanic, white, black and Asian-American women suggest the presence of additional, as yet unrecognized, risk or protective factors for stress incontinence.

We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of last search: January 2007.All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs in all populations.Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (UTIs - symptomatic and asymptomatic, side effects, adherence to therapy). Relative risk (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.Ten studies (n = 1049, five cross-over, five parallel group) were included. Cranberry/cranberry-lingonberry juice versus placebo, juice or water was evaluated in seven studies, and cranberries tablets versus placebo in four studies (one study evaluated both juice and tablets). Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs at 12 months (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) compared with placebo/control. Cranberry products were more effective reducing the incidence of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, than elderly men and women or people requiring catheterisation. Six studies were not included in the meta-analyses due to methodological issues or lack of available data. However, only one reported a significant result for the outcome of symptomatic UTIs. Side effects were common in all studies, and dropouts/withdrawals in several of the studies were high.There is some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. It's effectiveness for other groups is less certain. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. It is not clear what is the optimum dosage or method of administration (e.g. juice, tablets or capsules). Further properly designed studies with relevant outcomes are needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001321.pub3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3167492129", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2117925356", "title": "Naturally Occurring Human Urinary Peptides for Use in Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease", "text": "Because of its availability, ease of collection, and correlation with physiology and pathology, urine is an attractive source for clinical proteomics/peptidomics. However, the lack of comparable data sets from large cohorts has greatly hindered the development of clinical proteomics. Here, we report the establishment of a reproducible, high resolution method for peptidome analysis of naturally occurring human urinary peptides and proteins, ranging from 800 to 17,000 Da, using samples from 3,600 individuals analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to MS. All processed data were deposited in an Structured Query Language (SQL) database. This database currently contains 5,010 relevant unique urinary peptides that serve as a pool of potential classifiers for diagnosis and monitoring of various diseases. As an example, by using this source of information, we were able to define urinary peptide biomarkers for chronic kidney diseases, allowing diagnosis of these diseases with high accuracy. Application of the chronic kidney disease-specific biomarker set to an independent test cohort in the subsequent replication phase resulted in 85.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results indicate the potential usefulness of capillary electrophoresis coupled to MS for clinical applications in the analysis of naturally occurring urinary peptides.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m110.001917", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117925356", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of the present work was to develop a sensitive quantitative urinary test to identify renal injury in the rodent to facilitate early assessment of pathophysiological influences and drug toxicity. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies were made against the purified ectodomain of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), and these were used to construct a sandwich Kim-1 ELISA. The assay range of this ELISA was 50 pg/ml to 5 ng/ml, with inter- and intra-assay variability of <10%. Urine samples were collected from rats treated with one of three doses of cisplatin (2.5, 5, or 7.5 mg/kg). At one day after each of the doses, there was an approximately three- to fivefold increase in the urine Kim-1 ectodomain, whereas other routinely used biomarkers measured in this study [plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), glycosuria, proteinuria] lacked the sensitivity to show any sign of renal damage at this time point. When rats were subjected to increasing periods (10, 20, 30, or 45 min) of bilateral ischemia, there was an increasing amount of urinary Kim-1 detected. After only 10 min of bilateral ischemia, Kim-1 levels on day 1 were 10-fold higher (5 ng/ml) than control levels, whereas plasma creatinine and BUN were not increased and there was no glycosuria, increased proteinuria, or increased urinary NAG levels. Thus urinary Kim-1 levels serve as a noninvasive, rapid, sensitive, reproducible, and potentially high-throughput method to detect early kidney injury in pathophysiological studies and in preclinical drug development studies for risk-benefit profiling of pharmaceutical agents.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00291.2005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2172018609", "source": "openalex"}

However, potential metabolic consequences in the early postoperative period as well as long term remain a serious problem. Materials and Methods: We review the possible complications associated with removing bowel and incorporating it in the urinary tract. Results: Metabolic complications following continent urinary diversion are common. In the majority of cases, and with correct patient selection and education, problems may be minimized with use of an appropriate bowel segment and early intervention. Conclusions: Careful patient selection and vigilant followup are essential for good long-term results in patients undergoing continent urinary diversion.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2109531898", "title": "Sensitivity and Specificity of a Single Emergency Department Measurement of Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase–Associated Lipocalin for Diagnosing Acute Kidney Injury", "text": "Background: A single serum creatinine measurement cannot distinguish acute kidney injury from chronic kidney disease or prerenal azotemia. Objective: To test the sensitivity and specificity of a single measurement of urinary neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL) and other urinary proteins to detect acute kidney injury in a spectrum of patients. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Emergency department of Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York. Participants: 635 patients admitted to the hospital with acute kidney injury, prerenal azotemia, chronic kidney disease, or normal kidney function. Measurements: Diagnosis of acute kidney injury was based on the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage) criteria and assigned by researchers who were blinded to experimental measurements. Urinary NGAL was measured by immunoblot, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) by enzyme measurement, α1-microglobulin and α1-acid glycoprotein by immunonephelometry, and serum creatinine by Jaffe kinetic reaction. Experimental measurements were not available to treating physicians. Results: Patients with acute kidney injury had a significantly elevated mean urinary NGAL level compared with the other kidney function groups (416 µg/g creatinine [SD, 387]; P = 0.001). At a cutoff value of 130 µg/g creatinine, sensitivity and specificity of NGAL for detecting acute injury were 0.900 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98) and 0.995 (CI, 0.990 to 1.00), respectively, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 181.5 (CI, 58.33 to 564.71) and 0.10 (CI, 0.03 to 0.29); these values were superior to those for NAG, α1-microglobulin, α1-acid glycoprotein, fractional excretion of sodium, and serum creatinine. In multiple logistic regression, urinary NGAL level was highly predictive of clinical outcomes, including nephrology consultation, dialysis, and admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 24.71 [CI, 7.69 to 79.42]). Limitations: All patients came from a single center. Few kidney biopsies were performed. Conclusion: A single measurement of urinary NGAL helps to distinguish acute injury from normal function, prerenal azotemia, and chronic kidney disease and predicts poor inpatient outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-148-11-200806030-00003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109531898", "source": "openalex"}

These experiments enabled us to monitor changes in both ionic transport across the tissue and cellular ATP release from it. The urinary bladder of the rabbit maintains an electrical potential difference across its wall as a result largely of active sodium transport from the urinary (mucosal) to the serosal surface. Small hydrostatic pressure differences produced by removal of bathing fluid from one side of the tissue caused reproducible changes in both potential difference and short‐circuit current. The magnitude of these changes increases as the volume of fluid removed increases. Amiloride on the mucosal (urinary), but not the serosal, surface of the membrane reduces the transepithelial potential difference and short‐circuit current with an IC 50 of 300 n m . Amiloride reduces the size of, but does not abolish, transepithelial potential changes caused by alterations in hydrostatic pressure. Field electrical stimulation of strips of bladder tissue produces a reproducible release of ATP. Such release was demonstrated to occur largely from urothelial cells and is apparently non‐vesicular as it increases in the absence of calcium and is not abolished by tetrodotoxin. It is proposed that ATP is released from the urothelium as a sensory mediator for the degree of distension of the rabbit urinary bladder and other sensory modalities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.503bb.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101859335", "source": "openalex"}

Associations have previously been reported between urinary BPA concentrations and heart disease, diabetes and liver enzymes in adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003/04. We aimed to estimate associations between urinary BPA concentrations and health measures in NHANES 2005/06 and in data pooled across collection years. Methodology and Findings A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES: subjects were n = 1455 (2003/04) and n = 1493 (2005/06) adults aged 18–74 years, representative of the general adult population of the United States. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, BMI, waist circumference, and urinary creatinine concentration. Main outcomes were reported diagnoses of heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina and diabetes and serum liver enzyme levels. Urinary BPA concentrations in 2005/06 (geometric mean 1.79 ng/ml, 95% CI: 1.64 to 1.96) were lower than in 2003/04 (2.49 ng/ml, CI: 2.20 to 2.83, difference p-value = 0.00002). Higher BPA concentrations were associated with coronary heart disease in 2005/06 (OR per z-score increase in BPA = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.75, p = 0.043) and in pooled data (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.17 to 1.72, p = 0.001). Associations with diabetes did not reach significance in 2005/06, but pooled estimates remained significant (OR = 1.24, CI: 1.10 to 1.40, p = 0.001). There was no overall association with gamma glutamyl transferase concentrations, but pooled associations with alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase remained significant. Conclusions Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, is consistently associated with reported heart disease in the general adult population of the USA. Studies to clarify the mechanisms of these associations are urgently needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008673", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088514819", "source": "openalex"}

These infections are often caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Gram-negative bacterial species that cause CAUTIs express a number of virulence factors associated with adhesion, motility, biofilm formation, immunoavoidance, and nutrient acquisition as well as factors that cause damage to the host. These infections can be reduced by limiting catheter usage and ensuring that health care professionals correctly use closed-system Foley catheters. A number of novel approaches such as condom and suprapubic catheters, intermittent catheterization, new surfaces, catheters with antimicrobial agents, and probiotics have thus far met with limited success. While the diagnosis of symptomatic versus asymptomatic CAUTIs may be a contentious issue, it is generally agreed that once a catheterized patient is believed to have a symptomatic urinary tract infection, the catheter is removed if possible due to the high rate of relapse. Research focusing on the pathogenesis of CAUTIs will lead to a better understanding of the disease process and will subsequently lead to the development of new diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00019-07", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114594973", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: We analyzed data on 17,850 adults 20 years old or older who participated in the 2001 to 2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Any urinary incontinence was defined as a positive response to questions on urine leakage during physical activity, before reaching the toilet and during nonphysical activity. During this period changes in demographic and clinical factors associated with urinary incontinence included age, race/ethnicity, obesity, diabetes and chronic medical conditions (prostate disease in men). Age standardized prevalence estimates and prevalence ORs of urinary incontinence trends were determined using adjusted multivariate models with appropriate sampling weights. Results: The age standardized prevalence of urinary incontinence in the combined surveys was 51.1% in women and 13.9% in men. Prevalence in women increased from 49.5% in 2001 to 2002, to 53.4% in 2007 to 2008 (Ptrend = 0.01) and in men from 11.5% to 15.1%, respectively (Ptrend = 0.01). In women increased prevalence was partially explained by differences in age, race/ethnicity, obesity, diabetes and select chronic diseases across the survey periods. After adjustment the prevalence OR for 2007 to 2008 vs 2001 to 2002 decreased from 1.22 (95% CI 1.03–1.45) to 1.16 (95% CI 0.99–1.37). In men adjustment for potentially associated factors did not explain the increasing prevalence of urinary incontinence. Conclusions: The age standardized prevalence of urinary incontinence increased in men and women from 2001 through 2008. Decreasing obesity and diabetes may lessen the burden of urinary incontinence, especially in women.

The lack of early biomarkers has impaired our ability to initiate potential therapeutic or preventive interventions in cisplatin nephrotoxicity in a timely manner. In this study, we have explored the expression and urinary excretion of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxic injury.Mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg (high dose) or 5 mg/kg (low dose) cisplatin. The expression of NGAL was measured in the kidney and urine by Western analysis and immunofluorescence, and compared to changes in serum creatinine and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG).Cisplatin resulted in tubule cell necrosis and apoptosis following the high dose, but not the low dose. By Western analysis, NGAL protein was rapidly induced in the kidney within 3 h of high-dose cisplatin. By immunofluorescence, NGAL was induced predominantly in proximal tubule cells in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, reminiscent of a secreted protein. NGAL was easily detected in the urine by Western analysis within 3 h of cisplatin administration in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. By comparison, changes in urinary NAG or serum creatinine were not evident until 96 h after cisplatin. Using defined concentrations of purified recombinant NGAL, urinary NGAL excretion following cisplatin administration was quantified to be in the 20-80 ng/ml range.The results indicate that NGAL represents an early and quantitative urinary biomarker for cisplatin nephrotoxicity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000078452", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011250217", "source": "openalex"}

Our laboratory has developed methods for the in-depth characterization of body fluids; these involve a linear ion trap-Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) and a linear ion trap-orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap) mass spectrometer. Here we applied these methods to the analysis of the human urinary proteome. Results We employed one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography for protein separation and fractionation. Fractionated proteins were digested in-gel or in-solution, and digests were analyzed with the LTQ-FT and LTQ-Orbitrap at parts per million accuracy and with two consecutive stages of mass spectrometric fragmentation. We identified 1543 proteins in urine obtained from ten healthy donors, while essentially eliminating false-positive identifications. Surprisingly, nearly half of the annotated proteins were membrane proteins according to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Furthermore, extracellular, lysosomal, and plasma membrane proteins were enriched in the urine compared with all GO entries. Plasma membrane proteins are probably present in urine by secretion in exosomes. Conclusion Our analysis provides a high-confidence set of proteins present in human urinary proteome and provides a useful reference for comparing datasets obtained using different methodologies. The urinary proteome is unexpectedly complex and may prove useful in biomarker discovery in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-9-r80", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171215275", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: Of 92 patients diagnosed with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma at our institution from 1985 to 1995, 38 (41 kidneys) underwent ureteroscopic treatment and followup. Semirigid and flexible ureteroscopes were used to examine the collecting system. Tumors were biopsied, and treated with fulguration, the neodymium: YAG laser and/or the holmium: YAG laser. Patients were treated every 6 to 12 weeks until tumor-free and then followed on a strict endoscopic protocol. Results: Mean and median followup was 35.1 and 26 months, respectively (range 3 to 116). Grading of ureteroscopic biopsies was possible in 40 of 41 cases. Initial grading of tumors was low (grade 1 or 1 to 2) in 21 kidneys, grade 2 in 14 and grade 3 in 5. Of 41 kidneys 28 (68%) were documented as tumor-free ureteroscopically at some time following treatment, including 8 (29%) with subsequent recurrences that were treated endoscopically and 24 (86%) with no evidence of disease at the most recent followup. No patient to date has had progression of disease during endoscopic followup. High tumor grade, size and multifocality were significantly associated with tumor persistence and recurrence. Location in the kidney versus ureter was not a significant prognostic factor. Of the recurrent tumors 75% were not identified radiographically but were only discovered endoscopically. Two of 8 kidneys removed after endoscopic treatment had no tumor Stage (pT0). Conclusions: Endoscopic treatment of upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma is a reasonable method to treat carefully select patients based on strict indications. Complete endoscopic followup at regular intervals is essential to rule out recurrences. References 1 : Tumours of the upper urinary calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter. Eur. Urol.1976; 2: 120.

Seventy-six patients (25 infected and 51 noninfected) died during hospitalization; death rates were 19 per cent in infected patients and 4 per cent in noninfected patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that seven of 21 prospectively monitored variables were associated with mortality among the catheterized patients. The adjusted odds ratio for mortality between those who acquired infection and those who did not was 2.8 (95 per cent confidence limits, 1.5 to 5.1). The acquisition of infection was not associated with the severity of underlying disease; among patients who died, infections occurred in 38 per cent of those classified as having nonfatal underlying disease (15 of 39) and in 27 per cent of those classified as having fatal disease (10 of 37). Twelve deaths may have been caused by acquired urinary-tract infections. Two patients had urinary-tract pathogens in premortem blood cultures. Another 10 died with clinical pictures compatible with serious infection, but no diagnostic cultures were performed. We conclude that the acquisition of urinary-tract infection during indwelling bladder catheterization is associated with nearly a threefold increase in mortality among hospitalized patients, but the reason for this association is not yet clear.

Age, weight of the prostate, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, pathological stage and preservation or wide excision of the neurovascular bundles had no significant influence on preservation of urinary control.

Isolation of urinary exosomes by the established ultracentrifugation method has some limitations for use in a clinical laboratory. We sought a rapid and simple way to obtain urinary exosomes. We used a commercially available nanomembrane concentrator to enrich exosomes from urine by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10-30 min. Urinary exosomal markers tumor susceptibility gene 101, aquaporin-2, neuron-specific enolase, annexin V, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and podocalyxin (PODXL) were recovered from the nanomembrane concentrator and detected by Western blotting, and typical features of urinary vesicles were found by electron microscopy. Exosomal markers were detected in as little as 0.5 ml of urine. By the nanomembrane method, exosomal proteins could be recovered from urine samples frozen at -80 degrees C or refrigerated overnight at 4 degrees C then stored at -80 degrees C. By enriching exosomes we could detect PODXL, a podocyte marker, which decreased by 71% in five male patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and abundant proteinuria. We conclude that 1) use of a nanomembrane concentrator simplifies and accelerates the enrichment of urinary exosomes; and 2) the nanomembrane concentrator can concentrate exosomal proteins from clinical urine samples. This enhanced method may accelerate the translation of urinary exosomal biomarkers from bench to bedside for the diagnosis, classification, and prognostication of renal diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00434.2006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2169550143", "source": "openalex"}

Women were eligible for the study if they had predominant symptoms associated with the condition, a positive stress test, and urethral hypermobility. The primary outcomes were success in terms of overall urinary-incontinence measures, which required a negative pad test, no urinary incontinence (as recorded in a 3-day diary), a negative cough and Valsalva stress test, no self-reported symptoms, and no retreatment for the condition, and success in terms of measures of stress incontinence specifically, which required only the latter three criteria. We also assessed postoperative urge incontinence, voiding dysfunction, and adverse events.A total of 655 women were randomly assigned to study groups: 326 to undergo the sling procedure and 329 to undergo the Burch procedure; 520 women (79%) completed the outcome assessment. At 24 months, success rates were higher for women who underwent the sling procedure than for those who underwent the Burch procedure, for both the overall category of success (47% vs. 38%, P=0.01) and the category specific to stress incontinence (66% vs. 49%, P<0.001). However, more women who underwent the sling procedure had urinary tract infections, difficulty voiding, and postoperative urge incontinence.The autologous fascial sling results in a higher rate of successful treatment of stress incontinence but also greater morbidity than the Burch colposuspension.

Materials and Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample (10,458) of the total population of men 45 years old or older living in Goteborg, Sweden. The response rate was 74%. Results: The overall prevalence of urinary incontinence was 9.2% increasing (p <0.001) linearly from 3.6% in men 45 years old to 28.2% in men 90 years old or older. Daily leakage was reported by 64%, and 31% believed that urinary incontinence limited their social and vocational life. However, only 46% of the men with urinary incontinence had sought medical advice. Overall prevalence of other voiding disturbances included hesitancy in 9.1% of the patients, weak stream in 30.5%, dribbling in 33.7%, sensation of incompletely emptied bladder in 26.4%, nocturia in 56.1% and history of urinary tract infection in the last 2 years in 6.3%. Prevalence of all symptoms increased with increasing age. Childhood enuresis was reported by 9.1%. Impotence was reported by 7.6% and there was a linear increase (p <0.001) in the number of men reporting impotence up to 80 years of age. Conclusions: The prevalence of urinary incontinence and lower urogenital tract symptoms, such as hesitancy, weak stream, dribbling, sensation of incompletely emptied bladder, nocturia, urinary tract infection and impotence, increased linearly with increasing age.

METHODS: Type and frequency of incontinent episodes were assessed by 6049 community‐dwelling women using a self‐completed questionnaire. Postcards were subsequently mailed every 4 months to inquire about falls and fractures. Incident fractures were confirmed by radiographic report. Logistic and proportional hazard models were used to assess the independent association of urge urinary incontinence and risk of falling or fracture. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 78.5 (± 4.6) years. During an average follow‐up of 3 years, 55% of women reported falling, and 8.5% reported fractures. One‐quarter of the women (1493) reported weekly or more frequent urge incontinence, 19% (1137) reported weekly or more frequent stress incontinence, and 708 (12%) reported both types of incontinence. In multivariate models, weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was associated independently with risk of falling (odds ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14‐1.40) and with non‐spine nontraumatic fracture (relative hazard 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06‐1.69; P = .02). Stress incontinence was not associated independently with falls or fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was associated independently with an increased risk of falls and non‐spine, nontraumatic fractures in older women. Urinary frequency, nocturia, and rushing to the bathroom to avoid urge incontinent episodes most likely increase the risk of falling, which then results in fractures. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of urge incontinence may decrease the risk of fracture.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4236488639", "title": "Annual Direct Cost of Urinary Incontinence", "text": "In Brief OBJECTIVE To estimate the annual direct cost of urinary incontinence in 1995 US dollars. METHODS Epidemiologically based models using diagnostic and treatment algorithms from published clinical practice guidelines and current disease prevalence data were used to estimate direct costs of urinary incontinence. Prevalence and event probability estimates were obtained from literature sources, national data sets, small surveys, and expert opinion. Average national Medicare reimbursement was used to estimate costs, which were determined separately by gender, age group, and type of incontinence. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all variables. RESULTS The annual direct cost of urinary incontinence in the United States (in 1995 dollars) was estimated as $16.3 billion, including $12.4 billion (76%) for women and $3.8 billion (24%) for men. Costs for community-dwelling women ($8.6 billion, 69% of costs for women) were greater than for institutionalized women ($3.8 billion, 31%). Costs for women over 65 years of age were more than twice the costs for those under 65 years ($7.6 and $3.6 billion, respectively). The largest cost category was routine care (70% of costs for women), followed by nursing home admissions (14%), treatment (9%), complications (6%), and diagnosis and evaluations (1%). Costs were most sensitive to changes in incontinence prevalence, routine care costs, and institutionalization rates and costs. CONCLUSION Urinary incontinence is a very costly condition, with annual expenditures similar to other chronic diseases in women. Annual direct costs of urinary incontinence are over $16 billion in the United States, including $12.4 billion (76%) for women.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006250-200109000-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4236488639", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2130969262", "title": "Urinary prostaglandins. Identification and origin.", "text": "Human urine was analyzed by mass spectrometry for the presence of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha were detected in urine from females by selected ion monitoring of the prostaglandin E2-methylester-methoxime bis-acetate and the prostaglandin F2alpha-methyl ester-Tris-trimethylsilylether derivative. Additional evidence for the presence of prostaglandin F2alpha was obtained by isolating from female urine an amount of this prostaglandin sufficient to yield a complete mass spectrum. The methods utilized permitted quantitative analysis. The origin of urinary prostaglandin was determined by stimulating renal prostaglandin synthesis by arachidonic acid or angiotensin infusion. Arachidonic acid, the precursor of prostaglandin E2, when infused into one renal artery of a dog led to a significant increase in the excretion rate of this prostaglandin. Similarly, infusion of angiotensin II amide led to a significantly increased ipsilateral excretion rate of prostaglandin E2 and F2a in spite of a simultaneous decrease in the creatinine clearance. In man, i.v. infusion of angiotensin also led to an increased urinary eliminiation of prostaglandin E. These results show that urinary prostaglandins may originate from the kidney, indicating that renally synthesized prostaglandins diffuse or are excreted into the tubule. Thus, urinary prostaglandins are a reflection of renal prostaglandin synthesis and have potential as a tool to delineate renal prostaglandin physiology and pathology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci107987", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130969262", "source": "openalex"}

Thus we undertook RRCP and urinary diversion using a three-step technique. First, using a six-port approach and the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), one surgeon carried out a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy and cystoprostatectomy using a technique developed specifically for robotic surgery. The neurovascular bundles were easily identified and dissected away, the specimen entrapped in a bag and removed through a 5-6 cm suprapubic incision. Second, a different surgical team exteriorized the bowel through this incision and created a neobladder extracorporeally. Third, the neobladder was internalized, the incision closed and the primary surgeon completed the urethro-neovesical anastomosis with robotic assistance.RRCP was carried out in 14 men and three women by the primary surgeon (M.M.). The form of urinary reconstruction was ileal conduit in three, a W-pouch with a serosal-lined tunnel in 10, a double-chimney or a T-pouch with a serosal-lined tunnel in two each. The mean operative duration for robotic radical cystectomy, ileal conduit and orthotopic neobladder were 140, 120 and 168 min, respectively. The mean blood loss was < 150 mL. The number of lymph nodes removed was 4-27, with one patient having N1 disease. The margins of resection were free of tumour in all patients.We developed a technique for nerve-sparing RRCP using the da Vinci system which allows precise and rapid removal of the bladder with minimal blood loss. The bowel segment can be exteriorized and the most complex form of orthotopic bladder can be created through the incision used to deliver the cystectomy specimen. Performing this part of the operation extracorporeally reduced the operative duration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1464-410x.2003.04329.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100198850", "source": "openalex"}

They underwent 3 phases of a metabolic study, a placebo phase and 2 treatment phases in which they ingested either 1.2 1. orange juice (containing 60mEq. potassium and 190mEq. citrate per day) with meals or potassium citrate tablets (60mEq. per day) with water and meals. Compared to potassium citrate, orange juice delivered an equivalent alkali load and caused a similar increase in urinary pH (6.48 versus 6.75 from 5.71) and urinary citrate (952 versus 944 from 571mg. per day). Therefore, orange juice, like potassium citrate, decreased urinary undissociated uric acid levels and increased the inhibitor activity (formation product) of brushite (calcium phosphate). However, orange juice increased urinary oxalate and did not alter calcium excretion, whereas potassium citrate decreased urinary calcium without altering urinary oxalate. Thus, orange juice lacked the ability of potassium citrate to decrease urinary saturation of calcium oxalate. Overall, orange juice should be beneficial in the control of calcareous and uric acid nephrolithiasis. © 1993 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byAssimos D (2019) Re: The Effect of Lemonade and Diet Lemonade upon Urinary Parameters Affecting Calcium Urinary Stone FormationJournal of Urology, VOL. 201, NO. 5, (853-853), Online publication date: 1-May-2019.Pak C, Maalouf N, Rodgers K and Poindexter J (2018) Comparison of Semi-Empirical and Computer Derived Methods for Estimating Urinary Saturation of Calcium OxalateJournal of Urology, VOL. 182, NO. 6, (2951-2956), Online publication date: 1-Dec-2009.Pak C (2018) Medical Stone Management: 35 Years of AdvancesJournal of Urology, VOL. 180, NO. 3, (813-819), Online publication date: 1-Sep-2008.Pak C, Rodgers K, Poindexter J and Sakhaee K (2018) New Methods of Assessing Crystal Growth and Saturation of Brushite in Whole Urine: Effect of pH, Calcium and CitrateJournal of Urology, VOL. 180, NO. 4, (1532-1537), Online publication date: 1-Oct-2008.Kang D, Sur R, Haleblian G, Fitzsimons N, Borawski K and Preminger G (2018) Long-Term Lemonade Based Dietary Manipulation in Patients With Hypocitraturic NephrolithiasisJournal of Urology, VOL. 177, NO. 4, (1358-1362), Online publication date: 1-Apr-2007.GETTMAN M, OGAN K, BRINKLEY L, ADAMS-HUET B, PAK C and PEARLE M (2018) EFFECT OF CRANBERRY JUICE CONSUMPTION ON URINARY STONE RISK FACTORSJournal of Urology, VOL. 174, NO. 2, (590-594), Online publication date: 1-Aug-2005.GOLDFARB D and ASPLIN J (2018) EFFECT OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE ON URINARY LITHOGENICITYJournal of Urology, VOL. 166, NO. 1, (263-267), Online publication date: 1-Jul-2001.Whitson P, Pietrzyk R and Pak C (2018) RENAL STONE RISK ASSESSMENT DURING SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHTSJournal of Urology, VOL. 158, NO. 6, (2305-2310), Online publication date: 1-Dec-1997.Seltzer M, Low R, McDonald M, Shami G and Stoller M (2018) Dietary Manipulation With Lemonade to Treat Hypocitraturic Calcium NephrolithiasisJournal of Urology, VOL. 156, NO. 3, (907-909), Online publication date: 1-Sep-1996.Preminger G (2018) Editorial: Nephrolithiasis—Solutions for Emerging ProblemsJournal of Urology, VOL. 156, NO. 3, (910-911), Online publication date: 1-Sep-1996.Parivar F, Low R and Stoller M (2018) The Influence of Diet on Urinary Stone DiseaseJournal of Urology, VOL. 155, NO. 2, (432-440), Online publication date: 1-Feb-1996.Stoller M (2018) Editorial: Gout and Stones or Stones and Gout?Journal of Urology, VOL. 154, NO. 5, (1670-1670), Online publication date: 1-Nov-1995.Gupta M, Bolton D, Gupta P and Stoller M (2018) Improved Renal Function Following Aggressive Treatment of Urolithiasis and Concurrent Mild to Moderate Renal InsufficiencyJournal of Urology, VOL. 152, NO. 4, (1086-1090), Online publication date: 1-Oct-1994.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients referred from the urology service, in whom urinary tract abnormalities were strongly suspected, underwent multi-detector row CT urography. The technique included unenhanced, nephrographic, compression, and excretory-phase images through the abdomen and pelvis. Transverse images and three-dimensional reformations were reviewed by one of two radiologists. Findings were retrospectively compared with results of urinalysis, cystoscopy and/or ureteroscopy, and/or surgery. RESULTS: Multi-detector row CT urography depicted many clinically diagnosed urinary tract abnormalities, including 15 of 16 uroepithelial malignancies, five congenital anomalies, five urinary tract calculi, and 18 calyceal and/or papillary, 30 renal pelvic and/or ureteral, and 25 bladder abnormalities. All abnormalities were detected on transverse images. These abnormalities included diffuse urothelial wall thickening in four patients (three of whom had transitional cell carcinoma), a renal abscess, a colovesical fistula, and incidentally detected extrarenal disease (a liver mass, hepatic metastases, lymph node metastases, an aortic dissection, and a pheochromocytoma; each of these findings was seen in one patient). CONCLUSION: Multi-detector row CT urography is a useful method for detecting urinary tract abnormalities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2222010667", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094129583", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we used microarray expression profiling to examine the gene expression patterns in superficial transitional cell carcinoma (sTCC) with surrounding CIS (13 patients), without surrounding CIS lesions (15 patients), and in muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC; 13 patients). Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of CIS in the surrounding urothelium. We identified a few gene clusters that contained genes with similar expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with surrounding CIS and invasive TCC. However, no close relationship between TCC with adjacent CIS and invasive TCC was observed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Expression profiling of a series of biopsies from normal urothelium and urothelium with CIS lesions from the same urinary bladder revealed that the gene expression found in sTCC with surrounding CIS is found also in CIS biopsies as well as in histologically normal samples adjacent to the CIS lesions. Furthermore, we also identified similar gene expression changes in mTCC samples. We used a supervised learning approach to build a 16-gene molecular CIS classifier. The classifier was able to classify sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of surrounding CIS with a high accuracy. This study demonstrates that a CIS gene expression signature is present not only in CIS biopsies but also in sTCC, mTCC, and, remarkably, in histologically normal urothelium from bladders with CIS. Identification of this expression signature could provide guidance for the selection of therapy and follow-up regimen in patients with early stage bladder cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3620", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145424370", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the records of 303 children younger than 2 years with initial UTI investigated with DMSA scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography (VCU) within 3 months after UTI was performed. Results: In 156 of the 303 children (51%) DMSA scintigraphy showed renal lesions. VUR was found in 80 patients (26%) and VUR grade significantly correlated with the presence of renal lesions. A normal DMSA scintigraphy and dilating VUR (grade III) occurred in 7 infants. At followup after 1 to 2 years, 6 of these 7 patients had normal DMSA scans and 1 had a scarred duplex kidney. VUR resolved spontaneously in 5 and improved spontaneously to grade 1 in 2 patients. None of the 7 children had recurrent UTI. Conclusions: DMSA scintigraphy in infants with UTI may replace VCU as a first line investigation. A strategy to perform VCU in only patients with renal lesions is proposed. In this study 147 of 303 VCUs would have been unnecessary as only 1 child with a damaged kidney was missed. References 1 : Minimum incidence and diagnostic rate of first urinary tract infection.

We estimated 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion from a morning fasting urine sample (Kawasaki formula). We used restricted cubic spline plots to describe the association between sodium and potassium excretion and CV events and mortality, and to identify reference categories for sodium and potassium excretion. We used Cox proportional hazards multivariable models to determine the association of urinary sodium and potassium with CV events and mortality.CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF).At baseline, the mean (SD) estimated 24-hour excretion for sodium was 4.77 g (1.61); and for potassium was 2.19 g (0.57). After a median follow-up of 56 months, the composite outcome occurred in 4729 (16.4%) participants, including 2057 CV deaths, 1412 with MI, 1282 with stroke, and 1213 with hospitalization for CHF. Compared with the reference group with estimated baseline sodium excretion of 4 to 5.99 g per day (n = 14,156; 6.3% participants with CV death, 4.6% with MI, 4.2% with stroke, and 3.8% admitted to hospital with CHF), higher baseline sodium excretion was associated with an increased risk of CV death (9.7% for 7-8 g/day; hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26-1.86; and 11.2% for >8 g/day; HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.31-2.10), MI (6.8%; HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11-1.98 for >8 g/day), stroke (6.6%; HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.01 for >8 g/day), and hospitalization for CHF (6.5%; HR, 1.51; 1.12-2.05 for >8 g/day).

This activity is in turn controlled by neural circuits in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. Various neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, nitric oxide, and neuropeptides, have been implicated in the neural regulation of the lower urinary tract. Injuries or diseases of the nervous system, as well as drugs and disorders of the peripheral organs, can produce voiding dysfunctions such as urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence or inefficient voiding and urinary retention.

The long-term complete continence rate was 20 percent. Of the patients with wetness 55 percent had leakage of a few drops daily and 22 percent had leakage of less than a teaspoon. Of all patients 50 percent had leakage daily, 24 percent had leakage 1 or more times a week and wore an average of 1.5 pads per day, and 6 percent reported changing clothes due to wetness. A total of 90 percent of the patients reported satisfaction with the artificial urinary sphincter and 96 percent stated that they would recommend or had recommended the artificial urinary sphincter to a friend. In retrospect, 92 percent of the patients would have the artificial urinary sphincter placed again, 90 percent of those undergoing revision reported no change in satisfaction and 14 percent reported improved sexual activity. Conclusions: Patient satisfaction with the artificial urinary sphincter for post-prostatectomy incontinence is uniformly high. Although postoperative continence was not 100 percent, relative improvement in continence was the most significant factor affecting patient perceived outcome. Using these parameters criteria for a successful outcome can be established, and patient concerns regarding the artificial urinary sphincter can be dispelled.

Dietary estimates were converted to urine equivalents based on 79 pairs of dual measurements.Bayesian hierarchical modelling used survey data and their characteristics to estimate mean sodium intake, by sex, 5 years age group and associated uncertainty for persons aged 20+ in 187 countries in 1990 and 2010. Country-level covariates were national income/person and composition of food supplies.Mean sodium intake (g/day) as estimable by 24 h urine collections, without adjustment for non-urinary losses.In 2010, global mean sodium intake was 3.95 g/day (95% uncertainty interval: 3.89 to 4.01). This was nearly twice the WHO recommended limit of 2 g/day and equivalent to 10.06 (9.88-10.21) g/day of salt. Intake in men was ∼10% higher than in women; differences by age were small. Intakes were highest in East Asia, Central Asia and Eastern Europe (mean >4.2 g/day) and in Central Europe and Middle East/North Africa (3.9-4.2 g/day). Regional mean intakes in North America, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand ranged from 3.4 to 3.8 g/day. Intakes were lower (<3.3 g/day), but more uncertain, in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Between 1990 and 2010, modest, but uncertain, increases in sodium intakes were identified.Sodium intakes exceed the recommended levels in almost all countries with small differences by age and sex.

In this first phase 3 study we assessed the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Materials and Methods: A total of 683 North American women 22 to 84 years old were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo controlled study. The case definition included a predominant symptom of SUI with a weekly incontinence episode frequency (IEF) of 7 or greater, the absence of predominant symptoms of urge incontinence, normal diurnal and nocturnal frequency, a bladder capacity of 400 ml or greater, and a positive cough stress test and stress pad test. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo (339) or 80 mg duloxetine daily (344) as 40 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Primary outcome variables included IEF and an incontinence quality of life questionnaire. Van Elteren’s test was used to analyze percent changes in IEF with a stratification variable of weekly baseline IEF (less than 14 and 14 or greater). ANCOVA was used to analyze incontinence quality of life scores. RESULTS: Mean baseline IEF was 18 weekly and 436 subjects (64%) had a baseline IEF of 14 or greater. There was a significant decrease in IEF with duloxetine compared with placebo (50% vs 27%, p <0.001) with comparably significant improvements in quality of life (11.0 vs 6.8, p <0.001). Of subjects on duloxetine 51% had a 50% to 100% decrease in IEF compared with 34% of those on placebo (p <0.001). These improvements with duloxetine were associated with a significant increases in the voiding interval compared with placebo (20 vs 2 minutes, p <0.001) and they were observed across the spectrum of incontinence severity. The discontinuation rate for adverse events was 4% for placebo and 24% for duloxetine (p <0.001) with nausea the most common reason for discontinuation (6.4%). Nausea, which was also the most common side effect, tended to be mild to moderate and transient, usually resolving after 1 week to 1 month. Of the 78 women who experienced treatment emergent nausea while taking duloxetine 58 (74%) completed the trial. Conclusions: These phase 3 data are consistent with phase 2 data and they provide further evidence for the safety and efficacy of duloxetine as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of women with SUI.

Of the patients, 113 died. Mortality was increased in patients with baseline microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (odds ratios as compared with normoalbuminuria, 1.78 [P &amp;lt; 0.05] and 2.86 [P &amp;lt; 0.01]) and in patients with soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in the third tertile and C-reactive protein in the second and third tertiles (odds ratios as compared with the first tertile, 2.05 [ P &amp;lt; 0.01], and 1.80 [P &amp;lt; 0.05] and 2.92 [ P &amp;lt; 0.01]). These associations were mutually independent. The mean yearly change in urinary albumin excretion was 9.4%; in von Willebrand factor, 8.1%; in tissue-type plasminogen activator, 2.8%; in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, 5.2%; in soluble E-selectin, −2.3%; in C-reactive protein, 3.8%; and in fibrinogen, 2.3%. The longitudinal development of urinary albumin excretion was significantly and independently determined by baseline levels of and the longitudinal development of BMI, systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, glycated hemoglobin and plasma von Willebrand factor (baseline only), soluble E-selectin (baseline only), tissue-type plasminogen activator, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen. The longitudinal developments of markers of endothelial function and inflammation were interrelated. In type 2 diabetes, increased urinary albumin excretion, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation are interrelated processes that develop in parallel, progress with time, and are strongly and independently associated with risk of death.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2337/diabetes.51.4.1157", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171285048", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027509324", "title": "Multidisciplinary consensus on the classification of prenatal and postnatal urinary tract dilation (UTD classification system)", "text": "ObjectiveUrinary tract (UT) dilation is sonographically identified in 1–2% of fetuses and reflects a spectrum of possible uropathies. There is significant variability in the clinical management of individuals with prenatal UT dilation that stems from a paucity of evidence-based information correlating the severity of prenatal UT dilation to postnatal urological pathologies. The lack of correlation between prenatal and postnatal US findings and final urologic diagnosis has been problematic, in large measure because of a lack of consensus and uniformity in defining and classifying UT dilation. Consequently, there is a need for a unified classification system with an accepted standard terminology for the diagnosis and management of prenatal and postnatal UT dilation.MethodsA consensus meeting was convened on March 14–15, 2014, in Linthicum, Maryland, USA to propose: 1) a unified description of UT dilation that could be applied both prenatally and postnatally; and 2) a standardized scheme for the perinatal evaluation of these patients based on sonographic criteria (i.e. the classification system). The participating societies included American College of Radiology, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology, the Society for Fetal Urology, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the Society for Pediatric Urology, the Society for Pediatric Radiology and the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasounds.ResultsThe recommendations proposed in this consensus statement are based on a detailed analysis of the current literature and expert opinion representing common clinical practice. The proposed UTD Classification System (and hence the severity of the UT dilation) is based on six categories in US findings: 1) anterior-posterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD); 2) calyceal dilation; 3) renal parenchymal thickness; 4) renal parenchymal appearance; 5) bladder abnormalities; and 6) ureteral abnormalities. The classification system is stratified based on gestational age and whether the UT dilation is detected prenatally or postnatally. The panel also proposed a follow-up scheme based on the UTD classification.ConclusionThe proposed grading classification system will require extensive evaluation to assess its utility in predicting clinical outcomes. Currently, the grading system is correlated with the risk of postnatal uropathies. Future research will help to further refine the classification system to one that correlates with other clinical outcomes such as the need for surgical intervention or renal function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2014.10.002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027509324", "source": "openalex"}

An isolated ileal reservoir was constructed using the technique described for patients with a continent ileostomy. The ureters were implanted into an afferent segment provided with a reflux-preventing nipple valve. There were few operative complications and no operative mortality. Late complications involving malfunction of the nipple valves occurred in 8 patients and were corrected surgically. Postoperative followup presently is between 9 months and 6 1/2 years. Two patients have died: 1 in an accident and 1 of metastatic bladder carcinoma. The remaining 10 patients are continent and without reflux to the upper urinary tract. The reservoir generally is emptied by intermittent self-catheterization between 3 to 6 times daily. The volume capacity of the reservoir is more than 500 ml. Urinary cultures have been constantly negative in 7 patients and the contents of the reservoir more or less permanently contained bacteria in 5. Dilatation of the upper urinary tracts, progressive renal deterioration or metabolic disturbances have not been encountered. All patients are satisfied with this type of urinary diversion, especially those who have undergone other types of diversion previously.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-5347(17)53001-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013617338", "source": "openalex"}

Thus, there are concerns that the amount of BPA to which humans are exposed may cause adverse health effects. Importantly, results from a large number of biomonitoring studies are at odds with the results from two toxicokinetic studies.We examined several possibilities for why biomonitoring and toxicokinetic studies could come to seemingly conflicting conclusions.We examined > 80 published human biomonitoring studies that measured BPA concentrations in human tissues, urine, blood, and other fluids, along with two toxicokinetic studies of human BPA metabolism.The > 80 biomonitoring studies examined included measurements in thousands of individuals from several different countries, and these studies overwhelmingly detected BPA in individual adults, adolescents, and children. Unconjugated BPA was routinely detected in blood (in the nanograms per milliliter range), and conjugated BPA was routinely detected in the vast majority of urine samples (also in the nanograms per milliliter range). In stark contrast, toxicokinetic studies proposed that humans are not internally exposed to BPA. Some regulatory agencies have relied solely on these toxicokinetic models in their risk assessments.Available data from biomonitoring studies clearly indicate that the general population is exposed to BPA and is at risk from internal exposure to unconjugated BPA. The two toxicokinetic studies that suggested human BPA exposure is negligible have significant deficiencies, are directly contradicted by hypothesis-driven studies, and are therefore not reliable for risk assessment purposes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.0901716", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081746977", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2007193748", "title": "Association between Increases in Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase–associated Lipocalin and Acute Renal Dysfunction after Adult Cardiac Surgery", "text": "Acute renal dysfunction (ARD) and subsequent acute renal failure after cardiac surgery are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Early therapeutic or preventive intervention is hampered by the lack of an early biomarker for acute renal injury. Recent studies showed that urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL or lipocalin 2) is up-regulated early (within 1-3 h) after murine renal injury and in pediatric ARD after cardiac surgery. The authors hypothesized that postoperative urinary NGAL concentrations are increased in adult patients developing ARD after cardiac surgery compared with patients without ARD.After institutional review board approval, 81 cardiac surgical patients were prospectively studied. Urine samples were collected immediately before incision and at various time intervals after surgery for NGAL analysis by quantitative immunoblotting. ARD was defined as peak postoperative serum creatinine increase by 50% or greater compared with preoperative serum creatinine.Sixteen of 81 patients (20%) developed postoperative ARD, and the mean urinary NGAL concentrations in patients who developed ARD were significantly higher early after surgery (after 1 h: 4,195 +/- 6,520 [mean +/- SD] vs. 1,068 +/- 2,129 ng/ml; P < 0.01) compared with patients who did not develop ARD. Mean urinary NGAL concentrations continued to increase and remained significantly higher at 3 and 18 h after cardiac surgery in patients with ARD. In contrast, urinary NGAL in patients without ARD decreased rapidly after cardiac surgery.Patients developing postoperative ARD had significantly higher urinary NGAL concentrations early after cardiac surgery. Urinary NGAL may therefore be a useful early biomarker of ARD after cardiac surgery. These findings may facilitate the early detection of acute renal injury and potentially prevent progression to acute renal failure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200609000-00011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007193748", "source": "openalex"}

We describe our experience with complications during and after transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery after 9 years of practice. Materials and Methods: A total of 1,311 laparoscopic procedures were performed by 5 senior urologists in the same department since 1992, of which 72% were classified as difficult or very difficult (prostatectomy, nephrectomy for cancer, nephroureterectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, para-aortic lymph node dissection), 27.5% as moderately difficult (nephrectomy for benign disease, adrenalectomy, genitourinary prolapse, ureteropelvic junction, pelvic and ureteral stones, ureterovesical reimplantation, pelvic lymph node dissection) and 0.5% as easy (lymphocele, renal cyst and so forth). Results: There was no mortality or anesthetic complications. The overall transfusion rate was 2.4%. Complications were serious in 0.7% of cases, all of which required reoperation, intermediate in 1.8% of which 1% required reoperation and minor in 1.1%. The main complications were bowel (1.2%), vascular (0.5%) and ureteral injuries (0.8%). The conversion rate was 1.2% and the reoperation rate was 2.4%. Of the patients 1.2% had to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Postoperative complications were observed in 19% of cases. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with essentially the same complications as open surgery, and they, particularly bowel injuries and bleeding, can be diagnosed and often treated with repeat laparoscopy. Conclusions: Complications during and after transperitoneal laparoscopy remain low and are not superior to those observed during and after open surgery. As laparoscopy becomes more widely used, urologists wishing to learn this technique must realize that the learning process is long but essential. References 1 : Laparoscopic nephrectomy.

Population studies from numerous countries have reported that the prevalence of UI ranged from approximately 5% to 70%, with most studies reporting a prevalence of any UI in the range of 25–45%. Prevalence figures increase with increasing age, and in women aged ≥70 years more than 40% of the female population is affected. Prevalence rates are even higher in the elderly-elderly and amongst nursing home patients. There are only a few studies describing progression as well as remission of UI in the general population as well as in selected groups of the population. The mean annual incidence of UI has been reported to range from 1% to 9%, while estimates of remission are more varying, from 4% to 30%. The prevalence of UI is strongly related to the age of the woman and thus, due to the increase in mean life expectancy, the overall prevalence of UI in women is expected to increase in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2018.1543263", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2906018298", "source": "openalex"}

Case series and randomized controlled trials of the effect of surgical, behavioral and pharmacological weight loss on urinary incontinence are summarized.Epidemiological studies showed that obesity is a strong independent risk factor for prevalent and incident urinary incontinence. There was a clear dose-response effect of weight on urinary incontinence with each 5-unit increase in body mass index associated with about a 20% to 70% increase in the urinary incontinence risk, and the maximum effect of weight rarely exceeded an OR of greater than 4 to 5 on well controlled analyses. The odds of incident urinary incontinence during 5 to 10 years increased by approximately 30% to 60% for each 5-unit increase in body mass index. There may be a stronger association of increasing weight with prevalent and incident stress incontinence, including mixed incontinence, than with urge incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome. Weight loss studies indicated that surgical and nonsurgical weight loss led to significant improvements in urinary incontinence symptoms.Epidemiological studies document overweight and obesity as important risk factors for urinary incontinence. Weight loss by surgical and more conservative approaches is effective to decrease urinary incontinence symptoms and should be strongly considered a first line treatment in this patient population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2009.08.071", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088695478", "source": "openalex"}

The PEGylated MSNs of smaller particle size escape more easily from capture by liver, spleen, and lung tissues, possess longer blood-circulation lifetime, and are more slowly biodegraded and correspondingly have a lower excreted amount of degradation products in the urine.

Although biomarkers for nephrotoxicity are available, they often lack sensitivity and are not specific as indicators of epithelial cell injury. Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) is a type 1 membrane protein with extracellular immunoglobulin and mucin domains. The mRNA and protein for Kim-1 are expressed at very low levels in normal rodent kidney, but expression increases dramatically after injury in proximal tubule epithelial cells in postischemic rodent kidney and in humans during ischemic acute renal failure. To evaluate the utility of Kim-1 as a biomarker for other types of renal injury, we analyzed tissue and urinary expression in response to three different types of nephrotoxicants in the rat: S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine (TFEC), folic acid, and cisplatin. Marked increases in Kim-1 expression were confirmed by immunoblotting in all three models. The protein was shown to be localized to the proximal tubule epithelial cell by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, Kim-1 protein was detected in urine of toxicant-treated rats. The temporal pattern of expression in response to TFEC is similar to the Kim-1 expression pattern in the postischemic kidney. In folic acid-treated kidneys, Kim-1 is clearly localized to the apical brush border of the well-differentiated proximal tubular epithelial cells. After folic acid treatment, expression of Kim-1 is present in the urine despite no significant increase in serum creatinine. Cisplatin treatment results in early detection of urinary Kim-1 protein and diffuse Kim-1 expression in S3 cells of the proximal tubule. Kim-1 can be detected in the tissue and urine on days 1 and 2 after cisplatin administration, occurring before an increase in serum creatinine. The upregulation of expression of Kim-1 and its presence in the urine in response to exposure to various types of nephrotoxicants suggest that this protein may serve as a general biomarker for tubular injury and repair processes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00285.2002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068446361", "source": "openalex"}

A structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain ADHD diagnostic status, on the basis of slightly modified criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.One hundred nineteen children met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Children with higher urinary dialkyl phosphate concentrations, especially dimethyl alkylphosphate (DMAP) concentrations, were more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD. A 10-fold increase in DMAP concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.55 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.10), with adjustment for gender, age, race/ethnicity, poverty/income ratio, fasting duration, and urinary creatinine concentration. For the most-commonly detected DMAP metabolite, dimethyl thiophosphate, children with levels higher than the median of detectable concentrations had twice the odds of ADHD (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93 [95% confidence interval: 1.23-3.02]), compared with children with undetectable levels.These findings support the hypothesis that organophosphate exposure, at levels common among US children, may contribute to ADHD prevalence.

Preliminary data have suggested phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor efficacy in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and Methods: After a 4-week placebo run-in period 1,058 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia lower urinary tract symptoms were randomly allocated to receive 12-week, once daily treatment with placebo or tadalafil (2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg). Results: The International Prostate Symptom Score least squares mean change from baseline to end point was significantly improved for 2.5 (−3.9, p = 0.015), 5 (−4.9, p <0.001), 10 (−5.2, p <0.001) and 20 mg (−5.2, p <0.001) tadalafil compared to placebo (−2.3). International Prostate Symptom Score improvements at 4, 8 and 12 weeks were significant for all tadalafil doses and they demonstrated a dose-response relationship. Tadalafil (2.5 mg) significantly improved the International Prostate Symptom Score obstructive subscore and the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain, the latter in sexually active men with a history of erectile dysfunction. Statistically significant improvements were noted for 5, 10 and 20 mg tadalafil compared to placebo, as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score irritative and obstructive subscores, International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of Life, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (nonsignificant for 10 mg), Global Assessment Question and International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain. No statistically significant effect of treatment compared to placebo was noted for peak flow at any tadalafil dose. Treatment emergent adverse events were infrequent in all tadalafil groups. Conclusions: Once daily tadalafil demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant efficacy and it was well tolerated in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia lower urinary tract symptoms. Of the doses studied 5 mg tadalafil appeared to provide a positive risk-benefit profile. References 1 : Urologic Diseases in America Project: benign prostatic hyperplasia. J Urol2005; 173: 1256.

After this colonization, sterile artificial urine containing 1,000 micrograms of tobramycin per ml was flowed past this established biofilm, and a significant proportion of the bacterial cells within the biofilm were found to be still viable after 12 h of exposure to this very high concentration of aminoglycoside antibiotic. Planktonic (floating) cells taken from the test system just before the exposure of the biofilm to the antibiotic were completely killed by 50 micrograms of tobramycin per ml. The MIC of tobramycin for cells taken from the seeding cultures before colonization of the catheter material, and for surviving cells recovered directly from the tobramycin-treated biofilm, was found to be 0.4 micrograms/ml when dispersed cells were assayed by standard methods. These data indicate that growth within thick adherent biofilms confers a measure of tobramycin resistance on cells of P. aeruginosa.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.27.4.619", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2079130094", "source": "openalex"}

Here we review the epidemiology, virulence mechanisms, and host response to the most frequently isolated Gram-positive uropathogens: Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis , and Streptococcus agalactiae . We also review several emerging, rare, misclassified, and otherwise underreported Gram-positive pathogens of the urinary tract including Aerococcus , Corynebacterium, Actinobaculum, and Gardnerella . The literature strongly suggests that urologic diseases involving Gram-positive bacteria may be easily overlooked due to limited culture-based assays typically utilized for urine in hospital microbiology laboratories. Some UTIs are polymicrobial in nature, often involving one or more Gram-positive bacteria. We herein review the risk factors and recent evidence for mechanisms of bacterial synergy in experimental models of polymicrobial UTI. Recent experimental data has demonstrated that, despite being cleared quickly from the bladder, some Gram-positive bacteria can impact pathogenic outcomes of co-infecting organisms. When taken together, the available evidence argues that Gram-positive bacteria are important uropathogens in their own right, but that some can be easily overlooked because they are missed by routine diagnostic methods. Finally, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that a surprising variety of fastidious Gram-positive bacteria may either reside in or be regularly exposed to the urinary tract and further suggests that their presence is widespread among women, as well as men. Experimental studies in this area are needed; however, there is a growing appreciation that the composition of bacteria found in the bladder could be a potentially important determinant in urologic disease, including susceptibility to UTI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.uti-0012-2012", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2328462275", "source": "openalex"}

The oxidized DNA is continuously repaired and the oxidized bases are excreted in the urine. A simple routine analytical procedure is described for urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA damage adduct, as an indicator of oxidative damage in humans and rodents. This adduct was purified from human urine and characterized. The described assay employs a series of solid-phase extraction steps that separate 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine from other urinary constituents, followed by analysis by gradient reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a dual-electrode high-efficiency electrochemical detection system. Analysis of urine from three species by this method indicates that mice excrete approximately 3.3-fold more 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine than humans (582 vs. 178 residues per cell per day), a result that supports the proposal that oxidative damage to DNA increases in proportion to species-specific basal metabolic rates.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.86.24.9697", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010597170", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2124448307", "title": "Urinary Incontinence in US Women", "text": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disorder that is increasingly important as our population ages. Less is known about UI in younger women, and few large surveys have been able to determine risk factors by linking their data to patients' medical findings.We conducted a population-based, age-stratified postal survey of 6000 women aged between 30 and 90 years who were enrolled in a large health maintenance organization in Washington State.The response rate was 64% (n = 3536) after exclusion criteria were applied. The population-based prevalence of UI was 45%. Prevalence increased with age, from 28% for 30- to 39-year-old women to 55% for 80- to 90-year-old women. Eighteen percent of respondents reported severe UI. The prevalence of severe UI also increased notably with age, from 8% for 30- to 39-year-old women to 33% for 80- to 90-year-old women. Older age, higher body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), greater medical comorbidity, current major depression, a history of hysterectomy, and parity increased the odds of having UI. Not being white and having had only cesarean deliveries decreased the odds of having UI. Major depression (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-3.72) and obesity, defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-2.87), had the strongest association with UI. Among women with UI, age, BMI, medical comorbidity, current major depression, diabetes, a history of hysterectomy, and having had only cesarean deliveries were significantly associated with severe UI.Urinary incontinence is highly prevalent in women across their adult life span, and its severity increases linearly with age. Age, BMI, race, medical comorbidity, current major depression, a history of hysterectomy, parity, and having only had cesarean deliveries are each independent factors significantly associated with the likelihood of having UI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.5.537", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124448307", "source": "openalex"}

Multiple correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between cortisol levels and severity of PTSD that was due to a substantial association with scores on the avoidance subscale.The present findings replicate the authors' previous observation of low urinary cortisol excretion in combat veterans with PTSD and extend these findings to a non-treatment-seeking civilian group. The results also demonstrate that low cortisol levels are associated with PTSD symptoms of a clinically significant nature, rather than occurring as a result of exposure to trauma per se, and that low cortisol levels may persist for decades following exposure to trauma among individuals with chronic PTSD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.152.7.982", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1886580089", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2165375223", "title": "Integrative control of the lower urinary tract: preclinical perspective", "text": "Storage and periodic expulsion of urine is regulated by a neural control system in the brain and spinal cord that coordinates the reciprocal activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract (LUT): (a) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (b) an outlet (bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the urethral sphincter). Control of the bladder and urethral outlet is dependent on three sets of peripheral nerves: parasympathetic, sympathetic and somatic nerves that contain afferent as well as efferent pathways. Afferent neurons innervating the bladder have A‐δ or C‐fibre axons. Urine storage reflexes are organized in the spinal cord, whereas voiding reflexes are mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination centre (the pontine micturition centre) located in the brainstem. Storage and voiding reflexes are activated by mechanosensitive A‐δ afferents that respond to bladder distension. Many neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, nitric oxide and neuropeptides are involved in the neural control of the LUT. Injuries or diseases of the nervous system as well as disorders of the peripheral organs can produce LUT dysfunctions including: (1) urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence or (2) inefficient voiding and urinary retention. Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is triggered by C‐fibre bladder afferent axons, many of which terminate in the close proximity to the urothelium. The urothelial cells exhibit ‘neuron‐like’ properties that allow them to respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli and to release transmitters that can modulate the activity of afferent nerves.

Spiral computerized tomography (CT) is becoming a frequently used radiographic examination to establish the diagnosis and severity of calculus disease. Our objective for this study was to determine the precision of spiral CT in identifying the chemical composition of 6 different types of urinary calculi with region of interest measurements using spiral CT. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 chemically pure stones were separated into 6 groups. The stones along with phantoms containing butter (fat) and jello (water) were mounted vertically in the scanner gantry. Then 1 mm. thickness scanning was performed with a high speed scanner at the 2 energy levels of 80 and 120 kV. The determination of the chemical composition was performed using the absolute CT value measured at 120 kV. and the dual kilovolt CT values measured at 80 and 120 kV. Hounsfield unit at 80 kV. - Hounsfield unit at 120 kV.). Results: The absolute CT value measured at 120 kV. was able to identify precisely the chemical composition of uric acid, struvite and calcium oxalate stones. It was imprecise in differentiating calcium oxalate from brushite stone and struvite from cystine stone. However, dual kilovolt CT value was able to differentiate these latter stones with statistical significance (p <0.03). Uric acid stones were easily differentiated from all other stones using the absolute CT value. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the chemical composition of urinary calculi can be accurately determined by CT scanning in an in vitro setting.

Approximately 6.5 million of the 27 million white men who are 50 to 79 years old in the United States in 2000 were estimated to meet the criteria for discussing treatment. Materials and Methods: The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously. Results: In 2000 approximately 4.5 million visits were made to physician offices to for a primary diagnosis of BPH and almost 8 million visits were made with a primary or secondary diagnosis of BPH. In the same year approximately 87,400 prostatectomies for BPH were performed in inpatients in nonfederal hospitals in the United States. While the number of outpatient visits for BPH increased consistently during the 1990s, there was a dramatic decrease in the use of transurethral prostatectomy, inpatient hospitalization and length of hospital stay for this condition. These trends reflect the changing face of medical management for BPH, ie increasing use of pharmacological agents and minimally invasive therapies. In 2000 the direct cost of BPH treatment was estimated to be $1.1 billion exclusive of outpatient pharmaceuticals. Conclusions: Given the impact that BPH has on quality of life and health care cost in millions of American men, additional research into risk factors, diagnostic and therapeutic resource use, and effectiveness and cost benefit of therapies are warranted.

The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to Surgical Management of Stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society Guideline. Please refer to Part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the Guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. Results: The Panel identified 12 adult Index Patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional Index Patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, Guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management. Conclusions: Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This Guideline is intended for use in conjunction with the individual patient’s treatment goals. In all cases, patient preferences and personal goals should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2118051267", "title": "Detection of Intracellular Bacterial Communities in Human Urinary Tract Infection", "text": "Background Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections and are predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). While UTIs are typically considered extracellular infections, it has been recently demonstrated that UPEC bind to, invade, and replicate within the murine bladder urothelium to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). These IBCs dissociate and bacteria flux out of bladder facet cells, some with filamentous morphology, and ultimately establish quiescent intracellular reservoirs that can seed recurrent infection. This IBC pathogenic cycle has not yet been investigated in humans. In this study we sought to determine whether evidence of an IBC pathway could be found in urine specimens from women with acute UTI. Methods and Findings We collected midstream, clean-catch urine specimens from 80 young healthy women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and 20 asymptomatic women with a history of UTI. Investigators were blinded to culture results and clinical history. Samples were analyzed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy for evidence of exfoliated IBCs and filamentous bacteria. Evidence of IBCs was found in 14 of 80 (18%) urines from women with UTI. Filamentous bacteria were found in 33 of 80 (41%) urines from women with UTI. None of the 20 urines from the asymptomatic comparative group showed evidence of IBCs or filaments. Filamentous bacteria were present in all 14 of the urines with IBCs compared to 19 (29%) of 66 samples with no evidence of IBCs (p < 0.001). Of 65 urines from patients with E. coli infections, 14 (22%) had evidence of IBCs and 29 (45%) had filamentous bacteria, while none of the gram-positive infections had IBCs or filamentous bacteria. Conclusions The presence of exfoliated IBCs and filamentous bacteria in the urines of women with acute cystitis suggests that the IBC pathogenic pathway characterized in the murine model may occur in humans. The findings support the occurrence of an intracellular bacterial niche in some women with cystitis that may have important implications for UTI recurrence and treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040329", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118051267", "source": "openalex"}

To evaluate the role of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in increasing the frequency and severity of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and renal parenchymal damage among patients with acute pyelonephritis and to determine whether urinary antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the frequency and/or severity of UTIs and/or prevents renal parenchymal damage among patients with mild/moderate VUR. METHODS. Patients 3 months to 18 years of age with acute pyelonephritis, with or without VUR, were assigned randomly to receive urinary antibiotic prophylaxis or not. Patients were monitored every 3 months for 1 year. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans were repeated at 6 months or if there was a recurrence of febrile UTI. Urinalysis and urine culture were performed at each clinic visit. Renal ultrasound scans and voiding cystourethrograms were repeated at the end of 1 year of follow-up monitoring. RESULTS. Of the 236 patients enrolled in the study, 218 completed the 1-year follow-up monitoring. Groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and reflux grade distribution for those with VUR. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups with respect to rate of recurrent UTI, type of recurrence, rate of subsequent pyelonephritis, and development of renal parenchymal scars. CONCLUSIONS. After 1 year of follow-up monitoring, mild/moderate VUR does not increase the incidence of UTI, pyelonephritis, or renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis. Moreover, a role for urinary antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing the recurrence of infection and the development of renal scars is not supported by this study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2005-1362", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096930444", "source": "openalex"}

The primary outcomes included measures of stress incontinence (symptoms, stress testing, or treatment) and measures of urge symptoms. Enrollment was stopped after the first interim analysis because of a significantly lower frequency of stress incontinence in the group that underwent the Burch colposuspension.Of 322 women who underwent randomization, 157 were assigned to Burch colposuspension and 165 to the control group. Three months after surgery, 33.6 percent of the women in the Burch group and 57.4 percent of the controls met one or more of the criteria for stress incontinence (P<0.001) [Corrected]. There was no significant difference between the Burch group and the control group in the frequency of urge incontinence (32.7 percent vs. 38.4 percent, P=0.48). After surgery, women in the control group were more likely to report bothersome symptoms of stress incontinence than those in the Burch group who had stress incontinence (24.5 percent vs. 6.1 percent, P<0.001).In women without stress incontinence who are undergoing abdominal sacrocolpopexy for prolapse, Burch colposuspension significantly reduced postoperative symptoms of stress incontinence without increasing other lower urinary tract symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa054208", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976890255", "source": "openalex"}

After a baseline study period the stone formers were divided by randomization into 2 groups (1 and 2) and they were followed prospectively for 5 years. Followup in group 1 only involved a high intake of water without any dietetic change, while followup in group 2 did not involve any treatment. Each year clinical, laboratory and radiological evaluation was obtained to determine urinary stone risk profile (including relative supersaturations of calcium oxalate, brushite and uric acid by Equil 2), recurrence rate and mean time to relapse.The original urine volume was lower in male and female stone formers compared to controls (men with calcium oxalate stones 1,057 +/- 238 ml./24 hours versus normal men 1,401 +/- 562 ml./24 hours, p < 0.0001 and women calcium oxalate stones 990 +/- 230 ml./24 hours versus normal women 1,239 +/- 440 ml./24 hours, p < 0.001). During followup recurrences were noted within 5 years in 12 of 99 group 1 patients and in 27 of 100 group 2 patients (p = 0.008). The average interval for recurrences was 38.7 +/- 13.2 months in group 1 and 25.1 +/- 16.4 months in group 2 (p = 0.016). The relative supersaturations for calcium oxalate, brushite and uric acid were much greater in baseline urine of the stone patients in both groups compared to controls. During followup, baseline values decreased sharply only in group 1. Finally the baseline urine in patients with recurrences was characterized by a higher calcium excretion compared to urine of the patients without recurrences in both groups.We conclude that urine volume is a real stone risk factor in nephrolithiasis and that a large intake of water is the initial therapy for prevention of stone recurrences. In cases of hypercalciuria it is suitable to prescribe adjuvant specific diets or drug therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-5347(01)66321-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158124838", "source": "openalex"}

Summary and Background Data: The holmium: YAG laser is a solid-state, pulsed laser that emits light at 2100 nm. It combines the qualities of the carbon dioxide and neodymium: YAG lasers providing both tissue cutting and coagulation in a single device. Since the holmium wavelength can be transmitted down optical fibers, it is especially suited for endoscopic surgery. Methods: The authors provide a review of the literature as it relates to the holmium laser and its application to urology. Results: The holmium wavelength is strongly absorbed by water. Tissue ablation occurs superficially, providing for precise incision with a thermal injury zone ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. This level of coagulation is sufficient for adequate hemostasis. The most common urologic applications of the holmium laser that have been reported include incision of urethral and ureteral strictures; ablation of superficial transitional cell carcinoma; bladder neck incision and prostate resection; and lithotripsy of urinary calculi. Conclusions: The holmium:YAG laser is a multi-purpose, multi-specialty surgical laser. It has been shown to be safe and effective for multiple soft tissue applications and stone fragmentation. Its utilization in urology is anticipated to increase with time as a result of these features.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/clm.1998.16.13", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1540917893", "source": "openalex"}

In this study we examined epidemiological, economic and health care use trends for UTI in women in the United States. Materials and Methods: The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously. Results: The lifetime risk for UTI in women is high (greater than 50%). Between 1988 and 1994 the overall lifetime prevalence of UTI was estimated to be 53,067/100,000 women. Prescribing patterns demonstrated an increase in the trend toward using fluoroquinolones as first line therapy for UTI, which was associated with increased costs. Composite data revealed that overall expenditures for the treatment of UTIs in women in the United States, excluding spending on outpatient prescriptions, were approximately $2.47 billion in 2000. Diagnosis and treatment of UTI in women is performed in various clinical settings. Inpatient hospitalization for UTI care has generally decreased in younger women but increased in elderly women. There has been a sharp increase in emergency room use by younger women, which may reflect disparities in access to health insurance or primary care providers. Most outpatient care of women with UTIs is performed in physician offices. Conclusions: Analysis of health care use and economic data on UTIs in women revealed various interesting trends. These findings will help shape understanding of UTI treatment in relation to other urological disorders in women. The results raise various important future research questions.

Secondary outcomes included mean 72-hour urinary incontinence episodes measured by a 72-hour bladder diary (72-hour incontinence episodes). <h3>Results</h3> Among the 504 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 55.3 [8.4] years), 482 completed the study. Mean urine leakage at baseline was 18.4 g for the electroacupuncture group and 19.1 g for the sham electroacupuncture group. Mean 72-hour incontinence episodes were 7.9 for the electroacupuncture group and 7.7 for the sham electroacupuncture group. At week 6, the electroacupuncture group had greater decrease in mean urine leakage (−9.9 g) than the sham electroacupuncture group (−2.6 g) with a mean difference of 7.4 g (95% CI, 4.8 to 10.0;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). During some time periods, the change in the mean 72-hour incontinence episodes from baseline was greater with electroacupuncture than sham electroacupuncture with between-group differences of 1.0 episode in weeks 1 to 6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.7;<i>P</i> = .01), 2.0 episodes in weeks 15 to 18 (95% CI, 1.3-2.7;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and 2.1 episodes in weeks 27 to 30 (95% CI, 1.3-2.8;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 1.6% in the electroacupuncture group and 2.0% in the sham electroacupuncture group, and all events were classified as mild. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Among women with stress urinary incontinence, treatment with electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region, compared with sham electroacupuncture, resulted in less urine leakage after 6 weeks. Further research is needed to understand long-term efficacy and the mechanism of action of this intervention. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01784172.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.7220", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2724279953", "source": "openalex"}

However, controversy remains regarding the role of maintenance therapy, and its long-term effect on recurrence and progression. Materials and Methods: All patients in the study had transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with carcinoma in situ or an increased risk of recurrence. The criteria for increased risk were 2 or more episodes of tumor within the most recent year, or 3 or more tumors within 6 months. At least 1 week following biopsy of carcinoma in situ and resection of any stage Ta or T1 transitional cell tumors 660 patients were started on a 6-week induction course of intravesical and percutaneous Connaught BCG. Three months following initiation of BCG induction therapy 550 consenting patients were stratified by purified protein derivative skin test and the presence of carcinoma in situ, and then randomized by central computer to receive BCG maintenance therapy (maintenance arm) or no BCG maintenance therapy (no maintenance arm). Maintenance therapy consisted of intravesical and percutaneous BCG each week for 3 weeks given 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months from initiation of induction therapy. The 384 eligible patients who were disease-free at randomization constitute the primary intent to treat analytic group because they could be followed for disease recurrence. All patients were followed for adverse effects of treatment, recurrence, disease worsening and survival. Results: No toxicities above grade 3 were noted in the 243 maintenance arm patients. The policy of withholding maintenance BCG from patients with increased side effects may have diminished the opportunity to observe severe toxicity. Estimated median recurrence-free survival was 35.7 months (95% confidence interval 25.1 to 56.8) in the no maintenance and 76.8 months (64.3 to 93.2) in the maintenance arm (log rank p <0.0001). Estimated median time for worsening-free survival, defined as no evidence of progression including pathological stage T2 disease or greater, or the use of cystectomy, systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy, was 111.5 months in the no maintenance and not estimable in the maintenance arm (log rank p = 0.04). Overall 5-year survival was 78% in the no maintenance compared to 83% in the maintenance arm. Conclusions: Compared to standard induction therapy maintenance BCG immunotherapy was beneficial in patients with carcinoma in situ and select patients with Ta, T1 bladder cancer. Median recurrence-free survival time was twice as long in the 3-week maintenance arm compared to the no maintenance arm, and patients had significantly longer worsening-free survival.

Forty-two (71%) patients had a cystoscopy that showed various degrees of epithelial inflammation similar to that seen in chronic interstitial cystitis. All of 12 available bladder biopsies had histological features resembling those of interstitial cystitis. Urodynamically, either detrusor overactivity or decreased bladder compliance with or without vesico-ureteric reflux was detected to some degree in all of 47 patients. Thirty patients (51%) had unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis on renal ultrasonography, and four (7%) showed features suggestive of papillary necrosis on radiological imaging. Eight patients had a raised serum creatinine level.A syndrome of cystitis and contracted bladder can be associated with street-ketamine abuse. Secondary renal damage can occur in severe cases which might be irreversible, rendering patients dependent on dialysis. The present data do not establish the precise cause nor the incidence. Street-ketamine abuse is not only a drug problem, but might be associated with a serious urological condition causing a significant burden to healthcare resources.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2008.07920.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066655743", "source": "openalex"}

The immediate postoperative morbidity rate was 18 per cent. Increased morbidity was found in patients with a resection time of more than 90 minutes, gland size of more than 45gm., acute urinary retention and patient age greater than 80 years, and in the black population. Of the patients 77 per cent had significant pre-existing medical problems. Operative mortality, significant morbidity and hospital stay were reduced in comparison to studies done 15 and 30 years ago. © 1989 by The American Urological Association Education and Research,

This analytical approach allowed us to directly measure the individual phthalate metabolites responsible for the animal reproductive and developmental toxicity while avoiding contamination from the ubiquitous parent compounds. The monoesters with the highest urinary levels found were monoethyl phthalate (95th percentile, 3,750 ppb, 2,610 microg/g creatinine), monobutyl phthalate (95th percentile, 294 ppb, 162 microg/g creatinine), and monobenzyl phthalate (95th percentile, 137 ppb, 92 microg/g creatinine), reflecting exposure to diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, and benzyl butyl phthalate. Women of reproductive age (20-40 years) were found to have significantly higher levels of monobutyl phthalate, a reproductive and developmental toxicant in rodents, than other age/gender groups (p < 0.005). Current scientific and regulatory attention on phthalates has focused almost exclusively on health risks from exposure to only two phthalates, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-isononyl phthalate. Our findings strongly suggest that health-risk assessments for phthalate exposure in humans should include diethyl, dibutyl, and benzyl butyl phthalates.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.00108979", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097972057", "source": "openalex"}

The prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence during the previous 12 months were assessed by questionnaire. Factors potentially associated with urinary incontinence were assessed by questionnaire, interview, and physical examination. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent associations between these factors and the primary outcome of daily incontinence.Forty-one percent (3285) of the women reported urinary incontinence, with 14% (1130) reporting daily incontinence. In multivariate analysis, the prevalence of daily urinary incontinence increased significantly with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.3 per 5 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.5), prior hysterectomy (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.6), higher body mass index (OR 1.6 per 5 units, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), history of stroke (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7), diabetes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), and poor overall health (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.1). Faster gait speed (OR 0.8 per 0.2 units, 95% CI 0.6-1.0) was associated with decreased incontinence.Urinary incontinence is a common problem in older women, more common than most chronic medical conditions. Of the associated factors that are preventable or modifiable, obesity and hysterectomy may have the greatest impact on the prevalence of daily incontinence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0029-7844(96)00013-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023359850", "source": "openalex"}

We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess BPA variability and estimated associations between log10-transformed urinary BPA concentrations and demographic, occupational, dietary, and environmental factors, using mixed models.Geometric mean (GM) creatinine-standardized concentrations (micrograms per gram) were 1.7 (16 weeks), 2.0 (26 weeks), and 2.0 (birth). Creatinine-standardized BPA concentrations exhibited low reproducibility (ICC = 0.11). By occupation, cashiers had the highest BPA concentrations (GM: 2.8 μg/g). Consuming canned vegetables at least once a day was associated with higher BPA concentrations (GM = 2.3 μg/g) compared with those consuming no canned vegetables (GM = 1.6 μg/g). BPA concentrations did not vary by consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, canned fruit, or store-bought fresh and frozen fish. Urinary high-molecular-weight phthalate and serum tobacco smoke metabolite concentrations were positively associated with BPA concentrations.These results suggest numerous sources of BPA exposure during pregnancy. Etiological studies may need to measure urinary BPA concentrations more than once during pregnancy and adjust for phthalates and tobacco smoke exposures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1002366", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982404766", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike in younger adults, distinguishing symptomatic urinary tract infection from asymptomatic bacteriuria is problematic, as older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities, are less likely to present with localized genitourinary symptoms. Consensus guidelines have been published to assist clinicians with diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection; however, a single evidence-based approach to diagnosis of urinary tract infection does not exist. In the absence of a gold standard definition of urinary tract infection that clinicians agree upon, overtreatment with antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection remains a significant problem, and leads to a variety of negative consequences including the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Future studies improving the diagnostic accuracy of urinary tract infections are needed. This review will cover the prevalence, diagnosis and diagnostic challenges, management, and prevention of urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2217/ahe.13.38", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165998094", "source": "openalex"}

In this study we assessed temporal changes in urinary and sexual function up to 5 years following radical prostatectomy in a population based cohort.A sample of 1,288 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy and completed a baseline survey within 6 to 12 months of diagnosis were included in the analysis. Two and 5-year functional and quality of life data were collected, as was information on the use of erectile aids. Temporal functional changes and potentially confounding or modifying factors were assessed using longitudinal regression models.Of these men 14% reported frequent urinary leakage or no urinary control 60 months after diagnosis, which was slightly higher than the 10% reporting incontinence at 24 months (p = 0.007). At 60 months 28% of the men had erections firm enough for intercourse compared with 22% at 24 months (p = 0.003). Sildenafil was the most commonly used erectile aid (43% ever used) and 45% of users reported that it helped \"somewhat\" or \"a lot.\"Urinary and sexual dysfunction were common 5 years following radical prostatectomy in this large, community based cohort of prostate cancer survivors.

Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 109 patients referred for the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in our multicenter study. Patients were requested to complete a 72-hour micturition diary and pad test, and repeat each test during a 1-week interval. The test-retest reliability of various parameters of the 72-hour micturition diary and pad test was analyzed and compared. Further analysis was done to compare the test-retest reliability of 24, 48 and 72-hour studies performed on the same days after a 1-week interval. Reliability was assessed by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) with a cutoff value of 0.7 indicating test-retest reliability. Results: Of the 109 patients 106 (97%) with a median age of 64 years completed the study. The number of pads and total weight gain appeared to be reliable measures of the 24, 48 and 72-hour pad tests. For the 24-hour diary the total number of incontinence episodes was a reliable measure, while the total number of voiding episodes was marginally reliable (mean CCC 0.785 and 0.689, respectively). For the 48-hour diary the number of incontinence episodes and total number of voiding episodes were reliable measures (mean CCC 0.78 and 0.83, respectively), while for the 72-hour diary each parameter was highly reliable (CCC 0.86 and 0.826, respectively). However, an increased test period was associated with decreased patient compliance. Conclusions: The 24-hour pad test and micturition diary are reliable instruments for assessing the degree of urinary loss and number of incontinent episodes, respectively. Increasing test duration to 48 and 72 hours increases reliability but is associated with decreased patient compliance.

Dissecting the urethra at a more distal site increases the risk of urethral injury and erosion, and often the urethral circumference is so small that a 4 cm. cuff is too large. We present a novel technique for distal cuff placement using transcorporal dissection that leaves corporal tunica albuginea on the dorsal surface of the urethra, allowing for its safer mobilization and adding to its bulk. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the charts of 31 men who underwent this technique and contacted 26 by telephone. The indications for distal transcorporal cuff placement varied. In 7 men with inadequate urethral coaptation with a 4 cm. proximal cuff at initial implantation a primary transcorporal tandem cuff was implanted distal. In 8 men persistent or recurrent incontinence despite a 4 cm. proximal cuff led to secondary distal reimplantation. Previous artificial urinary sphincter erosion and/or infection in 10 cases, previous urethral surgery at the optimal cuff site in 5 and radiation changes at the optimal cuff site in 1 led to selection of the more distal site and technique. Of the transcorporally placed cuffs 18 were 4 cm. and 13 were 4.5 cm. Preoperatively 5.2 pads were used daily. Of the 31 patients 27 were impotent preoperatively, 1 had normal erections, 1 had partial erections with the MUSE drug delivery system (Vivus, Inc., Menlo Park, California) and 2 had a previously placed penile prosthesis. Results: At a mean followup of 17 months 26 of the 31 patients (84%) had occasional or no stress incontinence requiring 0 to 1 pad daily, 2 with pure urge incontinence used 1 to 2 pads daily and 3 had mixed incontinence requiring 0 to 3 pads daily. Of the 26 men surveyed 25 were very satisfied with the postoperative level of incontinence. Postoperatively erectile function deteriorated in 1 patient and was unchanged in the remainder. There was no erosion or infection of the transcorporally placed cuffs, although 3 were replaced for malfunction. Conclusions: This technique offers significant advantages in cases of revision. The technique protects the urethra from intraoperative dissection injury and decreases the risk of erosion because the urethra is buttressed at its vulnerable location. In addition, bulk is added to the urethra, allowing for better cuff sizing, which is usually a problem at this location where the urethra is small, thereby, improving continence in revised cases. Our success has recently led us to abandon tandem cuff placement altogether. There is a potential for deteriorating erectile function in potent men who undergo implantation in this fashion.

We previously demonstrated that high serum levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1), an antiangiogenic protein, and low levels of placental growth factor (PlGF), a proangiogenic protein, predict subsequent development of preeclampsia. In the absence of glomerular disease leading to proteinuria, sFlt1 is too large a molecule to be filtered into the urine, while PlGF is readily filtered.To test the hypothesis that urinary PlGF is reduced prior to onset of hypertension and proteinuria and that this reduction predicts preeclampsia.Nested case-control study within the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention trial of healthy nulliparous women enrolled at 5 US university medical centers during 1992-1995. Each woman with preeclampsia was matched to 1 normotensive control by enrollment site, gestational age at collection of the first serum specimen, and sample storage time at -70 degrees C. One hundred twenty pairs of women were randomly chosen for analysis of serum and urine specimens obtained before labor.Cross-sectional urinary PlGF concentrations, before and after normalization for urinary creatinine.Among normotensive controls, urinary PlGF increased during the first 2 trimesters, peaked at 29 to 32 weeks, and decreased thereafter. Among cases, before onset of preeclampsia the pattern of urinary PlGF was similar, but levels were significantly reduced beginning at 25 to 28 weeks. There were particularly large differences between controls and cases of preeclampsia with subsequent early onset of the disease or small-for-gestational-age infants. After onset of clinical disease, mean urinary PlGF in women with preeclampsia was 32 pg/mL, compared with 234 pg/mL in controls with fetuses of similar gestational age (P<.001). The adjusted odds ratio for the risk of preeclampsia to begin before 37 weeks of gestation for specimens obtained at 21 to 32 weeks, which were in the lowest quartile of control PlGF concentrations (<118 pg/mL), compared with all other quartiles, was 22.5 (95% confidence interval, 7.4-67.8).Decreased urinary PlGF at mid gestation is strongly associated with subsequent early development of preeclampsia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.1.77", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137433871", "source": "openalex"}

Catecholaminesecreting tumors were histologically proven. The sensitivity of fractionated plasma metanephrines was 97% (30 of 31 patients), compared with a sensitivity of 90% (28 of 31) for urinary total metanephrines and catecholamines (P = 0.63). The specificity of fractionated plasma metanephrines was 85% (221 of 261), compared with 98% (257 of 261; P < 0.001) for urinary measurements. The likelihood ratios for positive tests were 6.3 (95% confidence interval, 4.7 to 8.5) for fractionated plasma metanephrines and 58.9 (95% confidence interval, 22.1 to 156.9) for urinary total metanephrines and catecholamines. An adrenal pheochromocytoma was missed by urinary testing in two patients with familial syndromes and one asymptomatic patient with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass. An extra-adrenal paraganglioma was missed by plasma testing in one patient. In conclusion, measurements of 24-h urinary total metanephrines and catecholamines yield fewer false-positive results, an attribute preferred for testing low-risk patients, but fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements may be preferred in high-risk patients with familial endocrine syndromes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2002-021251", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979170245", "source": "openalex"}

Furthermore, studies now indicate that dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome is associated with pathological conditions. We propose that the urinary microbiome may influence chronic inflammation observed in the prostate, leading to prostate cancer development and progression. Therefore, we profiled the urinary microbiome in men with positive vs negative biopsies for prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Urine was collected from men prior to biopsy for prostate cancer. DNA was extracted from urine pellet samples and subjected to bacterial 16S rDNA Illumina® sequencing and 16S rDNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We determined the association between bacterial species and the presence or absence of cancer, cancer grade, and type and degree of prostate inflammation. Results: Urine samples revealed diverse bacterial populations. There were no significant differences in α or β diversity and no clear hierarchical clustering of benign or cancer samples. We identified a cluster of pro-inflammatory bacteria previously implicated in urogenital infections in a subset of samples. Many species, including known uropathogens, were significantly and differentially abundant among cancer and benign samples, in low vs higher grade cancers and in relation to prostate inflammation type and degree. Conclusions: To our knowledge we report the most comprehensive study to date of the male urinary microbiome and its relationship to prostate cancer. Our results suggest a prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria and uropathogens in the urinary tract of men with prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods: Questionnaire data from 1,271 men presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms in 12 countries were analyzed. Statistical methods included distributions, cross tabulations, chi-square analysis and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: Although prevalence and bothersomeness were moderately positively related, voiding symptoms were the most prevalent whereas the most bothersome were predominantly storage symptoms, including incontinence. While prevalence showed a broadly decreasing trend with age, bothersomeness was relatively unrelated to age. Conclusions: These findings suggest that symptom occurrence alone does not necessarily reflect the degree to which patients are bothered by lower urinary tract symptoms. Therefore, when deciding on treatment it is important not only to consider the presence and frequency of lower urinary tract symptoms but also the bother that they cause.

Materials and Methods: We evaluated a consecutive series of 536 patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy with attempted bilateral, unilateral or no nerve sparing, as defined by the surgeon, without prior radiotherapy at a minimum followup of 1 year with documented assessment of urinary continence status. Because outlet obstruction may influence continence rates, its incidence and management was also evaluated. Results: One year after surgery 505 of 536 patients (94.2%) were continent, 27 (5%) had grade I stress incontinence and 4 (0.8%) had grade II stress incontinence. Incontinence was found in 1 of 75 (1.3%), 11 of 322 (3.4%) and 19 of 139 patients (13.7%) with attempted bilateral, attempted unilateral and without attempted nerve sparing, respectively. The proportional differences were highly significant, favoring a nerve sparing technique (p <0.0001). On multiple logistic regression analysis attempted nerve sparing was the only statistically significant factor influencing urinary continence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy (OR 4.77, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.44, p = 0.0001). Outlet obstruction at the anastomotic site in 33 of the 536 men (6.2%) developed at a median of 8 weeks (IQR 4 to 12) and was managed by dilation or an endoscopic procedure. Conclusions: The incidence of incontinence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy is low and continence is highly associated with a nerve sparing technique. Therefore, nerve sparing should be attempted in all patients if the principles of oncological surgery are not compromised.
