Consequently, studies of the agreement between two instruments or clinical tests have proliferated in the ophthalmic literature. It is important that researchers apply the appropriate statistical tests in agreement studies. Correlation coefficients are hazardous and should be avoided.

Cerebral palsy (CP) and CVI share a common origin: 60 to 70% of children with CP also have CVI. We set out to describe visual dysfunction in children with CP. A further aim was to establish whether different types of CP are associated with different patterns of visual involvement. Methods A total of 129 patients (54 females, 75 males; mean age 4y 6mo, SD 3y 5mo; range 3mo–15y) with CP (51 with diplegia, 61 with tetraplegia, and 17 with hemiplegia; 62 [48%] of participants were able to walk) and CVI enrolled at the Centre of Child Neuro‐ophthalmology (at the Department of Child Neurology and Psychiatry, IRCCS ‘C. Mondino Institute of Neurology’, University of Pavia) underwent an assessment protocol including neurological examination, developmental and/or cognitive assessment, neuro‐ophthalmological evaluation including ophthalmological assessment, evaluation of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, optokinetic nystagmus, visual field and stereopsis, and neuroradiological investigations. Results Visual dysfunction in diplegia was characterized mainly by refractive errors (75% of patients), strabismus (90%), abnormal saccadic movements (86%), and reduced visual acuity (82%). The participants with hemiplegia showed strabismus (71%) and refractive errors (88%); oculomotor involvement was less frequent (59%). This group had the largest percentage of patients with altered visual field (64%). Children with tetraplegia showed a severe neuro‐ophthalmological profile, characterized by ocular abnormalities (98%), oculomotor dysfunction (100%), and reduced visual acuity (98%). Interpretation Neuro‐ophthalmological disorders are one of the main symptoms in CP. Each clinical type of CP is associated with a distinct neuro‐ophthalmological profile. Early and careful neuro‐ophthalmological assessment of children with CP is essential for an accurate diagnosis and for personalized rehabilitation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2012.04324.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1512096714", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2057038561", "title": "People and eyes: statistical approaches in ophthalmology", "text": "In conclusion, when an observation by its nature involves two eyes, as for blindness, statistical analyses should be conducted on individuals rather than eyes and between eye correlation is not a problem. In other circumstances, if information on only one eye per individual is used in the analysis there is a potential \"waste\" of information leading to less precise estimates of effect and less power. In addition, bias may be introduced into a study if there is non-random selection of the eye for inclusion in the analysis. The use of an overall summary of ocular findings for an individual may result in \"wastage\" of information in a similar fashion to the use of only one eye per individual. On the other hand, an analysis of individual eyes with no allowance made for between eye correlation may result in falsely narrow confidence intervals around estimates of effect. Between eyes correlation may be assessed empirically using the kappa statistic or similar means. If between eye correlation is substantial, statistical techniques exist which can utilise all available data while allowing for the correlation. In some circumstances a powerful design may be to use the fellow eye as a \"control\". Two conclusions may be drawn from this review of analytical approaches to the analysis of clinical data in the BJO. Firstly, the analytical approaches employed in many studies fail to use all the data available. In other words the analysis is less than \"optimal\". Secondly, in a proportion of studies, inappropriate statistical methods are used which may lead the investigator to draw inappropriate conclusions. In other words, the analysis is invalid. Ophthalmic data, by their very nature, present particular statistical challenges. We emphasise the need to involve appropriate statistical expertise in the design and analysis of ophthalmic studies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.82.8.971", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2057038561", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: This study describes the various ophthalmological conditions detected in the Swedish visual screening program for children. Methods: The study was longitudinal and retrospective. All children (3126) born in 1982 in three Swedish municipalities have been followed from birth to ten years of age. Visual acuity was examined at the ages of 4, 5.5, 7 and 10 years. Before the age of 4, a gross examination of the eyes was performed. Results: The prevalence of ametropia in the population was 7.7%, the prevalence of strabismus 3.1%, and the prevalence of organic lesions 0.6%. Seven children (0.2%) were visually handicapped (visual acuity ≤0.3 in the better eye). Refractive errors and microtropias were mainly detected at the age of 4, when the first visual acuity test was performed, while manifest strabismus was in many cases detected before this age. With this screening and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, the prevalence of deep amblyopia (visual acuity ≤0.3) has been reduced from 2% to 0.2%. With treatment, 47% of the amblyopic children achieved a visual acuity better than 0.7. Conclusion: Visual screening is effective in detecting visual and ocular disorders. Most conditions are discovered before the age of 6. Compared to an unscreened population, the prevalence of amblyopia is greatly reduced.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0420.2001.790306.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038945437", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients.Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts.A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted.We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04641-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3010267648", "source": "openalex"}

It is not a substitute but rather a substrate upon which cells can migrate and regenerate, forming new and healthy tissue. The amniotic membrane can also be used as a biologic patch, as a bandage, to treat acute inflammatory disorders. With the development of cell therapy, amniotic membrane can be also used as a carrier of limbal stem cells or their progeny, cultivated in vitro.Amniotic membrane use in ophthalmic surgery has been shown to provide an alternative for corneal and conjunctival reconstruction in many clinically challenging situations; however, there is still a lack of scientific evidence based on randomized comparative studies to prove that its use is better than other alternative therapies for ocular surface reconstruction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.icu.0000172827.31985.3a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991112222", "source": "openalex"}

To analyze some of these characteristics in very young children, the authors prospectively studied 100 consecutively admitted head-injured patients 24 months of age or younger who were drawn from three institutions. Mechanism of injury, injury type, and associated injuries were recorded. All patients underwent ophthalmologic examination to document the presence of retinal hemorrhages. An algorithm incorporating injury type, best history, and associated findings was used to classify each injury as inflicted or accidental. The results confirmed that most head injuries in children younger than 2 years of age occurred from falls, and while different fall heights were associated with different injury types, most household falls were neurologically benign. Using strict criteria, 24% of injuries were presumed inflicted, and an additional 32% were suspicious for abuse, neglect, or social or family problems. Intradural hemorrhage was much more likely to occur from motor vehicle accidents and inflicted injury than from any other mechanism, with the latter being the most common cause of mortality. Retinal hemorrhages were seen in serious accidental head injury but were most commonly encountered in inflicted injury. The presence of more serious injuries associated with particular mechanisms may be related to a predominance of rotational rather than translational forces acting on the head.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.90.2.179", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1894433771", "source": "openalex"}

Correlations between these data and income group, GDP per capita and prevalence rates of blindness and visual impairment were analysed. Results In 2015, there were an estimated 232 866 ophthalmologists in 194 countries. Income was positively associated with ophthalmologist density (a mean 3.7 per million population in low-income countries vs a mean 76.2 in high-income countries).

Currently regimens for prophylaxis against postsurgical endophthalmitis are being modified, including a total withdrawal of antibiotics in intravitreal injections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of PVI in ophthalmology. Recent findings As a result of its broad spectrum of microbicidal activity, PVI is routinely used in ophthalmic surgery. However, various protocols are applied worldwide and within different procedures. Additional indications include prophylaxis against ophthalmia neonatorum, acute conjunctivitis, adenoviral conjunctivitis, bacterial keratitis or corneal ulcer, endophthalmitis, giant fornix syndrome, and antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients with Boston type I keratoprosthesis. Summary Despite the introduction of new antiseptics in surgery, PVI is still the preeminent antiseptic measure in ophthalmology. Its use is economically reasonable. There have been no reports of resistance to PVI or anaphylaxis with topical ophthalmic use. Furthermore, it does not induce resistance or cross-grztance to antibiotics. With these advantages the range of indications for topical use of antibiotics might decrease, with PVI as the sole perioperative antiseptic measure.

However, the application of flipped classrooms in ophthalmology education has not been well investigated.Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and acceptability of the flipped classroom approach to teaching ophthalmology at the clerkship level.Design: Ninety-five fourth year medical students in an ophthalmology clerkship were randomly divided into two groups. An ocular trauma module was chosen for the content of this study. One group (FG (flipped group), n = 48) participated in flipped classroom instruction and was asked to watch a recorded lecture video and to read study materials before a face-to-face class meeting. They used the in-class time for discussion. The other group (TG (traditional group), n = 47) was assigned to traditional lecture-based instruction. These students attended a didactic lecture and completed assigned homework after the lecture. Feedback questionnaires were collected to compare students’ perspectives on the teaching approach they experienced and to evaluate students’ self-perceived competence and interest in ocular trauma. Pre- and post-tests were performed to assess student learning of the course materials.Results: More students in the FG agreed that the classroom helped to promote their learning motivation, improve their understanding of the course materials, and enhance their communication skill and clinical thinking. However, students in the FG did not show a preference for this method of teaching, and also reported more burden and pressure than those from the TG. Students from the FG performed better on the post test over the ocular trauma-related questions when compared to those from the TG.Conclusions: The flipped classroom approach shows promise in ophthalmology clerkship teaching. However, it has some drawbacks.

To account for the short depth of the focal area two suitable imaging conceptions are used: 1) synthetic aperture concept and 2) B/D-scan concept. To avoid the inhomogeneity of the images, different transmitter signals for each depth are applied, which are pseudoinversely prefiltered according to the transfer function of the tissue. To gain signal energy required for inverse filtering, a pulse compression technique with nonlinearly frequency modulated chirp signals is utilized.

We also detected increased frequency of convergence insufficiency, seborrhoic blepharitis, meibomian gland disease (MGD), dry eye syndrome, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract, and glaucoma (p<0.05). However, intraocular pressure (IOP) was significantly lower in the PD group compared to controls. The frequency of visual hallucinations, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and other ophthalmological diseases, as well as RT and RNFL thickness, did not significantly differ between investigated groups. Conclusions:Clinicians need to be aware of the association between PD and ophthalmological changes. Restoration of good-quality vision has a great impact on PD patients' quality of life, reduction of costs of treatment and care, and rehabilitation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.890861", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119737193", "source": "openalex"}

It causes suboptimal use of clinical and administrative staff and financial losses, as well as longer waiting times. The use of Short Message Service (SMS) appointment reminders potentially offers a cost-effective and time-efficient strategy to decrease non-attendance and so improve the efficiency of outpatient healthcare delivery. An SMS text message was sent to patients with scheduled appointments between April and September 2006 in a hospital ophthalmology department in London, reminding them of their appointments. This group acted as the intervention group. Controls were patients with scheduled ophthalmology appointments who did not receive an SMS or any alternative reminder. During the period of the study, 11.2% (50/447) of patients who received an SMS appointment reminder were non-attenders, compared to 18.1% (1720/9512) who did not receive an SMS reminder. Non-attendance rates were 38% lower in patients who received an SMS reminder than in patients who did not receive a reminder (RR of non-attendance = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.48 – 0.80). The use of SMS reminders for ophthalmology outpatient appointments was associated with a reduction of 38% in the likelihood of patients not attending their appointments, compared to no appointment reminder. The use of SMS reminders may also be more cost-effective than traditional appointment reminders and require less labour. These findings should be confirmed with a more rigorous study design before a wider roll-out.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2415-8-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2093530363", "source": "openalex"}

One of these strategies is the use of gold nanoparticles (GNP) for their multiple properties and their ability to be used as both diagnosis and therapy tools. This review exhaustively details research developing GNPs for use in ophthalmology. The toxicity of GNPs and their distribution in the eye are described through in vitro and in vivo studies. All publications addressing the pharmacokinetics of GNPs administered in the eye are extensively reviewed. In addition, their use as biosensors or for imaging with optical coherence tomography is illustrated. The future of GNPs for ophthalmic therapy is also discussed. GNPs can be used to deliver genes or drugs through different administration routes. Their antiangiogenic and anti‐inflammatory properties are of great interest for different ocular pathologies. Finally, GNPs can be used to improve stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, and photothermal therapy because of their many properties.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21509", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2803173642", "source": "openalex"}

A generative adversarial network (GAN), which consists of two competing types of deep neural networks, including a generator and a discriminator, has demonstrated remarkable performance in image synthesis and image-to-image translation. The adoption of GAN for medical imaging is increasing for image generation and translation, but it is not familiar to researchers in the field of ophthalmology. In this work, we present a literature review on the application of GAN in ophthalmology image domains to discuss important contributions and to identify potential future research directions. Methods We performed a survey on studies using GAN published before June 2021 only, and we introduced various applications of GAN in ophthalmology image domains. The search identified 48 peer-reviewed papers in the final review. The type of GAN used in the analysis, task, imaging domain, and the outcome were collected to verify the usefulness of the GAN. Results In ophthalmology image domains, GAN can perform segmentation, data augmentation, denoising, domain transfer, super-resolution, post-intervention prediction, and feature extraction. GAN techniques have established an extension of datasets and modalities in ophthalmology. GAN has several limitations, such as mode collapse, spatial deformities, unintended changes, and the generation of high-frequency noises and artifacts of checkerboard patterns. Conclusions The use of GAN has benefited the various tasks in ophthalmology image domains. Based on our observations, the adoption of GAN in ophthalmology is still in a very early stage of clinical validation compared with deep learning classification techniques because several problems need to be overcome for practical use. However, the proper selection of the GAN technique and statistical modeling of ocular imaging will greatly improve the performance of each image analysis. Finally, this survey would enable researchers to access the appropriate GAN technique to maximize the potential of ophthalmology datasets for deep learning research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40662-022-00277-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210482911", "source": "openalex"}

AI, which was first introduced in the 1950s, is defined as \"the machine simulation of human mental reasoning, decision making, and behavior\". The increased power of computing, expansion of storage capacity, and compilation of medical big data helped the AI implementation surge in medical practice and research. Ophthalmology is a leading medical specialty in applying AI in screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The first Food and Drug Administration approved autonomous diagnostic system served to diagnose and classify diabetic retinopathy. Other ophthalmic conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, and congenital cataract, among others, implemented AI too. Purpose: To review the contemporary literature of the bioethical issues of AI in medicine and ophthalmology, classify ethical issues in medical AI, and suggest possible standardizations of ethical frameworks for AI implementation. Methods: Keywords were searched on Google Scholar and PubMed between October 2019 and April 2020. The results were reviewed, cross-referenced, and summarized. A total of 284 references including articles, books, book chapters, and regulatory reports and statements were reviewed, and those that were relevant were cited in the paper. Results: Most sources that studied the use of AI in medicine explored the ethical aspects. Bioethical challenges of AI implementation in medicine were categorized into 6 main categories. These include machine training ethics, machine accuracy ethics, patient-related ethics, physician-related ethics, shared ethics, and roles of regulators. Conclusions: There are multiple stakeholders in the ethical issues surrounding AI in medicine and ophthalmology. Attention to the various aspects of ethics related to AI is important especially with the expanding use of AI.

Approximately 26% of the younger-onset and 36% of the older-onset diabetic population had never had an ophthalmologic examination. Characteristics of the younger-onset and older-onset population associated with never having had an ophthalmologic examination included living in a nonmetropolitan county, being older at the time of diagnosis, having a shorter duration of diabetes, having fewer years of education, receiving their diabetes care from a family or general practitioner, and having better visual acuity. Eleven percent of younger- and 7% of older-onset persons with Diabetic Retinopathy Study high-risk characteristics for severe visual loss had never been seen or were seen more than two years before the time of the study. Because severe visual loss caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy may be reduced by timely photocoagulation treatment, this study suggests that a large number of patients who would benefit from ophthalmologic care are currently not receiving it.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1984.03340430032024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035280495", "source": "openalex"}

The sugar is widespread in many species of plants and animals, where its function appears to be to protect cells against desiccation, but is not found in mammals. Trehalose has the ability to protect cellular membranes and labile proteins against damage and denaturation as a result of desiccation and oxidative stress. Trehalose appears to be the most effective sugar for protection against desiccation. Although the exact mechanism by which trehalose protects labile macromolecules and lipid membranes is unknown, credible hypotheses do exist. As well as being used in large quantities in the food industry, trehalose is used in the biopharmaceutical preservation of labile protein drugs and in the cryopreservation of human cells. Trehalose is under investigation for a number of medical applications, including the treatment of Huntington's chorea and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that trehalose can also prevent damage to mammalian eyes caused by desiccation and oxidative insult. These unique properties of trehalose have thus prompted its investigation as a component in treatment for dry eye syndrome. This interesting and unique disaccharide appears to have properties which may be exploited in ophthalmology and other disease states.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s18827", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101035904", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: To examine the age and sex‐specific prevalence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and its relationship with some ophthalmological variables. Methods: We carried out a population‐based study using a random sample taken from the national population census for citizens of Reykjavik, aged ≥ 50 years. A total of 1045 individuals participated in all parts of the study. Pseudoexfoliation was established by slit‐lamp examination with a maximally dilated pupil carried out by two experienced ophthalmologists, who were masked to one another’s results except in cases of disagreement where they had to reach a consensus. Results: In all, 108 (10.7%) persons were found to have PEX in at least one eye. Prevalence increased from 2.5% in those aged 50–59 years to 40.6% in those aged ≥ 80 years. Women were more frequently affected than men (12.3% versus 8.7%). This difference remained statistically significant after controlling for the effect of age (p &lt; 0.001). Eyes with PEX were found to have higher intraocular pressure (IOP) than eyes without PEX (p &lt; 0.05). However, PEX was not found to be related to central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, nuclear lens opacifications or optic disc morphology in a multivariate model. Conclusions: Pseudoexfoliation is an age‐related phenomenon commonly found in Iceland. It is more commonly found in women than in men and is associated with elevated IOP.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01051.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155953092", "source": "openalex"}

Eye platelet rich plasma (E-PRP) provides higher concentration of essential growth factors and cell adhesion molecules by concentrating platelets in a small volume of plasma as compared with autologous serum, the latter being used widely in ophthalmology for epithelial wound healing of the cornea for the last two decades. These growth factors and cell adhesion molecules have a major role in wound healing and enhance the physiological process at the site of the injury/surgery via eye drops or clot. E-PRP has been used more recently, and has achieved successful outcomes in peer-review articles in the treatment of dormant ulcers (epithelial defects of the cornea that fail to heal), moderate to severe dry eye syndrome, ocular surface syndrome post Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), and for surface reconstruction after corneal perforation associated with amniotic membrane transplantation. Preparation of E-PRP in the two available formulations, eyedrops and clot, is inexpensive and easy although it requires following strict sterility conditions using sterile and disposable materials and operating inside a laminar flow hood. No serious adverse effects have been described with the use of these products, and it is generally well tolerated. In summary, Platelet enriched plasma in the form obtained in ophthalmology, E-PRP, is a reliable and effective therapeutic tool to enhance epithelial wound healing in ocular surface disease.

Proangiogenic MMPs were upregulated in stromal fibroblasts in the vicinity of invading vessels following bFGF pellet implantation. Corneal neovascularization (NV) was also induced by intrastromal injection of MT1-MMP naked cDNA in conjunction with de-epithelialization. Partial limbal deficiency (HLD-) resulted in corneal NV in MMP-7 and MMP-3 knockout mice but not in wild type controls.Corneal angiogenic privilege is an active process involving the production of antiangiogenic factors to counterbalance the proangiogenic factors (which are upregulated after wound healing even in the absence of new vessels). Our finding that the potent antiangiogenic factors, angiostatin and endostatin, are colocalized with several MMPs during wound healing suggests that MMPs may be involved in the elaboration of these antiangiogenic molecules by proteolytic processing of substrates within the cornea.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1557246082", "source": "openalex"}

Mutation analyses and detailed clinical evaluations were performed in 43 individuals with aniridia or closely related ocular anomalies, to investigate whether phenotype correlates with mutation type.Case notes and medical records were reviewed and patients were reexamined when necessary. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis and sequencing of the PAX6 coding region was performed in individuals whose mutation was unknown.The most common PAX6 mutations identified were premature termination mutations, amino acid substitutions, and C-terminal extensions. Six novel mutations are reported. Mutations that inactivate one copy of the gene typically caused a severe phenotype including foveal hypoplasia, marked iris anomalies, and severe visual impairment. Missense mutations, all affecting invariant amino acids in the paired domain, caused milder phenotypes in this cohort, with a lower incidence of foveal hypoplasia and less severe visual loss. C-terminal extension mutations caused relatively severe anomalies and marked reduction in vision. Two C-terminal extension cases had a unilateral exudative retinopathy, resembling Coats' disease, which has not previously been reported in association with PAX6 mutation.PAX6 mutations cause panocular malformations that vary considerably in pattern and severity. In our cohort, iris hypoplasia, nystagmus, and foveal hypoplasia were most common, with cataracts, corneal anomalies, and high refractive errors also frequently observed. In this cohort, loss-of-function and C-terminal extension mutations were found to cause more severe phenotypes than missense mutations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.08-2827", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027886945", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2039957409", "title": "Topical Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs in Ophthalmology", "text": "Topically applied nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the management of postoperative ocular inflammation and for the prevention and treatment of cystoid macular edema (CME) after cataract surgery. In addition, they are useful for the prevention of intraoperative miosis during cataract surgery, for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, and for the reduction of ocular discomfort after refractive surgery. 1,2 In this chapter, the current status of topically applied NSAIDs and their potential therapeutic benefit for ophthalmic disorders are summarized. Chemical Classification and Commercial Preparations Commercially available NSAIDs consist of a chemically heterogeneous group of compounds that can be grouped into six major classes: salicylates, fenamates, indoles, phenylalkanoic acids, phenylacetic acids, and pyrazolones. The classification of this group of drugs as NSAIDs serves to underscore that their chemical structures lack a steroid nucleus that is biosynthetically derived from cholesterol. This ophthalmic clinical pharmacology review will emphasize the indoles, the phenylacetic acids, and the phenylalkanoic acids, because they are commercially available throughout the world as topically applied ophthalmic preparations. The salicylates, fenamates, and pyrazolone derivatives are either too toxic or too unstable in solution for commercial formulation as eye drops. Indomethacin, an indole derivative, was initially formulated as a sesame seed oil solution. However, this preparation was locally irritating and unsuitable for widespread clinical use. Today topical indomethacin is commercially available outside of the United States as a 1% aqueous suspension (Indocid Ophthalmic Suspension, Merck, Sharp & Dohme). Although a 0.1% indomethacin ophthalmic solution has been formulated, it is not commercially available. 3 The phenylalkanoic acids are water-soluble. This pharmacological group includes flurbiprofen, suprofen, and ketorolac. Because of their favorable solubility characteristics, these acids are formulated as ophthalmic solutions. Flurbiprofen 0.03% (Ocufen Ophthalmic Solution, Allergan) and suprofen 1% (Profenal Ophthalmic Solution, Alcon) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intraoperative use to inhibit excessive miosis during cataract surgery. Ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% (Acular Ophthalmic Solution, Allergan) is approved in the United States for the treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery and for use after refractive surgery. It is the only topically effective NSAID that is available in a preservative-free formulation (Acular PF Ophthalmic Solution, Allergan). Diclofenac 1% (Voltaren, Novartis Ophthalmics) is a phenylacetic acid derivative that is readily soluble in water and is, therefore, available as an ophthalmic solution. Its use is approved by the FDA for minimizing postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery and for minimizing pain and photophobia after refractive surgery. Diclofenac 1% formerly was available also in a generic form (Falcon, Alcon) approved for treatment of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery. This generic form of diclofenac was preserved with polyquad polyquaternium-1 and included tocophersolan and mannitol as emollients. These excipients differ from those present in Voltaren 1%, which is preserved with sorbic acid and edetate sodium and includes polyoxyl-35 as an emollient. The potential significance of these differences in formulation is not clear. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics can be defined as the action of one's body on a drug after the drug's administration. Although all NSAIDs are well absorbed after oral ingestion, with peak serum levels achieved in 1 to 3 hours, ocular instillation of topical NSAIDs provides ocular tissue and aqueous humor levels adequate to inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. In fact, commercially available, topically applied NSAIDs appear to penetrate the eye better after topical application than after oral administration. This observation makes it unreasonable for ophthalmologists to prescribe systemic NSAIDs to achieve most ocular therapeutic effects. This is particularly true in light of the enhanced likelihood for undesirable systemic side effects that can accompany the oral administration of these agents. NSAIDs are metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine and the bile. All these drugs are 90% to 99% protein-bound and, therefore, are easily recovered from ocular tissues after topical or systemic administration. Topically applied NSAIDs can gain access to the systemic circulation after mucosal absorption from the nasolacrimal outflow system. Therefore, even local administration of NSAIDs can be accompanied by systemic toxicity, particularly if nasolacrimal occlusion and eyelid closure are not employed after eye drop instillation. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics is defined as the action of a drug on one's body. Many investigators cite the pharmacodynamic relationship of NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. More specifically, aspirin and other NSAIDs decrease the synthesis of PGs within our tissues by inhibiting cyclooxygenase. This enzyme facilitates the formation of endoperoxides from arachidonic acid by participating in the cascade of reactions that ultimately generate PGs within our bodies. The resultant endogenous PGs can produce many pharmacological effects, including miosis, increased permeability of the blood-ocular barriers, conjunctival hyperemia, and changes in intraocular pressure. In addition, PGs are known to possess chemokinetic activity, can serve as mediators of humoral and cellular phases of inflammatory responses, and are associated with the pain response and allergic reactions. Although NSAIDs do not inhibit lipoxygenase and, therefore, have no direct ability to inhibit the generation of endogenous leukotrienes, diclofenac appears capable of reducing the level of leukotriene formation in vitro by an indirect means. 4 There is evidence that NSAIDs have a free radical scavenger activity that may be beneficial during inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of COI activity is clearly not the only potential mechanism of activity for this group of drugs. 1 Maintenance of Mydriasis During Cataract Surgery Flurbiprofen 0.03% and suprofen 1% were the first NSAIDs approved by the FDA for use as intraoperative inhibitors of miosis during cataract surgery. This pharmacological activity is of clinical benefit because decreasing pupil size is a recognized risk factor for vitreous loss and zonular breaks during cataract surgery involving implantation of an intraocular lens. 1 Many clinical studies report that preoperative NSAID application provides a significant pharmacological effect to prevent excessive miosis during cataract surgery. All the commercially available topical NSAIDs appear to share this therapeutic benefit. 5–7 However, the FDA's summary Bases of approval for flurbiprofen and suprofen suggest that the pharmacological effect of these NSAIDs on pupil size varies from one surgical practice to another, as previously discussed. 2 This suggests that endogenous factors other than PG-induced miosis and surgical technique are playing important, and as yet undefined, roles in the etiology of surgically induced miosis. Although most ophthalmologists prefer using topical NSAIDs prior to performing cataract surgery, it is probably unreasonable to require the routine use of these agents for all ophthalmic practices, because adequate intraoperative mydriasis can frequently be achieved and maintained by the use of good surgical technique, a combination of preoperative parasympatholytic and sympathomimetic eye drop therapy, and a sympathomimetic in the intraocular irrigation solution used for irrigation and aspiration of cortical remnants. Postoperative Inflammation After Cataract Surgery Double-masked, prospective, randomized, active and placebo-controlled clinical studies provide good evidence that topical NSAIDs are potentially useful in limitating excessive postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery. 1,2 However, it is of historical interest that during the 1970s, several studies evaluated the effect of topically applied indomethacin on the inflammatory response in the early postoperative period after ocular surgeries, with inconsistent results. Once studies were designed to evaluate the effects of indomethacin given prior to and immediately after the surgical procedures, the results were more impressive. It is interesting that, at present, topically applied NSAIDs are officially approved by the FDA for only postoperative use. However, it has become the standard of care to use these agents both preoperatively and postoperatively to provide better antiinflammatory control and help to discourage undesired miosis during the surgical procedure. Well-designed studies support this preoperative dosage regimen. 6,7 Many studies of NSAID effects on postoperative inflammation include the concurrent administration of corticosteroids. There is good evidence that NSAIDs and corticosteroids have a potential for synergistic activity. 8,9 Therefore, it is difficult to conclude from these studies whether the observed effects on postoperative inflammation are related to NSAID treatment alone or to a synergistic effect resulting from the combined pharmacological activities of the NSAID and corticosteroid. It is also possible that the concurrent corticosteroid treatment may mask the tendency for any given NSAID to cause ocular irritiation. Double-masked, randomized, active and placebo-controlled studies including patients undergoing cataract surgery have reported antiinflammatory effects from topically applied 1% indomethacin, 0.03% flurbiprofen, 0.5% ketorolac, and 0.1% diclofenac ophthalmic preparations. 1,2 These investigations report a measurable antiinflammatory effect from topical NSAID treatments as compared to placebo after intracapsular and extracapsular cataract extractions, with and without implantation of an intraocular lens. The correlation between slit-lamp observations and anterior ocular fluorophotometry appears consistent. In addition, studies using laser cell flare meter methodology provide further support for this potentially beneficial therapeutic benefit. 10–12 Studies comparing NSAIDs to corticosteroids have demonstrated no significant difference in the results of these treatments as judged by slit-lamp examinations for cells, flare, and chemosis, but NSAID treatment appears to be more effective than topical steroids in reestablishing the blood-aqueous barrier, as quantitatively measured with anterior ocular fluorophotometry. 1,2,10 A double-masked, prospective, randomized study of 120 patients after cataract surgery and implantation of an intraocular lens showed no statistical difference between the antiinflammatory effects of postoperatively administered ketorolac 0.5% and diclofenac 0.1% ophthalmic solutions, as evaluated with slit-lamp examinations and laser cell flare measurements. 12 In summary, many well-designed clinical studies provide evidence that topically applied NSAID ophthalmic preparations are potentially useful in the management of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery. Furthermore, there is good evidence that this treatment is potentially beneficial even with the application of current surgical technology. 13 Although the various topical NSAID preparations previously mentioned are available and used throughout the world for avoiding excessive inflammation after cataract surgery, at the time of this writing diclofenac 0.1% (Voltaren) and ketorolac 0.5% (Acular) ophthalmic solutions are the only topically applied NSAIDs specifically approved by the FDA for this indication in the United States. Prevention and Treatment of CME After Cataract Surgery Excellent reviews have summarized potential approaches to the prevention and treatment of CME after cataract surgery. 14,15 These reviews stress the importance of placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized trials in influencing decisions about the efficacy of potential treatments for CME after cataract surgery, because this syndrome's natural history includes spontaneous resolution. In addition, evaluating prophylactic therapy separately from the treatment of chronic CME is emphasized, as is the importance of differentiating between asymptomatic angiographic CME and clinically significant CME, which is associated with a reduction in vision. There is no FDA-approved therapy for the prevention and treatment of CME after cataract surgery. However, a recently completed metaanalysis concludes that application of a topical NSAID for this indication is potentially beneficial. 16 This metaanalysis is in agreement with a recent review article on this subject. 17 Although NSAIDs are effective in the prophylaxis of angiographic CME, a significant and sustained effect on visual acuity has not been demonstrated. 1,2,14,15,17 In addition, most of the studies of prophylactic NSAID therapy include the concurrent use of corticosteroids. Insofar as corticosteroids inhibit the generation of PGs by a different mechanism than do NSAIDs, the possibility exists for a synergistic effect when these drugs are used together. A large, randomized, double-masked clinical trial has compared 0.03% flurbiprofen, 1% indomethacin, and placebo for their ability to prevent CME during a 6-month period after cataract surgery, as assessed by Snellen and contrast sensitivity measurements. 18 The incidence of clinical CME as determined by contrast sensitivity scores was significantly lower for the drug-treated groups, but the effects were not sustained. In addition, this study involved concurrent use of corticosteroids. To date, there is only one randomized, double-masked study of prophylaxis of CME using NSAIDs without concurrent corticosteroids: It reports less postoperative angiographic CME in the group treated with ketorolac 0.5% as compared to the placebo group. 19 Although there are fewer studies of the treatment of chronic CME (defined as reduced vision associated with CME that has been present for at least 6 months), two double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized studies in which corticosteroids were not used demonstrate that ketorolac 0.5% ophthalmic solution, administered as a single drop four times daily for up to 3 months, improves vision in some patients with chronic CME after cataract surgery. 20,21 These studies provide evidence that this topical NSAID treatment offers benefit to some patients for the prevention and treatment of CME after cataract surgery. In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that the concurrent administration of corticosteroids and NSAIDs may provide a synergistic activity resulting in more rapid resolution of symptomatic CME. 8 The potential application of topical NSAIDs for the treatment and prevention of CME is discussed in greater detail and compared to other potential treatments (including corticosteroids, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and hyperbaric oxygen) in a recent publication. 17 Allergic Conjunctivitis On the basis of evidence that ketorolac 0.5% ophthalmic solution administered as one drop four times daily is effective in reducing the ocular pruritis that often accompanies seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, 22 the FDA has approved this preparation (Acular) for use in the United States. In addition, some studies suggest that diclofenac (Voltaren) also is effective in treating seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, 23 and there are reports of potentially useful effects after suprofen (Profenal) treatment of giant papillary conjunctivitis and vernal conjunctivitis. 24,25 Topical corticosteroids are commonly used in an attempt to reduce the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Unfortunately, their use can be accompanied by local toxicity, including secondary open-angle glaucoma, cataracts, superinfections with viruses or fungi, and impaired wound healing. Therefore, topically applied NSAIDs offer a potentially safer alternative to minimizing the signs and symptoms of allergic eye disease. Reduction of Discomfort After Refractive Surgery Ketorolac and diclofenac are approved for use within the United States to reduce pain and photophobia after refractive surgery. 26–28 In addition, some practitioners use topically applied NSAIDs to reduce pain after corneal abrasions. One randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 100 patients has shown that the healing time was not significantly different for patients who were patched after noninfected, non–contact lens–related, traumatic, or foreign-body removal–related corneal abrasions measuring less than 10 mm as compared to patients who received topical ketorolac 0.5% four times daily without patching. All patients also received topical antibiotics. 29 Miscellaneous Potential Uses of Topical NSAIDs Clinical studies have suggested a potential application for topical NSAIDs for the treatment of inflamed pinguecula and pterygia, argon laser trabeculoplasty, glaucoma, strabismus, refractive errors, and the management of pain and inflammation associated with corneal abrasions. 30–35 Laboratory studies have suggested that diclofenac might have a unique effect in preventing posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery. 36 However, a randomized, double-masked, prospective clinical comparison of diclofenac 0.1% and ketorolac 0.5% given as one drop four times daily after cataract surgery and implantation of an intraocular lens did not demonstrate a difference in these drugs abilities to prevent posterior capsule opacification, as determined 3 years postoperatively. 37 Local and Systemic Toxicity of Topical NSAIDs The most common adverse reactions after topical instillation of the NSAIDs are transient burning, stinging, and hyperemia of the conjunctiva. Manufacturers have used various formulation methods to minimize this potential discomfort. For example, indomethacin solution in sesame seed oil was abandoned in favor of an aqueous suspension. Suprofen is prepared with 1% caffeine, because it is less irritating. Ketorolac is formulated as the tromethamine salt, because the tromethamine moiety enhances the aqueous solubility and results in a solution that is less irritating to the eye. Despite these improvements, some patients will experience local discomfort after instillation of these preparations. In addition, allergies and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with all the NSAIDs. Corneal complications after topical NSAID use are uncommon. However, superficial punctate keratitis, corneal infiltrates, and epithelial defects have been reported after use of these agents. 38–41 This is not surprising, because most preserved eye-drops can cause minor, transient corneal changes. 42,43 The recent reports of corneal melting is surprising and of great interest. 44 Although we await a complete and careful analysis of these cases of severe toxicity, thus far any potentially severe corneal toxicity appears to be more likely associated with generic diclofenac (Falcon, Alcon). However, even in these cases, the inconsistent and variable dose-toxicity relationships do not suggest a simple drug toxicity. Furthermore, the lack of a definitive diagnosis and indication for treatment, the concurrent presence of ocular disease, and use of additional medications in many of these cases complicates the analysis. 45–48 For example, many of the reported cases occur in patients with insufficient tear production who are concurrently using corticosteroids. These are important considerations, because corneal perforations have been reported in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with dry eyes and in patients using only corticosteroids. 49–52 Practitioners can minimize the occurrence of corneal toxicity by attempting to make a definitive diagnosis before initiating antiinflammatory treatment and by conducting careful postoperative follow-up examinations. Systemic administration of NSAIDs can be accompanied by serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal, central nervous system, hematological, renal, liver, dermatological, and metabolic changes. However, such effects appear to be largely avoided by topical NSAID administration. The possibility of systemic absorption exists after topical application, but whether this represents a clinically significant problem is not clear. 1 Although the literature describes less toxicity associated with the topical use of NSAIDs than with topically applied corticosteroids, NSAIDs have been used far less extensively. Furthermore, there are some theoretical objections to the inhibition of only the cyclooxygenase inhibitor pathway for PG generation. Although an aggravation of ocular inflammation has not been observed in any of the clinical studies of NSAID use thus far reported, it is premature to assume that this treatment is completely safe. Therefore, NSAID use must be carefully monitored for adverse events, as is good practice with any new drug treatment.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3013612297", "title": "Visual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: pathophysiology and management", "text": "Visual hallucinations are common in older people and are especially associated with ophthalmological and neurological disorders, including dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson’s disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop. Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations.

Ophthalmic photocoagulation was the first medical laser application and has restored or maintained vision in millions of people. More recently, photodisruption and, increasingly, ablation have gained prominence for treating a wide range of ocular pathology. The unique properties of lasers have also been harnessed for diagnostic purposes, with optical coherence tomography representing a significant improvement over existing imaging methods. Many ophthalmic applications of lasers have been developed, but the field is a dynamic one which continues to evolve along with laser technology itself. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/lsm.1900170203", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987603498", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike opsoclonus, less characteristic eye movement abnormalities are difficult to recognize as presenting symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes. In this setting, the detection of several antibodies, including anti-Hu, Yo, Ma2, Ri, Tr, CV2/CRMP5 or voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies may help to establish that the neuro-ophthalmological disorder is paraneoplastic. Among the recently characterized antibodies, those against the Ma proteins often associate with brainstem encephalitis and vertical gaze paralysis. A small subset of patients with opsoclonus and ataxia harbor anti-Ri antibodies. In other patients, there is preliminary evidence that the autoantigens of opsoclonus reside in the postsynaptic density, but no dominant antibody marker has been identified. Uveitis and optic neuritis are rare accompaniments of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis; some of these patients harbor anti-CV2/CRMP5 in association with other antibodies. Studies on paraneoplastic retinopathy indicate that immunity to retinal proteins other than recoverin can result in a similar syndrome to that associated with recoverin antibodies, and that melanoma-associated retinopathy may associate with several retinal antibodies.There is increasing recognition of an extensive variety of neuro-ophthalmological abnormalities as manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes and of several antineuronal antibodies as clinical markers of these disorders. Basic immunological studies support the pathogenic role of some of these antibodies, and are elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie these and other antibody-associated paraneoplastic syndromes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00019052-200402000-00003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084301135", "source": "openalex"}

Machine learning has also been applied to the classification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of postoperative complications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and refractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading disability. In addition, machine learning techniques have been used for the study of visual development, vessel segmentation in pediatric fundus images, and ophthalmic image synthesis.Artificial intelligence applications could significantly benefit clinical care by optimizing disease detection and grading, broadening access to care, furthering scientific discovery, and improving clinical efficiency. These methods need to match or surpass physician performance in clinical trials before deployment with patients.

A total of 1271 residents were included. Data were analyzed from August 12, 2017, through April 4, 2018.Variables analyzed included mean volumes of cataract surgery and total procedures, resident gender, and maternity or paternity leave status.Among the 1271 residents included in the analysis (815 men [64.1%]), being female was associated with performing fewer cataract operations and total procedures. Male residents performed a mean (SD) of 176.7 (66.2) cataract operations, and female residents performed a mean (SD) of 161.7 (56.2) (mean difference, -15.0 [95% CI, -22.2 to -7.8]; P < .001); men performed a mean (SD) of 509.4 (208.6) total procedures and women performed a mean (SD) of 451.3 (158.8) (mean difference, -58.1 [95% CI, -80.2 to -36.0]; P < .001). Eighty-five of 815 male residents (10.4%) and 71 of 456 female residents (15.6%) took parental leave. Male residents who took paternity leave performed a mean of 27.5 (95% CI, 13.3 to 41.6; P < .001) more cataract operations compared with men who did not take leave, but female residents who took maternity leave performed similar numbers of operations as women who did not take leave (mean difference, -2.0 [95% CI, -18.0 to 14.0]; P = .81).

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error.

Acquired and genetic disorders affecting the outer retina show correlation between visual sensitivity and the thickness of the outer photoreceptors. These relationships help localize unknown causes of visual field loss through segmentation of the retinal layers using spectral domain OCT.Advances in relating the structure of the ganglion cell layer in the macula to the corresponding axons in the RNFL and to visual function further our ability to differentiate and localize ambiguous causes of vision loss and visual field defects in neuro-ophthalmology.

High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of glaucoma and ultrasonic drug delivery are the two main areas of research and potential clinical applications. For the treatment of glaucoma, the specific advantage of HIFU, particularly when compared to the laser, is that the energy can be focused through optically opaque media, especially through the sclera which is a strongly light-scattering medium. HIFU is therefore a possible method for partial coagulation of the ciliary body (an anatomical structure responsible for the production of the liquid filling the eye) and, hence, reducing intraocular pressure and the risk of glaucoma. Ocular drug bioavailability also remains a challenge, being limited by multiple barriers to drug entry and lacrimal drainage, and making it difficult to achieve a sufficient drug concentration for numerous diseases of the front and back of the eye. As the front wall of the eye (cornea and anterior sclera) is a pathway for topically applied drugs, locally applied ultrasound has been proposed as a way of enhancing the delivery and activity of drugs and genes. Despite the fact that experimental studies seem to confirm the potential benefit of ultrasound ocular drug delivery, there is still a lack of clinical evidence. The aim of this contribution is to provide an update on recent advances in the field of therapeutic ultrasound in ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2012.665566", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097584538", "source": "openalex"}

This review describes the historical and technological development of ophthalmic ultrasound and its clinical application and impact. Ultrasound, like light, can be focused, which is crucial for formation of high-resolution, diagnostically useful images. Focused, single-element, mechanically scanned transducers are most common in ophthalmology. Specially designed transducers have been used to generate focused, high-intensity ultrasound that through thermal effects has been used to treat glaucoma (via cilio-destruction), tumors, and other pathologies. Linear and annular transducer arrays offer synthetic focusing in which precise timing of the excitation of independently addressable array elements allows formation of a converging wavefront to create a focus at one or more programmable depths. Most recently, linear array-based plane-wave ultrasound, in which the array emits an unfocused wavefront and focusing is performed solely on received data, has been demonstrated for imaging ocular anatomy and blood flow. While the history of ophthalmic ultrasound extends back over half-a-century, new and powerful technologic advances continue to be made, offering the prospect of novel diagnostic capabilities.

Corneal abrasion, the most common ophthalmologic injury, is usually selflimiting. However, prolonged surgical procedures (>7 hours) associated with acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, and hypoxia may lead to posterior ischemic optic neuropathies. Direct pressure to the periorbital region of the eye can cause increased intraocular pressure and blindness as the result of central retinal artery occlusion. Hypoxia and cerebral embolism are associated with occipital cortical infarct or cortical blindness. The prognosis for visual recovery from ischemic neuropathy and retinal artery occlusion is poor. Cortical blindness usually improves to varying degrees. Effective treatment of perioperative amaurosis is lacking and usually ineffective, making prevention the cornerstone of management. To best prevent permanent ophthalmologic complications associated with prone positioning during spine surgery, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of pathophysiology and related risks associated with spine surgery in the prone position, and initiate preventive measures and predictable treatment options.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5435/00124635-200703000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1880210502", "source": "openalex"}

These system-based approaches can unravel disease-related processes and are valuable for biomarker discovery. Furthermore, potential therapeutic targets can be identified based on omics results, and targeted follow-up experiments can be designed to gain molecular understanding of the disease and to test new therapies. Here, we review the application of omics techniques in eye diseases, focusing on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal detachment (RD), myopia, glaucoma, Fuchs' corneal dystrophy (FCD), cataract, keratoconus, and dry eyes. We observe that genomic analyses were mainly successful in AMD research (almost half of the genomic heritability has been explained), whereas large parts of disease variability or risk remain unsolved in most of the other diseases. Other omics studies like transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics provided additional candidate proteins and pathways for several eye diseases, although sample sizes in these studies were often very small and replication is lacking. In order to translate omics results into clinical biomarkers, larger sample sizes and validation across different cohorts would be essential. In conclusion, omics-based studies are increasing in ophthalmology, and further application to the clinic might develop in the years to come. Integration of genomics with other type of omics data has the potential to improve the accuracy of predictive tests. Moreover, in the future, omics may lead to stratification of patients into subgroups based on molecular profiles, enabling the development of personalized treatments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.17-21809", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2614484782", "source": "openalex"}

In the field of ophthalmology, although many attempts have been made to address the problem of the decreasing teaching time and the increasing load of course content, a growing body of literature indicates the need to reform the current ophthalmology teaching strategies. Flipped classroom is a new pedagogical model in which students develop a basic understanding of the course materials before class, and use in-class time for learner-centered activities, such as group discussion and presentation. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in ophthalmology education. This study, for the first time, assesses the use of flipped classroom in ophthalmology, specifically glaucoma and ocular trauma clerkship teaching. A total number of 44 international medical school students from diverse background were enrolled in this study, and randomly divided into two groups. One group took the flipped glaucoma classroom and lecture-based ocular trauma classroom, while the other group took the flipped ocular trauma classroom and lecture-based glaucoma classroom. In the traditional lecture-based classroom, students attended the didactic lecture and did the homework after class. In the flipped classroom, students were asked to watch the prerecorded lectures before the class, and use the class time for homework discussion. Both the teachers and students were asked to complete feedback questionnaires after the classroom. We found that the two groups did not show differences in the final exam scores. However, the flipped classroom helped students to develop skills in problem solving, creative thinking and team working. Also, compared to the lecture-based classroom, both teachers and students were more satisfied with the flipped classroom. Interestingly, students had a more positive attitude towards the flipped ocular trauma classroom than the flipped glaucoma classroom regarding the teaching process, the course materials, and the value of the classroom. Therefore, the flipped classroom model in ophthalmology teaching showed promise as an effective approach to promote active learning.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174829", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2605310600", "source": "openalex"}

Children with deformational plagiocephaly do not have an increased prevalence of strabismus compared with the general population but do have an increased prevalence of astigmatism, whereas children with nonsyndromic craniosynostotic plagiocephaly have an increased prevalence of strabismus and astigmatism. This observational cohort study retrospectively reviewed patients in a multidisciplinary craniofacial clinic between 1993 and 2001. Patients were referred for evaluation and management of plagiocephaly or craniosynostosis. One hundred eleven patients had deformational plagiocephaly, and 45 had synostotic plagiocephaly. Patients with lambdoid craniosynostosis, hemifacial microsomia, any syndromic form of craniosynostosis, or without a formal diagnosis were excluded. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmologic, ocular motility, and craniofacial examinations. Diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic findings. Patients were evaluated between birth and age 14 years (mean = 13 months; SD = 22 months). Only 1 of 111 (<1%) patients with deformational plagiocephaly had an esodeviation, and none had an exodeviation. Three of 45 patients (7%) with synostotic plagiocephaly had an exodeviation, and none had an esodeviation. Eight of 93 patients (9%) with deformational plagiocephaly had unilateral astigmatism, and 14 (15%) had bilateral astigmatism (mean = 1.82 diopters). Three of 43 patients (7%) with synostotic plagiocephaly had unilateral astigmatism, and 9 (21%) had bilateral astigmatism (mean = 1.83 diopters). Patients with deformational plagiocephaly do not appear to have a higher prevalence of horizontal strabismus than the normal population. Exotropia is more common in patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostotic plagiocephaly than in the general population. The prevalence of astigmatism in patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostotic plagiocephaly appears to be greater than in the general population, but this higher prevalence requires further study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001665-200307000-00026", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009193304", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2024009141", "title": "OCT: New perspectives in neuro-ophthalmology", "text": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become essential to evaluate axonal/neuronal integrity, to assess disease progression in the afferent visual pathway and to predict visual recovery after surgery in compressive optic neuropathies. Besides that OCT testing is considered a powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration and a promising outcome measure for neuroprotective trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) technology allows quantification of retinal individual layers. The Ganglion Cell layer (GCL) investigation has become one of the most useful tools from a neuro-ophthalmic perspective. It has a high correlation with perimetry, is predictive of future progression and is a highly sensitive, specific of several neuro-ophthalmic pathologies. Moreover the superior correlation with clinical measures compared to peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) suggests that GCL analysis might be a better approach to examine MS neurodegeneration. In disorders with optic disk edema, such as ischemic optic neuropathy, papillitis and papilledema, reduction in RNFL thickness caused by axonal atrophy is difficult to distinguish from a swelling resolution. In this setting, and in buried optic nerve head drusen (ONHD), GCL analysis may provide more accurate information than RNFL analysis and it might be an early structural indicator of irreversible neuronal loss. Enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) provides in vivo detail of ONHD, allowing to evaluate and quantify the drusen dimensions. OCT is improving our knowledge in hereditary optic neuropathies. Furthermore, there is growing evidence about the role of OCT as an adjunctive biomarker of disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjopt.2014.09.016", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2024009141", "source": "openalex"}

The author includes a review of the most frequently documented ocular side effects of systemic medications, which further enhances this text. The author expertly describes the various complexities of ocular disease management in an efficient and straightforward manner. Each chapter includes lists of key clinical pearls, bulleted management strategies, and detailed clinical images that clearly illustrate pertinent anatomy and disease states. I was also pleased to see that the treatment options discussed for the various conditions were current. By contrast, I have reviewed a number of other texts that included fairly dated treatment options that were either impractical by contemporary standards or simply were no longer considered standard of care. It is also worth noting that although this book does not offer a thorough, step-by-step approach to surgical intervention, it does provide the reader with an adequate overview of general ophthalmic surgery in areas where it is applicable. The index is organized pragmatically and is easy to search. While I was in clinic one day, I used the index to locate a number of conditions and terms—no matter which pathology I referenced, the index consistently directed me to the correct section with ease. The text would benefit from an expanded reference section. Not all subjects covered in the book included a list of citations to current peer-reviewed journal articles or clinical studies. There were several instances in which a specific source could have served as a valuable complement; however, the text provides sufficient information to aid the eye care provider in day-to-day clinical practice. Overall, this is an excellent textbook that highlights numerous anatomical structures and disease states in a thorough, yet concise, clinically relevant and informative format. Paul M.

The field of ophthalmology is often at the forefront of technological advances in medicine including telemedicine and the use of artificial intelligence. Multiple studies have demonstrated the reliability of tele-ophthalmology for use in screening and diagnostics and have demonstrated benefits to patients, physicians, as well as payors. There remain obstacles to widespread implementation, but recent legislation and regulation passed due to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic have helped to reduce some of these barriers. This review describes the current status of tele-ophthalmology in the United States including benefits, hurdles, current programs, technology, and developments in artificial intelligence.

Astronauts with neuro-ophthalmic findings, which were not present at the start of a space flight mission and only seen on return from long-duration space missions to the International Space Station, will be discussed.After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings consisting of optic disc edema in 5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton-wool spots in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening detected by optical coherence tomography in 6, and decreased near vision in 6. Five of 7 astronauts with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift ≥+0.50 diopters (D) between pre-/post-mission spherical equivalent refraction in 1 or both eyes (range, +0.50 to +1.75 D). These 5 astronauts showed globe flattening on magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 6 lumbar punctures have been performed to date (4 in the originally described cohort) and documented opening pressures of 18, 22, 21, 21.5, 28, and 28.5 cm H2O. These were performed at 8, 66, 19, 7, 12, and 57 days after mission, respectively. The 300 postflight questionnaires documented that approximately 29% and 60% of astronauts on short-duration and long-duration missions, respectively, experienced a degradation in distant and near visual acuity. Some of these vision changes remain unresolved for years after flight. Several possible pathogenic mechanisms, as well as potential countermeasures and discussion of possible terrestrial implications, are described.We previously hypothesized that the optic nerve and ocular changes that we described in astronauts may be the result of orbital and cranial cephalad fluid shifts brought about by prolonged microgravity exposure. The findings we reported previously and continue to see in astronauts may represent parts of a spectrum of ocular and cerebral responses to extended microgravity exposure. Future investigations hopefully will lead to countermeasures that can be used to eliminate or lessen the magnitude of these potentially harmful findings before long-duration space flight including the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000334", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2410398877", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the lockdown on ophthalmic training programs across India. Methods: An online survey was sent across to trainee ophthalmologists across India through various social media platforms. Results: In all, 716 trainees responded; the average age was 29.1 years. Results showed that majority of the respondents were enrolled in residency programs (95.6%; 685/716) and the others were in fellowship programs. About 24.6% (176/716) of the trainees had been deployed on 'COVID-19 screening' duties. Nearly 80.7% (578/716) of the trainees felt that the COVID-19 lockdown had negatively impacted their surgical training. Furthermore, 54.8% (392/716) of the trainees perceived an increase in stress levels during the COVID-19 lockdown and 77.4% (554/716) reported that their family members had expressed an increased concern for their safety and wellbeing since the lockdown began. In all, 75.7% (542/716) of the respondents felt that online classes and webinars were useful during the lockdown period. Conclusion: Our survey showed that majority ophthalmology trainees across the country felt that the COVID-19 lockdown adversely affected their learning, especially surgical training. While most found online classes and webinars useful, the trainees' perceived stress levels were higher than normal during the lockdown. Training hospitals should take cognizance of this and reassure trainees; formulate guidelines to augment training to compensate for the lost time as well as mitigate the stress levels upon resumption of regular hospital services and training. Going ahead, permanent changes such as virtual classrooms and simulation-based training should be considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1067_20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3032084305", "source": "openalex"}

The possible transmission of 2019-nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications. Methods A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019-nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17–28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019-nCoV. Results 63 patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative. Conclusion 2019-nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3005909458", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Robots designed for eye surgery should meet certain basic requirements. Three designs are currently being developed: smart surgical tools such as the steady hand, comanipulation devices and telemanipulators using either a fixed or virtual remote center of motion. Successful human intraocular surgery is being performed using the Preceyes surgical system. Another telemanipulation robot, the da Vinci Surgical System, has been used to perform a pterygium repair in humans and was successful in ex-vivo corneal surgery despite its nonophthalmic design. Apart from Preceyes' BV research platform, none of the currently eye-specific systems has reached a commercial stage. Systems are likely to evolve from robotic assistance during specific procedural steps to semiautonomous surgery, as smart sensors are introduced to enhance the basic functionalities of robotic systems. Summary Robotics is still in its infancy in ophthalmology but is rapidly reaching a stage wherein it will be introduced into everyday ophthalmic practice. It will most likely be introduced first for demanding vitreo-retinal procedures, followed by anterior segment applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000476", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2789716155", "source": "openalex"}

Micronutrient supplementation is a provocative but largely unproven hypothesis. Positive associations of cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease or certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease with AMD provide potential clues as to the underlying pathogenesis of AMD and are yet another reason to treat these health problems. Drusen may disappear after laser to the macula; however, this intervention will require careful, randomized, prospective trials to determine if this therapy can reduce the risk of choroidal neovascularization and visual loss developing in patients with AMD.It is reasonable to have individuals wear sunglasses for comfort and possible protection from ultraviolet light exposure to all ocular structures (especially the lens) at little or no risk to the patient.

This disruption has caused rapid dynamic fluctuations in demand, capacity, and even contextual aspects of health care. Therefore, the traditional face-to-face patient–physician care model has had to be re-examined in many countries, with digital technology and new models of care being rapidly deployed to meet the various challenges of the pandemic. This Viewpoint highlights new models in ophthalmology that have adapted to incorporate digital health solutions such as telehealth, artificial intelligence decision support for triaging and clinical care, and home monitoring. These models can be operationalised for different clinical applications based on the technology, clinical need, demand from patients, and manpower availability, ranging from out-of-hospital models including the hub-and-spoke pre-hospital model, to front-line models such as the inflow funnel model and monitoring models such as the so-called lighthouse model for provider-led monitoring.

Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients. Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out. Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions.

The infants had been included in a previous epidemiological study of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (birth weight ⩽ 1500 grams). The incidence of refractive errors and development of refraction were studied, based on retinoscopies at 6 and 30 months of corrected age. <h3>RESULTS</h3> The overall incidence of<i>myopia</i> was 8% at 6 months, of which 35% was transient, and 10% at 30 months. Of the cryotreated infants, 30–40% were myopic at both retinoscopies. The incidence of <i>astigmatism</i> was 52% at 6 months and 26% at 30 months. Astigmatism was associated with ROP, but not with cryotreated ROP itself. Astigmatism “against the rule” was commoner than astigmatism “with the rule”.<i>Anisometropia</i> occurred in 6.5% of the infants at 6 months and in 8.4% at 30 months. The incidence of anisometropia was higher in eyes with ROP, particularly in cryotreated eyes, which tended to have high and persistent anisometropia. <h3>CONCLUSION</h3> The risk of refractive errors is higher in preterm infants than in infants born at term, and also prematurely born infants without ROP do run an increased risk of having myopia and anisometropia.

Together, these technologies will increase our understanding of the basic physiology of different eye structures, enable us to interrogate unknown aspects of ophthalmic disease pathogenesis, and serve as clinically-relevant surrogates for the evaluation of ocular therapeutics. Both the burden and prevalence of monogenic and multifactorial ophthalmic diseases, which can cause visual impairment or blindness, in the human population warrants a paradigm shift towards organoids and organ chips that can provide sensitive, quantitative, and scalable phenotypic assays.

The authors set out to provide practical information for the recognition and basic treatment of ophthalmic disorders. The book is divided into 15 chapters, and the authors have cleverly created a flow that parallels the recommended order of ophthalmic examination. The initial chapters provide a basic introduction to animal handling, equipment, and instruments used during an ophthalmic examination, followed by an overview to the examination of the eye. A condensed section on differential diagnoses provides a quick reference for practitioners. A small section on diagnostics, therapeutics, and surgery is only a brief overview, as the authors have noted that more involved treatment and surgery would be referred and, as such, extends beyond the scope of this textbook. A great chapter on ocular emergencies is an excellent resource and quick reference for the general practitioner. Some of the areas covered are luxation and proptosis of the globe and lid, and conjunctival and corneal lacerations. The authors also point out when to refer; a real asset that is provided throughout the book. The rest of the chapters cover conditions involving the orbit, lacrimal apparatus, eyelids, conjunctiva, globe, cornea and sclera, uvea and lens and vitreous. Each of these chapters starts with an introduction to the morphology and physiology of the specific structure. A real strength of this book is the beautiful photographs which outline various disorders of each structure. It reaffirms that a picture is worth a thousand words. The most common diseases are given the most attention and detail, which again lends to the practicality of this book. There is a chapter devoted to glaucoma and one that addresses breed dispositions and hereditary eye disease. The book finishes with a glossary of terms relating to the eye. The strengths of the book are its attention to providing practical “useful” information for everyday practice. Over 180 photographs provide an excellent reference which helps illustrate disease conditions. Over 200 schematic drawings are used to describe surgical approaches and the drawings also help to reinforce the text. There are many references to species differences, which can prove very helpful for mixed practices. I also really appreciated the author’s comments on when cases should be referred. In summary, I would not hesitate to recommend Ophthalmology for the Veterinary Practitioner as a great reference book for the general practitioner’s library.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606252411", "source": "openalex"}

A pathological review of all cases was performed according to the WHO classification. One hundred and forty‐five patients were selected for the study. Pathological review showed 36% MALT type lymphoma, 22% lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma, and 15% diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma. Ophthalmologic and ocular sites were intra‐orbital in 61 cases (42%) and conjunctival in 51 cases (35%), with bilateral involvement in 10% of cases. Stage IV was found in 32% of cases, with bone marrow involvement in 12%. With a median follow‐up of 90 months, the 5‐year DFS and OS were 64 and 79% for low‐grade NHL, and 43 and 50% for high‐grade NHL. On multivariate analysis, age greater than 59 years, elevated LDH level, stage IV, high‐grade histological subgroup, and presence of B‐symptoms had a negative impact on OS for the overall population.

Radio frequency (RF; 13.56 MHz) oxygen plasma was used to enhance the antibacterial and wettability properties of this polymer for biomedical applications, especially ophthalmology. The surface was activated by O2 plasma to produce hydrophilic functional groups. Samples were treated with various RF powers from 10 to 80 W and different gas flow rates from 20 to 120 sccm. Optical emission spectroscopy was used to monitor the plasma process. The modified surface hydrophilicity, morphology and transparency characteristics were studied by water contact angle measurements, atomic force microscopy and UV–vis spectroscopy, respectively. Based on the contact angle measurements of three liquids, surface free energy variations were investigated. Moreover, the antibacterial properties were evaluated utilizing the method of plate counting of Escherichia coli. Also, in order to investigate stability of the plasma treatment, an ageing study was carried out by water contact angle measurements repeated in the days after the treatment. For biomedical applications, especially eye lenses, highly efficient antibacterial surfaces with appropriate hydrophilicity and transparency are of great importance. In this study, it is shown that the plasma process is a reliable and convenient method to achieve these purposes. A significant alteration in the hydrophilicity of a pristine PMMA surface was observed after treatment. Also, our results indicated that the plasma-modified PMMAs exhibit appropriate antibacterial performance. Moreover, surface hydrophilicity and surface charge have more influence on bacterial adhesion rate than surface roughness.

A systematic search was conducted on the PubMed/MEDLINE database for studies that have evaluated readability level of ophthalmic patient education materials, and the reported readability scores were assessed. Additionally, we collected evidence-based guidelines for writing easy-to-read patient education materials, and these recommendations were applied to revise 12 patient education handouts on various glaucoma topics at our institution. Readability measures, including Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), and word count were calculated for the original and revised documents. The original and revised versions of the handouts were then scored in random order by two glaucoma specialists using the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) instrument, a grading scale used to evaluate suitability of health information materials for patients. Paired t test was used to analyze changes in readability measures, word count, and SAM score between original and revised handouts. Finally, five glaucoma patients were interviewed to discuss the revised materials, and patient feedback was analyzed qualitatively. Our literature search included 13 studies that evaluated a total of 950 educational materials. Among the mean FKGL readability scores reported in these studies, the median was 11 (representing an eleventh-grade reading level). At our institution, handouts' readability averaged a tenth-grade reading level (FKGL = 10.0 ± 1.6), but revising the handouts improved their readability to a sixth-grade reading level (FKGL = 6.4 ± 1.2) (p < 0.001).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3028726648", "title": "The impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on ophthalmological emergency department visits", "text": "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan and precipitously extended across the globe. On the evening of 9 March 2020, the Italian Government ordered a national lockdown to limit social interactions and contain the spread of the infection. As evident in other epidemics, peoples' fear of infection may affect their utilization patterns of health services and reduce the access to health care (Chang et al. 2004). We have previously noted a significant change in the trends of eye injuries since the beginning of the lockdown (Pellegrini et al. 2020). Herein, we aimed to assess the influence of COVID-19 on ophthalmological emergency department visits. We reviewed the charts of all patients presenting to the ophthalmological emergency department of the S.Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital (Bologna, Italy) during 6 weeks of national lockdown (from March 10 to 20 April 2020), and compared them with those of the same period of the previous year. Retrieved data included patients' demographics, diagnosis and need for hospital admission. Diagnoses were categorized as unlikely to be emergent, likely to be emergent, and not determined, as previously described (Channa et al. 2016). The total number of ophthalmological emergency department visits during the 2019 study period was 2902 and decreased to 776 in the 2020 study period. Mean age of patients increased from 50.6 ± 22.6 to 53.2 ± 20.5 years (p = 0.003, Student's t-test), and the proportion of children and adolescents decreased (from 10% to 5.3%). The percentage of males increased from 50.9% to 55.7% (p = 0.017, chi-squared test). The conditions diagnosed in the two study periods are reported in Table 1. In the 2020 study period, the percentage of possibly emergent diagnoses increased (from 30.7% to 38.1%), while unlikely to be emergent diagnoses decreased (from 65.9% to 57.3%; p < 0.001, chi-squared test). Patients requiring hospital admission were 27 in the 2019 study period (the indication was retinal detachment in 22 cases, open globe injury in two, corneal ulcer in one, angle closure glaucoma in one, and anterior migration of intravitreal dexamethasone implant in one) and nine in the 2020 study period (retinal detachment in eight cases and open globe injury in one). During 6 weeks of national lockdown for COVID-19, there was a 73% decrease in the number of ophthalmological emergency department visits compared to the same period of the previous year. This may be at least partially due to the measures applied during the lockdown. For instance, social distancing and school closure may limit the spread of infectious conjunctivitis, particularly among children and adolescents. In addition, many patients may choose to manage nonurgent conditions by themselves or through remote communication (e.g. via telephone or video) with their ophthalmologists. Therefore, it is understandable that the percentage of nonemergent diagnoses decreased. However, there was a substantial reduction also of potentially serious conditions, including those requiring urgent surgery such as retinal detachment. This may reflect the patients' reticence towards risking coronavirus exposure in healthcare settings, as reported anecdotally even for life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction (Krumholz 2020). In agreement with this, a recent study documented a substantial decrease in paediatric emergency department visits across five Italian hospitals during the lockdown. In some cases, delayed access to hospital care due to the fear of infection resulted in intensive care unit admission or even death (Lazzerini et al. 2020). The reduced access to health care represents a serious public health concern, and patients with urgent ophthalmological conditions avoiding specialized treatment are at high risk of permanent vision loss. Therefore, it is essential to inform patients on the importance of not delaying needed ophthalmological treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14489", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3028726648", "source": "openalex"}

Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation.To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.Deep learning-trained algorithm.The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%.In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy.

Additional studies not captured by these queries were found by manually scanning references within the articles captured by the queries. Ambiguous studies of patients with concomitant bacterial or viral infections were excluded. <h3>Findings</h3> Thirty-eight applicable studies of 7472 patients who underwent ophthalmologic screening for candidemia or fungemia were identified. Criteria were compared with the conventional definition of endophthalmitis based on present (concordant) or absent (discordant) frank vitreous involvement. Concordant (59 of 6693 [0.9%]) and discordant (114 of 779 [14.6%]) endophthalmitis incidence rates differed by 13.8% (95% CI, 11.4%-16.4%;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Visual acuity for each case was recorded verbatim as subjective report provided by each study, when available. None of the concordant endophthalmitis cases reported direct, intraocular, microscopic evidence of<i>Candida</i>or other fungal organisms. Outcomes were available for 19 patients with concordant endophthalmitis; 6 died within 4 weeks of screening. The rate of substantial vision loss was associated (φ = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.01-0.86;<i>P</i> = .046) with additional invasive intervention (3 of 6 [50.0%]) compared with medical management alone (0 of 6). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this systematic review without meta-analysis, inconsistent definitions of endophthalmitis accounted for discrepancies of its incidence and overreporting among patients with candidemia, contributing to bias and resulting in the construction of guidelines. As few as 3 of 7472 patients had potential improvement, while routine examination overall could lead to additional interventions and harm in this population. These findings suggest that indiscriminate screening based on candidemia alone does not appear to be supported by the literature and should be reevaluated for inclusion as a recommendation from the Infectious Diseases Society of America.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.0733", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2938394549", "source": "openalex"}

The authors present their experience with this technique and review the available literature. Methods Between September 2006 and September 2009, 14 patients underwent a purely endoscopic, endonasal approach for resection of newly diagnosed craniopharyngiomas. These procedures represent index surgeries; no patient had undergone previous tumor resection. A retrospective review of endocrinological and ophthalmological outcomes, extent of resection, and complication prevalence was completed. Additionally, a review of the English literature was performed to evaluate outcomes of similar endoscopic techniques for resection of craniopharyngiomas. Results Four patients (28.6%) underwent gross-total resection; near total resection or better was achieved in 9 patients (64.3%). All patients presented with some form of visual field or acuity deficit. Postoperatively, 12 patients (85.7%) experienced visual improvement, with 6 patients (42.9%) having complete visual recovery. One patient experienced worsening of her visual deficit. Visual acuity improved in 8 patients ((57.1%), while visual field defects improved in 11 (78.6%). The pituitary stalk was preserved in all cases. Eight (57.1%) of 14 patients experienced some form of anterior pituitary dysfunction postoperatively. Although 9 patients (64.3%) were documented to have either transient or permanent new diabetes insipidus immediately after surgery, at 1-month follow-up only 1 patient met clinical criteria. Five patients (35.7%) developed CSF leaks that were successfully treated by subsequent endoscopic revision. All CSF leaks occurred early in the series. Two patients (14.2%) were treated for presumed meningitis postoperatively. Conclusions The endoscopic endonasal approach is a minimally invasive alternative to open transcranial approaches for select craniopharyngiomas. Similar to previous transcranial series, rates of endocrinopathy and gross-total resection were dependent upon the adherence of the tumor capsule to the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, and associated vasculature. A review of the literature suggests that the results of the current series are similar to other published series on this topic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3171/2010.1.focus09292", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2065423896", "source": "openalex"}

The most feared impact is sight loss, but in a number of ophthalmic conditions, there can be wide-ranging systemic, psychological, emotional and social effects of both the disease and its treatment. External tests of visual function, such as visual acuity, are inadequate to understand the overall impact of ophthalmic disease on a patient’s functional vision or daily life. This can lead to a discordance between the patient’s priorities and perspective on the one hand and the efforts of clinicians and other stakeholders on the other hand. In this review, we discuss how the patient is uniquely placed to understand the impact of the disease and can use that position to transform ophthalmic care at the individual and collective level, from research to care delivery. We highlight how the “patient voice” can contribute to key areas, including priority setting in the research agenda, communicating the wide-ranging impact of disease and its treatment as assessed through qualitative research, identifying the outcome measures that matter to the patient through core outcome set development and reporting these outcomes through appropriate patient-reported outcome measures. We also consider the increasing power of the patient voice on health institutions, ranging from broadcasting an individual’s experience of care he/she has received to patient societies influencing future health policy. Finally, we reflect on the challenges that need to be overcome for the patient voice to increasingly influence and improve the delivery of eye care in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2016-309955", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2608549037", "source": "openalex"}

Methods All applications submitted through SF Match to the UCLA Stein Eye Institute Residency Training Program from the 2017–2018 application cycle were analyzed using validated text analysis software (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Austin, TX)). The main outcome measures were differences in language use in letters of recommendation by gender of applicant. Results Of 440 applicants, 254 (58%) were male and 186 (42%) were female. The two gender groups had similar United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 scores, undergraduate grade point averages (uGPA’s), proportions of underrepresented minority (URM) applicants and Gold Humanism Honor Society members, numbers of academic and service activities listed, and gender distributions of their letter writers (all P values &gt; 0.05). However, letters written for male applicants were determined to use more “authentic” words than those written for female applicants (mean difference, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.001–1.590; P = 0.047).

As the recent successes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have greatly increased life expectancy in these patients, they have served as a focal point for the transition of research towards improvement of quality of life. Ophthalmological findings in MPS include corneal clouding, glaucoma, optic neuropathies, and retinopathies. While corneal clouding is the most common ocular feature of MPS (especially type I, IVA, and VI), its response to HSCT and ERT is minimal.

These uses are at a variety of developmental stages in ophthalmology, from common use of clinical structural assessment for neuro‐ophthalmology and evaluation of space‐occupying lesions to the beginning stages of experimentally measuring functional activation of specific layers within the retina and measurement of physiological oxygen responses. New MRI methodologies, such as the use of orbital coils and Gd‐DTPA image enhancement, have been researched, developed, and validated in the eye, opening new possibilities for this technology to enter the clinic. This review aims to summarize the clinical ophthalmological uses of MRI, focusing on the current use of the technology and future applications.

The eye is a sensitive indicator of adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Anomalies of the eyes and their adnexa are known to be associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), although long-term effects of these malformations are unknown. Design. A prospective ophthalmologic follow-up (median, 11 years; range, 4 to 19 years) was performed in 25 children with FAS. Their social situation and educational status were also investigated. Results. All but one of the children had ophthalmologic abnormalities. Fundus anomalies were observed in 23 children, of whom 19 had optic nerve hypoplasia. Thirteen children had concomitant strabismus. Microphthalmos, buphthalmos, phthisis, microcornea, coloboma of the iris and uvea, blepharoptosis, cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and nystagmus were observed in single cases. The dysmorphology of the eyes remained unchanged during the follow-up period. In 2 children with severe mental retardation and, initially, very poor vision, the severe visual handicap persisted. Seventeen children had an initial visual acuity ≥20/70, which remained unchanged in 10 children and improved in 7 children, despite the presence of optic nerve hypoplasia in 14 of the children. Ten mothers died, 8 of them because of alcohol-related diseases, and only 4 of the mothers were able to take care of their children. Sixteen children went to schools for the mentally retarded, and only 3 children had a normal school education without extra teaching assistance. Conclusions. In children with FAS, the major sequela, ie, brain damage, remains despite extensive medical, educational, and social support. The presence of ophthalmic signs, which persisted but did not deteriorate during the follow-up period, strengthens the diagnosis of FAS, and the high frequency of ocular involvement indicates the importance of a complete ophthalmologic evaluation in children with FAS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.97.6.845", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140833540", "source": "openalex"}

Methods ChatGPT's performance was evaluated using 467 ophthalmology questions from the StatPearls question bank. These questions were stratified into 11 subcategories, four difficulty levels, and three generalized anatomical categories. The answer accuracy of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and human participants was assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the statistical significance of GPT-3 versus GPT-4 versus human performance, and repeated unpaired two-sample t-tests to compare the means of two groups. Results GPT-4 outperformed both GPT-3.5 and human professionals on ophthalmology StatPearls questions, except in the \"Lens and Cataract\" category. The performance differences were statistically significant overall, with GPT-4 achieving higher accuracy (73.2%) compared to GPT-3.5 (55.5%, p-value < 0.001) and humans (58.3%, p-value < 0.001).

Since mutations affecting the mouse eye can be easily identified, a remarkable number of mutant lines provide animal models for congenital anomalies in man. To understand the mechanisms of lens development in detail, the isolation of the corresponding genes and the characterization of the mutations at the molecular level are important. A prerequisite for molecular analysis is the chromosomal localization of the gene. In this review, some mutants from our institute will be discussed according to the embryological time scale of the expression of the affected genes, reflecting also their genetic hierarchy. (1) In the aphakia mouse mutant, two deletions in the promoter of the homeobox transcription factor Pitx3 lead to a loss of its function and to an arrest of eye development at the lens stalk stage. Mutations in the homologous human PITX3 gene have been demonstrated to be causative of cataracts and the dysmorphology of the anterior segment of the eye. (2) Connexin50 is present in the lens vesicle. Later on, it becomes abundant in the anterior part of the fiber cells and in the lens epithelial cells. Mutations in the connexin50-encoding gene Gja8 lead to dominant cataracts. (3) aAcrystallin is present in the mouse lens cup, in the posterior half of the lens vesicle, and later in a high concentration in the lens fiber cells. Mutations in the aA-crystallin-encoding gene Cryaa lead to recessive and dominant cataracts. (4) Mutations in the ?-crystallin -encoding genes ( Cryg ) are the most frequent cause of congenital, dominant nuclear, or total cataracts in the mouse. Indications from our first studies in congenital human cataracts support these data. (5) Some postnatal, progressive cataracts have been characterized by mutations in the ß-crystallin -encoding genes ( Cryb ). Since at least one of them is also expressed in the retina and the brain, effects on these tissues have to be considered, too.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1076/opge.24.1.1.13888", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979852819", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: This review emphasizes the importance of neuro‐ophthalmological signs and symptoms in sarcoidosis. The presence of ophthalmological and neuro‐ophthalmological findings may lead to diagnosis of the disease and the initiation of adequate treatment. Material and Methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis during the period 1990 − 2001 were identified from the departmental diagnostic index. The history, clinical, laboratory and imaging data of patients were analysed. Results: Fifteen patients were identified, four men and 11 women, with a mean age of 44.1 years (range 26–65 years). In six of the 15 (40%), neurological deficits were the initial symptoms. Nine (60%) had known sarcoidosis at the time of presentation. Ten patients (66%) had ophthalmological/neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms and signs. Conclusion: Neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms may develop early in neurosarcoidosis. If neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms arise in patients with established biopsy‐proven sarcoidosis, the diagnosis is usually easy to make. However, a number of patients with neurosarcoidosis may present with neuro‐ophthalmic symptoms before systemic involvement becomes obvious. In this situation the diagnosis is challenging, and the major goal is to establish the presence of systemic sarcoidosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2004.00348.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2047985935", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2309515002", "title": "Ophthalmologic Outcome of Extremely Preterm Infants at 6.5 Years of Age", "text": "<h3>Importance</h3> This follow-up study of extremely preterm (EPT) children (&lt;27 weeks’ gestational age [GA] at birth) revealed major eye and visual problems in 37.9% (147 of 388) of all EPT infants and in 55.4% (67 of 121) of the most immature subgroups at 6.5 years of age. These major eye and visual problems were strongly associated with treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). <h3>Objectives</h3> To investigate the ophthalmologic outcome of a national cohort of EPT children at 6.5 years of age and to evaluate the impact of prematurity and ROP. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> All surviving EPT children born in Sweden between April 1, 2004, and March 31, 2007, were included and compared with a matched term control group, as part of a prospective national follow-up study. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Visual acuity, refraction in cycloplegia, and manifest strabismus were evaluated and compared with GA at birth and with treatment-requiring ROP. <h3>Results</h3> The study cohort comprised 486 participants. The mean (SD) GA of the children who were included was 25 (1) weeks, and 45.7% (222 of 486) were female. At a median age of 6.6 years, 89.3% (434 of 486) of eligible EPT children were assessed and compared with 300 control group children. In the EPT group, 2.1% (9 of 434) were blind, 4.8% (21 of 434) were visually impaired according to the World Health Organization criteria, and 8.8% (38 of 434) were visually impaired according to the study criteria. Strabismus was found in 17.4% (68 of 390) and refractive errors in 29.7% (115 of 387) of the EPT children compared with 0% (0 of 299) and 5.9% (17 of 289), respectively, of the control children (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Altogether at 6.5 years of age, 37.9% (147 of 388) of the EPT children had some ophthalmologic abnormality compared with 6.2% (18 of 290) of the matched control group (95% CI of the difference, 26.1%-37.2%). When treatment-requiring ROP was adjusted for, no significant association between GA and visual impairment could be detected. For refractive errors, the association with GA remained after adjustment for treatment-requiring ROP (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91 for each 1-week increment). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In a Swedish national cohort of EPT children at 6.5 years of age, major eye and visual problems were frequently found. Treatment-requiring ROP was a stronger impact factor than GA on visual impairment and strabismus, but not on refractive errors, as a whole. In modern neonatal intensive care settings, ophthalmologic problems continue to account for a high proportion of long-term sequelae of prematurity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0391", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2309515002", "source": "openalex"}

Even with immediate therapy, these clinical entities carry a high rate of morbidity. They may present with diplopia, visual loss, and/or anisocoria. Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is an ominous condition, which can cause permanent and severe vision loss, stroke, or aortic dissection, requiring immediate steroid therapy. Pituitary apoplexy may go unnoticed if only computed axial tomography is performed. Diseases affecting the cavernous sinus and orbital apex region, such as cavernous sinus thrombosis or mucormycosis, can give rise to simultaneous vision loss and diplopia and, if not treated, may extend to the brain parenchyma causing permanent neurological sequela. An isolated third nerve palsy may be the harbinger of a cerebral aneurysm, carrying a significant risk of mortality. Horner syndrome can be the initial presentation of a carotid dissection, an important cause of stroke in the young adult.

The three-dimensional (3D) printing tools have been widely used in different applications, from surgical planning procedures to 3D models for certain highly delicate organs (such as: eye and heart). The purpose of this paper is to review the dedicated research efforts that so far have been made to highlight applications of 3D printing in the field of ophthalmology. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the state-of-the-art review has been summarized for bioprinters, biomaterials and methodologies adopted to cure eye diseases. This paper starts with fundamental discussions and gradually leads toward the summary and future trends by covering almost all the research insights. For better understanding of the readers, various tables and figures have also been incorporated. Findings The usages of bioprinted surgical models have shown to be helpful in shortening the time of operation and decreasing the risk of donor, and hence, it could boost certain surgical effects. This demonstrates the wide use of bioprinting to design more precise biological research models for research in broader range of applications such as in generating blood vessels and cardiac tissue. Although bioprinting has not created a significant impact in ophthalmology, in recent times, these technologies could be helpful in treating several ocular disorders in the near future. Originality/value This review work emphasizes the understanding of 3D printing technologies, in the light of which these can be applied in ophthalmology to achieve successful treatment of eye diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1108/rpj-06-2018-0144", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2901788310", "source": "openalex"}

The VEPs values were compared to those obtained from 53 other confirmed HIV positive subjects with neither ophthalmological nor neurological manifestations, who served as a comparison group and to the references values of our laboratory. <b>Results:</b> An abnormal neuro-ophthalmological examination was noted in 99/166 patients (60%). Eye movement disorders were present in 99 patients (51%). Visual field defects were detected in 39% of the patients. Optic neuropathy was noted in 31%, papilloedema in 27% and ocular motor nerve palsies in 26% of the patients. Toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis were the most frequent associated pathologies, though in some patients the HIV itself was the presumed cause. VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of patients with and without neurological manifestations, respectively. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had a significantly increased mean latency; however, both groups had significant increase in mean latency compared to reference values. <b>Conclusion:</b> Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations are common in neurologically symptomatic HIV infected patients. Subclinical dysfunction in the visual pathways is a common phenomenon in both HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms, but neurologically symptomatic patients seem to have more damage in their visual pathways.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.2004.044289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1966998578", "source": "openalex"}

An ideal tissue adhesive should have superior tensile strength, be non-toxic and anti-inflammatory, improve efficiency and be cost-effective. Both synthetic and biological glues are available. The primary synthetic glues include cyanoacrylate and the recently introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives, while most biological glues are composed of fibrin. Cyanoacrylate has a high tensile strength, but rapidly polymerises upon contact with any fluid and has been associated with histotoxicity. Fibrin induces less toxic and inflammatory reactions, and its polymerisation time can be controlled. Tensile strength studies have shown that fibrin is not as strong as cyanoacrylate. While more research is needed, PEG variants currently appear to have the most promise. These glues are non-toxic, strong and time-effective. Through MEDLINE and internet searches, this paper presents a systematic review of the current applications of surgical adhesives to corneal, glaucoma, retinal, cataract and strabismus surgeries. Our review suggests that surgical adhesives have promise to reduce problems in current ophthalmic surgical procedures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2017-311643", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2793457692", "source": "openalex"}

This is based on the assumption that influential research is widely cited by other scientists and clinicians. With the advent of the Internet, Journal Citation Reports from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI‐JCR) have become widely available to individuals and institutions. In an increasingly competitive research environ­ment, aspects of citation analysis have been suggested as simple proxy, objective measures to evaluate the research quality of a journal, published articles, research institutions and even individual researchers. This review article provides an overview of citation analysis, including definitions, uses of these reports, and related controversies and potential abuses. As it has become the most commonly used indicator, there is a particular focus on the use of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). This is a widely quoted measure indicating the frequency with which the average article published in a journal of interest will be quoted within a specified time frame that therefore allows approximate comparisons of journals within a particular field of interest. Given the relative paucity of information in this area, emphasis is placed on citation analysis within ophthalmology, in particular in regard to the 43 ophthal­mology, vision science and optometry journals that are listed in the ISI‐JCR 2001 reports.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-9071.2003.00610.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2004359979", "source": "openalex"}

The intraocular inflammation referred to as iridocyclitis primarily affects the iris and ciliary body. Overall, the reported incidence of iridocyditis varies from 2% to 21% in children with JRA.4 The morbidity of iridocydlitis includes cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy, and loss of vision.5,6 Diagnosis of early iridocycitis is usually not possible by routine direct ophthalmoscopy. Sitlamp examination detects the signs of active anterior chamber inflammation. Guidelines for the schedule of routine serial sitlamp examination are suggested for early detection of iridocycitis. The presentation of eye involvement in JRA may be asymptomatic or of an insidious onset. The outcome has improved in the past 20 years. The majority of children have a relatively good visual prognosis if the iridocycitis is detected and treated early.6 RISK FACTORS FOR IRIDOCYCLITIS Articular Features The diagnosis of JRA describes a heterogeneous group of arthritic conditions with onset of disease before age 16 years. There are three major subtypes of JRA: systemic onset, polyarticular onset, and pauciarticular onset, defined by the clinical manifestations in the first 6 weeks of the disease.7 Fewer than 2% of children with systemic-onset JRA have iridocycitis.4,5 Children with polyarticular disease are at moderate risk, with 7% to 37% incidence of iridocyditis.

From the 4334 abstracts screened, 210 articles were selected that contained information on pathophysiology and treatment with relevance to primary care physicians.The glaucomas are a group of progressive optic neuropathies characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting changes in the optic nerve head. Loss of ganglion cells is related to the level of intraocular pressure, but other factors may also play a role. Reduction of intraocular pressure is the only proven method to treat the disease. Although treatment is usually initiated with ocular hypotensive drops, laser trabeculoplasty and surgery may also be used to slow disease progression.Primary care physicians can play an important role in the diagnosis of glaucoma by referring patients with positive family history or with suspicious optic nerve head findings for complete ophthalmologic examination.

CMV retinitis was associated with CMV serostatus of donor or recipient (P = 0.01), CMV reactivation before day 100 (P = 0.007), delayed lymphocyte engraftment (P < 0.05), and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD; P < 0.001). In allogeneic recipients of HSCT who were alive at day 100 after transplantation and had chronic clinical extensive GVHD, the incidence of GVHD was 1.4% (8 of 577). Five of 10 patients had other manifestation of CMV disease before retinitis occurred (4 with gastrointestinal disease and 1 with interstitial pneumonia; median time, 70 days before onset of CMV retinitis; range, 58–279 days), and 4 others had CMV excretion. CMV retinitis was bilateral in 4 patients; 9 of 10 patients had ocular symptoms (i.e., decreased vision and floaters). Six of 7 patients responded well to ganciclovir or foscarnet systemic treatment, 1 improved only after switching to cidofovir, and 1 patient who received a transplant in 1983 did not respond to acyclovir treatment. In conclusion, CMV retinitis is an uncommon late complication after HSCT that occurs mainly in seropositive allograft recipients with previous CMV reactivation and chronic GVHD, and with delayed engraftment of lymphocytes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1086/318447", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162496953", "source": "openalex"}

Despite genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity within and between different types of MPS, the disease symptoms and clinical signs often manifest during the first 6 months of life with increasing head size, recurrent infections, umbilical hernia, growth retardation and skeletal problems. Typical ocular features include corneal clouding, ocular hypertension/glaucoma, retinal degeneration and optic nerve atrophy.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1990631687", "title": "Corticosteroids in Ophthalmology: Past – Present – Future", "text": "Corticosteroids have been used in a broad spectrum of inflammatory conditions of the eye over the past 50 years. They certainly belong to the most frequently prescribed therapeutics in ophthalmology. Although many aspects of their beneficial and side effects still remain uncovered, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions represent highly valuable therapeutic effects in ocular diseases. This review is intended to summarize some relevant aspects on the use of corticosteroids, their main indications as well as their limitations in ophthalmology.Early and substantial progress in the therapy of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases was achieved by the release of endogenous corticosteroids following an injection of attenuated typhoid vaccine. In 1950, Ahrendshorst and Falls [1]described the therapeutic effect of the systemic application of foreign proteins and already postulated a broad spectrum of indications in ocular disease. Following intravenous injection of attenuated typhoid vaccine, elevated plasma cortisol levels were measured [2]. However, activation of endogenous cortisol synthesis by foreign proteins showed severe side effects as it was accompanied by febrile reaction, general malaise and metabolic alteration. With the development of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisone and their successful application in the treatment of chronic polyarthritis, case reports on the control of ocular inflammatory diseases appeared. Elkinton et al. [3]first described the effect of ACTH therapy on inflammatory hemorrhagic retinopathy associated with 'generalized collagen disease'. Subsequently, ACTH was reported to be effective in various inflammatory conditions of the eye. Mann and Markson [4]presented positive results in patients treated with ACTH for uveitis and episcleritis. An early landmark on the use of corticosteroids in patients with inflammatory ocular disease was set by Woods [5], treating 14 patients with either ACTH or cortisone with favorable outcome. The preparation of cortisol for topical application was essential for further progress of anti-inflammatory therapy in ophthalmology. Their clinical introduction was followed by a rapidly growing number of indications including vernal conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis as well as inflammatory conditions of the uvea. With the introduction of prednisone and prednisolone, ophthalmologists were given therapeutic tools 5–10 times stronger in their anti-inflammatory potency compared to cortisone whereas these drugs were shown to have significantly fewer metabolic adverse effects. Although the mechanisms of action were not fully understood at that time, clinical experience led to a rapidly increasing spectrum of indications for the usage of corticosteroids in ophthalmology. However, ocular side effects were reported shortly after the introduction of corticosteroids. Rising intraocular pressure as one of the most relevant ocular adverse effects was already noticed in the early 1950s. Blake et al. [6]observed significantly increased intraocular pressure in patients receiving ACTH as Stern [7]did in patients with cortisone therapy. These reports were followed by Covell [8]in 1958. Additionally, Armaly [9]first noticed the inheritable nature of corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension and glaucoma. It has early been established that there is a close correlation between the anti-inflammatory potency of topically applied corticosteroids and the risk of rising intraocular pressure. This observation has generated not only strong efforts to develop strategies to minimize the risk of secondary glaucoma, but also provided new information on the genetic background in glaucoma.Besides sex steroids, adrenal steroids exhibit mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid activity. Whereas mineralocorticoids are involved in the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance, glucocorticoids affect the carbohydrate and protein metabolism in addition to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. With isolation and analysis of their chemical structure followed by the ability of industrial synthesis, corticosteroids were introduced for clinical use predominantly because of their anti-inflammatory activity. It has been possible to separate glucocorticoid from mineralocorticoid action in synthetic steroids, but it still has not been possible to separate anti-inflammatory actions from the other effects of glucocorticoids. Table 1, modified from Hollander [10], summarizes the effects of cortisone and its derivates. Modifications in the chemical structure of cortisone generated new synthetic steroids with significant alterations not only in their anti-inflammatory potency but in their absorption, protein binding, metabolic transformation and elimination. The next derivates that were developed were prednisone and prednisolone. Their relative anti-inflammatory potency is 5–10 times that of cortisone whereas their metabolic side effects following systemic application in equivalent dosages are significantly fewer.To develop intracellular action, circulating corticosteroids form complexes with cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors within the target cells (fig. 1) [11]. The glucocorticoid receptors, members of a supergene family which also includes receptors for estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, retinoid acid and vitamin D, consists of 800 amino acid residues [11]. Its tertiary structure is divided into several domains of which the C terminal end serves as the steroid binding domain. The center of the molecule contains the DNA binding domain, folded into two zinc fingers. The N-terminal domain (Tau1) and a further domain adjacent to the corticosteroid binding C-terminal domain (Tau2) are involved in transactivation of genes following DNA binding of the receptor [11].The action of steroids in target cells is mediated by the regulation of transcription of steroid-responsive genes. Therefore a complex, consisting of corticosteroid and a cytosolic steroid receptor, binds to DNA sites containing glucocorticoid response elements. These represent parts of the promoter region of steroid-responsive target genes. Once occurred, the binding results in either induction or repression of target genes by changing the rate of transcription which may also be determined by the number of glucocorticoid response elements and their position within the promoter region [11].Systemically applied corticosteroids may be transformed by several metabolic pathways. Hepatic metabolization includes conjugation of ring A to glucoronides or glucuronate, both excreted in the urine [12]. Conversion of the C11-hydroxyl group to a keto group represents a third pathway located either within the liver or in the peripheral tissue [12]. Further pathways include hydroxylation at the C6 position and reduction of a carbonyl group at the C20 position, transforming into metabolites which are also mainly excreted in the urine [12]. The metabolism of corticosteroids is highly variable and depends on the chemical ultrastructure of its derivates. Whereas cortisol may use many pathways, dexamethasone and triamcinolone are eliminated primarily unchanged [13]. Several studies investigated the metabolism of corticosteroids within the eye, in particular in the cornea. The presence of 11β-hydroxylase activity in the cornea is considered as an important pathway to convert cortisone to the active product 11β-hydrocortisone [14, 15]. In addition, the presence of phosphatase activity in the cornea that converts phosphate derivatives of corticosteroids to the more active alcohol forms is important.The remarkable differences between steroid derivates regarding their anti-inflammatory potency in systemic therapy appear to be much fewer following topical application. Intraocular effectiveness of corticosteroid preparations for topical use is much more dependent on the capability of corneal penetration and velocity of intraocular metabolism. To develop action, corticosteroids have to bind to intraocular target cells. Following a topical application of labeled dexamethasone, radiographic localization identified its binding to the nuclei of conjunctival and corneal epithelial cells, keratocytes and endothelial cells of blood vessels [16]. Receptor cells of the trabecular meshwork, iris muscle, conjunctiva, choroid, retina and sclera were shown to be reached by intravenous administration of dexamethasone [17].The most frequently used route of application for ocular diseases remains the topical administration. Even following an application of a single drop of prednisolone it can be detected in the aqueous within 15–30 min [18, 19, 20]. Although the intraocular concentrations depend on the concentration of the applied formula, this positive correlation is apparently determined for each individual substance. Preparations prolonging the ocular contact time such as viscous formulation, microsuspension or gel may double the corneal and aqueous humor concentrations of corticosteroids when compared with the application as a solution [21, 22, 23]. Interestingly, even minor changes in formulation such as addition of benzalkonium chloride may have a significant influence on the resulting intraocular concentration of the drug [21].The intraocular effectiveness of topically applied corticosteroid does not only depend on the anti-inflammatory potency of its derivates but also on the ability of each galenic preparation to penetrate the cornea as well as on the individual metabolic transformation and elimination. After topical application, the highest values of cortisone acetate and its metabolites were measured within the cornea and aqueous and, in small amounts, also in the sclera and choroids, whereas it was not detectable within the lens, vitreous and retina [24]. Following local application of various steroidal preparations including fluorometholone, prednisolone acetate, prednisolone phosphate and dexamethasone phosphate, significant differences of corneal permeability are found [25]. Galenic preparations of glucocorticoids based on a binding to acetate in a lipophilic suspension are shown to penetrate the cornea to a higher extent compared to hydrophilic formulations using phosphate or succinate. Corneal epithelium appears to be the greatest barrier for intraocular penetration of polar, hydrophilic preparations such as prednisolone phosphate whereas lipophilic derivates based on an alcohol or acetate formulation are passing the epithelium much more easily [25, 26, 27](table 2). In contrast, the intraocular concentrations measured for hydrophilic prednisolone phosphate following epithelial removal are much higher compared to their lipophilic formulations [27].For inflammatory conditions of the anterior chamber, sufficient therapeutic levels can be achieved by either topical, subconjunctival or systemic application. Subconjunctival injection has been shown to be effective in episcleritis, scleritis and anterior uveitis. The advantage of subconjunctival or retrobulbar injection of corticosteroids is regarded to be a prolonged release of effective concentrations to the sclera, choroid, retina, conjunctiva and cornea. Since the sclera is permeable even for relatively large molecules [28], high concentrations of corticosteroid within the sclera may be achieved by subconjunctival application [29]. However, not only is injection frequently followed by pain and tenderness, it appears that even the subconjunctival steroid enters the intraocular milieu by diffusion through the cornea after leaking out of the conjunctival puncture site [30]. Considering the risks of peribulbar injection its use may be limited to severe inflammatory conditions of the sclera and choroid only.As in other tissues, corticosteroids do not appear to have specific effects but exert a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity. In general, they are more effective in acute than in chronic inflammatory conditions. Some aspects of corticosteroid-induced effects are of particular importance for the treatment of ocular diseases. For instance, the reduction of fibrinoid exudation as well as an inhibition of corneal scar formation are essential to prevent secondary complications of ocular inflammation and to maintain corneal transparency. The effects of corticosteroids on ocular tissues include: – reduction of the cellular immune response; – reduction of inflammatory vascular permeability; – stabilization of the blood-aqueous barrier; – limitation of fibrinoid exudation; – inhibition of fibroblast transdifferentiation; – inhibition of epithelial proliferation; – inhibition of inflammatory corneal neovascularization; – retardation of wound healing; – elevation of intraocular pressure; – induction of cataract.An important aspect of intraocular inflammation is the collapse of two physiological barriers, between the blood and aqueous as well as between the blood and retina. Pathological exudation can easily be observed using slitlamp biomicroscopy. Corticosteroids can effectively restore the selective capillary permeability and inhibit pathological protein exudation which clinically impresses as a decrease in Tyndall's phenomenon and improvement of retinal edema. A cellular inflammatory reaction is mediated by migration of leukocytes from the capillaries into the extravascular milieu. As corticosteroids inhibit chemotactic leukocyte migration [31], this effect may clinically be observed as a reduction of cellular response within the anterior chamber or as a demarcation of chorioretinal infiltrates.Stabilization of lysosomal vacuoles in leukocytes is a further aspect of anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. It prevents the release of proteolytic enzymes and therefore inhibits further inflammatory damage to ocular tissues. This protective effect is of particular importance since proteolytic activity and remodeling of tissue may cause severe secondary complications following ocular inflammation. On the other hand, suppression of lysosomal activity is addressed to result in reduced elimination of mucopolysaccharides within the trabecular meshwork with subsequent augmentation of extracellular matrix contributing to steroid-induced glaucoma [32].An important aspect of the corticosteroid anti-inflammatory effect is modulation of the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators by modulation of gene transcription. Such biochemical mediators include cytokines, TNF, tachykinins, nitric oxide, platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids. Synthesis of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes is pathophysiologically dependent on phospholipase A2. It is a key enzyme in the release of arachidonic acid which is a substrate for the synthesis of leukotrienes and prostanoids (fig. 2). Following a stimulus by dexamethasone application, transcription and synthesis of lipocortin – a protein shown to inhibit phospholipase A2 is increased [11].The effectiveness of topical steroids in the prevention of corneal scarring indicates that corticosteroids may inhibit the proliferation and transdifferentiation of keratocytes [34], reduce collagenolytic activity [35]and stabilize the homeostasis of keratocytes, collagen fibrils and extracellular matrix [36]. Although the effect of corticosteroids in mechanical trauma or chemical burn is not fully understood on a molecular basis, their beneficial use in the prevention of posttraumatic scar formation is unquestioned. Therefore, they are frequently administered in cases of traumatic damage to the cornea as well as for the prevention of stromal remodeling after corneal surgery. In specific cases, corticosteroids may also be beneficial to inhibit scar formation following infectious corneal inflammation. However, since corticosteroids reduce the local defence to infectious agents, the indication should carefully be limited to postinfectious conditions in which immunological response is assumed to dominate the clinical course. Additionally, corneal neovascularization can be inhibited by administration of corticosteroids [37], but the exact mechanism is still not elucidated. Apparently, an unspecific vasoconstrictive action contributes to this effect and regression of existing corneal vessels is also frequently observed.Topically applied corticosteroids are well established in the therapy of acute allergic reactions of the eyelids and conjunctiva. Though there have been other anti-inflammatory drugs introduced – like antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers – corticosteroids still remain powerful therapeutics in severe (acute) cases of allergic conjunctivitis. The selection of topically administered corticosteroids in these indications is determined by considerations aiming at high anti-inflammatory effects on the conjunctiva while minimizing intraocular action. Fluorometholone meets these requirements as it is effective at the ocular surface but does not penetrate the cornea.With their anti-inflammatory effects, topically administered corticosteroids are essential in the therapy of acute episodes of episcleritis, scleritis and uveitis. Depending on the severity and course of the disease as well as on the patient's ocular and general condition, topical treatment might be combined with systemic administration of corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory agents. As approximately 40–50% of patients with scleritis have an associated systemic disorder like rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease or systemic lupus erythematosus, the indication for long-term immunomodulatory treatment has to be closely monitored in an interdisciplinary collaboration (table 3).Multiple studies on uveitis patients have shown that, with a prevalence of 50%, idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (fig. 3) is the most common form among acute intraocular inflammatory conditions [38]. The underlying cause of idiopathic anterior uveitis still remains unknown although both autoimmune and infectious inflammatory mechanisms have been identified. Clinical observations such as increased circulating levels of interleukin 2 receptor, increased T lymphocyte responsiveness to retinal S antigen and the presence of circulating immune complexes suggest underlying immune mechanisms [39]. Topically applied corticosteroids remain the mainstay of quiet inflammation in the acute episode. The rapid anti-inflammatory effect is particularly useful to minimize secondary damage to the eye such as fibrin formation and posterior synechiae or even secondary synechial angle closure glaucoma due to intraocular inflammation. Severe cases of idiopathic anterior uveitis may require periocularly injected or systemically applied corticosteroids. The long-term management of recurrent idiopathic anterior uveitis depends on the frequency and severity of episodes and may include either short-term use of topically administered corticosteroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A or methotrexate [40].Intermediate uveitis is an anatomic designation of inflammatory conditions of the peripheral uvea. As intermediate uveitis presents with chronic persistent inflammation, the treatment goal is not only to suppress inflammation but also to diminish long-term vision loss which may develop due to cystoid macular edema. A 4-step treatment approach has been recommended using an initial trial of oral or periocularly injected corticosteroids [41]. Systemic corticosteroids may be given in doses up to 1.0 mg/kg body weight daily for a period of 4–10 weeks and should be tapered depending on treatment response. Since all corticosteroid therapy carries the risk of ocular complications (table 4), before all rising intraocular pressure and cataract formation, patients and family should be well informed concerning the therapeutic management. If corticosteroids fail to sufficiently suppress inflammation and cystoid macular edema does not resolve, surgical approaches including cryotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy might be considered. Long-term treatment may also depend on other systemic immunomodulatory agents like methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A or mycophenolate mofetil.Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroid eye drops is regarded to be beneficial after surgical procedures like cataract extraction. Even when significant progress has been made in microsurgical techniques, corticosteroids remain an important adjunct to reduce postoperative sequelae due to unspecific inflammatory conditions.The postoperative management of patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty includes topically applied corticosteroids [42]. It has been shown that an additional systemic administration does not significantly improve the outcome of corneal allografts compared to a topical delivery of corticosteroids only in eyes that do not meet high-risk criteria (fig. 4). However, the anti-inflammatory effect of topically applied corticosteroids in patients following corneal surgery is accompanied by its ability to inhibit corneal neovascularization.The formulation and dose applied depend on the clinical features of the disease as well as on the ocular site intended to be reached. Affections of the ocular surface respond very well to topical steroids. If, like in corneal transplant disease, intraocular action and therefore therapeutic levels within the aqueous are intended, preparations will be selected that are able to penetrate the cornea sufficiently. In severe cases of transplant disease, systemic administration may be considered.Glaucoma secondary to prolonged use of corticosteroids has been suspected already in 1950 [43]. The concept of corticosteroid-induced glaucoma was further substantiated by a number of clinical observations. Taken together: – An increase in intraocular pressure will be found in approximately 30% of individuals with an average rise of 10 mm Hg. – An additional 5% of patients will develop an increase of more than 16 mm Hg. – This response is increased to 46–92% in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Patients over 40 years of age and with certain systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, high myopia) as well as relatives of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma are more vulnerable to corticosteroid-induced glaucoma. The association of corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension with other conditions which are considered as risk fac tors for glaucoma (racial origins, hypertension, migraine, vasospasm) is likely but not fully established. – Secondary glaucoma due to corticosteroids can be induced by any route of administration [44, 45]. – The intensity of intraocular pressure elevation in a given individual depends on the potency of the corticosteroid, frequency and duration of application. – Pressure changes are completely reversible when treatment is discontinued. However, irreversible optic nerve damage may result from prolonged secondary hypertension.The clinical and pharmacological links between the side effect of corticosteroids of increasing intraocular pressure and primary open-angle glaucoma are of substantial interest given the fact that glaucoma remains a major cause of blindness in developed countries. Recent studies demonstrated that corticosteroid treatment of human trabecular meshwork cells produced delayed, progressive cellular and extracellular glycoprotein induction. From this system a gene termed TIGR (trabecular meshwork inducible GC response) was cloned. The progressive induction of the TIGR gene combined with specific structural features of its cDNA including features for interactions with glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins and signal sequences for secretion suggests that it should be considered as a candidate gene for outflow obstruction in glaucoma [46].Additional data suggest an activation of stress/apoptotic pathways in human trabecular meshwork cells. Pharmacological modulation showed that corticosteroid-induced TIGR gene expression is reduced approximately 4-fold by bFGF and TGF-β and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs protect against steroid-induced stress response [47, 48].These observations not only allow to better understand the pathogenesis of steroid-induced secondary glaucoma, but will also be helpful to investigate potential mechanisms in different types of glaucoma.Posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) as a complication of both topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy (fig. 5) is well documented [49]. In 1960, Black et al. [50]suggested a causative relation between systemic steroid administration and this type of cataract formation. Although the mechanism is still not understood in detail, this specific effect seems to be dependent on dosage and duration of therapy as well as on an interindividual susceptibility [51]. The incidence of corticosteroid-induced cataracts varies between 6.4 and 38.7% after oral use [52]. As little as 5 mg of oral prednisolone per day has been reported to cause PSC within 2 months.Other studies demonstrated that already within 6 months the risk of significant PSC existed in patients when corticosteroids were given at a minimum dosage of 10 mg dexamethasone [53]. However, the pathophysiology of secondary cataracts remains unclear [54]and several mechanisms may contribute: – The formation of covalent adducts of the steroid molecule with the lysine residues of lens particles may result in lens opacities [55]. – Prolonged topical application of prednisolone caused marked changes in the aqueous humor such as significant lower ascorbic acid, an important antioxidant present in the aqueous humor. – Specific corticosteroid receptors have been identified in lens epithelial cells [56]. – In addition, metabolic changes have been reported such as altered phospholipid metabolism in experimental animals [57].In contrast to steroid-induced glaucoma there is no direct evidence that steroids directly cause PSC. Intraocular inflammation, the presence of posterior synechiae, the aging processes and other factors are also likely to participate. Although in some animals cataract formation could be induced, cataractogenesis in experimental models is rather complex. Even high doses of systemically applied steroids did not cause cataract in rats, rabbits or chickens [58]. Topically applied steroids given daily for 6 months caused lens opacities in 50% of cortisone-treated, 35% of hydrocortisone-treated and 20% of prednisolone-treated rabbits [58].Because of their potential side effects a novel approach to the use of corticosteroids is highly desirable (fig. 6). There are at least two main directions to achieve a high therapeutic index and to reduce the risk of undesired side effects: development of 'soft drugs' and application of long-term drug release systems.A major approach to reduce side effects is based on the 'retrometabolic design' technique. This concept has already been used for the design of safe antiglaucoma agents ('soft' β-blockers) or short-acting mydriatics ('soft' anticholinergics) [59]. In principle the development is focussing on inactive drug metabolites which are metabolized at the target site or near the application site. The search for corticosteroids that suppress inflammation but do not cause secondary glaucoma continues.Loteprednol etabonate is a site-active corticosteroid synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite [60]. In double-blind studies, loteprednol etabonate was effective in the treatment of giant papillary conjunctivitis, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, postoperative inflammation and uveitis. In a large double-blind study on corticosteroid responders loteprednol etabonate demonstrated less propensity to cause clinically significant elevation in intraocular pressure when compared to prednisolone acetate [61].Rimexolone is another candidate that has been launched on the market as a 'soft' corticosteroid. It appears that this agent induces a rise of intraocular pressure equivalent to that seen with fluorometholone but a smaller rise of pressure than dexamethasone phosphate or prednisolone acetate [62]. At the same time, in a clinical uveitis trial, rimexolone was as effective as an anti-inflammatory agent like prednisolone.Several approaches have been introduced to increase the bioavailability of ocular drugs including liposomes, microspheres, collagen shields or intraocular implants [63, 64, 65, 66]. Since it is particularly difficult to achieve effective levels of therapeutics in the vitreous/retina following topical, parabulbar or even systemic administration, intraocular drug delivery devices have attracted considerable attention. Nonbiodegradable drug delivery devices containing 2 or 15 mg of fluocinolone that were implanted into the vitreous cavity of rabbit eyes demonstrated a constant drug release over a 6-month test period. Based on these release rates the predicted life span of the 2- and 15-mg devices are 2.7 and 18.6 years, respectively [67]. Since no drug toxicity was reported based on clinical, electrophysiological or histological observation, these devices may show great promise in the treatment of chronic intraocular inflammation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000066189", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990631687", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence is presented that these patients probably represent part of the spectrum of a single disorder that includes the multiple evanescent white-dot syndrome (MEWDS), acute idiopathic blind-spot-enlargement syndrome (AIBSES), acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), and the pseudo-presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (P-POHS).The medical records of these 13 patients and 2 additional patients, who developed, in addition to the features of this syndrome, funduscopic changes typical of MEWDS, AMN, and P-POHS, were reviewed and follow-up obtained.These patients had extensive unrewarding medical and neurological investigations because of suspected diagnoses, including central nervous system disorders, cancer-associated retinopathy, retinal vasculitis, diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis, and tapetoretinal degenerations. Although most patients retained good visual acuity, all had permanent visual field loss that in some cases was severe. The cause of the disorder was not determined. No effective treatment was found.Acute visual loss and photopsia in these patients is probably caused by damage to large zones of the outer retina that appears unaffected ophthalmoscopically. Electroretinography is important in early diagnosis. Future investigations probably will reveal further evidence linking this disorder to MEWDS, AIBSES, AMN, and P-POHS.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W119067240", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical and therapeutic factors and demographics were reviewed from medical records. Statistical associations between clinical and therapeutic factors and visual outcomes after surgery were also analyzed.A total of 352 patients were diagnosed with paranasal sinus mucoceles and underwent surgical treatment. Ninety-six of them presented with ophthalmologic symptoms, and periorbital swelling and pain were the most common symptoms (36.4%) in those patients. Among the 96 patients with ophthalmologic manifestations, 18 (18.8%) were diagnosed with optic neuropathy based on the deterioration of their visual acuity and unilateral relative afferent papillary defect. Ten of these 18 patients showed improvements in their vision after surgical intervention. The statistical analysis of the association between clinical and therapeutic factors and visual outcomes showed that the presence of infection was the only significant factor (p = 0.023).Paranasal sinus mucoceles present various ophthalmologic manifestations. Among them, optic neuropathy may be one of the most devastating conditions. In treating optic neuropathy caused by mucoceles, the presence of infection was the only factor that had any influence on postoperative visual outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that not only surgical drainage and ventilation of the sinus are necessary, but infection control is also a vital factor in treating mucoceles with optic neuropathy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2011.25.3624", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027350013", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Postgraduate year 1 and 2 family medicine residents at the University of Western Ontario were recruited for this study. The main outcome measures were hours of classroom and clinic-based instruction on ophthalmology during undergraduate medical education, and the comfort level in ophthalmic clinical skills and managing various ophthalmic conditions. Results: In total, 54 (33.3%) of 162 family medicine residents responded to the survey. Residents reported an average of 27.1 ± 35.1 hours and 39.8 ± 47.1 hours of classroom and clinical ophthalmology instruction, respectively. However, most residents (80%) responded as feeling only \"somewhat comfortable\" or \"not at all comfortable\" in assessing and managing common ophthalmic conditions, including ocular emergencies, such as acute angle closure glaucoma and ocular chemical burn. A positive correlation was seen between overall comfort level and hours of classroom instruction ( P < 0.05). Conclusion: The number of hours of ophthalmology training received by family medicine residents during medical school meets the International Council of Ophthalmology Task Force recommendations. However, family medicine residents appear to be uncomfortable in handling treatable but potentially sight-threatening ocular conditions. Standardizing the undergraduate medical education ophthalmology curriculum and increasing hours of ophthalmology training during postgraduate family medicine residency may be useful in bridging this gap in knowledge.

Visual acuity has for a long time been considered the gold standard endpoint for clinical trials, but in the recent years it became evident that other endpoints are required for many indications including geographic atrophy and inherited retinal disease. In glaucoma the currently available drugs were approved based on their IOP lowering capacity. Some recent findings do, however, indicate that at the same level of IOP reduction, not all drugs have the same effect on visual field progression. For neuroprotection trials in glaucoma, novel surrogate endpoints are required, which may either include functional or structural parameters or a combination of both. A number of potential surrogate endpoints for ophthalmology clinical trials have been identified, but their validation is complicated and requires solid scientific evidence. In this article we summarize candidates for clinical endpoints in ophthalmology with a focus on retinal disease and glaucoma. Functional and structural biomarkers, as well as quality of life measures are discussed, and their potential to serve as endpoints in pivotal trials is critically evaluated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preteyeres.2022.101160", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4313479790", "source": "openalex"}

We performed a systematic review of the neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE reported in the English literature from 1970 to 2010 by a Medline search. The prevalence of neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations is 3.6% in adult and 1.6% in childhood SLE patients. Neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are highly variable, with the commonest presentation being optic neuritis, followed by myasthenia gravis, visual field defects and pseudotumor cerebri. The underlying pathology was thought to be either SLE activity or its vascular complications. Most neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are responsive to high‐dose glucocorticoids. Anticoagulation is indicated when there is concomitant antiphospholipid syndrome. SLE ‐related neuromyelitis optica is often refractory to treatment and 92% of patients require multiple immunosuppressive protocols. Neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are uncommon but heterogeneous. The prognosis of neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations in SLE is generally good because of their rapid response to glucocorticoids. Relapses of these manifestations may be reduced by the use of maintenance immunosuppression. Cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab can be considered in glucocorticoid‐dependent or refractory cases. Anticoagulation is indicated when there is concomitant antiphospholipid syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.12337", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981443910", "source": "openalex"}

Despite its frequency treatments for RVO are unsatisfactory and include several that have not been tested by large, well designed, prospective, randomised controlled trials. There is also the lack of long term follow up in many of the available small uncontrolled studies, and the timings of interventions are haphazard. This review aims to evaluate the current knowledge relating to the pathogenesis, suggested treatments for the different types of RVO, and their complications. Isovolaemic haemodilution is of limited benefit and should be avoided in patients with concurrent cardiovascular, renal, or pulmonary morbidity. Evidence to date does not support any therapeutic benefit from radial optic neurotomy, optic nerve decompression, or arteriovenous crossing sheathotomy on its own. Vitrectomy combined with intravenous thrombolysis may offer promise for central RVO. Similarly, vitrectomy combined with arteriovenous sheathotomy intravenous tissue plasminogen activator may offer benefits for branch RVO. RVOs occur at significantly high frequency to allow future prospective randomised controlled studies to be conducted to evaluate the role of different therapeutic modalities singly or in combination.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.2005.068668", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038183722", "source": "openalex"}

Design: Prospective, observational case series. Materials and Methods: A total of 682 patients were evaluated for evidence of punctal stenosis from May to November 2008. Any associated findings from clinical examination were recorded. Results: As many as 54.3% (370/682) of the candidates had punctal stenosis. The prevalence is associated significantly with increasing age (p=.001), and no gender predilection was found. It was due to chronic blepharitis in 97% (359/370), entropion in 1.4% (5/370) and unknown causes in 1.6% (6/370) of the patients. As many as 58.1% (215/370) did not have subjective or objective evidence of epiphora, and all of them had a tear film breakup time of less than 10 seconds and positive corneal fluorescein staining. Conclusion: Punctal stenosis is a common finding among patients presenting for routine eye checkup. It increases with advancing age, and the most common predisposing factor is chronic blepharitis. A significant number of patients can be asymptomatic as they have concurrent dry eye disease. Surgical intervention is not recommended unless the patient is symptomatic after treating any associated blepharitis and dry eye disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-9233.53867", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063251936", "source": "openalex"}

This strategy was investigated to define standardized blood bank components. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two different, highly concentrated autologous platelet components, one from whole‐blood preparation and the other from plateletpheresis, were evaluated. In the first procedure, platelet‐rich plasma was obtained from 250 mL of whole blood. After storage for 20 hours, platelet‐rich plasma was concentrated In a second centrifugation step and adjusted to 10 × 10 9 platelets per mL. In the second procedure, platelets were collected by apheresis, stored overnight, centrifuged, and adjusted to 20 × 10 9 platelets per mL. The respective component was instilled during vitrectomy and gas tamponade in patients with stage II to IV macular holes. Patients were followed for 9 months. RESULTS: With regard to the various preparation procedures and final concentrations of platelets in the components, no differences in wound healing were observed. An anatomic closure of the macular hole was achieved in 18 of 19 treated patients. Visual acuity improved in 14 patients. CONCLUSION: Both types of highly concentrated platelet components were effective in achieving high closure rates of macular holes. These autologous platelet components possess the quality standard of blood bank components and could be of great benefit for initiating wound healing in other clinical settings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39299154727.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059211871", "source": "openalex"}

These estimates were then compared with the results of various clinical tests and examinations of the same patients, including Schirmer's tests, evaluations of tear-film breakup times and fluorescein staining of corneas.Although the overall prevalence of dry eye based on OSDI was 29.25%, there was considerable age- and gender-related variation in this parameter. Compared with the younger patients, those aged ≥80 years were more likely to have OSDI that were indicative of dry eye (41.2%), and the women investigated were more likely to have dry eye (as indicated by OSDI) than the men (27% v. 12%). Occupation, however, appeared to have no effect on the risk of dry eye (P=0.952).Grittiness was the commonest complaint reported. McMonnies' indices (MMI), OSDI and the values recorded in Schirmer's tests were all significantly and positively correlated with the probability of a clinical diagnosis of dry eye (P<0.001 for each). Only patients with a Schirmer's value of <8 mm showed fluorescein staining of the cornea (P<0.005).This appears to be the first report from India in which MMI and OSDI have been significantly correlated with the probability of a clinical diagnosis of dry eye. Although the subjects were recruited in an ophthalmology department and may not have been very representative of the general population of New Delhi, dry-eye syndrome is probably common in the study area and probably has a considerable socio–economic impact. The early detection and timely management of this syndrome is important, as they can help prevent long-term sequelae and sight-threatening complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1179/136485910x12647085215859", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087099222", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with LS underwent genotyping for the whole genome of mitochondrial DNA and SURF1 mutations. The clinical demographic and ophthalmologic phenotypes were compared between the good prognosis group and the poor prognosis group. Results Strabismus (40.9%) was the most frequently observed ophthalmologic manifestation, followed by pigmentary retinopathy (22.5%), optic atrophy (22.5%), ptosis (15.9%), and nystagmus (13.6%). Thirteen patients were exotropes and five patients were esotropes. The mean exodeviation was 29.6±12.5 prism dioptres (PD) and the mean esodeviation was 24.0±8.9 PD.

A thorough search of several databases was conducted to find sufficient literature on ROCK inhibitors. This research found strong evidence demonstrating that inhibition of Rho kinase significantly decreases IOP, increases healing of the corneal endothelium, and decreases progression of diabetic retinopathy. The main side effect of ROCK inhibitors is conjunctival hyperemia that is often present in more than half of the patients in certain formulations. Additional clinical trials investigating the reviewed treatment options of Rho kinase inhibitors are necessary to further validate previous findings on the topic.

Many candidates choosing a postgraduate pathway in ophthalmological training, such as those accepted into the Royal Colleges of Ophthalmology in the UK, Australia and New Zealand programmes and the American Academy of Ophthalmologists in the USA, are compelled as adult learners to revise or revisit human orbital anatomy, ocular anatomy and select areas of head and neck anatomy.

This high degree of resolution, however, limits tissue penetration to 5 to 10 mm, which is ideal for examination of the anterior segment of the eye. The detail provided by high-resolution ultrasound readily permits the clinician to distinguish between various anterior segment entities that may appear similar but are treated quite differently, such as anterior uveal tumors, iridociliary cysts, and iris bombé. High-frequency ultrasound is also a valuable aid in creating a surgical plan for treatment of ocular disorders in which the cornea is opaque, such as feline corneal sequestrum and tumor invasion into the cornea. Other applications of this technology include elucidation of the pathogenesis of glaucoma in veterinary patients and evaluation of regions of the lens that are difficult to examine directly.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.2003.223.1617", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170506973", "source": "openalex"}

In this way, OCT-A images constitute a suitable scenario to analyze the retinal vascular properties of regions of interest as is the case of the macular area, measuring the characteristics of the foveal vascular and avascular zones. Extracted parameters of this region can be used as prognostic factors that determine if the patient suffers from certain pathologies (such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion, among others), indicating the associated pathological degree. The manual extraction of these biomedical parameters is a long, tedious and subjective process, introducing a significant intra and inter-expert variability, which penalizes the utility of the measurements. In addition, the absence of tools that automatically facilitate these calculations encourages the creation of computer-aided diagnosis frameworks that ease the doctor’s work, increasing their productivity and making viable the use of this type of vascular biomarkers. In this work we propose a fully automatic system that identifies and precisely segments the region of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) using a novel ophthalmological image modality as is OCT-A. The system combines different image processing techniques to firstly identify the region where the FAZ is contained and, secondly, proceed with the extraction of its precise contour. The system was validated using a representative set of 213 healthy and diabetic OCT-A images, providing accurate results with the best correlation with the manual measurements of two experts clinician of 0.93 as well as a Jaccard’s index of 0.82 of the best experimental case in the experiments with healthy OCT-A images. The method also provided satisfactory results in diabetic OCT-A images, with a best correlation coefficient with the manual labeling of an expert clinician of 0.93 and a Jaccard’s index of 0.83. This tool provides an accurate FAZ measurement with the desired objectivity and reproducibility, being very useful for the analysis of relevant vascular diseases through the study of the retinal micro-circulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212364", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2900999361", "source": "openalex"}

Assistance facilitated by robots offers substantial improvements in terms of movement control, tremor cancellation, enhanced visualization, and distance sensing. Robotic technology has only recently been integrated into ophthalmology; hence, the progression is only in its initial stages. Robotic technologies such as da Vinci Surgical System are integrated into the field of ophthalmology and are assisting surgeons in complex eye surgeries. Ophthalmic surgeries require high accuracy and precision to execute tissue manipulation, and some complex ocular surgery may take few hours to complete the procedures that may predispose high-volume ophthalmic surgeons to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. A complete paradigm shift has been achieved in this particular field through the integration of advanced robotic technology, resulting in easier and more efficient procedures. Where robotic technology assists the surgeons and improves the overall quality of care, it also projects several challenges including limited availability, training, and the high cost of the robotic system.

Digital health comprises overlapping areas ranging from AI, the internet of things, electronic health, and telehealth to the analysis and use of big data.1WHOWHO guideline: recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening.https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/digital-interventions-health-system-strengthening/en/Date accessed: August 10, 2019Google Scholar With substantial innovation opportunities in digital health, WHO published a set of guidelines earlier this year,1WHOWHO guideline: recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening.https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/digital-interventions-health-system-strengthening/en/Date accessed: August 10, 2019Google Scholar advising potential researchers and innovators on how to harness this technology to create evidence-based interventions within real-world settings to improve patients' outcome. Here, we highlight some of the new developments in ophthalmology, focusing on AI and other digital innovation, particularly those that are clinically available and could be implemented in the foreseeable future. First, within the spectrum of digital health, AI and a subset of machine learning known as deep learning have become popular technologies and the forefront of the digital revolution. Compared with traditional feature-based machine learning techniques, deep learning has shown to outperform traditional techniques in image, speech, and motion recognition and natural language processing.2LeCun Y Bengio Y Hinton G Deep learning.Nature. 2015; 521: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (41799) Google Scholar In medicine, deep learning has shown robust performance in detecting tuberculosis from chest x-rays, malignant melanoma on skin photographs, and lymph node metastases secondary to breast cancer from tissue sections. In ophthalmology, most of the deep learning systems focus heavily on image recognition, using fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography to detect diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, and cataract.3Ting DSW Peng L Varadarajan AV et al.Deep learning in ophthalmology: the technical and clinical considerations.Prog Retin Eye Res. 2019; 72100759Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar Excitingly, deep learning might be able to predict systemic cardiovascular risk factors such as age, sex, systemic blood pressure, and glycated haemoglobin A1c from the fundus photographs. Most of these new deep learning algorithms and systems, however, have been developed in retrospective, open-source, or cleaned research laboratory settings, with very few done in either real-world settings or from prospective studies. In different clinical areas in ophthalmology, the use of deep learning for diabetic retinopathy screening is the most established, the most commonly reported in the peer-reviewed literature, and the closest technology that could be translated, integrated, and implemented clinically. For example, in one of the first published prospective studies,4Gulshan V Rajan RP Widner K et al.Performance of a deep-learning algorithm vs manual grading for detecting diabetic retinopathy in India.JAMA Ophthalmol. 2019; 137: 987Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar deep learning achieved better diagnostic performance than the human graders in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the first medical AI-based device to screen for and monitor diabetic retinopathy in 2018,5Abràmoff MD Lavin PT Birch M Shah N Folk JC Pivotal trial of an autonomous AI-based diagnostic system for detection of diabetic retinopathy in primary care offices.NPJ Digit Med. 2018; 1: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar based on a preregistered prospective clinical trial that was done in primary eye-care settings in the USA. This approval has opened the door for introducing AI-based technology in the real-world setting. To date, about 30 million retinal optical coherence tomography procedures are now done every year in the USA for disease diagnosis and monitoring, which is more than all other ophthalmic imaging modalities combined. To tackle the burden of reading optical coherence tomography scans, an AI decision support tool might be a potential alternative. De Fauw and colleagues6De Fauw J Ledsam JR Romera-Paredes B et al.Clinically applicable deep learning for diagnosis and referral in retinal disease.Nat Med. 2018; 24: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar reported a novel deep learning system that can generate a referral triage decision, ensuring correct referral urgencies and siting of patients in the primary to tertiary eye-care settings. In the treatment monitoring of age-related macular degeneration, Schmidt-Erfurth and colleagues7Schmidt-Erfurth U Bogunovic H Sadeghipour A et al.Machine learning to analyze the prognostic value of current imaging biomarkers in neovascular age-related macular degeneration.Ophthalmol Retina. 2018; 2: 24-30Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar developed a machine learning model (random forest regression) that might predict visual acuity after 12 months in patients receiving ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, from the level of visual acuity at baseline, or within the first 3 months. This approach might help clinicians to counsel and better manage the patients' expectations appropriately during their treatment journey. Second, with AI, doctors can be excluded from the care pathway. Such a virtual clinic has been implemented into the eye hospital setting using the same principles—ie, when a patient has an eye scan with a specialist report either instead of or before a face-to-face consultation with an ophthalmologist. The scan reading, however, is only one component in the overall specialty care that these patients need. And so, if improvements are made in patient-reported outcomes, the use of an automated report as a substitute for the consultation needs to be carefully assessed to ascertain when it is appropriate to use fully automated services and when taking the direct interaction with the clinician out of the equation might reduce the quality of the holistic care the patient receives. Additionally, the internet of things is a new digital technology that can be used for AI deployment in ophthalmology.8Meinert E Van Velthoven M Brindley D et al.The internet of things in health care in Oxford: protocol for proof-of-concept projects.JMIR Res Protoc. 2018; 7e12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar With the internet of things, any devices connected to the internet can transfer information to each other in a purely automated way without the need for human–human or human–computer interaction. The application of the internet of things offers the opportunity to transform eye care by linking imaging data with clinical information not only within clinics, but between clinics in a region or cluster or even anywhere in the world. Images and clinical data can be analysed by AI algorithms or next-generation data analytics. One key example is the development of the digital virtual clinic, which, by negating the need for a physical appointment, addresses the major problem of patients having to wait for months for an eye appointment by highly trained specialists. In a UK proof-of-concept study using a cloud-based teleophthalmology platform that could be used across a range of devices, more than 50% of would-be referrals into hospital were prevented, allowing specialist care within local services in a cost-efficient way; although these findings need to be further validated clinically in the long term.9Kern C Fu DJ Kortuem K et al.Implementation of a cloud-based referral platform in ophthalmology: making telemedicine services a reality in eye care.Br J Ophthalmol. 2019; (bjophthalmol-2019-314161.)Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar The bidirectional communication of clinical information between ophthalmologists and optometrists further allowed embedding work-based learning into community optometry practices while upskilling local practitioners. In summary, health-care innovations, including AI and the internet of things, must start with the identification and the pull of unmet clinical needs, rather than the push of technology. Although studies on AI systems have been published, many of the successful AI algorithms are yet to be adopted within the clinical setting, including diabetic retinopathy screening algorithms. To expedite the translation of digital health into clinical care, it is important to gather, apart from the physical technology, all the key components of clinical care, including the overall health-care strategy, the standards and interoperability, infrastructure, legislation, policy, and compliance with clinical guidelines, and the appropriate workforce. This enabling framework is crucial to avoid the potential hype that a new disruptive innovation such as digital health could bring to the community,10Chen JH Asch SM Machine learning and prediction in medicine—beyond the peak of inflated expectations.N Engl J Med. 2017; 376: 2507-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar with the proliferation of unconnected, short-lived, and poorly tested systems.

The umbrella term for technologies with these characteristics is extended reality. The ability of extended reality to create environments that are otherwise impossible in the real world has practical implications in the medical discipline. In ophthalmology, virtual reality simulators have become increasingly popular as tools for surgical education. Recent developments have also explored diagnostic and therapeutic uses in ophthalmology.This systematic review aims to identify and investigate the utility of extended reality in ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics.A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Publications from January 1, 1956 to April 15, 2020 were included. Inclusion criteria were studies evaluating the use of extended reality in ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Eligible studies were evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. Relevant studies were also evaluated using a validity framework. Findings and relevant data from the studies were extracted, evaluated, and compared to determine the utility of extended reality in ophthalmology.We identified 12,490 unique records in our literature search; 87 met final eligibility criteria, comprising studies that evaluated the use of extended reality in education (n=54), diagnostics (n=5), and therapeutics (n=28). Of these, 79 studies (91%) achieved evidence levels in the range 2b to 4, indicating poor quality. Only 2 (9%) out of 22 relevant studies addressed all 5 sources of validity evidence. In education, we found that ophthalmic surgical simulators demonstrated efficacy and validity in improving surgical performance and reducing complication rates. Ophthalmoscopy simulators demonstrated efficacy and validity evidence in improving ophthalmoscopy skills in the clinical setting. In diagnostics, studies demonstrated proof-of-concept in presenting ocular imaging data on extended reality platforms and validity in assessing the function of patients with ophthalmic diseases. In therapeutics, heads-up surgical systems had similar complication rates, procedural success rates, and outcomes in comparison with conventional ophthalmic surgery.Extended reality has promising areas of application in ophthalmology, but additional high-quality comparative studies are needed to assess their roles among incumbent methods of ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2196/24152", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3142879207", "source": "openalex"}

Previous studies showed that test procedures for binary paired data that ignore the presence of intraclass correlation could lead to inflated significance levels. Furthermore, it is possible that asymptotic versions of these procedures that take the intraclass correlation into account could also produce unacceptably high type I error rates when the sample size is small or the data structure is sparse. We propose two alternatives for these situations, namely the exact unconditional and approximate unconditional procedures. According to our simulation results, the exact procedures usually produce extremely conservative empirical type I error rates. That is, the corresponding type I error rates could greatly underestimate the pre-assigned nominal level (e.g. (empirical type I error rate/nominal type I error rate) 0.8). On the other hand, the approximate unconditional procedures usually yield empirical type I error rates close to the pre-chosen nominal level. We illustrate our methodologies with a data set from a retinal detachment study.

Methods: Human postmortem retinas from eight patients with AD (mean age: 80 ± 12.7 years) and from 11 age-matched controls (mean age: 78 ± 16.57 years) were analyzed. The retinas were sampled from the superior quadrant on both the temporal and nasal sides with respect to the optic nerve. Thickness of the inner and outer layers involving the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) were measured and compared between controls and AD. A total of 16 measurements of retinal thickness were acquired for each layer. Results: RNFL thinning supero-temporally was significant closest to the optic nerve (∼35% thickness reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-nasally, RNFL was thinner throughout all points (∼40% reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-temporally, RGCL thinning was pronounced toward the macula (∼35% thickness reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-nasally, RGCL showed uniform thinning throughout (∼35% reduction; P < 0.001). IPL thinning supero-temporally was statistically significant in the macula (∼15% reduction; P < 0.01).

The analysis was performed from July 2015 to November 2015. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome measures were percentage representation of women vs men overall and in industry research, consulting, speaking roles, royalties and licenses, grants, services other than consulting, and honoraria. Secondary outcome measures included mean and median payments from industry to female vs male ophthalmologists. <h3>Results</h3> In 2013, 4164 of 21 380 (19.5%) ophthalmologists were women, and of 1204 ophthalmologists analyzed for industry payments, 176 (4.2%) women had industry ties compared with 1028 (6%) men (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Mean payments to women were $11 419 compared with $20 957 for men (<i>P</i> = .001), and median payments to women were $3000 compared with $4787 for men (<i>P</i> = .007). In 2013, women were underrepresented among ophthalmologists receiving industry payments for research (49 of 462 [10.6%]), consulting (96 of 610 [15.7%]), honoraria (3 of 47 [6.4%]), industry grants (1 of 7 [14.3%]), royalties and licenses (1 of 13 [7.7%]), and faculty/speaker roles (2 of 48 [4.2%]). In 2014, 4352 of 21 531 (20.2%) of ophthalmologists were women. Of 1518 ophthalmologists analyzed for industry payments, 255 (6%) women had industry ties compared with 1263 (7.4%) men (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Mean payments to women were $14 848 compared with $30 513 for men (<i>P</i> = .004), and median payments to women were $3750 compared with $5000 for men (<i>P</i> = .005). Women remained underrepresented among ophthalmologists receiving industry payments for research (25 of 241 [10.4%]), consulting (145 of 921 [15.7%]), honoraria (14 of 11 [12.6%]), industry grants (3 of 25 [12.0%]), royalties and licenses (1 of 22 [4.6%]), and faculty/speaker roles (21 of 189 [11.1%]) in 2014. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Women make up a minority of ophthalmologists with professional industry relationships, and the average woman partnering with industry earns less than her male colleagues. The reasons for differences are multifactorial and could not be determined by this study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0552", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2341794844", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1969407808", "title": "Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach, 5th ed.", "text": "Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach, 5th ed. Jack J. Kanski. Boston: Butterworth-Heinemann, 2003. Pages: 748. Price: $179.00. ISBN 0-7506-5541-0. FIGUREFIGUREClinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach, 5th edition, is the latest offering from Jack J. Kanski, M.D. Previous editions have long been an essential part of the optometrist’s reference library. With its clear text and vivid pictures, this book continues to be useful to both beginning students as well as seasoned clinicians. In addition, improvements have been made to this new edition that make it more valuable than ever. This fifth edition still achieves the author’s goals of “providing the trainee with a systematic and easily assimilated knowledge of ophthalmology, yet serving as a reference and as an update for the more experienced practitioner.” So the question becomes, how does this new edition compare to the previous fourth edition? Is this substantial textbook worth the investment? As compared to the previous edition, the fifth edition serves as a revision, and not a re-working of the content of the book. The first and most obvious change is the cosmetic facelift. Now each chapter’s header is color coded, thus facilitating the use of this book for quick reference. As well, Dr. Kanski has added four new chapters: Dry Eye, Ccleritis, Corneal and Refractive Surgery, and Systemic Diseases, increasing the count to 20. These chapters not only update the reader on new clinical information, they also reflect new trends and issues of eye care. Some additional improvements include the incorporation of new medications; for example, the use of topical and systemic fluoroquinolone antibiotics for bacterial infection and topical cyclosporin for dry eye. New imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography and Heidelberg retinal tomography are also discussed for the analysis of the macula and optic nerve. The organization and structure of this book offer a suitable introduction to ocular disease. Each section is structured in a logical manner with easy-to-follow and concise text. The major selling point of this book is the photography. The photographs in each chapter, most in high-quality color and detail, show typical presentations of the disease. The photographs in Clinical Ophthalmology may not be as large or illustrate as many variations of a disease as subject-specific atlases, but the breadth and array of the pictures in this collection are suitable for such a comprehensive work. For this reason, I feel this work is ideally suited for the beginning eye care professional. The chapters remain organized from anterior to posterior, with each chapter following a general outline. The initial section reviews the anatomy and physiology of each structure. This is followed with general examination techniques and special considerations. The remainder of the chapter describes the clinical features of each disease, such as presentation, signs and symptoms, examination techniques, classifications, and differential diagnosis. Each section concludes with a discussion of potential treatments and includes pharmacological as well as surgical procedures. Dispersed throughout various sections are clinical pearls in shaded gray banners titled “NB:,” which highlight points worth noting and tips for the reader. My only minor criticism of this work is the inconsistency of presented treatments. Some sections of the book provide the exact dosage of medication, while others merely suggest possible options. As this may not be problematic for the veteran clinician, a young professional may appreciate supplementing Clinical Ophthalmology with an up-to-date pharmacology reference. Clinical Ophthalmology is not designed to be the primary source for every ophthalmologic specialty, but is intended for use as a reference. I believe it is useful in this respect, yet it is often the first textbook I reach for. It helps me work through differential diagnosis, and to determine treatment and follow-up. I believe this book is a valuable resource. If you do not own previous editions of this book, I highly recommend the investment. If you have the fourth edition, borrow this new edition and read through some of the new chapters. If you have an older edition, it may be time to invest in this updated, more complete and thorough edition. It has become a great addition to my ophthalmologic reference library.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.opx.0000134900.67908.fc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969407808", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical studies were identified in which visual acuity was used as an outcome measure. Visual acuity outcomes were examined throughout the articles and classified as follows: best visual acuity, defined as an outcome at any time during follow-up; final visual acuity, defined as an outcome at last follow-up; and interval visual acuity, defined as an outcome at specified follow-up times. A few factors that might be associated with the different types of outcome were evaluated. Reproducibility of the categorization between 2 ophthalmologists evaluating the articles was determined by using the κ statistic. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 527 clinical studies met the criteria. Among these, authors of 195 reported visual acuity as an outcome measure. Authors of 1 article(0.5%) reported only best visual acuity, authors of 6 (3%) reported both best and final visual acuity, authors of 113 (58%) reported only final visual acuity, and authors of 73 (37%) reported interval visual acuity outcomes. Reproducibility of these categorizations between 2 ophthalmologists was considered excellent, as compared with chance alone (κ = 0.84). Authors of only 2 of the 120 articles that used either best or final visual acuity outcomes discussed the limitations or potential bias of reporting outcomes in this way. Randomized trials and other prospective study designs more often were associated with interval outcomes than were nonrandomized and retrospective studies. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Despite potential bias with use of best or final visual acuity outcomes, these end points alone were used in most studies published during 2000 in the 3 most commonly cited journals. Authors of clinical studies should consider avoiding use of best or final visual acuity outcomes whenever possible to minimize possible data misinterpretation. If best or final outcomes are used, authors should consider discussing the limitations of these methods and their potential effect on the interpretation of results.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.121.11.1586", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1571149542", "source": "openalex"}

To date, this is the first review that investigates the current state of VR/AR technology applied more broadly to the entire field of ophthalmology. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched systematically from January 2014 through December 1, 2020. Studies that discussed VR and/or AR as it relates to the field of ophthalmology and provided information on the technology used were considered. Abstracts, non–peer-reviewed literature, review articles, studies that reported only qualitative data, and studies without English translations were excluded. Results: A total of 77 studies were included in this review. Of these, 28 evaluated the use of VR/AR in ophthalmic surgical training/assessment and guidance, 7 in clinical training, 23 in diagnosis/screening, and 19 in treatment/therapy. 15 studies used AR, 61 used VR, and 1 used both. Most studies focused on the validity and usability of novel technologies. Conclusions: Ophthalmology is a field of medicine that is well suited for the use of VR/AR. However, further longitudinal studies examining the practical feasibility, efficacy, and safety of such novel technologies, the cost-effectiveness, and medical/legal considerations are still needed. We believe that time will indeed foster further technological advances and lead to widespread use of VR/AR in routine ophthalmic practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/apo.0000000000000409", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3191362883", "source": "openalex"}

In the current report, 12 consecutive patients were evaluated to document operative ocular morbidity referable to the brain stem as well as visual deficits secondary to occipital lobe retraction. Before craniotomy, ophthalmological findings related to dorsal midbrain dysfunction were evident in four of the 10 patients who had previously undergone ventricular shunting. The other patients developed a partial or complete Parinaud's syndrome in the early postoperative period and some suffered additional deficits such as cranial nerve palsies. These deficits improved to varying degrees in all patients. Although each had full visual fields preoperatively, an absolute or incomplete left homonymous hemianopsia developed in the immediate postoperative period. Such visual field deficits fully resolved over a variable period of time in 10 of the 12 patients. One patient has a permanent left homonymous hemianopsia, while another has a left homonymous paracentral scotoma. Eight patients were able to return to preoperative pursuits. While ocular abnormalities related to dorsal midbrain dysfunction are most probably independent of operative approach, visual field deficits attributable to occipital lobe retraction were common in patients after a occipital transtentorial approach performed in the semisitting position.

This laser can be used for preparing host and donor tissue for both full thickness and lamellar keratoplasty. Research is underway, exploring ways to employ the FS laser for different stages of cataract surgery.

In the field of ophthalmology, a close relationship between HTLV-1 infection and uveitis was identified through a series of clinical and laboratory studies in the late 1980s–1990s. Since then, HTLV-1-related ocular manifestations such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, interstitial keratitis, optic neuritis and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)-related ocular manifestations have continuously been reported. During the three decades since the association between HTLV-1 and ocular pathologies was discovered, ophthalmic practice and research have advanced with the incorporation of new technologies into the field of ophthalmology. Accordingly, new findings from recent research have provided many insights into HTLV-1-associated ocular diseases. Advanced molecular technologies such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/broad-range PCR using ocular samples have enabled rapid and accurate diagnosis. Advanced ophthalmic technologies such as widefield fundus camera and optical coherence tomography have clarified various features of HTLV-1-associated ocular manifestations, and identified characteristics such as the \"knob-like ATL cell multiple ocular infiltration\" (KAMOI) sign. Advanced drug delivery methods such as intravitreal injection and sub-Tenon injection have led to progress in preventing disease progression. This article describes global topics and the latest research findings for HTLV-1-associated ocular diseases, with reference to a large-scale nationwide survey of ophthalmologists. Current approaches and unmet needs for HTLV-1 infection in ophthalmology are also discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00388", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3011650973", "source": "openalex"}

The presence and extent of the visual field defects were correlated to surgical results, age at onset of epilepsy, age at operation, preoperative duration of epilepsy, presence of grand mal, preoperative complications, and neuropathological findings, but without observing any statistically significant conclusions. On the other hand, the extent of the postoperative visual field defect was significantly influenced by the side of the operation, with more and larger defects following right‐sided lobectomies. In the 51 patients with postoperative hemianopias, this defect was either unobserved by the patient or regarded as a considerably less important handicap than the frequent and socially invalidating preoperative seizures.

Case reportsCase I, a white male, weighed 6 lb. 3 oz.at birth in 1915.Hypermobility of the finger joints was apparent in early childhood, but apart from a tendency to skin-splitting and a moderate myopia, he was quite well until the age of i9 years.He then developed a left-sided hemiplegia, which was attributed to an intracranial bleed, consequent upon a head injury which had occurred 3 weeks previously.Considerable recovery of function took place, but some weakness of the left arm and leg persisted.At the age of 22 years, 3 years after this event, he was struck in the right eye by a rubber patch from a car tyre.Although the blow was of no great severity, the globe of the eye was ruiptured.Primary suture was performed but vision was lost, and the eye was later enucleated and replaced by a prosthesis.He remained in good health until the age of 5I, when he tripped in his home and banged the left side of his head on the ground.The globe of the left eye was ruptured and although the scleral tear was sutured, he remained blind.A younger sister also had the EDS, and she too became blind in early adult life (vide infra).His other six sibs were normal, as were his parents and his own four children.There was no known consanguinity, and no other members of the kindred were affected (Fig. i,overleaf). ExaminationIn I969 he was found to be a thin, tense man, 70 in.tall and weighing I6o lb.His elbows, knees, and shins bore hyperpigmented papyraceous scars, and he had considerable extensibility of the skin.The finger and wrist joints were very lax, and he had a moderate increase in the range of movements", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.54.4.263", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081636808", "source": "openalex"}

It also promises to alter prediction, diagnosis and management of the complex disease age-related macular degeneration. Personalized ophthalmology is underpinned by an understanding of the molecular basis of eye disease. Two important areas of focus are required for adoption of personalized approaches: disease stratification and individualization. Disease stratification relies on phenotypic and genetic assessment leading to molecular diagnosis; individualization encompasses all aspects of patient management from optimized genetic counseling and conventional therapies to trials of novel DNA-based therapies. This review discusses the clinical implications of these twin strategies. Advantages and implications of genetic testing for patients with inherited eye diseases, choice of molecular diagnostic modality, drivers for adoption of personalized ophthalmology, service planning implications, ethical considerations and future challenges are considered.

Methods PubMed.gov was searched for relevant articles using the keywords “COVID-19”, “coronavirus”, and “SARS-CoV-2” in conjunction with “ophthalmology” and “eye”. Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). Results As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe. There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews. These articles could be classified into the topics “Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission”, “Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19”, “Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic”, and “Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure”. Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth. Conclusion Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19. As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic. In the eye, COVID-19 can manifest as keratoconjunctivitis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1164-9381", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3022452745", "source": "openalex"}

Methods The study reviewed data from the American Association of Medical Colleges for the years 2003 to 2017. The number and percentage of women at different ranks, as well as number of women Chairs of clinical academic departments, were collected by specialty. The number of women residents from 2007 to 2017 was obtained from datasets published by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Trends of the percentage of women at different ranks were compared. Results The percentage of women residents in ophthalmology has remained constant at around 42%, although it has declined slightly over the last 3 years. On the other hand, the number of women faculty in academic ophthalmology has gradually increased from 24 to 34% over 15 years. This increase has largely been at the Assistant Professor rank, with only a modest increase at the Professor rank. Discussion The percentage of women in ophthalmology continues to lag behind the average for all clinical departments at every level. While this gender disparity is rapidly closing for Assistant Professors and slowly closing for Associate Professors and Chairs, it is widening for Professors. This demonstrates that women in ophthalmology are making some strides but are not being promoted to Professor at the same rate as other specialties. This may be the result of explicit and implicit biases, as well as phenomena such as imposter syndrome that are more common in women.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3401849", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2997368720", "source": "openalex"}

However, physicians have raised concerns that EHR time requirements have negatively affected their productivity. Meanwhile, evolving approaches toward physician reimbursement will require additional documentation to measure quality and cost of care. To date, little quantitative analysis has rigorously studied these topics.To examine ophthalmologist time requirements for EHR use.A single-center cohort study was conducted between September 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, among 27 stable departmental ophthalmologists (defined as attending ophthalmologists who worked at the study institution for ≥6 months before and after the study period). Ophthalmologists who did not have a standard clinical practice or who did not use the EHR were excluded.Time stamps from the medical record and EHR audit log were analyzed to measure the length of time required by ophthalmologists for EHR use. Ophthalmologists underwent manual time-motion observation to measure the length of time spent directly with patients on the following 3 activities: EHR use, conversation, and examination.The study outcomes were time spent by ophthalmologists directly with patients on EHR use, conversation, and examination as well as total time required by ophthalmologists for EHR use.Among the 27 ophthalmologists in this study (10 women and 17 men; mean [SD] age, 47.3 [10.7] years [median, 44; range, 34-73 years]) the mean (SD) total ophthalmologist examination time was 11.2 (6.3) minutes per patient, of which 3.0 (1.8) minutes (27% of the examination time) were spent on EHR use, 4.7 (4.2) minutes (42%) on conversation, and 3.5 (2.3) minutes (31%) on examination. Mean (SD) total ophthalmologist time spent using the EHR was 10.8 (5.0) minutes per encounter (range, 5.8-28.6 minutes). The typical ophthalmologist spent 3.7 hours using the EHR for a full day of clinic: 2.1 hours during examinations and 1.6 hours outside the clinic session. Linear mixed effects models showed a positive association between EHR use and billing level and a negative association between EHR use per encounter and clinic volume. Each additional encounter per clinic was associated with a decrease of 1.7 minutes (95% CI, -4.3 to 1.0) of EHR use time per encounter for ophthalmologists with high mean billing levels (adjusted R2 = 0.42; P = .01).Ophthalmologists have limited time with patients during office visits, and EHR use requires a substantial portion of that time.

The goal of this research was to evaluate perspectives on and familiarity with telemedicine among eye care providers at a large tertiary-care medical center via an anonymous, descriptive survey.Results:In total, 58 eye care physicians completed surveys (response rates of 86% for physicians-in-training and 49% for faculty physicians, respectively). Although a majority of both faculty and physicians-in-training were willing to participate in telemedicine services, trainees were more likely to be willing to interpret photographs than faculty (p=0.04). Most respondents (71%) indicated that they did not use telemedicine. Over half had received photographs (via phone or e-mail) for interpretation from referring physicians (54%) or patients (56%) within the past 3 months. A majority of providers (82%) would be willing to participate in telemedicine for consultations and for interpreting photographs, but a majority (59%) had low confidence in remote care for providing an opinion on patient care.Conclusions:Most eye care providers viewed telemedicine as part of the future of eye care but were concerned about the use of telemedicine. Although most providers did not practice telemedicine, over half of them were comfortable managing eye care consultations (including patients' photographs) via the Internet.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2014.0115", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1860410213", "source": "openalex"}

Twenty-four patients presented with acute problems requiring specialist ophthalmological advice to the emergency department of a remote hospital in Mt Isa, Queensland, between December 1996 and February 1997. Tele-ophthalmology consultations were carried out with three ophthalmologists working in a specialist eye clinic in Townsville, 900 km away. Patients and doctors were extremely positive about the telemedicine facility. Tele-ophthalmology was an effective means of providing acute specialist consultation in a remote emergency department. By reducing the need for acute transfers to the tertiary hospital in Townsville, significant benefits can be anticipated—both financial and in terms of convenience for the patient.

Modern neuroimaging allows routine access to visual population receptive fields (pRFs), enabling investigations of clinical disorders. Yet how the underlying neural circuitry operates is controversial. The controversy surrounds observations that measurements of pRFs can change in healthy adults as well as in patients with a range of ophthalmological and neurological disorders. The debate relates to the balance between plasticity and stability of the underlying neural circuitry. We propose that to move the debate forward, the field needs to define the implied mechanism. First, we review the pRF changes in both healthy subjects and those with clinical disorders. Then, we propose a computational model that describes how pRFs can change in healthy humans. We assert that we can correctly interpret the pRF changes in clinical disorders only if we establish the capabilities and limitations of pRF dynamics in healthy humans with mechanistic models that provide quantitative predictions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-vision-091517-033948", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2808689049", "source": "openalex"}

This paperback version is hardly compact. But at 487 pages, it is shorter than the previous paperback edition published in 2007. The first author, Neil R. Miller, MD, remains on top. There are 2 new authors: Prem S. Subramanian, MD, and Vivek R. Patel, MD. All authors are, or were, from Johns Hopkins University. Other authors have contributed to some of the chapters. They are appropriately given credit. As in the previous editions, the authors have jettisoned the bibliography and the many case examples. They are aiming at a teaching text and have succeeded marvelously. What makes this book a top choice? First, the authors have again performed a superb job of presenting the principles of examination. Second, the writing is fluid. Not having tons of references and case citations to interrupt the flow makes the text read more like a story. Of course, the reader must accept the authors' often overarching assertions, but then these are brilliant neuro-ophthalmologists with a track record of solid contributions to the field. I could find little to quarrel with. Third, nothing important seems to have been left out. All the rules, and even the exceptions, are here. Fourth, the illustrations are superb. Just about everything the authors mention is pictured-right there on the same page. Very few of the faded black-and-white photographs from the original editions are still around. Most of the clinical photographs and cartoons come from the host institution. Where they needed illustrations from elsewhere, they have chosen the classics. The secret of success here is that the original tone is authoritative, but it took the skill of a great condensing artist to turn it into a teaching textbook. I learned a lot from reading it, and I give much of the credit to Dr. Miller, who has been with this project for more than 40 years.

With ageing populations in many countries, more than 20% might have the disorder. Advanced age-related macular degeneration, including neovascular age- related macular degeneration (wet) and geographic atrophy (late dry), is associated with substantial, progressive visual impairment. Major risk factors include cigarette smoking, nutritional factors, cardiovascular diseases, and genetic markers, including genes regulating complement, lipid, angiogenic, and extracellular matrix pathways. Some studies have suggested a declining prevalence of age-related macular degeneration, perhaps due to reduced exposure to modifi able risk factors. Accurate diagnosis combines clinical examination and investigations, including retinal photography, angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Dietary anti-oxidant supplementation slows progression of the disease. Treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration incorporates intra ocular injections of anti- VEGF agents, occasionally combined with other modalities. Evidence suggests that two commonly used anti-VEGF therapies, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, have similar effi cacy, but possible diff erences in systemic safety are diffi cult to assess.

DESIGN--Prospective survey over eight weeks. SETTING--Two general and one ophthalmic accident and emergency departments, two general outpatient departments, and an eye hospital ward consulting room (all in two teaching hospitals) in Newcastle upon Tyne. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Consultation numbers by age, sex, health district of residence, source of referral, diagnosis, and disposal were determined. An average of 37 ophthalmological emergency patients were seen daily. The all cause consultation rate per 1000 population for Newcastle residents was 2.64 (17.2 per year); for injuries it was 1.10 (7.2 per year) and for inflammations the rate was 0.91 (5.9 per year). Consultation rates per 1000 were 3.5 for males and 1.8 for females, the excess being explained by the higher risk of injury to men. Most patients were self-referred (58%), consulted during office hours (79.6%), were attended by senior house officers working alone (83.9%), and were asked to return for follow up (66.1%). Patients in an accident and emergency department seldom saw a consultant in their initial management. The diagnoses of patients from outside Newcastle were little different from those who lived within the city. The 10 commonest problems accounted for 68% of all cases. Injuries were the commonest problem (40.9% of all diagnoses). CONCLUSION--Ophthalmological accident and emergencies are an important component of an accident and emergency department workload. These patients are usually seen by junior doctors, some untrained in ophthalmology. The wide range of presenting problems poses a challenge for training and the organisation of effective referral chains, while the gender difference in injury rates points to the potential for prevention.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.47.5.382", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990216168", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: A retrospective review of case records of all children aged <16 years with diagnosis of CVI seen between January 2016 and December 2016 was carried out. Data were collected for their age, gender, cause of CVI, refraction, accommodation, anterior and posterior segment examination findings, and systemic problems. Results: A total of 124 patients were identified and studied (80 boys and 44 girls, mean age 5.23 years, 44.8% aged <2 years). The most common causes of CVI were hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (34.4%), undetermined etiology (32.8%), neonatal seizures, and infantile spasms (16% each). The most common presenting complaints were poor vision (76%) and squint (11.2%). Profound visual impairment was seen in 88.8%, and 11.2% had high functioning CVI.

Methods: Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index databases were used to collate data on ophthal­mology research literature from 1980 to 2000. Subsequent analysis particularly focused on Australia's contribution to this literature, including publication frequency vis‐à‐vis the world, collaboration, and the journals in which Australian researchers frequently publish. These data were also compared with other countries of similar scientific stature or language. Results: Since 1980, Australia has ranked in the top 10 nations contributing to world ophthalmology research. Its contribution was close to world average in the 1980s, but increasing numbers of researchers and papers show Australia exceeding the world average during the 1990s. Most ophthalmology research collaboration by Australians is within Australia. Although fewer in number, collaborative papers with overseas researchers include 28 other countries. Data on the journals in which Australians publish show that Australian researchers continue to exhibit a preference for publication in their own regional journals.

In particular, the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR), as evaluated by chromatic pupillometry, can be used as a reliable marker of mRGC function in vivo. In the last years, pupillometry has become a promising tool to assess mRGC dysfunction in various neurological and neuro-ophthalmological conditions. In this review we will present the most relevant findings of pupillometric studies in various neuro-ophthalmological conditionsincluding hereditary optic neuropathies, glaucoma, ischemic optic neuropathies, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. The use of PIPR as a marker for mRGC function is also proposed for other neurodegenerative disorders in which circadian dysfunction is documented.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.01047", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2904381811", "source": "openalex"}

Neuro-ophthalmological signs were present in 14% of all patients with Behcet's disease. Oculomotor findings were sixth nerve palsy in eight, third nerve palsy in two and supranuclear gaze disorders in two patients. These are explained on the basis of increased intracranial pressure or brainstem infarction. Twenty-five of 80 patients had papilledema and increased intracranial pressure. The high incidence of papilledema due to intracranial hypertension and dural vein thrombosis is emphasized. Plasma prostacyclin (PGI2) and vessel wall in vitro PGI2 biosynthesis were found to be significantly decreased compared to normals in all three patients studied. Three patients presented with optic neuropathy. Progressive atrophy of the optic disc and severe visual loss is not uncommon in Behcet's disease, however, visual loss due to acute optic neuropathy is rare. The authors believe that the pathogenesis could be explained by the occlusion of the small vessels of the optic nerves due to vasculitis and demyelinization on the basis of mild ischemia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/01658109109009635", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059030763", "source": "openalex"}

Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, stereopsis, and visual fields were measured, and optic fundi were photographed. Horizontal and vertical eye movements (search coil) were recorded, and saccades, pursuit, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), vergence, and optokinetic (OK) responses were measured.All patients showed normal visual functions and optic fundi. The main eye movement abnormality concerned saccades, which were \"multistep,\" consisting of a series of small saccades and larger movements that showed transient decelerations. Larger saccades ended earlier and more abruptly (greater peak deceleration) in LOTS patients than in control subjects; these changes can be attributed to premature termination of the saccadic pulse. Smooth-pursuit and slow-phase OK gains were reduced, but VOR, vergence, and gaze holding were normal.Patients with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS) show characteristic abnormalities of saccades but normal afferent visual systems. Hypometria, transient decelerations, and premature termination of saccades suggest disruption of a \"latch circuit\" that normally inhibits pontine omnipause neurons, permitting burst neurons to discharge until the eye movement is completed. These measurable abnormalities of saccades provide a means to evaluate the effects of novel treatments for LOTS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000144275.76658.f4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077291994", "source": "openalex"}

This survey aims to evaluate the current state of undergraduate ophthalmology teaching in Australasia and proximate Asian medical schools. Methods: A questionnaire was developed to determine the content and extent of ophthalmology teaching in the undergraduate medical curriculum. The questionnaire was sent to 25 medical schools throughout Australasia and Asia. Results: Nineteen of the 25 questionnaires were returned (76% response rate). Ophthalmology teaching programmes ranged from 2 to 20 days: five (26%) medical schools having one ophthalmology attachment; six schools (32%) two attachments; and the remainder three or more. Only seven of the schools taught all 13 ophthalmology topics recommended in current curriculum guidelines. Ocular examination (100%), lens and cataract (95%) and ocular manifestations of systemic disease (95%) were the most commonly taught topics, with intraocular tumours only covered by 10 schools (53%).

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in an outpatient ophthalmology clinic. Appointment data were analyzed for 51,529 ophthalmology appointments in the computerized scheduling database during a 12-month period. Results: The average no-show rate was 21.7% and 6.6% for resident- and faculty-clinic, respectively ( P <0.001). The no-show rate increased, and the likelihood an appointment would be kept decreased as the time in advance an appointment was scheduled increased. With a lead time for appointment of 0–2 weeks, the average no-show rate was 9.1% and 2.4% for the resident- and faculty-clinic, respectively. With a lead time for appointment of 6 months, the average no-show rate increased to 38.3% ( P <0.001) and 6.9% ( P <0.001) for the resident- and faculty-clinic, respectively. A predicted no-show rate model showed approximately 2% reduction of the no-show rate for 10% increase of the proportion of patients scheduled within 2 weeks, potentially reducing the no-show rate by nearly 60% with all appointments scheduled 0–2 weeks in advance. Conclusion: Clinic no-show rate increased as appointment lead time increased.

Although the external appearance of the eyes has been well‐described, the type and frequency of structural and functional eye anomalies has not been emphasized. We report three children with Kabuki syndrome who also had a retinal coloboma. A diagnosis of CHARGE association was initially suggested in two of the patients before the typical facial features of Kabuki syndrome emerged. A detailed review of reported cases of Kabuki syndrome shows that a variety of eye anomalies are associated with Kabuki syndrome. The incidence of coloboma is greatly increased in Kabuki syndrome. Thus, ophthalmologic abnormalities are frequently associated with Kabuki syndrome, and an ophthalmologic evaluation should be performed for each patient. Phenotypic overlap, including congenital heart, ear, and renal defects, can lead to the diagnosis of CHARGE association, especially since the typical facial features of Kabuki syndrome may not be apparent in early infancy. Thus, Kabuki syndrome should be considered in patients with coloboma if other features consistent with this condition are present, and follow‐up evaluations are indicated for establishing the proper diagnosis. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.20277", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2227652159", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Patients evaluated between 1985 and 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Data analyzed included vision, residual strabismus after surgery, aberrant reinnervation, binocular function, and anisometropia. Long-term outcome was assessed in patients followed-up longer than 6 months. Results: Forty-one patients were identified. The most frequent causes were congenital (39%), traumatic (37%), and neoplastic (17%). Visual acuities were reduced in 71% of patients at the time of the initial visit. Long-term outcome could be assessed in 20 of the 41 patients (49%), with a mean follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 0.5 to 13 years). Visual acuities were reduced because of amblyopia in 35% and nonamblyopic factors in 25% of patients in the long-term outcome group at last follow-up. The best response to amblyopia therapy was in the congenital group, in which all patients improved to normal visual acuity. Strabismus surgery was performed on 8 of 20 children (40%) followed-up, none of whom demonstrated measurable stereopsis after operation despite improved alignment. Aberrant reinnervation was present in 9 of 20 patients (45%). Only 3 patients fully recovered from their oculomotor nerve injuries, and these were the only patients to regain measurable stereopsis. The causes in those 3 patients were congenital, traumatic, and neoplastic. Conclusions: Oculomotor nerve palsy/paresis is associated with poor visual and sensorimotor outcome in children younger than 8 years of age. The best ophthalmologic outcome was in the resolved cases (3 of 20; 15%). Amblyopia therapy was most effective with congenital causes, but treatment results were poor with other causes.

As a volume of more than 700 pages, this book is more extensive than an introduction but less extensive than a definitive reference. The major focus is on clinical differential diagnosis and management, with supplementary discussions of neuroanatomy, physiology, and ancillary studies used in neuro-ophthalmology. Contents: The book is divided into four main sections: history and examination, afferent disorders, efferent disorders, and headache. The afferent and efferent sections are subdivided neuroanatomically, and lead the reader from anterior visual pathways to higher cortical dysfunction. Each subsequent chapter provides an organized and thoughtful presentation of a topical disorder by covering pertinent review of the anatomy, then pathophysiology, clinical presentations, differential diagnosis, relevant diagnostic-imaging studies, discussion of specific disease entities, and management. There are also symptom-based discussions that emanate from the patient report precipitating the physician visit. Each subsection succinctly discusses the disease process and, where appropriate, includes fundus photos, neuroradiologic illustrations, and tables of distinguishing features. Important differential characteristics are emphasized, which clarify information for the reader. In addition, each subsection is followed by an up-todate bibliography. The initial section of two chapters teaches the history and examination. The subsequent section deals with visual loss and dysfunction. Chapter 3 encompasses a topical overview of afferent disorders, visual pathways, visual field, and electrophysiologic diagnostic testing. Chapter 4 presents a useful discussion of retinal disorders that mimic optic neuropathies. Chapters 5 through 8 focus on topographic neuro-ophthalmology from nerve to cortex, and in particular update the prognosis and management of optic neuritis. The last four chapters elaborate on diseases of higher cortical function and the entities of transient visual loss, functional visual loss, and visual hallucinations and illusions. The third major section discusses efferent disorders including ocular motility-related cranial neuropathies and pupillary, eyelid and facial nerve, and movement abnormalities. The last chapter of this section is devoted to orbital disease. The final section focuses on headache, facial pain and disorders of facial sensation. Strengths: The text is particularly useful for the all-in-one systematic overview of the clinical field, from anatomy to management. The thoroughness of disease discussion (by the use of key charts, tables, outlines, and clinically significant photos and neuroimaging scans) is commendable. The brief yet pertinent references direct readers to more detailed investigations and primary sources. The publisher's use of chapter numbers on each page allows one to efficiently scan for information. Deficiencies: The length of the book may overwhelm residents looking for one resource for their 3-month rotation. Although the book focuses on diagnosis and management, it may do so at the expense of neuroanatomy, visual field testing, neuroimaging, and electrophysiology. Recommended audience: Residents in ophthalmology and neurology and fellows in neuro-ophthalmology would benefit from this text. Critical appraisal: This text's readability, organization, clear outlines, and tables for differential diagnosis are extremely beneficial for those who treat neuro-ophthalmology patients. The thorough discussions and references relating to management will reassure practitioners that the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities have been adequately considered as they look for help in the care of their patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00041327-200112000-00018", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975149038", "source": "openalex"}

Adult human visual cortex shows several manifestations of plasticity, such as perceptual learning and adaptation, working under the top-down influence of attention. Plasticity results from the interplay of several mechanisms, including the GABAergic system, epigenetic factors, mitochondrial activity, and structural remodeling of synaptic connectivity. There is also a downside of plasticity, that is, maladaptive plasticity, in which there are behavioral losses resulting from plasticity changes in the human brain. Understanding plasticity mechanisms could have major implications in the diagnosis and treatment of ocular diseases, such as retinal disorders, cataract and refractive surgery, amblyopia, and in the evaluation of surgical materials and techniques. Furthermore, eliciting plasticity could open new perspectives in the development of strategies that trigger plasticity for better medical and surgical outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/568354", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104979539", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with isolated RV tended to have peripheral vascular sheathing, macular oedema, and diffuse capillary leakage. Those with RV accompanying Behçet9s disease often had branch vein retinal occlusions and retinal infiltrates together with macular oedema and diffuse capillary leakage; the retinal infiltrates were pathognomonic for Behçet9s disease. In sarcoidosis the retina typically showed features of periphlebitis associated with focal vascular leakage. Patients with uveomeningitis, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, or systemic vasculitis showed diffuse retinal capillary leakage associated with a mixture of the other features. Poor visual function was particularly associated with macular oedema and branch vein retinal occlusion, while the retina appeared to 9withstand9 the impact of vascular sheathing, periphlebitis, or neovascularisation alone.

Methods: This study investigated patient referrals from general practitioners and optometrists to an ophthalmologist’s practice in Belfast, over a period of 3 months from January 2007 to the end of March 2007. Anonymised data were divided into two groups depending on the referring practitioner. Within the two groups, patient numbers were sub‐divided into 15 categories covering the range of diagnoses made. Preliminary diagnoses or reasons for referral were compared with the definitive diagnoses made by the ophthalmologist. Results: Optometrists contributed the greatest number of referrals (323) with 243 patients referred by general practitioners. Cataract was the most common condition referred by optometrists, and the second most common condition referred by general practitioners: agreement with ophthalmological diagnosis was high for both groups of primary care practitioners. Concurrence of referral reason with ophthalmological diagnosis for glaucoma was lower for general practitioners (56%) than for optometrists (76%), but optometrists referred more false positive patients for glaucoma than did general practitioners. The opposite was true for lid/tear duct/conjunctival conditions, the most common basis for referral by general practitioners.

However, the ophthalmic features and their relationship to the neurologic features of SCA7 have not been widely reported. The goal of this study was to provide increased documentation.The medical records of 10 consecutive patients with SCA7 examined in the Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic at Kresge Eye Institute between 2000 and 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. Each patient underwent a standardized ophthalmologic and neurologic examination. Some patients also underwent electroretinography (ERG). Eight patients had genetically confirmed disease and 2 patients had presumptive SCA7 based on their clinical presentation. Patients were excluded if they had visual loss or ataxia due to other causes.Nine patients reported visual symptoms at presentation, including hemeralopia, photophobia, dyschromatopsia, and blurred vision. In 3 of these patients, the visual symptoms had preceded the onset of ataxic symptoms. Visual acuity was abnormal in all patients at presentation. Four patients with visual dysfunction had normal or minimally abnormal macular pigmentary changes, but all patients had abnormal electroretinograms (ERGs) showing primarily cone dysfunction. The severity of visual loss and the severity of ataxia were frequently discordant.Based on this study, patients with SCA7 often have visual symptoms that may precede, accompany, or follow the onset of ataxic symptoms. The severity of vision loss and ataxia may be discordant. Ophthalmoscopic evidence of macular abnormalities may be scant, but results of ERG will always be abnormal. This information may assist in earlier and more cost-effective diagnosis and permit more effective patient counseling.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0b013e3181b1b3f8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076318272", "source": "openalex"}

Our objective was to determine the frequency of ocular OMG in patients referred to an academic neuro-ophthalmologist and determine alternate diagnoses and response to therapy.We performed a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the University of Kansas Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic with suspected OMG over 9 years. We defined OMG as isolated ptosis/diplopia at initial presentation supported by at least one of the following abnormal tests: edrophonium test, ice test, Cogan lid twitch, fatigability on sustained upgaze, acetylcholine receptor binding antibody, greater than 10% decrement on repetitive stimulation, or abnormal single-fiber jitter. We also determined the cause of ptosis/diplopia if it was not the result of OMG. Patients who progressed from OMG to generalized disease were termed transformed myasthenia gravis (TMG).One hundred thirty-eight patients were referred with mean age at presentation 58 ± 19 years. Myasthenia gravis was diagnosed in 101 patients; 95 had OMG; six had generalized MG. Diagnosis in the other 37 was cranial nerve palsies (nine), levator dehiscence (five), multiple sclerosis (two), blepharospasm (two), decompensated phorias (three), accommodation spasm (four), exophoria (three), skew deviation (two), Graves disease (one), hypertropia (one), myopathy (one), neurosarcoidosis (one), progressive supranuclear palsy (one), Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (one), and obstructive sleep apnea (one). Mean follow-up was 3.0 ± 2.8 years. Test sensitivity/specificity in OMG was fatigability on sustained upgaze 0.80/0.63; ice pack 0.80/0.25; Cogan lid twitch 0.59/1.00; edrophonium 0.88/0.50; acetylcholine receptor binding antibody 0.38/1.00; repetitive nerve stimulation 0.24/1.00; and single-fiber electromyography 0.90/1.00.

This draft was sent to an international panel of retina experts for a first revision. The panel met at the European School for Advanced Studies in Ophthalmology headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland, and elaborated the final document.Seven tomographic qualitative and quantitative features are taken into account and scored according to a grading protocol termed TCED-HFV, which includes foveal thickness (T), corresponding to either central subfoveal thickness or macular volume, intraretinal cysts (C), the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and/or external limiting membrane (ELM) status (E), presence of disorganization of the inner retinal layers (D), number of hyperreflective foci (H), subfoveal fluid (F), and vitreoretinal relationship (V). Four different stages of the disease, that is, early diabetic maculopathy, advanced diabetic maculopathy, severe diabetic maculopathy, and atrophic maculopathy, are based on the first four variables, namely the T, C, E, and D. The different stages reflect progressive severity of the disease.A novel grading system of diabetic maculopathy is hereby proposed.

Two patients developed subtle and suggestive changes on optical coherence tomography in the parafoveal ellipsoid zone after 11 and 17 months and definitive toxicity after 15 and 25 months. None of the other patients showed damage. Thus, evidence to date indicates that extreme doses do accelerate retinal toxicity but with a probable time course of many months rather than days. As this is being written, other reports are coming out that may alter the landscape of CQ and HCQ usage, and more reports will show up by the time this one is published. For example, a prepublication just appeared of a small French trial of 22 COVID-19-positive patients using 600 mg/day HCQ for 10 days to reduce the viral load.10Gautret P. Lagier J.-C. Parola P. et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar The number of polymerase chain reaction-positive cases fell nearly 50% relative to those of controls and dropped to nearly zero if azithromycin was added. The HCQ dosage of 600 mg/day is only approximately twice that recommended by the AAO, on average, and should present no risk of retinopathy in this time frame. News media are now also citing interest in the use of CQ or HCQ intermittently as prophylaxis, much like the use for malaria, although doses have not been mentioned. Ophthalmologists should judge all of this evolving information in light of well-established knowledge about dose, weight, and duration as the primary determinants of risk of retinopathy.11Melles R.G.

Short-term trials (less than 2 weeks) will have negligible risk, even with doses 5-6 times the usual recommended maximum dosage of <5 mg/kg/day. Usage for a few months will still have very low risk with doses less than 3-4 times the usual level. However, if physicians suggest using these drugs for a year or more, I would strongly advise staying within the AAO recommendation and screening the patient annually. The bottom line: I do not believe ophthalmic screening is necessary for COVID-19 patients who take CQ or HCQ for less than 2 weeks as antiviral therapy, because the likelihood of retinal damage is exceedingly low, even with high doses. In a time of pandemic with worldwide shortages of medical personnel, funds, hospital beds, equipment, screening tests, and proven therapy, it would be counter-productive (and raise inappropriate fears) to suggest the addition of labor-intensive and expensive eye examinations that are of low yield. However, as new protocols arise, these steps will need to be evaluated relative to the risk of retinopathy that their particular doses and durations of use may pose. Ophthalmologists will be most effective in this time of crisis by reassuring physicians and the public where retinopathy is not a serious concern with respect to CQ or HCQ usage for coronavirus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.03.029", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3012687586", "source": "openalex"}

Not surprisingly, a variety of alternative immunomodulatory agents have been tested for topical use including cyclosporin A (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus (FK506), rapamycin (sirolimus) and leflunomide. Local application bears the possibility to avoid the severe side-effects of systemic therapy. The effect of topical therapy is naturally restricted to local immune response mechanisms, such as antigen presentation by Langerhans and dendritic cells. Moreover, many immunomodulatory agents (e.g. CsA) are lipophilic and thus have low water solubility and penetrate insufficiently intra-ocularly, often being stored in the lipophilic corneal epithelial barrier. Therefore, the therapeutical success is limited for intra-ocular immune-mediated diseases like anterior uveitis. However, a multitude of strategies have been introduced to circumvent these problems including complexing substances such as cyclodextrins (CDs) and liposomes. In the prevention and treatment of transplant rejection after keratoplasty, many attempts to introduce topical immunomodulatory therapy have failed; on the other hand, further therapeutic options not primarily expected are being evaluated today such as treatment of severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca. In our own studies, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of topical treatment with different agents including MMF and evaluated the efficacy of topical treatment in animal models for uveitis and keratoplasty. Taken together, topical immunomodulatory therapy will not replace systemic therapy but further treatment options can be expected.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000080937", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037958386", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical experience in dental practice claims that mandibular latero-deviation is connected both to eye dominance and to defects of ocular convergence. The trigeminal nerve is the largest and most complex of the twelve cranial nerves. The trigeminal system represents the connection between somitic structures and those derived from the branchial arches, collecting the proprioception from both somitic structures and oculomotor muscles. The intermedius nucleus of the medulla is a small perihypoglossal brainstem nucleus, which acts to integrate information from the head and neck and relays it on to the nucleus of the solitary tract where autonomic responses are generated. This intriguing neurophysiological web led our research group to investigate anatomical and functional associations between dental occlusion and vision.

Methods:Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The intervention of interest was any type of tele-ophthalmology, including screening of diseases using remote devices. Studies involved patients receiving care from any trained provider via tele-ophthalmology, compared with those receiving equivalent face-to-face care. A search was executed on the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, Global Health, EBSCO-CINAHL, SCOPUS, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, OCLC Papers First, and Web of Science Core Collection. Six outcomes of care for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), or glaucoma were measured and analyzed. Results:Two hundred thirty-seven records were assessed at the full-text level; six RCTs fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Four studies involved participants with diabetes mellitus, and two studies examined choroidal neovascularization in AMD. Only data of detection of disease and participation in the screening program were used for the meta-analysis. Tele-ophthalmology had a 14% higher odds to detect disease than traditional examination; however, the result was not statistically significant (n = 2,012, odds ratio: 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52–2.53, p = 0.74). Meta-analysis results show that odds of having DR screening in the tele-ophthalmology group was 13.15 (95% CI: 8.01–21.61; p < 0.001) compared to the traditional screening program. Conclusions:The current evidence suggests that tele-ophthalmology for DR and age-related macular degeneration is as effective as in-person examination and potentially increases patient participation in screening.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2017.0100", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2742365000", "source": "openalex"}

(CHCI), a large multi-site Federally Qualified Health Center) were evaluated by teleophthalmology using the Canon CR-1 nonmydriatic fundus camera. Digital images were acquired in the CHCI offices and saved on the EyePACS server network. The images were later evaluated by retinal specialists at the Yale Eye Center, Yale University Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science. The costs for the standard of care ophthalmic examinations were calculated based on 2009 Medicaid reimbursement rates. The process of telemedicine-based diagnosis was based on a take-store-forward-visualize system. The cost of telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging examination included cost for devices, training, annual costs and a transportation fee. Current Medicaid reimbursement, transportation, and staff labor costs were used to calculate the conventional retinal examination cost as a comparison.Among the 611 patients digital retinal images screened in the first year of this program and for whom data are available, 166 (27.2%) cases of diabetic retinopathy were identified. Seventy-five (12.3%) patients screened positive with clinically significant disease and were referred for further ophthalmological evaluation and treatment. The primary direct cost of the telemedicine was $3.80, $15.00, $17.60, $1.50, and $2.50 per patient for medical assistant, ophthalmologist, capital cost (Equipment + Training), equipment maintenance, and transportation fee, respectively. The total cost in the telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging and evaluation was $40.40. The cost of conventional retinal examination was $8.70, $65.30, and $3.80 per patients for round-trip transportation, 2009 national Medicaid Physician Fee Schedule allowable for bilateral eye examination, and medical assistant personnel, respectively. The total costs of conventional fundus examination were $77.80. An additional conventional ophthalmologic retinal examination was required for 75 (12.3%) patients with clinically significant disease on telemedicine evaluation, which involves an averaged additional cost of $ 9.55 per patient for all the patients in the study. If the cost of subsequent examination was added, the total cost of telemedicine-based digital fundus imaging was $49.95 per patient in our group of 611 patients evaluated.Our cost analysis indicates that telemedicine-based diabetic retinopathy screening cost less ($49.95 vs $77.80) than conventional retinal examination and the telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging examination has the potential to provide an alternative method with greater convenience and access for the remote and indigent populations. Diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy are growing problems in the United States and worldwide. Large scale adoption of telemedicine should be encouraged as a means toward providing improved access, increasing compliance with annual evaluation, at a low cost for patients with diabetes with direct access to an eye care specialist.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2168553690", "source": "openalex"}

Forty patients (80 eyes) were evaluated by SWAP and standard automated perimetry. Thirteen patients (26 eyes) had recovered from optic neuritis and/or multiple sclerosis, 15 (30 eyes) were in various stages of treatment for pseudotumor cerebri, and 12 (24 eyes) had other miscellaneous neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. Six additional patients (12 eyes) with neuro-ophthalmologic conditions were tested twice on different days during a 2-week period, with the order of SWAP and standard perimetric testing being reversed on the second day. <h3>Results:</h3> Of the 80 eyes tested, 38 (48%) had SWAP visual fields that were worse than standard automated perimetry results; 29 (36%) showed no difference between standard and SWAP visual fields; and 13 (16%) had standard automated perimetry results that were worse than SWAP visual fields.

Diagnostic confirmation can be obtained by noting the absence of fungiform papillae on the tongue and by observing an abnormal reaction to histamine injected into the skin. Evidence suggests that denervation supersensitivity exists in dysautonomic ocular structures, both to sympathetic and to parasympathetic stimuli.

Recent findings Numerous studies have associated mitochondrial diseases with neuro-ophthalmic manifestations. Although there has been an explosion of studies on the genetics of mitochondrial diseases over the past few years, pathogenesis is only partly understood and therapy remains very limited. Over the past year, new mutations in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy have been reported, and at least three genes associated with autosomal dominant chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia have been described. These findings allow a better definition of the specific genetic mutations and gene products as well as pathophysiology of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. The current development of animal models allows a better understanding of the pathophysiology of human mitochondrial diseases. Summary The afferent and efferent visual pathways within the central nervous system are frequently involved in mitochondrial diseases. Neuro-ophthalmic signs figure prominently and may be the presenting or even sole manifestation of these disorders. The four most common neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities seen in mitochondrial disorders are bilateral optic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia with ptosis, pigmentary retinopathy, and retrochiasmal visual loss.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00019052-200302000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4252501449", "source": "openalex"}

As in the past, current clinical experience has prompted new pharmacological questions and induced much debate among practitioners, notably in the field of ophthalmology. An examination of the history of antibodies as treatments for ocular disorders reveals interesting parallels to the modern era. The fact that a treatment administered by a systemic route could be efficacious in a local disease was not widely accepted and the \"chemical\" nature of antibodies was not clearly understood in the late 19th century. Clinical studies by Henry Coppez, a Belgian ophthalmologist, established in 1894 that anti-diphtheric antitoxins could be used to treat conjunctival diphtheria. Nearly 20 years later, Coppez and Danis described age-related macular degeneration, a disorder which today benefits from ranibizumab therapy. The product, a locally-administered recombinant monoclonal Fab fragment, is directed against vascular epithelial growth factor A. Interestingly, its full-size counterpart, bevacizumab, which is approved for the treatment of solid tumors, has also demonstrated efficacy in age-related macular degeneration when administered either intravenously or locally, which raises new questions about antibody pharmacology and biodistribution. In order to shed some light on this debate, we recount the early history of serotherapy applied to ophthalmology, review the exact molecular differences between ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and discuss what is known about IgG and the blood-retina barrier, and the possible role of FcRn, an IgG transporter.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4161/mabs.2.2.11205", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011622054", "source": "openalex"}

Access is currently limited by the relatively small number of neuro-ophthalmologists, and consequently, patients may be affected by incorrect or delayed diagnosis. The objective of this study is to analyze referral patterns to neuro-ophthalmologists, characterize rates of misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses in patients ultimately referred, and delineate outcomes after neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 300 new patients seen over 45 randomly chosen days between June 2011 and June 2015 in one tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology clinic. Demographics, distance traveled, time between onset and neuro-ophthalmology consultation (NOC), time between appointment request and NOC, number and types of providers seen before referral, unnecessary tests before referral, referral diagnoses, final diagnoses, and impact of the NOC on outcome were collected. Results: Patients traveled a median of 36.5 miles (interquartile range [IQR]: 20–85). Median time from symptom onset was 210 days (IQR: 70–1,100). Median time from referral to NOC was 34 days (IQR: 7–86), with peaks at one week (urgent requests) and 13 weeks (routine requests). Median number of previous providers seen was 2 (IQR: 2–4; range:0–10), and 102 patients (34%) had seen multiple providers within the same specialty before referral. Patients were most commonly referred for NOC by ophthalmologists (41% of referrals). Eighty-one percent (242/300) of referrals to neuro-ophthalmology were appropriate referrals. Of the 300 patients referred, 247 (82%) were complex or very complex; 119 (40%) were misdiagnosed; 147 (49%) were at least partially misdiagnosed; and 22 (7%) had unknown diagnoses. Women were more likely to be at least partially misdiagnosed—108 of 188 (57%) vs 39 of 112 (35%) of men ( P &lt; 0.001). Mismanagement or delay in care occurred in 85 (28%), unnecessary tests in 56 (19%), unnecessary consultations in 64 (22%), and imaging misinterpretation in 16 (5%). Neuro-ophthalmologists played a major role in directing treatment, such as preserving vision, preventing life-threatening complications, or avoiding harmful treatment in 62 (21%) patients.

The clinical content of primary care consists of the first presentation of disease, the management of minor illness and trauma, the recurrence of disease, the follow up and support of some chronic conditions, and the delivery of preventive health care. Planning for ophthalmic primary care needs to take service requirements of these categories of disease into account. Primary care research is abundant in ophthalmology but needs to be more structured and targeted.

Although there has been a rapid growth of studies on AI in the recent years, real-world adoption of AI is still rare. One reason may be because the data derived from economic evaluations of AI in health care, which policy makers used for adopting new technology, have been fragmented and scarce. Most data on economics of AI in ophthalmology are from diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Few studies classified costs of AI software, which has been considered as a medical device, into direct medical costs. These costs of AI are composed of initial and maintenance costs. The initial costs may include investment in research and development, and costs for validation of different datasets. Meanwhile, the maintenance costs include costs for algorithms upgrade and hardware maintenance in the long run. The cost of AI should be balanced between manufacturing price and reimbursements since it may pose significant challenges and barriers to providers. Evidence from cost-effectiveness analyses showed that AI, either standalone or used with humans, was more cost-effective than manual DR screening.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3022091245", "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Ophthalmology in 2020: A Technology on the Cusp for Translation and Implementation", "text": "With aging populations, health systems worldwide are struggling to provide adequate eye care at the population level, giving rise to projections of increasing levels of visual impairment (VI) and blindness from major eye diseases in the near future.1 The substantial burden of VI has overwhelmed global efforts to expand the physical capacity (eye clinics and hospitals and related facilities) and expert availability of eye care providers (eg, ophthalmologists, optometrists).2 This trend has been observed even in developed nations. Long waiting times to see an ophthalmologist in public hospitals are common in the United States, UK, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. A study in England reported that a delay in care of 22 weeks resulted in harms such as permanent visual acuity deterioration and visual field loss in some patients that could have been avoided with earlier intervention.3 This reflects the urgent public health need for completely novel solutions to improve the accessibility and availability of eye care services at primary, secondary, and tertiary level for the larger population.4 Of the major eye diseases, diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and cataract are major global causes of blindness. DR has alarming projections for prevalence despite established cost-effectiveness and guidelines for population screening.5–7 This is partly due to staggering growth in the burden of diabetes mellitus (DM),8 whereby DR is a common end organ manifestation of DM.9 Similarly, AMD and glaucoma are other leading causes of VI, driven by aging populations.10 Gaps in population-level screening and management of DR, AMD, and glaucoma are well known and have not been adequately tackled using traditional models of care, which have largely focused on provision of tertiary level eye care.11–13 DAWN OF DIGITAL HEALTH AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Technology may provide innovative solutions to address such gaps.14 The successful development of digital health and telemedicine solutions have provided new tools that improve the efficiency and accessibility of existing eye care services.4 Recent reports describe new models of care delivery enabled by technology, such as asynchronous teleophthalmology in England and Singapore.15,16 These enabled more targeted referrals from community-based primary eye care services to specialist ophthalmologists, enhancing right siting of patients.17 Successful use of these technologies in Scotland has been described in the Scottish Eyecare Integration project through electronic image exchange between community providers and clinicians of a centralized referral unit.18 Reported benefits include streamlined referral services, improved patient satisfaction, and generation of real-world data for provider training.19 Similarly, encouraging results have been described of digital ophthalmology services for patients with diabetes attending a specialist endocrinology outpatient clinic in Italy and rural remote eye screening services in suburban and rural Australia, whereby other common causes of blindness such as AMD and glaucoma were also incidentally detected early.20,21 Over in India, teleophthalmology has also been used to enhance access to eye screening and remote specialist review in rural settings using synchronous22 or mixed synchronous-asynchronous solutions,23 whereby the latter uses a mix of store-and-forward and/or video consultation.4 However, although these digital ophthalmology solutions have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, their scalability is constrained by the need for additional infrastructure and manpower to operationalize them.4 The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in ophthalmology promise to extend and expand the use of digital ophthalmology, providing the potential to improve the accessibility, availability, and productivity of existing resources and overall efficiency of eye care services.24 Telemedicine and AI are not constrained by the \"where\" (need for specialized eye hospitals) or who (availability of expert eye care manpower). Therefore, these solutions can be paired with other technology (eg, imaging devices) to quickly decentralize and scale-up eye screening and primary care services.24 Where relevant resources are available, this presents a timely solution as procurement cycles and the time required to train operators of these solutions are significantly less than that required to train ophthalmologists. Eye screening is well-suited for the application of AI due to well-understood relationships between clinical features and disease severity in the major eye diseases such as glaucoma25 and DR,26 and ready availability of imaging to effectively capture these features.27 IS AI IN OPHTHALMOLOGY RESEARCH READY FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION AND IMPLEMENTATION? AI is a technology that was first described >50 years ago. In the past 5 to 10 years, with improving computing power and large datasets, deep learning (DL), a new branch of AI, has been developed. Research using newer AI techniques, including DL, has shown robust results that has surpassed human performance in many areas of medicine and healthcare. AI has possibly reached a \"tipping point\" in technology readiness level for translation to real-world application.24 Applications of AI in ophthalmology began with traditional feature-based machine learning (ML) techniques as described by Ruamviboonsuk et al45 in their article about the evolution of AI solutions for eye screening in this issue. Those ML techniques required expert ophthalmologists to label individual clinical features and severity in images to develop the AI solutions, sometimes referred to as \"supervised learning.\"28 These labeled images were used to train AI algorithms to classify the images based on identification of those feature labels. DL is a new AI technique that is trained in a manner that bypasses the need for feature labeling by experts, sometimes referred to as \"unsupervised learning.\" DL instead involves using entire images labeled with clinical diagnosis (or severity) by experts, so the AI \"self-learns\" the predictive features for classification of diagnosis or severity, with better than traditionally accepted error rates. Recent reports demonstrated improved classification of ophthalmic imaging using DL compared with ML techniques,29 with the same in head-to-head comparisons.30 Recent research has demonstrated clinically acceptable performance of these DL algorithms in classifying ophthalmic imaging data such as color fundus photography (CFP) for various eye diseases such as DR.29 Other successful applications include that for classifying optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans.31 By providing granular 3-dimensional information as opposed to 2-dimensional information from CFPs, the incorporation of OCT imaging may improve the performance of existing CFP-based screening tools. For the major eye diseases of DR, AMD, and glaucoma, fortunately, retinal features that correspond to clinical outcomes and severity have been described,25,32 enabling the training of DL to classify ophthalmic imaging.33,34 DL systems have been developed for classifying DR in CFPs35–37 and OCT images,38 which have been summarized along with other applications in a recent review.29 Furthermore, DL systems that classify AMD in CFPs33,39,40 predict AMD progression using OCTs,41 and classify glaucoma in ophthalmic imaging have also been described,42,43 with some demonstrated in real-world datasets from screening settings such as teleophthalmology and glaucoma clinics.44 Other new DL studies and initiatives in Asia have also been described in the article on the evolution of AI-based solutions for eye screening contributed by Ruamviboonsuk et al45 in this issue. The authors suggest methods to reduce the cost of digital ophthalmology and/or AI-based ophthalmology services, such as the training of human graders to augment the digital services and reduce the need for specialist-trained ophthalmologists to support the services, freeing up ophthalmologists for more follow-up of patients requiring further assessment or interventional services. Independent researchers in Singapore and Korea have even applied a single deep learning system to simultaneously detect multiple referable eye diseases such as glaucoma, AMD and DR with high accuracy.36,46 In another completely different area of cataract detection and management, Goh et al47 discussed techniques for emerging applications of AI related to cataract, a relatively underexplored area in ophthalmology. These range from automating the selection of intraocular lenses during preoperative planning for cataract surgery, to detecting cataract in ophthalmic imaging such as CFP or slit lamp photography. HOW CAN AI MAKE AN IMPACT IN OPHTHALMOLOGY DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING? Despite these research reports of excellent DL performance in clinical validation studies, few studies have evaluated suitable forms for its real-world implementation. This can either take on a \"fully-automated\" or \"semi-automated\" model (Fig. 1). The \"fully-automated model\" would function with no human provider involvement, whereby the AI system initiates referrals to ophthalmologists where necessary or flags patients as suitable for continued community-based monitoring. In contrast, a \"semi-automated model\" can take on various forms of human grader or ophthalmologist involvement to augment classification by the DL as a tool for triage of patients.FIGURE 1: Potential applications of a DL solution for DR screening. Illustration of the application of a DL solution for DR screening using imaging, comparing existing clinical practice with a fully automated AI model (replacement) and a semiautomated AI model (triage). AI indicates artificial intelligence; DL, deep learning; DR, diabetic retinopathy.A clear example of where an AI-based DL technology can potentially \"fill\" a growing gap is in DR screening. The increasing burden of DR has outpaced the long process of training eye care professionals, causing an expanding rift between health system capacity in screening and clinical demand.48 The traditional model for DR screening, and 2 possible models of AI-based tools for automated classification of DR are shown in Figure 1. Ideally, in some situations, AI based-DL algorithms can be implemented using a \"fully-automated model\" (as a replacement test), whereby classification is independently conducted by the AI with triage and referrals to ophthalmologists where required (Fig. 1). Alternatively, AI based-DL algorithms can be implemented in a \"semi-automated model,\" whereby a human assessor (doctors/optometrists/readers) mediates classification of imaging data that the AI labels as abnormal. Xie et al have described the cost-effectiveness of one such semiautomated model developed in Singapore whereby the AI is used to triage CFPs and those flagged as abnormal are reviewed by human graders using teleophthalmology.49 Apart from determining the ideal form of implementation, there are several other practical, technical, and sociocultural challenges that have yet to be addressed. These will be explored in detail in the following section. WHAT ARE CURRENT CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTATION OF AI IN CLINICAL PRACTICE? Practical Challenges The first major challenge in the implementation of validated AI solutions is the need for a whole solution suitable for practical application. This may require a combination of DL systems with clinically acceptable performance and interoperability of the solution to receive images of varying quality from commonly used devices. Supporting clinical guidelines for the clinical communication of DL systems classification to patients and for patient selection also need to be developed. Grassmann et al have previously illustrated the importance of appropriate patient selection in their report of misclassifications by a DL system that arose due to macular reflex in younger patients in their validation dataset, when the young were not represented in the DL systems training dataset.33 Furthermore, most existing DL systems have only been validated for independent classification of a single eye disease at a time. A need to maintain and switch between multiple DL systems for each possible eye disease is not practically feasible for providers without technical AI or software expertise. Fortunately, researchers are developing solutions for these challenges, such as Ting et al and Son et al who have demonstrated accuracy of a single DL systems to classify multiple referable eye diseases such as DR, glaucoma, and AMD.36,46 Other challenges common to any new technology also need to be addressed. For instance, as with any screening test, supporting systems and processes are needed to address misclassified patients such as false-positives or negatives. This relates to the need for standardized practices in the development, validation, reporting, and implementation of AI to avoid misclassification when applied to fundamentally different target populations.33 Finally, the ethical and legal challenges in applying DL systems for classification of clinical data given that it is not explainable also need to be addressed. In the event of a misclassification, does the liability lie with the clinician or the AI technology provider? Many questions like these have yet to be addressed and will contribute to resistance to adoption. Technical Challenges First, the need for suitable training data and external validation is a major technical challenge that needs to be addressed to facilitate generalizability and translation of these solutions. This has been further elaborated on by Goh et al47 in their article contributed to this issue. This also begets the next challenge—the laborious labeling of input data for the training process, requiring the involvement of expert practitioners that make human errors. Coupled with the need for careful patient selection, the repeated need for labeling imaging datasets for calibrating a DL system for each new population may delay adoption and contribute to set-up costs.50 However, emerging research has demonstrated that DL algorithms could be trained to automate the labeling of training data using data from a detailed 3-dimensional scan such as the OCT, to train a new DL algorithm to classify a different type of scan such as 2-dimensional CFPs.51 This could address the human limitations and help scale up the calibration process for improved performance when a DL system is applied to new target populations. Furthermore, the \"black box\" nature of AI and lack of explainability of DL techniques is another major technical challenge that needs to be addressed. Progress in the development of explainable AI for image classification includes emerging techniques such as \"soft attention,\"52 occlusion testing, and saliency maps to identify the pixels in images that drive the DL systems' classification.53 New methods such as \"weighted error scoring\" are also being developed to help evaluate the impact of wrong automated classification decisions against grading by humans.54 However, these methods still require the development of expert consensus, standards, and guidelines on evaluating the performance of any DL systems for implementation in eye care services. Sociocultural Challenges There are sociocultural challenges globally in the adoption of AI technology in clinical practice. Asia is a good example. Asia is a vast continent with heterogeneous population biology and culture, along with unique differences in health spending and consumption patterns.55 Although national Asian health systems are rapidly developing with pockets of communities that have comparable resources and health systems to the west, resource-limited settings encompass a significant majority. These communities remain disadvantaged by considerable geographical variation in infrastructure availability, health care accessibility and population income inequality.56 These major social determinants of health would impact the effectiveness and adoption of any new health technology intervention.14 These present unique challenges in the implementation of disruptive solutions for AI-based eye screening programs, given that the needs of both high and low demand users need to be addressed for successful deployment of a disruptive population screening tool. First, a lack of infrastructure is a major challenge for implementing digital solutions in some regions due to large areas without reliable access to electricity and/or internet. Therefore, portable solutions with rechargeable power supply may be needed to facilitate mobile screening programs. Open-source geolocation tagging would help in the co-ordination of resources for follow-up initiatives by government or philanthropic organizations, such as cataract surgery outreach camps. Gaps in internet coverage necessitate the development of AI-solutions localized within screening hardware to provide real-time results effectively offline that be conveyed to patients at the point-of-care, enabling de-centralized care.57 The alternative would be \"store-and-forward\" device configurations that collect geotagged data during mobile screening and subsequently upload data to a cloud-based server for analysis once docked in a centralized terminal or connected to the internet. However, the latter would require new systems to centralize care co-ordination and communicate results to patients, unlike local solutions that deliver insights at the point of care—which can be more easily overlaid to clinical microsystems. Furthermore, specialists generally practice in tertiary hospitals with massive geographical catchment areas of referrals from primary eye care providers. Therefore, asynchronous teleophthalmology platforms may be an essential feature to ensure appropriate referrals of patients triaged to tertiary care.4 This will reduce false-positives and unnecessary travel that can amount to days between rural settlements and the nearest tertiary care provider. The major considerations for AI-based screening programs for resource-limited settings are summarized diagrammatically in Figure 2.FIGURE 2: Developing a model for implementation of AI-based eye screening in resource-limited settings. Illustrates considerations for a whole solution designed for AI-based population eye screening in resource-limited settings including AI-algorithms that are either (A) Localized within screening tools (top left) or (B) cloud-based with \"store-and-forward\" configuration (bottom left); (C) asynchronous teleconsultation systems for low cost review of referrals by tertiary providers (bottom right); (D) Cybersecurity to protect the various forms of patient data in storage or transit (top right); all of which are built around (E) mobile solutions with geolocation tagging to facilitate co-ordination over vast geographical catchment areas (center). AI indicates artificial intelligence.CONCLUSIONS Given all these significant challenges, it may be tempting to dismiss AI as a \"passing fad\" and difficult to see how AI is a \"near-enough reality\" with whole solutions for clinical implementation. However, AI and DL capabilities are rapidly improving with new potential solutions for technical challenges emerging all the time, some of which have been outlined above. Furthermore, research of AI in ophthalmology has transitioned from the development and validation of these tools towards the implementation. This is a key step required to scope out the potential practical and sociocultural challenges to develop targeted solutions based on the needs of users: patients and providers. Although it may not be \"months away,\" AI solutions in ophthalmology is likely a reality in this new decade. In conclusion, in narrow, well defined areas, AI has shown tremendous promise in expanding health systems' capacity of eye screening. For one, this can be achieved by automating the classification of DR and other eye diseases in multiple clinical applications, highlighted by Ruamviboonsuk et al45, and in management of certain diseases like cataract as suggested by Goh et al47. Naturally, as the technology progresses from clinical validation to translation with increasing technology readiness level, new challenges in integration of AI solutions in clinical care pathways and health care systems will emerge. Potential targeted solutions are already being investigated and reported for many of the challenges outlined. Low-cost, simpler digital solutions, such as smart phone-based systems in resource-limited settings,58 may add to the ease of AI implementation. All factors considered, AI seems to be primed and ready for translation and implementation to revolutionize eye care beyond 2020.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.apo.0000656984.56467.2c", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3022091245", "source": "openalex"}

The higher the percentage of total burn, the later the referral was made. Of those with severe eyelid burns, 100% had eyelid surgery and 50% of moderate burns had eyelid surgery. Sixty percent of moderate eyelid burns that required surgery did not receive prophylaxis. Thirty-four of 66 patients had acute corneal involvement, but only 3 eyes of 118 had long-term corneal morbidity.The requirement for eyelid surgery was closely related to the severity of the eyelid burn. The presence of an acute corneal burn with epithelial loss was not a poor prognosticator. The use of prophylactic ocular surface lubrication may provide early corneal protection, thereby minimizing ulceration in patients who may otherwise have required surgery, especially in those with mild to moderate exposure. Prompt ophthalmologic examination and the early use of prophylactic ocular surface lubrication for the cornea are associated with less need for eyelid surgery in patients with moderate eyelid burns.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00002341-200205000-00008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998037643", "source": "openalex"}

Submissions to Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology were analysed over a 12‐month period with the aim of identifying common reasons for editorial rejection of manuscripts. Methods: A content analysis was carried out of reviewer and section editor comments of all rejected manuscripts (original papers) submitted to Clinical 0mp; Experimental Ophthalmology between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008. Comments were categorized by reasons for rejection. Results: A total of 662 manuscripts were submitted to Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology via ScholarOne Manuscripts from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008 with a final decision date of up to 1 April 2009. The overall rejection rate for these manuscripts was 73.6%. The most common reason for rejection of manuscripts was ‘does not add to current literature’, followed by ‘poor methodology’, ‘problematic control groups’, ‘poor English and grammar/poorly organized’, ‘needs further work/clarification’ and ‘simultaneous submission to another journal/plagiarized’; the remainder had either no readily categorized reason stated or were grouped into an ‘other’ category. Discussion: Understanding why original research work is rejected can be invaluable to an author's publishing career. The categories that emerged from this content analysis are reflected in other literature on the topic, therefore the flaws in manuscripts rejected by Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology appear to be both common and avoidable. Armed with this knowledge an author may strive towards a more ‘rejection‐proof’ manuscript when submitting to ophthalmology and visual science journals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9071.2009.02190.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059582587", "source": "openalex"}

MMPC is a dimethacrylate with phosphorylcholine‐analogous linkage. Previous reports clarified that the affinity of MMPC to MPC enables the water contents and mechanical properties of the poly(MPC) hydrogels to be varied without disturbing the bulk phases. In this study, we examined the protein adsorption resistance, water wettability, oxygen permeability, and electrolyte permeability of the mechanically enhanced poly(MPC) hydrogel crosslinked with MMPC. The amount of protein adsorbed on this hydrogel was 0.9 μg/cm 2 , which accounted for 30% of Omafilcon A and 3% of Etafilcon A. Water contact angle experiments revealed the high wettability of the poly(MPC) hydrogels. The oxygen permeability and NaCl diffusion constant of the poly(MPC) hydrogels were 64 barrer and 48 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s, respectively. This high permeability resulted from the high water content, similar to the case of the human cornea. These results suggested that poly(MPC) hydrogels have good potential for use in ophthalmologic biomaterials. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Eye care professionals are therefore skeptical about the benefits of smartphone Apps and are reluctant to adopt it in their day to day practice. The purpose of this study was to provide an updated overview of all Apps exclusive to ophthalmology. Methods: This study was a quantitative analysis of Smartphone Apps exclusively designed for ophthalmic care. The Apple iPhone and Google play store were searched for eye care themed Apps. Any App related to eye treatment and management such as visual acuity screening, eye education, calculators, eBooks, Low Vision Aids were included in the study. Data on the purpose of the Apps, target end-users, validation, App usage, user ratings, and App developer qualifications were documented. Results: As of March 2020, a total of 131 Apps exclusively dedicated for eye care were identified. 53% (69/131) were available in iPhones, 44% (58/131) in Android smartphones, and 3% in both. 32% (41/131) Apps were designed for visual acuity (VA) screening, 13% (17/131) for eye relaxation exercises, 12% (15/131) for professional education, and the remaining for Apps detecting color blindness, low vision aids, and assistance and patient education. Among the 131 Apps, 6 (4.5%) Apps are claimed by the developers as validated. Conclusion: This study unveils a wide range of smartphone Apps exclusive to ophthalmology and suggests guidelines to choose an appropriate App. The study also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in the design, development, and validation of such Apps.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1480_20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3129460582", "source": "openalex"}

The concept of employing liposomes as drug carriers in ophthalmology is more recent. A major advantage of employing liposomes in the eye is their ability to evade initially the mononuclear phagocytes that make the intravenous use of liposomes so challenging. Recent work suggests that there are several applications in which use of liposome-entrapped drugs may prove superior to other methods for the diagnosis and treatment of ocular disease. One promising strategy that bears further investigation is ligand-mediated targeting of liposome-entrapped drugs. In order for these types of vesicles to become commercially available, they will have to be proven to be more effective than other targeted drug delivery modalities. In the final analysis, a more complete understanding of the biological changes that occur in various pathological conditions in the eye is needed in order to design the most effective drug carriers for use in ophthalmology.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2412269565", "source": "openalex"}

The oculomotor system is sensitive to brain trauma; however, neuro-ophthalmologic response to subconcussive head impacts remains unclear. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine whether subconcussive head impacts cause impairments in neuro-ophthalmologic function as measured by the King-Devick test (KDT) and oculomotor function as measured by the near point of convergence. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> In this randomized clinical trial, adult soccer players were randomized into either a heading group or kicking (control) group. The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph. The kicking-control group followed the same protocol but with 10 kicks. Peak linear and rotational head accelerations were assessed with a triaxial accelerometer. The KDT speed and error and near point of convergence were assessed at baseline (preheading or prekicking) and at 0, 2, and 24 hours after heading or kicking. <h3>Exposures</h3> Ten soccer-ball headings or kicks. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was the group-by-time interaction of KDT speed at 0 hours after heading or kicking. The secondary outcomes included KDT speed at 2 hours and 24 hours after heading or kicking, KDT error, and near point of convergence. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 78 individuals enrolled (heading group, n = 40; kicking-control group, n = 38). Eleven individuals (heading group: 4 women; mean [SD] age, 22.5 [1.0] years; kicking-control group, 3 women and 4 men; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [1.1] years) voluntarily withdrew from the study. Data from 67 participants with a mean (SD) age of 20.6 (1.7) years were eligible for analysis (heading, n = 36; kicking-control, n = 31). Mean (SD) peak linear accelerations and peak rotational accelerations per impact for the heading group were 33.2 (6.8)<i>g</i>and 3.6 (1.4) krad/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Conversely, soccer kicking did not induce a detectable level of head acceleration. Both groups showed improvements in KDT speed (heading group: 0 hours, −1.2 [95% CI, −2.2 to −0.1] seconds;<i>P</i> = .03; 2 hours, −1.3 [95% CI, −2.6 to 0] seconds;<i>P</i> = .05; 24 hours, −3.2 [95% CI, −4.3 to −2.2] seconds;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; kicking-control group: 0 hours, −3.3 [95% CI, −4.1 to −2.5] seconds;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; 2 hours, −4.1 [95% CI, −5.1 to −3.1] seconds;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; 24 hours, −5.2 [95% CI, −6.2 to −4.2] seconds;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Group differences occurred at all postintervention points; the kicking-control group performed KDT faster at 0 hours (−2.2 [95% CI, −0.8 to −3.5] seconds;<i>P</i> = .001), 2 hours (−2.8 [95% CI, −1.2 to −4.4] seconds;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and 24 hours after the intervention (−2.0 [95% CI, −0.5 to −3.4] seconds;<i>P</i> = .007) compared with those of the heading group. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> These data support the hypothesis that neuro-ophthalmologic function is affected, at least in the short term, by subconcussive head impacts that may affect some individuals in some contact sports. Further studies may help determine if these measures can be a useful clinical tool in detecting acute subconcussive injury. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT03488381", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.6128", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3006276017", "source": "openalex"}

Now it is used routinely in retrobulbar, peribulbar, and sub-Tenon’s blocks. Until recently, the only sources of hyaluronidase were animal derived, either pharmaceutically manu-factured or compounded. Animal-derived products have been associated with low pu-rity, variable potency, and uncertain safety. Given these concerns, use of recombinant human hyaluronidase merits consideration to help improve the safety and quality of local anesthetic blocks. In order for practitioners to make informed therapeutic decisions re-garding the use of hyaluronidase in ophthal-mology, the safety and efficacy of available products must first be evaluated.DesignWe analyzed multiple clinical samples from national and regional compounding pharma-cies for purity and potency, and compared them to recombinant human hyaluronidase. In addition, a literature search, including the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA AERS) database, was performed to further evaluate adverse event and safety data. ResultsThe laboratory analyses demonstrated that animal-derived hyaluronidase, specifically compounded products, has variable purity and potency, whereas recombinant hu-man hyaluronidase possesses high purity and consistency. The literature supported routine inclusion of hyaluronidase in an-esthetic blocks to help reduce the potential for complications. Although compounded animal-derived preparations have been used extensively, their varying levels of impuri-ties and their potential for allergic reactions may create unnecessary risk.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2183125506", "source": "openalex"}

Data are discussed indicating that melatonin, being an efficient antioxidant that displays antinitridergic properties, has a promising role in the treatment of these ocular dysfunctions. Melatonin synthesis occurs in the eye of most species, and melatonin receptors are localized in different ocular structures. In view of the fact that melatonin lacks significant adverse collateral effects even at high doses, the application of melatonin could potentially protect ocular tissues by effectively scavenging free radicals and excessive amounts of NO generated in the glaucomatous or uveitic eye.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-079x.2010.00764.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160535952", "source": "openalex"}

Two patients developed subtle and suggestive OCT changes in the parafoveal ellipsoid zone after 11 and 17 months, and definitive toxicity after 15 and 25 months. None of the others showed damage. Thus, evidence to date indicates that extreme doses do accelerate retinal toxicity, but with a probable time course of many months rather than days. As this is being written other reports are coming out that may alter the landscape of CQ and HCQ usage, and more will show up by the time this is published. For example, a pre-publication just appeared on a small French trial of 22 COVID-19 positive patients using 600 mg/day of HCQ for 10 days to reduce the viral load.10Gautret P. Lagier J.-C. Parola P.

This dose is only about 2 times AAO recommended levels on average and should have no risk of retinopathy in this time frame. News media are now also citing interest in using CQ or HCQ intermittently as prophylaxis, much like the use for malaria, although doses have not been mentioned. Ophthalmologists should judge all of this evolving information in light of well-established knowledge about dose/weight and duration as the primary determinants of retinopathy risk.11Melles R.G.

Short-term trials (under 2 weeks) will have negligible risk even with doses 5-6 times the usual 5 mg/kg/day maximum recommendation. Usage for a few months will still have very low risk with doses under 3-4 times the usual level. However, if physicians suggest using these drugs for a year or more, I would strongly advise staying within the AAO recommendation, and screening annually. Bottom line: I do not believe ophthalmic screening is necessary for COVID-19 patients who take CQ or HCQ for less than 2 weeks as anti-viral therapy, since the likelihood of retinal damage is exceedingly low even with high doses. In a time of pandemic with world-wide shortages of medical personnel, funds, hospital beds, equipment, screening tests, and proven therapy, it would be counter-productive (and raise inappropriate fears) to suggest the addition of labor-intensive and expensive eye exams that are of low yield.

All of them had visual acuity measurement, oculomotor examination, fundoscopy and, whenever possible, visual field testing.Visual signs were present at diagnosis in 96% of patients in our series, but were the circumstances of diagnosis of craniopharyngioma in only 34.5%. Loss of visual acuity was present at diagnosis in 15 patients (51.7%), strabismus in eight (27.6%), papilloedema in ten (34.4%), and optic nerve atrophy in 11 patients (37.9%). A visual field defect was present at diagnosis in all 18 children who were able to perform an instrumental visual field and in three of the children who were tested by attraction visual field.In children, ophthalmological signs are not the main circumstance of diagnosis of craniopharyngioma because children do not complain of a mild or unilateral reduction in visual acuity. The central visual field is more often affected than the peripheral visual field; computerized static automated perimetry, which allows precise study of the central visual field, is difficult to perform in children. Because of the infiltrating nature of craniopharyngiomas, visual field defects are sometimes atypical and do not indicate a chiasmal problem.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W112361543", "source": "openalex"}

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) applications for preventing vision loss in eye illnesses have developed quickly. Artificial intelligence uses computer programs to execute various activities while mimicking human thought. Machine learning techniques are frequently utilized in the field of ophthalmology. Ophthalmology holds great promise for advancing artificial intelligence, thanks to various digital methods like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field testing. Artificial intelligence has been used in ophthalmology to treat eye conditions impairing vision, including macular holes (M.H.), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts. The more common occurrence of these diseases has led to artificial intelligence development. It is important to get annual screenings to detect eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These conditions can cause decreased visual acuity, and it is necessary to identify any changes or progression in the disease to receive appropriate treatment. Numerous studies have been conducted based on artificial intelligence using different algorithms to improve and simplify current medical practice and for early detection of eye diseases to prevent vision loss.

AI and deep learning (DL) find obvious applications in fields like ophthalmology wherein huge amount of image-based data need to be analyzed; however, the outcomes related to image recognition are reasonably well-defined. AI and DL have found important roles in ophthalmology in early screening and detection of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), glaucoma, and other ocular disorders, being successful inroads as far as early screening and diagnosis are concerned and appear promising with advantages of high-screening accuracy, consistency, and scalability. AI algorithms need equally skilled manpower, trained optometrists/ophthalmologists (annotators) to provide accurate ground truth for training the images. The basis of diagnoses made by AI algorithms is mechanical, and some amount of human intervention is necessary for further interpretations.

A less frequent anomalous neurologic complication is tearing when eating (paradoxical gustolacrimal tearing or \"crocodile tears\") or lack of emotional tearing. The involvement of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves, often seen together in the thalidomide-affected individual, is also characteristic of Möbius syndrome/sequence.

In the past few years, however, progress in genetic engineering has led to a rapidly growing number of transgenic animals, mostly mice, carrying constructs that lead to disruption or overexpression of candidate genes for retinal degenerations. On the one hand, these new models constitute a powerful and adaptable tool to investigate the role of specific gene mutations and the resulting cellular defects that finally lead to photoreceptor cell death. On the other hand, they extend the spectrum of animal models suitable for the newly arisen field of retinal somatic gene therapy. To assist researchers and clinicians interested in the field, this article attempts to provide a structured overview on recently developed transgenic animal models as well as on models based on spontaneous mutations and induced degenerations. In this review the authors focus on animal models for photoreceptor degeneration since the rapidly growing field of models for ganglion cell death merits its own review and would be beyond the scope of this article. Even with this restriction, the abundance of information generated especially in the past few years makes the attempt of a complete overview almost illusory. Therefore, we apologise for omissions or shortfalls extant in this review. Furthermore, we want to point out that some of the model systems described have already been used extensively. We will therefore occasionally not cite original publications but rather reviews dealing with the specific model system. Finally, we did not incorporate strategies using viral vectors and/or pharmacological substances.

It raises the questions of whether the current laws regarding helmet use are satisfactory, and whether helmets currently used are of an adequate standard.The records over a 20-year period of one neuro-ophthalmologist in Adelaide were reviewed producing 22 patients with neuro-ophthalmological sequelae of head injuries as a result of horse-related accidents.There were 22 patients (16 female, six male), one of whom was involved in three separate accidents, Of these, seven were professional riders and 15 amateur. In 20 of the 24 accidents, patients were either thrown or fell from the horse. Helmets were worn in 15 of the accidents. All the patients had closed head injuries of varying severity. The most common neuro-ophthalmological complication found was a fourth-nerve palsy in 11 patients. Five patients had a significant loss of vision and two of these were severe enough to warrant a blind pension.Horse riding and working around horses constitute an occupation or recreation with inherent dangers. Previous studies have shown that wearing of protective headgear reduces the risk and severity of head injuries, and helmet use should be vigorously promoted. The current laws and practices regarding helmet use are not uniform and seem to be inadequate. The current standard for equestrian safety helmets (AS/NZS 3838:1998) embodies improvements on earlier helmet standards and certainly increases the rider's chances of surviving a severe impact. Nevertheless, serious brain injuries have occurred in wearers of approved helmets, and further research is desirable to ensure the optimum degree of protection compatible with rider acceptance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-9071.2001.00430.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133621268", "source": "openalex"}

We notice in these cases that improvement occurs in the central acuity, and no improvement in the visual field, color-vision and nightblindness. Apparently acupuncture acts on the macula alone and not on the entire retina. Acupuncture is not intended to substitute for established medication or surgery in ophthalmology. It cannot restore a tissue or organ damaged beyond regeneration, \"incurable\" eye diseases per se are not cured by acupuncture.

Poor visual response, poor pupillary response, and retinal hemorrhage correlated strongly with demise of the child. One child who died had pigmented retinal scars from previous abuse, a condition not previously observed histopathologically. The clinical and autopsy findings varied somewhat, probably because of the differing conditions for examination. No correlation could be made between computerized tomography scans done during life and the subdural hemorrhage of the optic nerve found on autopsy. Half of the surviving patients were known to have good vision. One fourth of the patients had poor vision, largely due to cerebral visual impairment from bilateral injury posterior to the optic chiasm. Severe neurologic impairment correlated highly with loss of vision.This series provides information on the frequency of eye findings in SBS patients. No fundus finding is pathognomonic for SBS. When retinal hemorrhages are found in young children, the likelihood that abuse occurred is very high.

Three of 114 subjects (2.6%) developed documented (n = 2) or possible (1) serious eye complications. One subject developed evidence of ischemic retinopathy (cotton-wool spots) by week 24, 1 developed uveitis by week 48, and 1 reported at week 48 transient (<4 hours) monocular blindness that had occurred at week 36 with a subsequent normal examination at week 48.Ophthalmologic complications are infrequent in children who are treated with pegylated interferon-alpha2a for HCV (2%-3%). Because of the potential severity of ischemic retinopathy and uveitis, prospective ocular assessment should remain part of the monitoring strategy for children who are treated with interferon for HCV.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0b013e3181b99cf0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998494653", "source": "openalex"}

The visual pathway is prone to derangements in patients with craniosynostosis, particularly in syndromic cases, and there is a risk for permanent vision loss when ocular disease complications are not identified and properly treated early in life. Extensive advancements have been made in our understanding of the etiologies underlying vision loss in craniosynostosis over the last 20 years. Children with craniosynostosis are susceptible to interruptions in visual input arising from strabismus, refractive errors, and corneal damage; any of these aberrations can result in understimulation of the visual cortex during childhood neurodevelopment and permanent amblyopia. Elevated intracranial pressure resulting from abnormal cranial shape or volume can lead to papilledema and, ultimately, optic atrophy and vision loss. A pediatric ophthalmologist is a crucial component of the multidisciplinary care team that should be involved in the care of craniosynostosis patients and consistent ophthalmologic follow-up can help minimize the risk to vision posed by such entities as papilledema and amblyopia. This article aims to review the current understanding of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in craniosynostosis and explore diagnostic and management considerations for the ophthalmologist taking care of these patients.

This survey aims to assess medical workers’ and other professional technicians’ familiarity with, attitudes toward, and concerns about AI in ophthalmology. Methods This is a cross-sectional study design study. An electronic questionnaire was designed through the app Questionnaire Star, and was sent to respondents through WeChat, China’s version of Facebook or WhatsApp. The participation was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire consisted of four parts, namely the respondents’ background, their basic understanding of AI, their attitudes toward AI, and their concerns about AI. A total of 562 respondents were counted, with 562 valid questionnaires returned. The results of the questionnaires are displayed in an Excel 2003 form. Results There were 291 medical workers and 271 other professional technicians completed the questionnaire. About 1/3 of the respondents understood AI and ophthalmic AI. The percentages of people who understood ophthalmic AI among medical workers and other professional technicians were about 42.6 % and 15.6 %, respectively. About 66.0 % of the respondents thought that AI in ophthalmology would partly replace doctors, about 59.07 % having a relatively high acceptance level of ophthalmic AI. Meanwhile, among those with AI in ophthalmology application experiences (30.6 %), above 70 % of respondents held a full acceptance attitude toward AI in ophthalmology. The respondents expressed medical ethics concerns about AI in ophthalmology. And among the respondents who understood AI in ophthalmology, almost all the people said that there was a need to increase the study of medical ethics issues in the ophthalmic AI field. Conclusions The survey results revealed that the medical workers had a higher understanding level of AI in ophthalmology than other professional technicians, making it necessary to popularize ophthalmic AI education among other professional technicians. Most of the respondents did not have any experience in ophthalmic AI but generally had a relatively high acceptance level of AI in ophthalmology, and there was a need to strengthen research into medical ethics issues.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07044-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127549795", "source": "openalex"}

A total of 31% of patients used drugs recommended by a pharmacist; 25% used drugs of their own choosing and 24% followed suggestions from a friend or family member. Only 12% of patients knew the drug's components and only 3% were aware of any possible side effects. There was no difference in behavior patterns related to educational level or age, however, there was a significant difference related to gender, with males misusing ophthalmic drops more frequently than women (P = 0.004).Patients commonly attempt to treat conditions that require ophthalmologic care by self-medicating with over-the-counter eye drops.

One such example is ulcerative keratitis, which is very frequent in horses. Because some of these corneal ulcers can be very severe, progress rapidly and, therefore, can be a possible cause of vision loss, it is important to diagnose them at an early stage and administer an appropriate treatment, which can be medical, surgical, or a combination of both. The therapeutic strategy should eradicate the infection in order to reduce or stop destruction of the cornea. In addition, it should support the corneal structures and control the uveal reaction, and the pain associated with it, in order to minimize scarring. In this study, we address how stem cells derived from peripheral blood can be used also in ophthalmological pathologies. Our results demonstrate that this treatment protocol improved eye disease in four horse cases, including corneal ulcers and one case of retinal detachment. In all cases, we detected a decrease in the intense inflammatory reaction as well as the restoration of the epithelial surface of the central cornea. J. Cell.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:Data from all amniotic membrane transplantations from January 2001 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Data was accessed from the electronic database and the annual reports of the Eye Bank at the University Eye Hospital Tübingen. RESULTS:A total of 771 amniotic membrane transplantations were performed between 2001 and 2016 at the University Eye Hospital Tübingen. The mean number of amniotic membrane transplantations was 48 per year (range: 7–81). Overall, the mean number of amniotic membrane transplantations more than doubled, from 31 amniotic membrane transplantations per year during the first 8-year period to 66 amniotic membrane transplantations per year during the second 8-year period (p<0.0001). The most common surgical indications for amniotic membrane transplantation were corneal ulcers and persistent corneal epithelial defects. The inlay, overlay, and sandwich technique became the favored surgical methods for various disorders of the ocular surface. CONCLUSIONS:Our study showed a significant increase of amniotic membrane transplantations from 2001 to 2016. This increase is likely influenced by the introduction of different surgical amniotic membrane transplantation techniques, the rising knowledge about containing growth factors, neurotrophins and cytokines, and the demographic change with aging of the population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.12659/aot.906856", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2793436090", "source": "openalex"}

The most specific ocular manifestations of Fabry disease are conjunctival vascular abnormalities, corneal opacities (cornea verticillata), lens opacities and retinal vascular abnormalities. These do not usually cause significant visual impairment or other ocular symptoms, but can nevertheless be important because they can act as markers of the disease, with diagnostic and prognostic implications. Being an external organ and easily investigated with minimally invasive technologies, the eye may be useful for monitoring the natural history of Fabry disease and the response to enzyme replacement therapy. FOS – the Fabry Outcome Survey –provides comprehensive data on the ocular manifestations of Fabry disease. As of March 2005, 173 of the 688 patients enrolled in FOS have undergone a detailed ophthalmological examination. Cornea verticillata was the most frequently reported ophthalmic abnormality in both hemizygous males and heterozygous females, and may represent a useful diagnostic marker. Tortuous vessels and Fabry cataracts were more frequent in males than in females.

The author is a well recognized authority in the field of radiology, who has made many contributions to our knowledge of neuroradiology and radiologic diseases of the head and neck. In this volume he has collected material which usually extends outside the classic boundaries of neuroradiology. The textbook has been needed and will remain unchallenged for some time. It is up to date in references and also includes the pertinent references of the past. Each of the ten chapters listed in the Table of Contents is furnished with an adequate number of excellent quality x-ray reproductions accompanied by clear legends. The radiologist who is responsible for the radiographic evaluation of the head and neck should be well acquainted with the neuro-ophthalmologic problems; pneumoencephalography and angiography must be supplemented by tomography, orbitography, and venography. The book may be divided into three parts—problems of the optic orbit and of the parasellar and paranasal regions. These problems, of course, are common to the ophthalmologist, the neurosurgeon, and the otorhinologist. A complete radiologic approach is needed in these select areas where too often mistakes have occurred when too great a reliance was placed upon clinical acumen and judgment.

We considered in detail the neuro-ophthalmological features of the 53 cases whose neuroimaging alterations were described with an assigned radiological pattern of the disease (parenchymal: 14 cases, non-parechymal: 35 cases, and mixed: 4 cases). In 19/53 patients (36%), neuro-ophthalmological symptoms anticipated any pathognomonic sign for a BD diagnosis, or only occasional aphtae were recalled by the patients. Family history was positive in 17% of subjects. Headache was reported in 75% of the patients; in those presenting with cerebral vascular involvement, headache was combined to other symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Papilledema was the most frequently reported ophthalmological finding, followed by posterior uveitis. Treatment consisted of systemic steroids in 93% of patients, often combined with other immunosuppressive drugs (especially colchicine and azathioprine). Clinical recovery or improvement was documented in the large majority of patients. Nine subjects had definitive alterations, and one died. Based on our review and personal experience, a delayed diagnosis, and the consequently delayed immunosuppressive treatment, may favour permanent sequelae, in particular, optic atrophy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-1172-8-18", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140134208", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Adult patients with diabetes were included if seen in the resident ophthalmology clinic at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center for an initial DR examination between July 2006 and June 2007. Medical records were reviewed for compliance with the 29 applicable elements from the American Academy of Ophthalmology DR Preferred Practice Pattern. Results: Of 451 diabetic patient visits in the ophthalmology clinic in the study period, 70 met inclusion criteria. The overall mean compliance rate was 52%. Compliance was best in the categories of examination (mean = 87%), diagnosis (mean = 82%), and treatment (mean = 74%). Compliance was lowest in the categories of medical history (mean = 11%) and counseling/referral (mean = 34%). Conclusion: Compliance with both practice and documentation of American Academy of Ophthalmology DR Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines at a resident ophthalmology clinic should be monitored, especially in the areas of medical history, patient education, and referrals. A target level of compliance should be set and maintained in all the DR Preferred Practice Pattern categories, especially in a teaching hospital where residents are developing their approach to quality care.

The objective of the present study was a detailed analysis of case reports about that topic. Material and methods: After conducting a literature search in PubMed this study analyzed 108 ophthalmologic complications following intraoral local anesthesia in 65 case reports with respect to patient-, anesthesia-, and complication- related factors. Results: The mean age of the patients was 33.8 years and females predominated (72.3%). The most commonly reported complication was diplopia (39.8%), mostly resulting from paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle. Other relatively frequent complications included ptosis (16.7%), mydriasis (14.8%) and amaurosis (13%). Ophthalmologic complications were mainly associated with block anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve (45.8%) or the posterior superior alveolar nerve (40.3%). Typically, the ophthalmologic complications in conjunction with intraoral local anesthesia had an immediate to short onset, and disappeared as the anesthesia subsided. Discussion and conclusion: The increased number of ophthalmologic complications after intraoral local anesthesia in females may suggest a gender effect. Double vision (diplopia) is the most frequently described complication, which is usually completely reversible like the other reported ophthalmologic complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.61872/sdj-2014-07-08-02", "url": "https://openalex.org/W147687049", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1979832276", "title": "The ophthalmological complications of targeted agents in cancer therapy: what do we need to know as ophthalmologists?", "text": "Recently, there has been an increase in the use of targeted therapies for cancer treatments. Nevertheless, the ocular side-effects of the commonly used targeted agents are generally under-reported and not well studied in the literature. We conducted multiple searches in databases, including Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and conference proceedings, using the following strings: 'name of targeted therapeutic agent (both generic and commercial names)' AND 'eye OR ocular OR vision OR ophthalmological'. Various targeted agents have been found to be associated with ocular side-effects due to their specific targeting of activities in the eye. Imatinib commonly causes periorbital oedema, epiphora and occasionally conjunctival haemorrhage. Cetuximab causes corneal lesions, meibomian gland dysfunction, periorbital and lid dermatitis, blepharitis and conjunctivitis. Erlotinib is related to various ocular toxicities, mainly on the ocular surface, and perifosine has been reported to be associated with severe keratitis. Bevacizumab could potentially disrupt intrinsic ocular circulation and lead to the development of thromboembolic events; there are rare reported cases of optic neuritis or optic neuropathy. Other targeted agents, such as trastuzumab, sunitinib and crizotinib, also have specific ocular toxicities. In conclusion, ocular effects of targeted agents are not uncommon in cancer patients receiving targeted therapy. Ophthalmologists should have high indexes of suspicion to diagnose and treat these complications promptly. Within the ever-expanding armamentarium of anticancer agents, targeted therapy, with its robust activity and good tolerability, has emerged rapidly in the recent decades. According to the definition by the National Cancer Institute, targeted therapy is a type of anticancer treatment that blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific molecules that are needed for carcinogenesis and tumour growth (they are therefore more cancer specific) rather than attacking all rapidly dividing cells (e.g. as with traditional chemotherapy). Targeted cancer therapies may be more effective than other anticancer treatments and less harmful to normal cells. In the era of personalized medicine, more than 20 targeted agents have been approved for specific indications in cancer treatment; many more are in the early stages of clinical development. Most of these agents work through mechanisms markedly different from conventional chemotherapy by targeting cellular signalling and angiogenesis pathways, and they are associated with distinct adverse effects. The eye, with its high vascularity, rapid proliferation and abundant distribution of receptors for various signalling molecules, is particularly susceptible to the effects of targeted agents (Fig. 1). A Summary of the Distribution of Various Signalling Pathways in the Eye and the Related Targeted Agents. EGF, epidermal growth factor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase. Although ocular toxicities associated with various anticancer treatments have been documented in the literature, nearly all reported toxicities are from radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapies. There are only a few reports that specifically address the issue of ocular toxicities associated with the commonly used targeted therapies. Notably, with the increasing number of cancer patients receiving targeted treatment, ophthalmologists' awareness of the potential ocular toxicities of these targeted agents is paramount to allow for timely management of cancer patients with ocular complaints. When a patient presents with a specific ocular symptom, it is important to delineate whether the complaints are due to the tumour itself, its associated effects, such as paraneoplastic syndrome, or the treatments. In this review, we summarize the reported ophthalmologic adverse effects of various commonly used targeted therapies in clinical practice. Imatinib (GleevecTM) is a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, c-kit, Arg and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-related protein tyrosine kinase (Fig. 1). It is approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. It is associated with a number of known ocular side-effects. Periorbital oedema is the most common ocular side-effect associated with imatinib (Esmaeli et al. 2004; Dogan & Esmaeli 2009) reported in up to 70% of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours in a randomized multicentre trial (Demetri et al. 2002) and similarly in another retrospective series (Fraunfelder et al. 2003). This phenomenon is due to dermal dendrocytes found in the periocular soft tissue that express particular molecular targets of imatinib, namely c-kit and PDGFR. Through the inhibition of PDGFR, imatinib may decrease the interstitial pressure and increase trans-capillary transport (Pietras et al. 2001; Esmaeli et al. 2002). In the literature, most of the reported cases improved with topical steroids and systemic diuretics, but surgical procedures in the form of debulking excessive skin, fat and oedema were required occasionally (Esmaeli et al. 2004; McClelland et al. 2010). Epiphora, the second most common orbital complaint with imatinib, occurs in nearly 20% of patients (Fraunfelder et al. 2003; Esmaeli et al. 2004). Postulated mechanisms for epiphora include conjunctival chemosis resulting in ocular surface irritation and the overproduction of tears, lacrimal pump dysfunction due to periorbital oedema, blockage of the puncta by conjunctivochalasis and secretion of the medication in the tear film. Topical steroids and diuretics have been useful in these situations (Dogan & Esmaeli 2009). Haemorrhage in the conjunctiva, which is rich in c-kit-positive mast cells (Stahl et al. 1999), was also noted in 11% of patients in a cohort of 87 in the absence of marrow suppression or systemic bleeding tendency; drug hypersensitivity and ocular irritation were suggested as possible mechanisms. Most of these cases spontaneously improved or improved with topical steroids (Radaelli et al. 2007). Sight-threatening complications affecting the optic nerve, macula and retina are uncommon but do occur with imatinib. Imatinib was shown to compromise the survival of retinal ganglion cells in vitro via the inhibition of the PDGFR signalling pathway (Biswas et al. 2009). Full-thickness retinal necrosis, chronic nongranulomatous vitritis and retinal oedema have been demonstrated in rabbit eyes after an intravitreal injection of imatinib and subsequent enucleation; because of the unknown effects of imatinib at the blood-retinal barrier, the in vivo significance of this finding has not been determined (Kitzmann et al. 2008). A clinical case report described imatinib-induced optic disc oedema and optic nerve dysfunction as evidenced by visual field depression and prolongation of P100 latency, which regressed after the cessation of the medication (Kwon et al. 2008). Cases of recurrent optic neuritis (Govind Babu et al. 2007), cystoid macular oedema and retinal oedema related to imatinib (Masood et al. 2005) are also reported in the literature. The macular oedema and retinal oedema subsided with cessation of the medication, and optic neuritis improved with systemic steroids. Erlotinib (TarcevaTM) is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinase at the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has been widely used to treat nonsmall-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer (Fig. 1). It shares a similar ocular toxicity profile with cetuximab, but its toxicities are mainly limited to the ocular surface. It has been reported to be associated with delayed corneal epithelial healing due to epidermal growth factor inhibition and possible secondary infectious keratitis (Johnson et al. 2009). Trichomegaly has also been documented as a side-effect of erlotinib, which may aggravate corneal epithelial damage. Epilation was used to treat the aforementioned problems (Lane & Goldstein 2007; Papadopoulos et al. 2008). Other reported ocular side-effects, including periorbital rash, swelling and secondary ectropion, improved after cessation of the medication (Methvin & Gausas 2007). Secondary conjunctivitis has been reported as another complication of ocular surface toxicity (2006). Gefitinib (Iressa TM) is another commonly used epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. It is mainly used for the treatment of nonsmall-cell lung cancer in Asian patients harbouring specific epidermal growth factor mutations. It has occasionally been associated with minor and treatable superficial punctate keratopathy, dry eyes, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and trichiasis. Fortunately, the conditions are usually mild and topical lubricants and antibiotics were usually sufficient for treatment (Tullo et al. 2005). Perifosine is a novel phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that inhibits Akt activation in the PI3K pathway and also affects a number of other key signal transduction pathways, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, all of which are associated with programmed cell death, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell survival (Fig. 1). Perifosine affects multiple pivotal signalling pathways, which therefore render this agent useful for various malignancies, such as refractory colorectal cancer and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Regarding its ocular toxicities, there were reports of severe adverse effects in the form of keratitis presenting as peripheral, paralimbal, ring-shaped, superficial corneal stromal infiltration and corneal ulcers that resembled the features of autoimmune keratitis. The exact mechanism of keratitis has not been understood. As most of the reported cases of ulcerative keratitis were in patients who had been receiving imatinib, a possible synergistic toxicity has been postulated but not yet proven. This can be potentially sight threatening, but fortunately, most of the reported cases responded to topical steroids (Shome et al. 2008; Dogan & Esmaeli 2009; Keenan et al. 2010). Crizotinib, a novel anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor (Fig. 1) with robust activity against ALK-positive nonsmall-cell lung cancer in phase II trials, was recently reported to be associated with a light–dark accommodation abnormality without objective ophthalmological abnormalities in up to 42% of patients (Shaw et al. 2011). The mechanism for this phenomenon is not well understood. Sunitinib is a small-molecule, multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (Fig. 1). It acts by working against platelet-derived growth factor receptors and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Similar to other anti-VEGFs, it is associated with cardiovascular disturbances. Cases have been reported regarding its role in reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome, which can cause cortical blindness that is reversible after the cessation of therapy and with blood pressure control (Chen & Agarwal 2009; Padhy et al. 2011). Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK cascade is a signal transduction pathway that is aberrantly activated in various neoplasms. Several agents have been developed to target this pathway. Although most of these agents have only been tested in clinical trials, ocular toxicities have already been reported. Ocular adverse effects (coloured spots or halos) have been observed in 34% of the patients receiving the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 at doses greater than 15 mg twice daily. Moreover, retinal vein occlusion has also been observed in three patients receiving PD0325901. Another MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, has been reported to cause blurring of vision, but symptoms gradually subsided after decreasing the dosage during the clinical trials. Similar complaints have been seen in patients on other MEK inhibitors, including GSK1120212 and AS703026. This unique toxicity associated with this class of drug suggests that it is an on-target, MEK-mediated effect (Sebolt-Leopold 2008; Delord et al. 2010; Infante et al. 2010). Cetuximab (ErbituxTM) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) whose downstream signalling pathways are essential for tumour survival and proliferation (Fig. 1). It is primarily approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. EGFR is expressed in various ocular structures, including hair follicles, meibomian glands and corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelium (Fig. 1). In hair follicles, the EGFR cascade regulates the transformation from anagen or the growth phase to catagen or the regressive phase. Cetuximab-induced inhibition of EGFR alters the growth cycle leading to abnormal hair growth and terminal differentiation (Vaccaro et al. 2009; Vano-Galvan et al. 2010). In addition, the keratinocyte architecture of root sheaths and the pattern of normal hair growth are affected, resulting in disoriented and short hair follicles. Because of the abnormal structures of these hairs, they may affect the corneal surface by causing local mechanical irritation (Dueland et al. 2003; Melichar & Nemcova 2007). Meibomian gland dysfunction with increased seborrheic secretions, periorbital and lid dermatitis, blepharitis and conjunctivitis were also reported (Tonini et al. 2005; Melichar & Nemcova 2007). Corneal epithelial toxicity has also been reported. EGFR in corneal, limbal and conjunctival epithelium stimulates epithelial proliferation, migration and wound healing; cetuximab causes a breakdown in this self-healing mechanism to the extent of persistent corneal erosion, despite all convention treatments, including lubrication, bandage lens and patching. In one reported case, topical epidermal growth factor administration was essential to improve the wound healing (Foerster et al. 2008; Forster et al. 2008). Although the ocular side-effects of cetuximab are apparently restricted to cutaneous structures and the major effects are mainly cosmetic and locally irritating, a potentially blinding keratopathy can be a serious sequel due to surface opacification after repeated erosion and scarring. Bevacizumab (AvastinTM) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor-1 (VEGF-1) (Fig. 1) and is approved for use in metastatic colon cancer, nonsmall-cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer and glioblastoma multiforme. Additionally, bevacizumab is used as an off-label treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. To date, there are no large-scale reports on the ocular side-effects of bevacizumab when used systemically. Bevacizumab infusion is associated with cerebral or cardiac ischaemic events (Klastersky 2006). Similarly, the eye can be affected by the disruption of the intrinsic ocular circulation or the development of thromboembolic events, although not yet reported in the literature. Interestingly, there were rare reported cases of optic neuritis and optic neuropathy associated with bevacizumab treatment for cutaneous melanoma and glioblastoma (Biswas et al. 2008; Sherman et al. 2009). Another case of an acute retinal pigment epithelial tear in the untreated fellow eye following bevacizumab injections was also reported, suspected to be caused by bevacizumab reaching the other eye via systemic circulation (Mennel et al. 2007). Of note, bevacizumab use is associated with the occurrence of reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), which may commonly present as cortical blindness (Allen et al. 2006; Glusker et al. 2006). Although the primary pathology of RPLS is not in the eye and ophthalmological examination is usually unremarkable, patients may first present to ophthalmologists complaining of visual disturbances. Other clinical features in this syndrome include hypertension, headache, seizures and altered mental status. The pathogenesis is attributed to vasogenic oedema from changes in blood pressure related to vasospasm or toxic damage to blood-brain barrier or vascular endothelium (Glusker et al. 2006). Diagnosis is made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where bilateral grey and white matter oedema in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemispheres can be observed. Vision usually returns to baseline after blood pressure is controlled and bevacizumab is stopped. Trastuzumab (HerceptinTM) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts by binding to the extracellular juxtamembrane domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER 2). By down-regulating downstream signalling cascades, trastuzumab is useful in inhibiting proliferation and the survival of HER2-dependent tumours, mainly breast cancer and advanced gastric cancer. In vivo, trastuzumab was found to inhibit corneal neovascularization, (Guler et al. 2009) but the ocular effects of trastuzumab in human subjects are not known. In a study on a related compound, trastuzumab-DM1, a HER2 antibody-cytotoxic conjugate, adverse ocular effects were reported to be 27.7% (Burris et al. 2011). These included dry eyes, increased lacrimation, mild subjective blurring of vision and conjunctivitis, and they were generally mild and tolerable. Targeted agents represent a promising treatment modality in cancer patients. Nonetheless, they are relatively new in clinical development, and their effects on normal tissues are not fully understood. The eye, a complex integration of the neurological, vascular and cutaneous systems, can be affected by these targeted agents (Table 1). Ocular complications have been studied for a few targeted agents but are likely to be under-reported in others with similar or overlapping actions. A high index of suspicion would facilitate a better understanding of the ophthalmic effects of these agents and the prevention of sight-threatening complications. Despite the diversity of ocular complications caused by various targeted agents, a simple screening protocol that consists of visual acuity, colour vision assessment, Amsler grid test, pupil reaction and fluorescein staining of the cornea surface may be helpful in high-risk patients. Assessments can be performed at the patient's baseline and then regularly by trained nurses. Abnormal results may prompt the referral to an ophthalmologist. It is also important to address the optimal frequency of follow-up in these patients. Although a more frequent follow-up schedule is better for the earlier detection of complications, it might be difficult to implement in most centres. Baseline screening, as mentioned, and prompt referral for ophthalmological attention may be a compromised solution. Moreover, general toxicity scores and self-reported questionnaires might be used to facilitate the standardization of symptom reporting. More importantly, in patients on targeted therapies and at high risk for developing ocular side-effects, oncologists may consult the ophthalmologists about the need to prescribe prophylactic treatments, such as topical lubricants, topical steroids and systemic diuretics to prevent the development of corneal toxicity, ocular chemosis and swelling, which can potentially be associated with the use of the targeted agents. Overall, the management of targeted therapy-induced ocular complications requires a close partnership between ophthalmologists and oncologists. Most patients with mild toxicities do not require treatments other than lubrication or eye patching, while the cessation of the offending targeted agents will usually lead to clinical improvement in more severe cases. Some of these simple measures may be managed by oncologists alone. For more complicated patients, ophthalmological input is indicated so that more attentive eye care and follow-ups can be arranged. Specific treatments exist for different conditions: for instance, diuretics for periorbital oedema (McClelland et al. 2010), steroids for optic neuritis (Govind Babu et al. 2007) and anti-microbials for secondary infections (Fraunfelder et al. 2003). Novel therapies, such as topical application of recombinant human EGF, which binds soluble EGF antibodies in tears and stimulates migration of corneal epithelial cells, have been used to treat cetuximab-induced corneal erosion (Forster et al. 2008). In rare instances, aggressive treatment is required; surgical debulking was reported in the treatment of severe eyelid oedema causing visual obstruction (Biswas et al. 2009). For patients requiring these modalities of treatment, follow-up by an ophthalmologist is recommended (Table 2). The ocular effects of targeted agents are clinically relevant, and ophthalmologists are expected to see an increasing number of referrals from the oncologists for the management of these side-effects. Practicing ophthalmologists should be vigilant in detecting these complications promptly.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-3768.2012.02518.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979832276", "source": "openalex"}

Questionnaires (using a Likert scale of 1-5) were distributed to 169 fifth-year medical students attending the cornea module applied as TBL in an ophthalmology course. The questionnaire consisted of two categories: the TBL format (7 items) and an open-ended question about the class (1 item). Feedback was then evaluated. The majority of students felt that modified TBL sessions were better at fulfilling learning objectives (121 students, 71.59%), enabled better understanding (134 students, 79.28%), were more interesting (146 students, 86.39%), ensured greater student participation (123 students, 72.78%), and involved greater effort on the part of students (148 students, 87.57%) compared with traditional teaching methods. Most of the students (129 students, 76.33%) agreed that more such sessions should be organized in the future.

Deep learning (DL), in particular, has garnered significant attention due to the availability of large amounts of data and digitized ocular images. Currently, AI in Ophthalmology is mainly focused on improving disease classification and supporting decision-making when treating ophthalmic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, most of the DL systems (DLSs) developed thus far remain in the research stage and only a handful are able to achieve clinical translation. This phenomenon is due to a combination of factors including concerns over security and privacy, poor generalizability, trust and explainability issues, unfavorable end-user perceptions and uncertain economic value. Overcoming this challenge would require a combination approach. Firstly, emerging techniques such as federated learning (FL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autonomous AI and blockchain will be playing an increasingly critical role to enhance privacy, collaboration and DLS performance. Next, compliance to reporting and regulatory guidelines, such as CONSORT-AI and STARD-AI, will be required to in order to improve transparency, minimize abuse and ensure reproducibility. Thirdly, frameworks will be required to obtain patient consent, perform ethical assessment and evaluate end-user perception. Lastly, proper health economic assessment (HEA) must be performed to provide financial visibility during the early phases of DLS development.

Enzyme activity, release mechanism, and perspectives for ophthalmology", "text": "Mesoporous vaterite CaCO3 crystals are nowadays one of the most popular vectors for loading of fragile biomolecules like proteins due to biocompatibility, high loading capacity, cost effective and simple loading procedures. However, recent studies reported the reduction of bioactivity for protein encapsulation into the crystals in water due to rather high alkaline pH of about 10.3 caused by the crystal hydrolysis. In this study we have investigated how to retain the bioactivity and control the release rate of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) loaded into the crystals via co-synthesis. SOD is widely used as an antioxidant in ophthalmology and its formulations with high protein content and activity as well as opportunities for a sustained release are highly desirable. Here we demonstrate that SOD co-synthesis can be done at pH 8.5 in a buffer without affecting crystal morphology. The synthesis in the buffer allows reaching the high loading efficiency of 93%, high SOD content (24 versus 15 w/w % for the synthesis in water), and order of magnitude higher activity compared to the synthesis in water. The enormous SOD concentration into crystals of 10−2 M is caused by the entrapment of SOD aggregates into the crystal pores. The SOD released from crystals at physiologically relevant ionic strength fully retains its bioactivity. As found by fitting the release profiles using zero-order and Baker-Lonsdale models, the SOD release mechanism is governed by both the SOD aggregate dissolution and by the diffusion of SOD molecules thorough the crystal pores. The latest process contributes more in case of the co-synthesis in the buffer because at higher pH (co-synthesis in water) the unfolded SOD molecules aggregate stronger. The release is bi-modal with a burst (ca 30%) followed by a sustained release and a complete release due to the recrystallization of vaterite crystals to non-porous calcite crystals.

Examination of 228 mentally retarded adults revealed that every fourth person in the group had a considerable visual handicap. In some of these cases this handicap was previously unknown. More than half of the examined had one or more ocular disorders. In 12 cases there was need for surgery. Fourteen eyes have subsequently been operated on, all without complications. Eight of these operations resulted in improved vision. Considerable refractive errors were found in 54 of the examined.

Non-invasive approaches for early detection and monitoring of treatments have decreased morbidity and mortality. Understanding of basic methods of imaging techniques and choice of imaging modalities in cases encountered in neuro-ophthalmology clinic is critical for proper evaluation of patients. Two main imaging modalities that are often used are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, variations of these modalities and appropriate location of imaging must be considered in each clinical scenario. In this article, we review and summarize the best neuroimaging studies for specific neuro-ophthalmic indications and the diagnostic radiographic findings for important clinical entities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjopt.2012.07.001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2032284298", "source": "openalex"}

This review aims to provide an update on these additional features, with respect to the management of a diverse range of neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. Recent findings Macular ganglion cell complex (mGCC) analysis has been shown to be superior to peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) analysis in certain settings, such as differentiating Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy from functional visual loss; monitoring neurodegenerative diseases or multiple sclerosis; and predicting visual loss in nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy. mGCC analysis also demonstrates high correlation with perimetry and might serve as an early structural indicator of irreversible neuronal loss. Compared to pRNFL, retinal thickness analysis of the optic nerve head demonstrates better correlation with the severity of papilledema, thus enabling its possible application in detecting raised intracranial pressure, especially in the pediatric group. Upcoming research on emerging OCT technologies including OCT-angiography, enhanced depth imaging, retinal single-layer analysis and portable systems will hopefully further enhance the utility of OCT in the field. Summary It is crucial for neuro-ophthalmologists to be updated and familiar with these newer OCT imaging protocols and to make appropriate choices for different clinical scenarios, in order to optimize the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000418", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2742378625", "source": "openalex"}

However, TBL hasn't been well-studied in the ophthalmology clerkship context. This study was to examine the impact of modified TBL in such context and to assess the student evaluations of TBL. Methods Ninety-nine students of an 8-year clinical medicine program from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre, Sun Yat-sen University, were randomly divided into four sequential units and assigned to six teams with the same faculty. The one-week ophthalmology clerkship module included traditional lectures, gross anatomy and a TBL module. The effects of the TBL module on student performance were measured by the Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT), the Group Readiness Assurance Test (GRAT), the Group Application Problem (GAP) and final examination scores (FESs). Students' evaluations of TBL were measured by a 16-item questionnaire. IRAT and GRAT scores were compared using a paired t-test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and subgroup analysis compared the effects among quartiles that were stratified by the Basic Ophthalmology Levels (BOLs). The BOLs were evaluated before the ophthalmology clerkship. Results In TBL classes, the GRAT scores were significantly higher than the IRAT scores in both the full example and the BOL-stratified groups. It highlighted the advantages of TBL compared to the individual learning. Quartile-stratified ANOVA comparisons showed significant differences at FES scores (P < 0.01). In terms to IRAT, GRAT and GAP scores, there was no significant result. Moreover, IRAT scores only significantly differed between the first and fourth groups. The FES scores of the first three groups are significantly higher than the fourth group. Gender-specific differences were significant in FES but not the IRAT. Overall, 57.65% of student respondents agreed that TBL was helpful. Male students tended to rate TBL higher than female students. Conclusion The application of modified TBL to the ophthalmology clerkship curriculum improved students' performance and increased students' engagement and satisfaction. TBL should be further optimized and developed to enhance the educational outcomes among multi-BOLs medical students.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154250", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2342278127", "source": "openalex"}

The most common causes are Bell's palsy, Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and trauma, including surgical trauma. Incidence varies between 17 and 35 cases per 100,000. Initial evaluation should include accurate clinical history, followed by a comprehensive investigation of the head and neck, including ophthalmological, otological, oral and neurological examination, to exclude secondary causes. Routine laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging is not indicated in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, but should be performed in patients with risk factors, atypical cases or in any case without resolution within 4 months. Many factors are involved in determining the appropriate treatment of these patients: the underlying cause, expected duration of nerve dysfunction, anatomical manifestations, severity of symptoms and objective clinical findings. Systemic steroids should be offered to patients with new-onset Bell's palsy to increase the chance of facial nerve recovery and reduce synkinesis. Ophthalmologists play a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary team involved in the evaluation and rehabilitation of these patients. In the acute phase, the main priority should be to ensure adequate corneal protection. Treatment depends on the degree of nerve lesion and on the risk of the corneal damage based on the amount of lagophthalmos, the quality of Bell's phenomenon, the presence or absence of corneal sensitivity and the degree of lid retraction. The main therapy is intensive lubrication. Other treatments include: taping the eyelid overnight, botulinum toxin injection, tarsorrhaphy, eyelid weight implants, scleral contact lenses and palpebral spring. Once the cornea is protected, longer term planning for eyelid and facial rehabilitation may take place. Spontaneous complete recovery of Bell's palsy occurs in up to 70% of cases. Long-term complications include aberrant regeneration with synkinesis. FNP after acoustic neuroma surgery remains the most common indication for FN rehabilitation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjopt.2014.09.009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1985188639", "source": "openalex"}

In a series of 14 patients with this diagnosis, 10 had associated neurologic disorders. Clinical-neuroradiologic correlation identified the brainstem as the site of the lesion in some patients. The ipsilateral pupil was involved in 12 patients and was miotic with a trace or no reaction to light on the side of the palsy in 8 of the 12 patients. In two of these eight patients, the pupil was documented to be dilated and fixed in early infancy and subsequently became miotic at several months of age, concurrent with emergence of other signs of aberrant reinnervation. Pupillary miosis as a result of aberrant reinnervation appears to be much more frequent after congenital than acquired pupillary-involving oculomotor palsy. Four patients showed better visual acuity in the paretic eye, an unexpected finding. The paretic eye appeared to have a fixational advantage if the patient had nystagmus, presumably due to asymmetric dampening of the nystagmus. Significant anisometropia and astigmatic errors in the paretic eye were present in essentially all patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0161-6420(91)32230-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088932458", "source": "openalex"}

The impact of these changes on clinical care of patients was examined by examining operation and prescribing rates for glaucoma in four geographical areas of Scotland for the years 1994 to 1999.A retrospective analysis of national health statistics: primary care prescribing data, hospital derived operation rates, consultant numbers, optometrist numbers, and eye test data, expressed by estimated population at risk of glaucoma. The outcome measures were prescribing volume and cost for glaucoma medications, and operation rates, corrected for population estimated to be at risk of glaucoma (PEG), for trabeculectomy, for Scotland as a whole, and for four geographical \"regions\" (north east, south east, central, and south west Scotland).Prescribed items per 1000 population estimated to have glaucoma (PEG) increased by 24.9% between 1994 and 1999. This was above the general increase in prescribing in Scotland (17.8%). This increase varied in the four health regions evaluated (14.3% to 31.9%). Prescribing of topical beta blockers increased little (6.4%), but there was a large increase in the use of new products (topical prostaglandins, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and alpha(2) agonists), at the expense of miotics (47.7% fall), and older sympathomimetics. This change in prescribing pattern was accompanied by a 61.5% increase in cost (range 42.2% to 73.4% in the four regions). New drugs accounted for more than half of total glaucoma expenditure in 1999. Operation rates (corrected for PEG) fell by 45.9% (range 43.1 to 58.6%) between 1994 and 1999. Other indicators suggested increased activity in ophthalmic areas (for example, cataract operations, eye tests, numbers of optometrists and ophthalmic surgeons all increased). Within north east Scotland operation rates decreased and prescribing increased less than in other regions, both from lowest regional baseline in 1994.The introduction of new drug classes has had dramatic effects on the prescribing of glaucoma treatments. There has been a decline in older treatments and an increase in new agents, which has been associated with a large reduction in operation rates for glaucoma in Scotland over 6 years.

Fundus images comprise of fine features like blood vessels, macula and optic disks. Conventional watermarking methods may tamper crucial information in this case. Even minutest change can distort fine features and affect final decision. ROI (Region of Interest) selection approach also fails here as fine features of fundus images are evenly distributed and it's almost impossible to properly define Region of Interest (ROI) and Region of Non-Interest (RONI) for medical practitioner. Hence arises an imperative necessity of a watermarking system which does not tamper the fundus images and results in no loss of medical information. This paper proposes a zero-watermarking system which uses singular value coefficients in Wavelet domain for generation of unique identification code from fundus images which is strategically combined with patient ID to generate watermark. Proposed technique suits to the specific requirements of fundus images and optimizes the conflicting requirements of traditional watermarking. The technique aims at unique identification, authentication and integrity verification of medical images.

However, the correlation between ophthalmological findings and disease staging remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the staging, acute ophthalmological manifestations, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of orbital complications of paranasal sinusitis during a 27-year period. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with orbital complications of paranasal sinusitis hospitalized at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, a medical center in Taiwan during 1988–2015. Sex, age, symptoms, history, ophthalmological findings, laboratory and imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed by staging. Results Eighty-three patients aged 9 days to 80 years had stage I (preseptal cellulitis, n = 39 patients), II (postseptal orbital cellulitis, n = 8), III (subperiosteal abscess, n = 16), IV (orbital abscess, n = 8), or V (intracranial involvement, n = 12) complications. Peak incidences occurred in patients aged 0–19 and 60–69 years. Chronic sinusitis and diabetes mellitus were common preexisting diseases. Extraocular movement limitation and proptosis predicted postseptal (stage II or more) involvement. The likelihood of elevated intraocular pressure increased with stage. Reduced visual acuity and presence of relative afferent pupillary defect indicated consideration of magnetic resonance imaging to investigate possible intracranial extension. Ipsilateral maxillary (81.7%) and ethmoidal (75.6%) sinuses were the most common sources of infection, and the most frequently implicated pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (25.3%) and Staphylococcus aureus (20.5%). All patients received intravenous antimicrobial therapy (multi-drug therapy in 88.0%), and 55.4% underwent surgery, most commonly endoscopic sinus surgery. One (1.2%) diabetic man with stage V complications died of fungal sinusitis with intracranial invasion. Five (6.0%) patients, all stage V, lost vision despite intensive treatment. The average length of hospital stay was 13.8 days (range 2–72 days), and significantly longer stays were associated with stages II–V as compared to stage I. Conclusions Orbital infection originating from paranasal sinusitis can cause vision loss and death due to intracranial extension. Acute ophthalmological findings predict staging and prognosis. Cooperative consultation between ophthalmologists, otorhinolaryngologists, and neurologists is essential.

The prevalence of eyes with at least one complication involving anterior segment was significantly more represented in the PsA group than the psoriasis one (p = 0.024). Anterior segment complications were more frequently associated with posterior ones in PsA patients than in psoriasis patients (p = 0.005). Most common complications in total sample at baseline examination were cataract (29.7%), ocular hypertension (17%), macular edema (7%), and pupillary seclusion (4.4%). Conclusion: Uveitis in patients with psoriasis and PsA may have distinguishing clinical features. PsA patients have more ocular complications than those with psoriasis. Both groups need an ophthalmological examination to promptly detect ocular co-morbidity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/08820538.2016.1170161", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2461185310", "source": "openalex"}

Search terms included ophthalmology or ophthalmologist and malpractice anywhere in the retrieved documents. Cases in which the plaintiffs were younger than 18 years at the time of the inciting event were included. Pediatric cases were compared with adult cases.Pediatric malpractice case outcomes and settlement amounts.Sixty-eight ophthalmology malpractice cases involving plaintiffs younger than 18 years were included in the study. Thirty-five cases (51.5%) were resolved via jury trial. Of these 35 cases, verdicts in favor of the plaintiff were issued in 17 pediatric cases (48.6%), compared with 168 of 584 adult cases (28.8%) (difference, 33%; 95% CI, -24% to 64%; P = .01). The 17 cases that resulted in verdicts in favor of the pediatric plaintiff had a mean jury award of $4 815 693 (median, $883 281; range, $147 765-$42 061 690). Nine of the total 68 cases (13.2%) resulted in a settlement, with mean adjusted indemnities of $1 912 738 (median, $1 377 689; range, $92 070-$8 493 086). The remaining 24 cases (35.3%) involved appellate rulings, pretrial and posttrial relief rulings, and 1 bench verdict.

Recent findings Amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) applied to the eyes and eyelids in the acute phase of SJS can prevent the devastating scarring and visual problems that characterize the chronic phase of the disease. The severity of ocular inflammation in the acute phase does not always correlate to the severity of skin and systemic involvement. Thus, it is crucial that all patients with SJS be evaluated by an ophthalmologist familiar with the current management of the disease, the potential urgency of the situation and the option of AMT. Although challenging, the severe, chronic ocular problems of SJS can be at least partially alleviated with autologous serum drops, mucous membrane grafting to replace scarred tarsal conjunctiva, specialized contact lenses (PROSE), conjunctival replacement surgery (COMET), limbal stem cell transplantation and kerotoprostheses. Summary Early AMT is an effective treatment of acute SJS. Emerging treatments offer increased hope for those who have already suffered damage from SJS, but emphasis on the prevention of damage in the acute phase is most crucial.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0b013e3283622718", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2333710896", "source": "openalex"}

However, the efficacy of SDL in some clinical courses is debated.The aim of the study was to measure the effectiveness of SDL for an ophthalmology course in comparison with PBL.A cross-sectional study was conducted with fifth-year medical students enrolled in an ophthalmology course. SDL comprised four case-based scenarios guided by several questions. PBL comprised three sessions. An ear, nose, and throat (ENT) course was selected for comparison as a control. At the end of the course, 30 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for both SDL and PBL were assessed and analyzed against their counterparts in the ENT course by an independent t-test.For the SDL component of the ophthalmology course, the number and percentages of students attaining high (n = 6/60, 10%) and moderate (n = 15/60, 28.3%) scores on an MCQs written exam were evaluated. For the PBL component, high scores were seen for 23.3% (n = 14/60), and moderate scores for 33.3% (n = 20/60) of the participants. For the SDL component of the ENT course, the number and percentages of students attaining high (n = 14/60, 23.3%) and moderate (n = 17/60, 28.3%) scores were recorded. For the PBL component, high (16/60, 26.6%) and moderate (17/60, 28%) scores were recorded. Significant p-values were obtained between the results for SDL and PBL in the ophthalmology course (p = 0.009), as well as between SDL results for both courses (p = 0.0308). Moreover, differences between the SDL results of ophthalmology and the PBL results of ENT (p = 0.0372) were significant.SDL appears to be less valuable for promotion of self-readiness.

Over the years, gaining in-depth knowledge of the disease has led to vast improvement in patient life expectancy. However, debilitating, extra-renal manifestations such as eye disease, in particular corneal crystal deposition and its associated photophobia, still occur frequently, regardless of patient age and notwithstanding the increased implementation of systemic therapy. Ophthalmological assessment has not yet been standardized. The aim of this article was to provide clear recommendations for ophthalmological assessment during follow-up of patients with cystinosis to improve quality and regularity of ophthalmological care and thereby minimize ophthalmological complications. A literature search was performed to assess previous and current recommendations on examinations to conduct during follow-up of patients with cystinosis. Multidisciplinary cystinosis clinics were set up in collaboration with the Department of Ophthalmology and the Department of Pediatric Nephrology to allow patients to be seen by a nephrologist, an ophthalmologist and other specialists on the same day. Based on the results of these multidisciplinary clinics the standardized clinical ophthalmological assessment was drafted. This is a protocol for follow-up, describing the approach taken regarding ophthalmological follow-up of patients with cystinosis, considering the different types of the disease and the time since diagnosis. Standard examination includes history, visual acuity, tonometry and slit-lamp examination, with fundus photography performed at diagnosis and annually thereafter. Confocal microscopy is the imaging modality of choice, while anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a good alternative. Finally, posterior segment OCT for imaging of the macular region and optic nerve should be conducted on an annual basis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-017-0089-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2611522672", "source": "openalex"}

Scope: This is a 600-page soft cover training manual that covers every important topic in neuro-ophthalmology. There are no references. As the authors declare in the preface, it is intended as an introduction to neuro-ophthalmology for medical students and physicians in training in ophthalmology, neurology, and neurosurgery. The material is organized in a fashion that has become standard for books of this nature. Techniques of examination come first, followed by chapters on persistent and transient visual loss, retinal and optic nerve diseases, retrogeniculate disorders, pupils, diplopia, eyelid, orbital, and cavernous sinus diseases, ocular oscillations, headache and facial pain, and nonorganic manifestations. The text is amplified with flowcharts, boxes that succinctly highlight \"take-home\" points (called \"pearls\"), decision trees, lists of differential diagnoses, and hundreds of illustrations, including anatomic drawings from Thieme atlases, external ocular photographs, fundus photographs, CT scans, magnetic resonance scans, and cerebral angiograms. Strengths: The text is tightly and cogently written. The illustrations are first-rate. The explanations are simple enough so that a newcomer can quickly catch on, yet ample enough for an experienced reader to capture a deeper understanding of how these things work and how to teach them. Weaknesses: There aren't any. One could object that there are no references to back up the material, but training manuals do not need them. Besides, the authors adhere to accepted wisdom in the field without making controversial points. I wonder if the soft binding will hold up with repeated use, which this book will certainly get. Recommended Audience: This book will work best as a training manual, as the authors suggest. But it would also suit practitioners of all clinical neurologic specialties who are looking for an elegant rendition of the subject matter supported by beautiful illustrations. Critical Appraisal: This is the best soft cover training manual in neuro-ophthalmology that I have read. Its excellence is no surprise, for the authors are renowned for their clinical wizardry. The amalgamation of so much good information with such good pictures under one cover is a triumph. Novices will learn pleasurably from the succinct text and apt illustrations. The cognoscenti will marvel at how masterfully this book has been put together. Jonathan D.

METHODS This paper reviews the outcomes of 29 children treated for pineal and posterior third ventricular tumors in the contemporary era using chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and resection as defined by the histology and/or marker profile of the tumor. RESULTS At the time of diagnosis, all patients except 1 had hydrocephalus and all had ophthalmological involvement. Papilledema was found in 69% of patients. Seventy-five percent of patients had partial or complete Parinaud's syndrome, and diplopia or blurred vision was noted in the remaining patients. Visual acuity was impaired in 8 patients. Outcomes were dependent on the histology of the tumor and the treatment required. Those patients who did not requiring resection showed a lower rate of ophthalmological worsening during treatment and greater long-term improvement, in particular with respect to up-gaze palsy. Patients who underwent resection for postchemotherapy residual disease or primary resection showed greater worsening during treatment and lesser degrees of recovery. All patients with impaired visual acuity improved with treatment. CONCLUSIONS As the mortality of germ cell and other pineal tumors decreases, posttreatment morbidity remains, specifically that related to convergence nystagmus, accommodation, and diplopia.

We recorded demographics, iris color, number of positive review of systems, ocular examination, precipitating event or trauma, workers' compensation claims, disability and lawsuit related to the visual loss, and the reason for wearing sunglasses.Among the 1,377 consecutive new patients seen in our clinic during the study, 34 patients wore sunglasses, among whom 7 (20.6%) had organic visual loss. During the study period, 59 patients were diagnosed with NOVL, among whom 27 (45.8%) wore sunglasses. The sensitivity of wearing sunglasses for NOVL was 0.46 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.59). The probability that a patient walking into our clinic had NOVL was 0.043 (95% CI 0.033 to 0.055); it increased to 0.79 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.91) in sunglasses patients.

All except one (99%) admitted a change in their routine clinical practice during the pandemic, and most (89%) continued to be engaged in ophthalmology department duties. Twenty-five percent were deployed to COVID-19 units, which was combined with ophthalmological activities in about half of them (47%). A significant proportion of participants stated that they were enrolled in the following ophthalmological activities: emergency/inpatient care (87%), outpatient visits (73%; general 70% vs subspecialty 29%), and surgical procedures (64%). Twenty-five percent did not assist in any outpatient visits and 36% did not participate in any surgical procedures. On a scale from 1 (no impact) to 5 (maximum impact), most participants classified their perceived negative impact of the pandemic on the training program as 3 (24%), 4 (40%), or 5 (27%). Participants highly agreed with the extension of the residency program (80%) in order to to make up for training disruption.Discussion: Most trainees provided ophthalmological care during the pandemic. However, those clinical activities were essentially related to general and emergency care. Surgical experience was significantly curtailed. As such, strategies are needed to guarantee a high-quality learning process.

We review what PROMs are, how they are developed and chosen for use, and how their quality can be critically appraised. We outline the progress made to develop PROMs in each clinical subspecialty. We highlight recent examples of the use of PROMs as secondary outcome measures in randomized controlled clinical trials and consider the impact they have had. With increasing interest in using PROMs as primary outcome measures, particularly where interventions have been found to be of equivalent efficacy by traditional outcome metrics, we highlight the importance of instrument precision in permitting smaller sample sizes to be recruited. Our review finds that while there has been considerable progress in PROM development, particularly in cataract, glaucoma, medical retina, and low vision, there is a paucity of useful tools for less common ophthalmic conditions. Development and validation of item banks, administered using computer adaptive testing, has been proposed as a solution to overcome many of the traditional limitations of PROMs, but further work will be needed to examine their acceptability to patients, clinicians, and investigators.

He developed corneal edema with decrease in vision in his left eye following application of the plant extract. Treatment with topical steroids and antibiotics resulted in a complete clinical and visual recovery. The second patient developed a fungal corneal ulcer (dermatophyte - Trichophyton mentagrophyte) after sustaining injury with an animal tail to the right eye and used honey for pain relief prior to presentation. She responded poorly to anti-fungal treatment, underwent a penetrating keratoplasty with recurrence of infection in the graft that resulted in a vascularized corneal scar. The third patient was a five-year-old child who was treated with 'wasam' on the occiput for intraocular inflammation following bilateral uncomplicated cataract extraction. Following this treatment the topical steroid was discontinued. The 'Wasam' treatment indirectly resulted in exacerbation of the intraocular inflammation and secondary glaucoma and poor vision as well as 'Wasam ulcers' on the occiput. Despite treatment of the intraocular inflammation, the visual outcome was poor.Traditional medicine in Oman is sought by many for variable reasons. Lack of evidence-based scientific data on its safety or efficacy does not deter the Omanis from flocking the traditional healers.

Sir Charles Bell (1774–1842) was a Scottish anatomist, physiologist, neurologist, artist and surgeon, who enjoyed a distinguished career in teaching and clinical practice in London between 1804 and 1836. In 1814, he was appointed to the surgical staff of the Middlesex Hospital. In 1824, he was elected Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and shortly afterwards was elected Professor of Physiology at the University of London. In 1831, he was knighted on the accession of William IV. In 1836, he was elected to the Chair of Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, and remained there until his death in 1842, at 68 years of age. During his career, Bell was a prolific medical author, a brilliant medical researcher and a skilled artist. In 1811, he discovered the distinct functions of the motor and sensory nerves, findings that were initially published in a pamphlet entitled ‘Ideas of a New Anatomy of the Brain’. In 1821, Bell described the long thoracic nerve, which supplies the serratus anterior muscle, and which now bears his name. In the same paper he showed that lesions of the seventh cranial nerve produce facial paralysis (now termed Bell's palsy). He also demonstrated that the fifth cranial nerve is of sensory importance to the face and controls the muscles of mastication, whereas the seventh cranial nerve principally controls the muscles of facial expression. Bell published research on a number of ophthalmological subjects.

This study investigated the impact of Lean Six Sigma, a service improvement methodology originally from manufacturing, in reducing patient wait times and increasing service capacity in a publicly-funded, tertiary referral outpatient ophthalmology clinic. Methods This quality improvement study compared results from two five-months audits of operational data pre- and post-implementation of Lean Six Sigma. A baseline audit was conducted to determine duration and variability of patient in-clinic time and number of patients seen per clinic session. Staff interviews and a time-in-motion study were conducted to identify issues reducing clinic service efficiency. Solutions were developed to address these root causes including: clinic schedule amendments, creation of dedicated postoperative clinics, and clear documentation templates. A post-implementation audit was conducted, and the results compared with baseline audit data. Significant differences in patient in-clinic time pre- and post-solution implementation were assessed using Mann-Whitney test. Differences in variability of patient in-clinic times were assessed using Brown-Forsythe test. Differences in numbers of patients seen per clinic session were assessed using Student’s t-test. Results During the baseline audit period, 19.4 patients were seen per 240-minute clinic session. Median patient in-clinic time was 131 minutes with an interquartile range of 133 minutes (84–217 minutes, quartile 1- quartile 3). Targeted low/negligible cost solutions were implemented to reduce in-clinic times. During the post-implementation audit period, the number of patients seen per session increased 9% to 21.1 ( p = 0.016). There was significant reduction in duration ( p &lt; 0.001) and variability ( p &lt; 0.001) of patient in-clinic time (median 107 minutes, interquartile range 91 minutes [71–162 minutes]).

The 101 most frequently cited articles were published in 16 journals.<i>Archives of Ophthalmology</i>had the most top-cited articles (n = 31), followed by<i>American Journal of Ophthalmology</i>(n = 24) and<i>Albrecht von Graefe's Archiv für Ophthalmologie</i>(n = 9). These articles originated from 14 countries, with the United States publishing the majority (n = 58).

Among an estimated 2,200 patient visits to the office from August 10 to October 15, 1981 for problems unrelated to infectious conjunctivitis, 39 (1.8%) persons subsequently developed EKC. The median incubation period was 6.5 days (range, 1 to 14 days). A case-control study was done to identify risk factors associated with contracting EKC; patients with EKC were more likely than control patients to have been examined by one or the other of two of the four ophthalmologists at the clinic and to have undergone procedures such as tonometry or foreign body removal. Adenovirus was isolated from conjunctival swabs from four of five persons with conjunctivitis; three were type 8 and one was type 7. Recognition of the problem and improved handwashing practices were associated with terminating the outbreak. This outbreak illustrates the potential for transmission of adenovirus infection during the provision of eye care.

Methods: The study population included 2,951 new consecutive patients from the Department of Ophthalmology at University Hospital in Chiang-Mai, Thailand. Main outcome measures were blindness and low vision, which were defined according to World Health Organization criteria. Results: Of 2,951 patients, 369 (12.5%) had blindness and/or low vision (bilateral blindness in 73, unilateral blindness in 129, bilateral low vision in 77, and unilateral low vision in 90). Of the etiological causes of visual loss, age-related ocular disease was the most frequent (128 patients [35%]) followed by infections (66 patients [18%]) and trauma (43 patients [12%]). Although infections and trauma were the predominant causes of blindness, age-related disorders were frequently found in patients with low vision. Of anatomical sites, the lens (134 patients [36%]) was the main location of visual loss, closely followed by disorders of the retina and/or uvea (126 patients [34%]). Blindness and low vision were considered avoidable in 70% of cases. Of 73 patients with bilateral blindness, 14 had active cytomegalovirus retinitis, accounting for 19% of all patients with bilateral blindness. Conclusion: The most common causes of blindness and low vision in a tertiary center in northern Thailand were age-related ocular disorders and infections, which were predominantly cases of cytomegalovirus retinitis in human immunodeficiency virus–infected patients. Retinal and/or uveal disorders were major causes of blindness in a tertiary center in Thailand, while cataract was the main cause of low vision. Specifically, bilateral blindness was caused by cytomegalovirus retinitis in 19% of cases. Most disorders were considered either preventable or reversible.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.iae.0000249575.38830.45", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977772822", "source": "openalex"}

Half (50%) of responses were obtained from doctors belonging to 31-40 years' age group. Two hundred and thirty (35%) of the ophthalmologists had height ranging from 161 to 170 cm and 443 (68%) had weight ranging from 51 to 75 kg. Four hundred and eighty-one (73.8%) of the respondents had <15 years of ophthalmic experience. Cataract (346; 53.1%) and general ophthalmology (342; 52.5%) were commonly practised by the ophthalmologists. Time spent in the outpatient department (OPD) was 39.37 ± 16.32 h/week and in the operating theater 13.64 ± 9.89 h/week, respectively. Self-reported prevalence of back pain was 70.5%. Fully 49% of respondents had low back pain, followed by neck pain (33%) and upper extremity symptoms (16%). Age <50 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4485), female gender (OR = 2.0265), long working hours in OPD (OR = 1.6524), and performing retinal lasers and indirect ophthalmoscopy (OR = 3.3251) showed positive association with back pain. The intolerable back pain was noted in <7% of the respondents.

Diagnostic considerations and therapeutic options for individual diseases are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Paraneoplastic syndromes can affect the afferent and efferent visual systems. Paraneoplastic syndromes may result in reduced visual acuity from retinal degeneration, alterations in melanocyte proliferation and uveal thickening, or acquired nystagmus. Ocular motor abnormalities related to paraneoplastic syndromes may present with symptoms from opsoclonus or from neuromuscular junction disease. Diagnosis remains challenging, but serologic identification of some specific antibodies may be helpful or confirmatory. Treatment, in addition to directed therapies against the underlying cancer, often requires systemic corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or immunosuppression, but some specific syndromes improve with use of targeted pharmacologic therapy.

Three types of side effects may develop. Corneal deposits and neuromuscular-associated blurred vision are always reversible and therefore benign. Visual loss has occurred in patients with retinopathy. Retinopathy may be divided into true retinopathy and premaculopathy. It is true retinopathy that may be associated with visual loss, while premaculopathy consists of subtle visual field and funduscopic abnormalities. These premaculopathic changes are generally completely reversible with drug discontinuation and have not been shown to progress. Hydroxychloroquine appears safer than chloroquine when currently accepted equivalent doses are’ used. Fewer than 20 patients with true retinopathy caused by hydroxychloroquine have been reported; more patients have developed true retinopathy when taking chloroquine. The safety profile is most dependent on low daily dose and regular ophthalmologic monitoring. The optimal strategy of ophthalmologic testing has not yet been determined, but visual acuity, funduscopic examination and visual field examination should be monitored. Self-administered ophthalmologic testing with Amsler grids may contribute additional safety but is not a replacement for physician testing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0961203393002001051", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3083763809", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, population-based follow-up study (Extremely Preterm Infants in Sweden Study [EXPRESS]) was conducted in Sweden. The population included extremely preterm infants (<27 weeks' gestation) born in Sweden between 2004 and 2007, of whom 491 survived until age 2.5 years. Screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was performed in the neonatal period. At 30 months' corrected age, an ophthalmologic assessment was performed in 411 of 491 children (83.7%).Visual acuity, manifest strabismus, and refractive errors were evaluated.Visual impairment was identified in 3.1% of the children, and 1.0% were blind. Refractive errors, defined as myopia less than -3 diopters (D), hypermetropia greater than +3 D, astigmatism 2 D or more, and/or anisometropia 2 D or more, were found in 25.6% of the children, and 14.1% had manifest strabismus. There were significant associations between visual impairment and treated ROP (P = .02), cognitive disability (P < .001), and birth weight (P = .02). Multiple regression analyses revealed significant associations between strabismus and treated ROP (P < .001), cognitive disability (P < .01), and cerebral palsy (P = .02). Refractive errors were significantly correlated with severity of ROP (right eye, P < .001; left eye, P < .01).

We questioned the appropriateness of Laplace's Law for computing wall stress in the eye considering the advances in knowledge of ocular biomechanics. Methods: In this manuscript we recapitulate the formulation of Laplace's Law, as well as common interpretations and uses in ophthalmology. Using numerical modeling, we study how Laplace's Law cannot account for important characteristics of the eye, such as variations in globe shape and size or tissue thickness, anisotropy, viscoelasticity, or that the eye is a living, dynamic organ. Results: We show that accounting for various geometrical and material factors, excluded from Laplace's Law, can alter estimates of corneoscleral wall stress as much as 456% and, therefore, that Laplace's Law is unreliable. Conclusions: We conclude by illustrating how computational techniques, such as finite element modeling, can account for the factors mentioned above, and are thus more suitable tools to provide quantitative characterization of corneoscleral biomechanics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.15-18053", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2258125483", "source": "openalex"}

The onset of primary SS (pSS) may remain misunderstood for several years. It usually presents with different types of severity, e.g., dry eye and dry mouth symptoms, due to early involvement of the lacrimal and salivary glands, which may be associated with parotid enlargement and dry eye; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is its most common ocular manifestation. It is still doubtful if the extent ocular surface manifestations are secondary to lacrimal or meibomian gland involvement or to the targeting of corneal and conjunctival autoantigens. SS is the most representative cause of aqueous deficient dry eye, and the primary role of the inflammatory process was evidenced. Recent scientific progress in understanding the numerous factors involved in the pathogenesis of pSS was registered, but the exact mechanisms involved still need to be clarified. The unquestionable role of both the innate and adaptive immune system, participating actively in the induction and evolution of the disease, was recognized. The ocular surface inflammation is a central mechanism in pSS leading to the decrease of lacrimal secretion and keratoconjunctival alterations. However, there are controversies about whether the ocular surface involvement is a direct autoimmune target or secondary to the inflammatory process in the lacrimal gland. In this review, we aimed to present actual knowledge relative to the pathogenesis of the pSS, considering the role of innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and genetics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12030365", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3135830949", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty consecutive patients attending a primary eye-care facility in Singapore (the Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic, AMKP) with the symptom of chronic blurred vision were recruited. An ophthalmic technician was trained to perform Snellen acuity; auto-refraction; intraocular pressure measurement; red-colour perimetry; video recordings of extraocular movement, cover tests and pupillary reactions; and anterior segment and fundus photography. Digital information was transmitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore (the Tan Tock Seng Hospital) via a tele-ophthalmology system for teleconsultation with an ophthalmologist. The diagnoses were compared with face-to-face consultation by another ophthalmologist at the AMKP. A user experience questionnaire was administered at the end of the consultation. Using face-to-face consultation as the gold standard, tele-ophthalmology achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing media opacity (n = 29), maculopathy (n = 23) and keratopathy (n = 30) of any type; and 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity in diagnosing optic neuropathy of any type (n = 24). The majority of the patients (97%) were satisfied with the tele-ophthalmology workflow and consultation. The tele-ophthalmology system was able to detect causes of chronic blurred vision accurately.

AI tools, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs), are progressively involved in detecting and customized control of ophthalmic diseases. The studies that refer to the efficiency of AI in medicine and especially in ophthalmology were analyzed in this review. Materials and Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review in order to collect all accounts published between 2015 and 2022 that refer to these applications of AI in medicine and especially in ophthalmology. Neural networks have a major role in establishing the demand to initiate preliminary anti-glaucoma therapy to stop the advance of the disease. Results: Different surveys in the literature review show the remarkable benefit of these AI tools in ophthalmology in evaluating the visual field, optic nerve, and retinal nerve fiber layer, thus ensuring a higher precision in detecting advances in glaucoma and retinal shifts in diabetes. We thus identified 1762 applications of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology: review articles and research articles (301 pub med, 144 scopus, 445 web of science, 872 science direct). Of these, we analyzed 70 articles and review papers (diabetic retinopathy (N = 24), glaucoma (N = 24), DMLV (N = 15), other pathologies (N = 7)) after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusion: In medicine, AI tools are used in surgery, radiology, gynecology, oncology, etc., in making a diagnosis, predicting the evolution of a disease, and assessing the prognosis in patients with oncological pathologies. In ophthalmology, AI potentially increases the patient’s access to screening/clinical diagnosis and decreases healthcare costs, mainly when there is a high risk of disease or communities face financial shortages. AI/DL (deep learning) algorithms using both OCT and FO images will change image analysis techniques and methodologies.

A special emphasis was placed on screening for Usher's syndrome. Methods: From 1980-1990, a prospective twocenter visual screening program of 231 deaf students in schools throughout Oregon was conducted using an ophthalmic questionnaire, complete eye examinations, and electroretinography. Students were between the ages of 10 and 21 years and participated on a volunteer basis. Findings for etiology and severity of visual loss and the scope of ophthalmologic surveillance within this population were analyzed. Results: Two hundred seventeen of the 231 students examined received electroretinograms. Significant ocular pathology was found in 1 1 1 (48%) of the students. The most common diagnoses were congenital rubella (21%), significant uncorrected ametropia (16%), and ocular hypertension (9%). Five students were diagnosed with Usher's syndrome. Of the students with significant ocular pathology, only 37% were actively followed by an ophthalmologist. Conclusion: Deaf students in Oregon's schools had a high frequency of eye disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of eye disease in this population could benefit the quality of life of these students.

Any small compendium of ophthalmology, especially one that is 607 pages long, weighs less than a kilogram, and has hundreds of photographs and diagrams, implicitly suggests that it could be an invaluable reference in your practice. Any book that pretends to be this comprehensive should be more than a guide and reference for medical and optometry students and primary care providers. Such a textbook must be current and must offer eye care specialists of every variety advice and immediate help with complex eye disorders. With this in mind, I went to my pediatric ophthalmology practice carrying G.K. Lang's Ophthalmology Textbook Atlas to see if it would be useful to me. This was a test drive of a very ambitious, comprehensive textbook. As a preface to my evaluation of the utility of this text, let me mention that I have a pediatric subspecialty practice and that, throughout the day, I see very complex problems. I also evaluate children with more routine sorts of problems and disorders. I was skeptical that this book would be of any use to me. Could I benefit from a book that covers every conceivable type of eye disorder? Would a text that covers pathology and pathogenesis of eye disorders be of any use to me? My first patient of the day wanted contact lenses for myopia. Since I don't fit children for contact lenses, I advised the family that they would need to see a specialist who can do this. Questions arose as to benefits and risks of contacts. I consulted Lang's text. The text is full of useful information about material used for contacts, and special indications. I wish I could have photocopied the contact lens chapter and given it to the family. Next came a patient with a history of retinopathy of prematurity. In several sentences, Lang reviewed the subject and told me everything I would need to know to care for this patient. A very high quality photograph shows stage 3 in an infant. If you have never seen the condition in the nursery, this text would offer you a rich review of the condition. As is so often the case, a patient's parent asked me about her own mother, and her macular degeneration problem. Here I am on relatively unfamiliar ground in my practice. Lang was enormously beneficial to me. Not only did I read about the pathogenesis of the condition, but I also reviewed pictures of macular degeneration and its treatment. The text includes valuable information about the epidemiology of this and other disorders. Next came some significant challenges for the book. In my pediatric practice, I am not able to take advantage of diagnostic tools such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), yet I want to learn more about this and other new innovations used to diagnose eye disorders. Back to Lang I went. Surprise¡ The book has brilliant OCT pictures, correlated with clinical examples. OK. Now it was time for a real subspecialty challenge. A patient came to my practice with one iris brown and the other blue (heterochromia). What could cause this, and would there be any reason for concern or follow-up? Lang's text was accurate, brief (!), and authoritative. This text would get you through your practice and would prevent you from missing important problems or making mistakes. Lang passed the subspecialty and comprehensive eye care test. Now it was time for resident and medical student trial runs. And Lang flourished in this setting as well. Can my medical student diagnose angle closure glaucoma without benefit of and access to specialized equipment? Consult Lang and learn that the answer is “yes,” and also how to make the measurement. Can my students identify bitemporal hemianopia, and how? Lang answers the question and identifies “how.” What are the layers of the retina? Consult Lang. And so on. Suffice it to say, that Lang's text now resides in my brief case, where I am very pleased to have immediate access to a compendium of useful information. The preface to Lang's text offers biographical information about Professor Lang. His career has been devoted to educating students and practicing physicians about ophthalmic disorders. This text shows the nobility of such a career path. He has succeeded beyond all expectations. Lang's Ophthalmology Textbook Atlas is recommended to anyone interested in eye disorders, be they subspecialist or novice student. William V.

This was improved by establishing an image-based reference standard defined as the majority diagnosis given by three readers (13% discrepancies with image readers). It was further improved by establishing an overall reference standard that incorporated the clinical diagnosis (10% discrepancies with image readers). These principles of establishing reference standards may be applied to improve robustness of real-world systems supporting image-based diagnosis.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2425036628", "source": "openalex"}

The authors explored the ophthalmologic outcomes following fronto-orbital advancement (FOA). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Included studies reported postoperative rates of strabismus, astigmatism, and/or amblyopia. Two independent reviewers performed screening and extracted data including preoperative rates, laterality and severity of findings, need for ocular surgery, and timing of FOA. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Methodologic Index for Non-Randomized Studies scale and American Society of Plastic Surgeons Evidence Rating Scale for Therapeutic Studies. A total of 231 abstracts were screened. Sixteen articles were eligible for qualitative synthesis including 13 case series and 3 retrospective comparative studies. Nine studies contained both preoperative and postoperative data, but for strabismus only. Postoperative prevalence of strabismus was 19% to 100%. Rates increased in 4 studies and decreased in 3. Incidences of new and resolved cases of strabismus were 0% to 60% and 0% to 33%, respectively. Twenty-five percent to 100% of patients required strabismus surgery. Postoperative rates of astigmatism were 15% to 92%. Fourteen percent to 41% had clinically significant anisometropia, predisposing to amblyopia. The postoperative prevalence of amblyopia was 3% to 56%. In summary, FOA does not appear to reduce rates of strabismus, astigmatism, or amblyopia. In addition, surgery carries the risk of iatrogenic strabismus.

Congenital toxoplasmosis may lead to severe visual impairment or neurological sequelae in the child. Purpose: To study the severity of the primary and late ophthalmological dysfunction during a prospective incidence study of congenital toxoplasmosis in the Stockholm and Skåne counties. Methods: Blood collected on phenylketonuria (PKU) cards from 40 978 consecutively born children were investigated for antitoxoplasma antibodies. Children with verified congenital toxoplasmosis were treated for 12 months with antiparasitic therapy and followed ophthalmologically, neurologically and serologically every third month. Results: Three children had congenital toxoplasmosis. Two of these were asymptomatic at birth and would have escaped early detection without screening. One child had unilateral severe visual impairment and CNS involvement. The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis was less than 1:10 000. Conclusion: Neonatal screening is of importance to diagnose asymptomatic infected children with congenital toxoplasmosis as treatment has been shown to reduce long‐term sequelae.

Methods The randomized controlled study included 1276 consecutive patients admitted to the Institute of Ophthalmology of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia for cataract surgery. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: 638 were assigned not to undergo preoperative evaluation based on routine medical tests and electrocardiograms; the other 638 underwent preoperative evaluation based on said tests. Ophthalmologic and systemic complications were assessed intraoperatively and 1 month after surgery. Results Eleven intraoperative complications occurred in the group without preoperative tests and eight in the group with preoperative tests; at 1 month six complications were recorded in the group without tests and five in the group with tests. Systemic adverse events occurred intraoperatively in four patients, whereas no systemic adverse event was recorded at 1 month in either group.

Design Observational case series with prospective data collection. Participants Children from the Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) with birth weights less than 1251 g served as subjects. Group A included 257 children from all 23 CRYO-ROP study centers who had threshold ROP, who had participated in the randomized trial of cryotherapy, and who had survived to age 1 year. Group B included 1208 children from 5 of the 23 study centers who had varying severity of ROP (69 had threshold ROP) and who had participated in a 5-year study of the natural history of ROP. Main outcome measures Investigators documented medical and surgical ophthalmologic interventions through age 5 years as well as cerebrospinal fluid shunting surgery for hydrocephalus through age 2 years. Results Group A was composed of 257 children with threshold ROP who underwent 226 ocular interventions in addition to cryotherapy (0.9 intervention per child). The most common treatments performed on the randomized cohort of children were vitrectomy (26% of patients), lensectomy (18%), amblyopia therapy (20%), and strabismus surgery (10%). Cataract surgery not associated with vitrectomy was performed infrequently (2%) and was performed equally often in treated and control eyes. Amblyopia therapy was prescribed as often for treated as for control eyes. Cerebrospinal fluid shunts were placed in 11% of these children. Group B was composed of 1208 natural history patients who underwent 239 ophthalmologic interventions (0.4 intervention per child).

Behçet's disease is the most frequent entity in endogenous uveitis in Japan. Patients are found throughout the country, and the prevalence rate averages seven to eight per 100,000 population: the rate is higher in the northern than in the southern districts. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a combination of clinical symptoms that are divided into the major and minor criteria symptoms. The major criteria comprise the ocular involvement, aphthous ulcers of the oral mucous membrane, genital ulcers, and skin lesions. These symptoms recur often as attacks and the disease follows a chronic course. The ocular involvement is found in 83% to 95% in males and 67% to 73% in females; the male to female ratio in the number of patients is 1.78. Both into the anterior segment type and the fundus and panophthalmic types. The anterior segment type shows serous iridocyclitis with the classic type of hypopyon appearing in about 12% of the attacks. This type is found in about 20%, more often in females than in males, and the visual prognosis is more favorable than in the fundus and panophthalmic types. In the latter two types, attacks of retinal angitis resulting in intensive retinal edema, yellowish-white exudate, and hemorrhages recur particularly in the macular region, and the visual prognosis is poor. More than 50% of male patients lose visual acuity to less than 0.1 in five years, but this is the case in only 10% of female patients. Consequently, Behçet's disease is the cause of blindness in about 12% of acquired blindness in adults. The ocular histopathology during the attack is characterized by severe angitis with intensive infiltration of neutrophil leucocytes largely in the uveal tract and the retina; the latter is severely affected and loss of visual cells and other neural elements results. The etiology of this disease still remains unknown but genetic predisposition is suggested since this disease is strongly linked with HL-A-B5. Environmental factors are also considered. Various abnormalities are found in the blood chemistry, blood cells (particularly in neutrophil leucocytes), immunologic mechanism, fibrinolytic and blood clotting system, and hormonal system. Chemotractic factors are found in the aqueous humor. These changes are particulary enhanced just before and during the ocular attacks. Systemic corticosteroids are deleterious to the visual prognosis, but cyclophosphamide and colchicine appear to suppress attacks and help patients maintain the visual acuity. However, these drugs are toxic, particulary to the reproductive organs, and the patients must be informed of this side effect and be allowed to make a decision before they are used.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1510146729", "source": "openalex"}

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) are summaries of the best available evidence to address a specific research question via comprehensively literature search, in-depth analysis and synthesis of results. To date, there have been several studies summarizing the publication trends of SRMAs in research specialties, however, none has conducted specifically in ophthalmology. The purpose of this study is to establish the scientometric landscape of SRMAs published in the field of ophthalmology over time. Methods We retrieved relevant ophthalmological SRMAs and the corresponding bibliometric parameters during 2000 to 2020 from Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analysis was performed using bibliometrix package. Pre-registration and guideline compliance of each article was independently assessed by two investigators. Results A total of 2,660 SRMAs were included, and the average annual growth rate was 21.26%. China and the United States were the most productive countries, while Singapore was the country with the highest average citations per document. Wong TY was not only the most productive, but also the most frequently cited author. The most productive affiliation was National University of Singapore ( n = 236). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses output in most subspecialties had steadily increased with retina/vitreous ( n = 986), glaucoma ( n = 411) and cornea/external diseases ( n = 303) constantly as the most dominant fields. Rates of pre-registration and guideline compliance had dramatically increased over time, with 20.0 and 63.5% of article being pre-registered and reported guideline in 2020, respectively. However, SRMAs published on ophthalmology journals tended to be less frequently pre-registered and guideline complied than those on non-ophthalmology journals (both p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion The annual output of SRMAs has been rapidly increasing over the past two decades. China and the United States were the most productive countries, whereas Singapore has the most prolific and influential scholar and institution. Raising awareness and implementation of SRMAs pre-registration and guideline compliance is still necessary to ensure quality, especially for ophthalmology journals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2023.1135592", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4322773319", "source": "openalex"}

The subjects had anomalies associated with an early gestational effect of thalidomide, including facial nerve palsy and incomitant strabismus. Because autism has been observed in a few cases of Möbius sequence (Möbius syndrome), a condition characterized by involvement of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves, the similarity to early thalidomide embryopathy suggested a relation between cranial nerve involvement and autism. The present study was undertaken to further evaluate the association of autism with patients manifesting findings of Möbius syndrome.A prospective study of 25 Swedish patients with Möbius sequence was conducted. The patients had a complete multidisciplinary evaluation, including ophthalmologic and psychiatric examinations and standard testing for autism. Findings associated with autism were compared with the ocular and systemic anomalies of the 4 thalidomide-affected subjects.In the Möbius group 6 patients had autism, achieving the criteria for autism according to all the diagnostic manuals that were used. One patient showed autistic-like conditions meeting fewer numbers of the criteria. A few were too young to be meeting evaluated. Incomitant strabismus ranging from primary abduction defects alone to a horizontal gaze paresis pattern was noted in these patients, in addition to characteristic findings of seventh nerve paresis. Aberrant lacrimation was observed in many cases, especially often associated with autism.The common group of anomalies noted in both cases of thalidomide embryopathy and Möbius sequence suggests that brain-stem damage probably early in embryogenesis can sometimes be associated with autism.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W178889822", "source": "openalex"}

As there is continuous change in the popularity of these techniques, an estimate of current anaesthetic practices for cataract surgery around the world was derived. This allows comparison of techniques and practices internationally and may serve as a baseline for future surveys. Methods: At the 2002 Congress of the International Council of Ophthalmology held in Sydney, Australia, ophthalmic surgeons from around the world were surveyed with regard to their anaesthetic techniques for cataract surgery. Results: It was found that almost all cataract surgery was performed using regional anaesthesia. Surgeons performed just over half of the anaesthetics; however, in some countries anaesthetists performed the vast majority of eye anaesthetics. The most frequently employed technique was the peribulbar block, but a substantial minority were performed under topical anaesthesia. An anaesthesia‐trained person monitored most patients during cataract surgery, and the most commonly used local anaesthetic was lignocaine. Conclusion: Although there is a single most frequent practice in the type of regional block employed for cataract surgery among the delegates, and general anaesthesia is seldom used, individual countries have very different results regarding the anaesthetic used and the role of the anaesthetist.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9071.2005.01063.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156964849", "source": "openalex"}

In particular, in the last 5 years polymeric nanomicelles have been increasingly investigated to overcome some of the important challenges of the topical treatment of ocular diseases.The aim of this review was to gather up-to-date information on the different roles that polymeric micelles (commonly in the nanosize scale) can play in ocular delivery. Thus, after a general description of ocular barriers and micelles features, the attention is focused on those properties that are relevant for ophthalmic application. Finally, their efficacy in improving the ocular delivery of different classes of therapeutics (anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, antiglaucoma, antifungal, and antiviral drugs) are reported.Although still a few, in vivo experiments have clearly demonstrated the capability of polymeric nanomicelles to overcome a variety of hurdles associated to ocular therapy, notably increasing drug bioavailability.

Our objective was to determine the most common causes of eye pain in 2 ophthalmology and neurology departments at academic medical centers. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis and chart review at the departments of ophthalmology and neurology at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ), University of Zürich, Switzerland, and the University of Utah (UU), USA. Data were analyzed from January 2012 to December 2013. We included patients aged 18 years or older presenting with eye pain as a major complaint. Results: Two thousand six hundred three patient charts met inclusion criteria; 742 were included from USZ and 1,861 were included from UU. Of these, 2,407 had been seen in an ophthalmology clinic and 196 had been seen in a neurology clinic. Inflammatory eye disease (conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, uveitis, dry eye, chalazion, and scleritis) was the underlying cause of eye pain in 1,801 (69.1%) of all patients analyzed. Although only 71 (3%) of 2,407 patients had migraine diagnosed in an ophthalmology clinic as the cause of eye pain, migraine was the predominant cause of eye pain in the neurology clinics (100/196; 51%). Other causes of eye pain in the neurology clinics included optic neuritis (44 patients), trigeminal neuralgia, and other cranial nerve disorders (8 patients). Conclusions: Eye pain may be associated with a number of different causes, some benign and others sight- or life-threatening. Because patients with eye pain may present to either a neurology or an ophthalmology clinic and because the causes of eye pain may be primarily ophthalmic or neurologic, the diagnosis and management of these patients often requires collaboration and consultation between the 2 specialties.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000601", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2784203585", "source": "openalex"}

This study was planned to assess visual morbidity in patients of IIH in terms of clinical and neuro-ophthalmo- logical parameters. In this prospective study of 40 patients of IIH, neuro-ophthalmological parameters were noted in the form of visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer thickness, and visual evoked potential. Visual outcome was defined in using specific criteria. Final visual outcome of patients was compared with clinical and neuro-ophthalmologic para- meters to determine any correlation. The most common presenting clinical symptoms were headache (85%) and Transient visual obscurations (TVOs) (52.5%). In univariate analysis severity of visual loss, Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) pressures and abnormal Visual evoked potential (VEP) were associated with worse visual outcome or need of aggressive management. When adjusted for severity of visual loss no independent clinical/neuroophthalmic predictor could be established. High CSF opening pressure, worsening vision/papilledema, greater Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness and abnormal VEPs may be some of the alarming signs for physicians, but none of these parameters can be used as an independent predictor for visual outcome in isolation. Visual loss at presentation is probably the most important predictor of the final visual outcome in these patients. This may also suggest that patients presenting in an advanced disease course (with worse visual status) fair badly despite best medical/surgical management. Early diagnosis and prompt management is the cornerstone of management.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01658107.2017.1400570", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2783918425", "source": "openalex"}

It is used regularly in certain medical disciplines, but its use has not been established for ophthalmology to our knowledge. <h3>Objective</h3> To explore the feasibility of providing immersive simulation human factors training for ophthalmic surgical teams. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Prospective scenario-based simulation and concept description at University College London Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, England, from December 12, 2013, to March 13, 2014. At both sites, fully immersive simulated operating theater environments were used, comprising live interactive communication with patients and theater staff, full anesthetic and operating facilities, replicated patient notes, active vital signs, and the ability to contact surgical or anesthetic teams outside of the theater via telephone. Participants were consultant (attending) and trainee ophthalmic surgeons and anesthetists, operating department assistants and practitioners, and ophthalmic nursing staff. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The following 4 previously validated rating tools for nontechnical skills were applied to a replicated series of scenarios based on actual patient safety incidents at Moorfields Eye Hospital and in the literature: Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery (OTAS), Non-Technical Skills Scale (NOTECHS), Anesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS), and Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient was calculated for each pair of scoring tools. Intertool and interassessor reliability was established. Interassessor consistency was compared by calculating a normalized standard deviation of scores for each tool across all assessors. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty simulation scenarios, including wrong intraocular lens implantation, wrong eye operation, wrong drug administration, and wrong patient, were provided. The intertool correlations were 0.732 (95% CI, 0.271-0.919;<i>P</i> = .01) for NOTECHS vs ANTS, 0.922 (95% CI, 0.814-0.968;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) for NOTSS vs ANTS, 0.850 (95% CI, 0.475-0.964;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) for OTAS vs ANTS, 0.812 (95% CI, 0.153-0.971;<i>P</i> = .03) for OTAS vs NOTECHS, 0.716 (95% CI, −0.079 to 0.955;<i>P</i> = .07) for OTAS vs NOTSS, and 0.516 (95% CI, −0.020 to 0.822;<i>P</i> = .06) for NOTECHS vs NOTSS. The normalized standard deviations of scores obtained using each tool across all assessors were 0.024 (95% CI, 0.014-0.091) for NOTSS, 0.060 (95% CI, 0.034-0.225) for OTAS, 0.068 (95% CI, 0.041-0.194) for ANTS, and 0.072 (95% CI, 0.043-0.206) for NOTECHS. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study describes the feasibility of a high-fidelity immersive simulation course specifically for ophthalmic surgical teams. The ANTS and NOTSS had the highest intertool and interrater consistency, respectively. Human factors simulation in ophthalmology offers a new method of teaching team members, with the potential to reduce serious ophthalmic patient safety events.

The aim of this study was to assess the health related quality of life (HRQOL) in people who had ophthalmologic complications due to the sulfur mustard gas exposure during the war. Methods The Veterans and Martyrs Affair Foundation (VMAF) database indicated that there were 196 patients with severe ophthalmologic complications due to chemical weapons exposure. Of these, those who gave consent (n = 147) entered into the study. Quality of life was measured using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and scores were compared to those of the general public. In addition logistic regression analysis was performed to indicate variables that contribute to physical and mental health related quality of life. Results The mean age of the patients was 44.8 (SD = 8.7) ranging from 21 to 75 years. About one-third of the cases (n= 50) reported exposure to chemical weapons more than once. The mean exposure duration to sulfur mustard gas was 21.6 years (SD = 1.2). The lowest scores on the SF-36 subscales were found to be: the role physical and the general health. Quality of life in chemical warfare victims who had ophthalmologic problems was significantly lower than the general public (P &lt; 0.001). The results obtained from logistic regression analysis indicated that those who did not participate in sport activities suffer from a poorer physical health (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.36 to 6.30, P = 0.006). The analysis also showed that poor mental health was associated with longer time since exposure (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.39, P = 0.03) and lower education (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.21 to 7.56, P = 0.01). Conclusion The study findings suggest that chemical warfare victims with ophthalmologic complications suffer from poor health related quality of life. It seems that the need for provision of health and support for this population is urgent. In addition, further research is necessary to measure health related quality of life in victims with different types of disabilities in order to support and enhance quality of life among this population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7525-7-2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146528022", "source": "openalex"}

However, for most parameters, the range of variation found in normal children remains poorly defined. Methods: We have determined the range of normal function for a number of commonly measured ophthalmological variables in 162 children, classified normal by Gold Standard ophthalmological examination. This group is representative of almost 12 000 normal children aged 41/2 to 5V2 in Nova Scotia. Results: In 56.8% of eyes the visual acuity was 6/4.5. The use of a chart with crowding bars was more discriminating between differences in higher levels of acuity and highlighted differences in acuity between the two eyes. Randot stereoacuity showed a uniform, non-Gaussian distribution of scores. Cycloplegic refractive errors were distributed about a modal value of between +0.5 and +1.0 diopter. Forty percent of eyes had no detectable astigmatism. Ninety-seven percent of subjects had no heterophoria. Fusional vergence data are presented.

Although a number of developments have occurred in the last decade (e.g., the open access (OA) movement and the website Sci-Hub), everyone agrees that these difficulties still persist very widely, mainly due to the fact that paywalls still limit access to approximately 75% of scholarly documents. In this study, we compare the accessibility of recent full text articles in the field of ophthalmology in 27 established institutions located worldwide. Methods A total of 200 references from articles were retrieved using the PubMed database. Each article was individually checked for OA. Full texts of non-OA (i.e., “paywalled articles”) were examined to determine whether they were available using institutional and Hinari access in each institution studied, using “alternative ways” (i.e., PubMed Central, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and Online Reprint Request), and using the website Sci-Hub. Results The number of full texts of “paywalled articles” available using institutional and Hinari access showed strong heterogeneity, scattered between 0% full texts to 94.8% (mean = 46.8%; SD = 31.5; median = 51.3%). We found that complementary use of “alternative ways” and Sci-Hub leads to 95.5% of full text “paywalled articles,” and also divides by 14 the average extra costs needed to obtain all full texts on publishers’ websites using pay-per-view. Conclusions The scant number of available full text “paywalled articles” in most institutions studied encourages researchers in the field of ophthalmology to use Sci-Hub to search for scientific information. The scientific community and decision-makers must unite and strengthen their efforts to find solutions to improve access to scientific literature worldwide and avoid an implosion of the scientific publishing model. This study is not an endorsement for using Sci-Hub.

They can regulate protein formation through several different mechanisms. Similarly, circular RNAs are reported to play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Changes in the expression pattern of these molecules are known to underlie various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological and immunological disorders (Rinn &amp; Chang, 2012; Sun &amp; Kraus, 2015). Recent studies suggest that they are differentially expressed both in healthy ocular tissues as well as in eye pathologies, such as neovascularization, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, ocular malignancy or even strabismus (Li et al., 2016). Aetiology of ocular diseases is multifactorial and combines genetic and environmental factors, including epigenetic and non-coding RNAs. In addition, disorders like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration lack biomarkers for early detection as well as effective treatment methods that would allow controlling the disease progression at its early stages. The newly discovered non-coding RNAs seem to be the ideal candidates for novel molecular markers and therapeutic strategies.

The mechanical properties of some ocular tissues, such as lamina cribrosa (LC) in the optic nerve head, are believed to play a pivotal role in eye pathogenesis.A novel etching technology was used to fabricate silicon-based lens for a 500-MHz transducer. The transducer was tested in a custom-designed scanning system on human eyes. Two-dimensional (2-D) maps of bulk modulus (K) and mass density (ρ) were derived using improved versions of current state-of-the-art signal processing approaches.The transducer employed a lens radius of 125 μm and had a center frequency of 479 MHz with a -6-dB bandwidth of 264 MHz and a lateral resolution of 4 μm. The LC, Bruch's membrane (BM) at the interface of the retina and choroid, and Bowman's layer (BL) at the interface of the corneal epithelium and stroma, were successfully imaged and resolved. Analysis of the 2-D parameter maps revealed average values of LC, BM, and BL with KLC = 2.81 ±0.17; GPa, KBM = 2.89 ±0.18; GPa, KBL = 2.6 ±0.09 ; GPa, ρ LC = 0.96 ±0.03 g/cm3; ρ BM = 0.97 ±0.04 g/cm3; ρ BL = 0.98 ±0.04 g/cm3.This novel SAM was shown to be capable of measuring mechanical properties of soft biological tissues at microscopic resolution; it is currently the only system that allows simultaneous measurement of K, ρ, and attenuation in large lateral scales (field area >9 mm2) and at fine resolutions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2016.2573682", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2406158094", "source": "openalex"}

However, blindness from vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) is a persistent problem. This study examined the extent of patients' adherence to postscreening recommendations.A retrospective record review was conducted in primary care clinics of a large county hospital in the USA. All patients with diabetes detected with VTDR in two time periods, differing in record type used, were included in the study: 2012-2014, paper charts only; 2015-2017, combined paper charts/electronic medical records (EMRs), or EMRs only. Adherence rates for keeping initial ophthalmology appointments, starting recommended treatments, and keeping follow-up appointments were determined.Adequate records were available for 6046 patients; 408 (7%) were detected with VTDR and recommended for referral to ophthalmology. Only 5% completed a first ophthalmology appointment within recommended referral interval, 15% within twice the recommended interval, and 51% within 1 year of DRS. Patients screened in 2015-2017 were more likely to complete a first ophthalmology appointment than those in 2012-2014. Ophthalmic treatment was recommended in half of the patients, of whom 94% initiated treatment. A smaller percentage (41%) adhered completely to post-treatment follow-up. Overall, 28% of referred patients: (1) kept a first ophthalmology appointment; (2) were recommended for treatment; and (3) initiated the treatment. Most patients failing to keep first ophthalmology appointments continued non-ophthalmic medical care at the institution. EMRs provided more complete information than paper charts.Reducing vision impairment from VTDR requires greater emphasis on timely adherence to ophthalmology referral and follow-up. Prevention of visual loss from VTDR starts with retinopathy screening, but must include patient engagement, adherence monitoring, and streamlining ophthalmic referral and management. Revision of these processes has already been implemented at the study site, incorporating lessons from this investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2019-001154", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3036885589", "source": "openalex"}

Eleven patients were available for follow-up monitoring. The degree of ONP was recorded at admission, at discharge, after 3 months, and at yearly intervals thereafter. The size of the aneurysm, the duration of ONP before coiling, the degree of coiling, age, and the presence of other microvascular risk factors were correlated with the degree of nerve recovery.Complete resolution of ONP did not occur in any of the 11 cases in this series. However, residual oculomotor nerve deficits did not cause diplopia with primary gaze for 10 of 11 patients. Clinically significant ptosis did not persist for any of the patients. The pupil remained minimally affected in all cases.Although mass effect remains after endovascular packing, oculomotor nerve dysfunction improves comparably to the recovery observed after surgical clipping.

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scholar were searched from inception to October 30, 2022 to identify applications of GAN in ophthalmology. A total of 40 papers were included in this review. We cover various applications of GANs in ophthalmic-related imaging including optical coherence tomography, orbital magnetic resonance imaging, fundus photography, and ultrasound; however, we also highlight several challenges, that resulted in the generation of inaccurate and atypical results during certain iterations. Finally, we examine future directions and considerations for generative AI in ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.survophthal.2024.04.009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4396952102", "source": "openalex"}

This study was carried out to determine the microbiological profile of corneal ulcer cases diagnosed among patients visiting Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology (TIO), Nepal. A total of 101 corneal scrapping samples were tested for routine culture and antibiotic susceptibility at the pathology department of TIO Nepal from April to October 2014. Microorganisms were identified by using standard microbiological procedures following the manual of American Society for Microbiology (ASM) and their antibiotic susceptibility test, performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method in conformity with the CLSI guideline. Out of 101 samples analyzed, 44.6% (45/101) showed positive growth with bacterial isolates i.e., 56% (25/45), more prevalent than fungus i.e., 44% (20/45). Among bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (31.1%, N = 14) was isolated in highest number whereas Fusarium (13.4%, N = 6) was the most common fungus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the only Gram negative bacteria isolated from corneal ulcer cases. All bacterial isolates were found to be susceptible to the quinolone group of antibiotics (moxifloxacin followed by ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin). These findings showcase the current trend in the microbiological etiology of corneal ulcer in Nepal, which have important public health implications for the treatment as well as prevention of corneal ulceration in the developing world.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-016-0388-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2559425422", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we provide a detailed description of the ophthalmological findings in a well-defined cohort of patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy using state of the art retina imaging techniques. Thirty-three genetically confirmed patients (aged 7–80 years) and 24 unrelated healthy controls (aged 6–68 years) underwent clinical ophthalmological examination, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography/angiography, genotyping and neurological examination. All patients had normal corrected visual acuity and normal intraocular pressure. In 27 of the 33 patients, weakness of the orbicularis oculi was observed. Central retinal pathology, only seen in patients and not in healthy controls, included twisting (tortuosity) of the retinal arteries in 25 of the 33 patients and retinal pigment epithelium defects in 4 of the 33 patients. Asymmetrical foveal hypoplasia was present in three patients, and exudative abnormalities were observed in one patient. There was a correlation between the severity of retinal tortuosity and the D4Z4 repeat array size (R2 = 0.44, P &amp;lt; 0.005). Follow-up examination in a subgroup of six patients did not show any changes after 2 years. To conclude, retinal abnormalities were frequent but almost always subclinical in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and consisted primarily of arterial tortuosity and foveal abnormalities. Retinal tortuosity was seen in the retinal arterioles and correlated with the D4Z4 repeat array size, thereby providing clinical evidence for an underlying genetic linkage between the retina and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcz023", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2980115564", "source": "openalex"}

Papers reporting development and validation of questionnaire instruments for assessing patient-reported outcomes of an ophthalmic disorder in patients aged 2-18 years were included. Quality was assessed by examining the purpose and psychometric properties of the instruments. Strengths and limitations were summarised with recommendations regarding use.Search identified 17 instruments. Of these, 11 were condition-specific and six were intended for a broader population of children and young people with visual impairment regardless of the ophthalmic condition. Three were developed for use in a specific trial and two are still in development.Paediatric ophthalmology PROM development and application is a developing field and new instruments are needed. There is scope for improvement in this area through (a) clarity of definitions of the underlying constructs intended to be measured at the onset of development of new instruments, (b) application of child-centred approaches and (c) adherence to extant guidance and best practice in questionnaire instrument development.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-303350", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2161140705", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: A total of 950 children with normal development from the municipality of Roskilde, Denmark, were invited to participate in an ophthalmic cross-sectional population-based survey, of which 445 children in the age of 54-87 months participated with a complete ocular examination including cycloplegia. Visual acuity (VA) was tested using Kay Picture charts and notified in logMAR units. RESULTS: Mean distance VA was 0.010 logMAR [standard deviation (SD): 0.048] in right eye, and near VA in right eye was 0.012 logMAR (SD: 0.054), with a nonsignificant difference between right and left eye in both parameters (paired t-test, p = 0.15 and p = 0.08, respectively). Amblyopia was found in 12 children (2.7%), mainly related to refractive errors. The mean refractive error of right eye was +1.75 D, and significant hyperopia (greater than +3.0 D) was found in 7.9%. No myopia (greater than or equal to -0.5 D) was found, astigmatism (>1 D) was seen in 4.3%. Manifest strabismus was present in 1.6%, and heterophoria in 4.0%. Reduced or absent stereo acuity was present in 35 children (7.9%) and was related to a reduced VA, refractive error and strabismus. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic data of 445 normally developed children are presented, supplementing previous reported normative data in children. We found a relatively high prevalence of amblyopia and of hyperopia, while myopia was not found, confirming previous studies that myopia is not developing at early age in Danish children.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.13650", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2790907364", "source": "openalex"}

However, contemporary HCQ prescribing trends in the UK remain unknown.We examined a UK general population database to investigate HCQ dosing between 2007 and 2016. We studied trends of excess HCQ dosing per ophthalmology guidelines (defined by exceeding 6.5 mg/kg of IBW and 5.0 mg/kg of ABW) and determined their independent predictors using multivariable logistic regression analyses.Among 20,933 new HCQ users (78% female), the proportions of initial HCQ excess dosing declined from 40% to 36% using IBW and 38% to 30% using ABW, between 2007 and 2016. Among these, 47% of women were excess-dosed (multivariable OR 12.52; 95% CI 10.99-14.26) using IBW and 38% (multivariable OR 1.98; 95% CI,1.81-2.15) using ABW. Applying IBW, 37% of normal and 44% of obese patients were excess-dosed; however, applying ABW, 53% of normal and 10% of obese patients were excess-dosed (multivariable ORs = 1.61 and 0.1 (reference = normal); both p < 0.01). Long-term HCQ users showed similar excess dosing.A substantial proportion of HCQ users in the UK, particularly women, may have excess HCQ dosing per the previous or recent weight-based guidelines despite a modest decline in recent years. Over half of normal-BMI individuals were excess-dosed per the latest guidelines. This implies the potential need to reduce dosing for many patients but also calls for further research to establish unifying evidence-based safe and effective dosing strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-018-1634-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2832938734", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this review is to outline neuro-ophthalmologic findings that can help in diagnosis, treatment and determining prognosis in patients with movement disorders.Common movement disorders with ophthalmic symptoms include extrapyramidal disorders such as Parkinson disease-associated dry eye, decreased blink rate, and vergence dysfunction, and progressive supranuclear palsy-related lid retraction, frequent square-wave jerks and supranuclear gaze palsy. Multisystem atrophy can present with gaze-evoked horizontal or positional downbeat nystagmus and impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression. Genetic disorders such as Huntington disease produce increased saccadic latencies and impaired suppression of saccades to presented stimulus, whereas Wilson disease is associated with saccadic pursuits, increased antisaccade latencies and decreased pursuit gain. Whipple's disease can present with supranuclear gaze palsy and characteristic oculomasticatory myorrhythmia.Movement disorders commonly present with ocular features.

The current state of ophthalmic teaching in Australia is unknown. Background To evaluate the perceptions of junior medical officers (JMOs) and medical students on ophthalmology teaching in Australian medical schools. Design Survey‐based cross‐sectional study. Participants A total of 838 JMOs and medical students from across Australia. Methods Fifty‐six hospitals and 20 medical schools across Australia were contacted. Hardcopy and online surveys were distributed to participants at consenting institutions, evaluating the characteristics of ophthalmology teaching received during medical school and participant confidence in basic ophthalmological clinical skills and knowledge. Factor analysis was performed on confidence scores. Main outcome measures Likert scale confidence ratings, teaching methods encountered versus preferred. Results Four hundred and thirty‐two (51.6%) surveys were received from JMOs and 406 (48.4%) from medical students. The most common form of teaching received were lectures (71.3% JMOs, 65.5% medical students), while the most preferred type were hospital tutorials (37.7% JMOs, 61.6% medical students). Mean confidence in ophthalmology‐specific skills and knowledge topics were not high for medical students (skills: 2.66/5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.55–2.76; knowledge: 2.88/5, 95% CI = 2.80–2.96) and JMOs (skills: 2.52/5, 95% CI = 2.43–2.60; knowledge: 2.84/5, 95% CI = 2.77–2.91). Many participants voiced the need for more ophthalmology teaching, particularly clinically oriented opportunities. Conclusions and relevance JMOs and medical students do not show high levels of confidence in basic ophthalmological clinical skills and knowledge, and report inadequate emphasis on ophthalmology during medical school.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ceo.13342", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2809445533", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Eight syringes were analysed: from the USA, Terumo 0.5 mL, Becton-Dickinson (BD) Tuberculin 1 mL, BD Luer-lok 1 mL, BD Ultra-Fine 0.3 mL and Exel Insulin 0.3 mL; from Germany, Braun Omnifix-F 1 mL and Braun Injekt-F 1 mL and from Spain, BD Plastipak 1 mL. The impact of air, priming the plunger, agitation by flicking and fluid temperature on SO release were assessed by light microscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to identify the molecular compound in each syringe. Results Five hundred and sixty syringes were analysed. Terumo 0.5 mL and BD Ultra-Fine 0.3 mL released more SO than all others. BD Luer-lok 1 mL, BD Plastipak and Braun Omnifix-F 1 mL released little SO; BD Tuberculin 1 mL, Exel 0.3 mL and Braun Injekt-F 1 mL released the least SO. Priming the syringe and different temperatures did not significantly affect SO release. Agitation by flicking caused a significantly higher proportion of samples to have SO droplets and an increased number of oil droplets. Air had an additive effect on the release of oil in the agitation groups. FTIR identified polysiloxane in all syringes but Injekt-F. Conclusion Syringes commonly used for intravitreal injections frequently release SO droplets, especially when agitated by flicking. To avoid unnecessary ocular risks, syringes should not be agitated before intravitreal injection.

Trehalose is synthetized by many organisms when cells are exposed to stressful conditions, including dehydration, heat, oxidation, hypoxia or even anoxia. Although trehalose is not synthesized by mammalian cells, it has recently been demonstrated to have a number of important properties that indicate its utility in humans. Trehalose enables wound healing by protecting cells, especially cell membranes, from oxidative injury and dessication. When the injured cornea is treated with trehalose, corneal inflammation, scar formation and corneal neovascularization are suppressed. In dry eye disease, trehalose decreased cell apoptosis and reduced oxidative, inflammatory and proteolytic activity at the ocular surface. In UVB irradiated cornea, trehalose suppressed photodamage evoked by UVB rays. It decreased the intracorneal inflammation and reduced corneal neovascularization. Trehalose prevented postoperative fibrous scar formation after ocular surgery, such as glaucoma filtration surgery. The non-toxicity of trehalose allows its administration in humans for extended periods and enables its use in various disease states.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-082", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2913375288", "source": "openalex"}

At the present time, diagnostic tests in ophthalmology for both acquired and inherited diseases are being revolutionized by molecular technology. The molecular genetics of ocular disease is currently the subject of intense investigation using techniques of gene mapping and isolation. Rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis of eye diseases will advance the treatment of these conditions, including the potential for gene therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.1996.01100130453017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099340511", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3039807755", "title": "Tele-Neuro-Ophthalmology During the Age of COVID-19", "text": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rapidly and dramatically transform the daily lives of patients and health care providers across the world. The number of new cases even at the time of this writing continues to grow. As individuals and as physicians, we have a responsibility to our patients and to society to \"first, do no harm.\" As such, neuro-ophthalmologists must balance their sacred oath to \"treat the sick\" against the need for social distancing to help \"flatten the disease curve.\" The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and other public health organizations have actively updated recommendations and have suggested practices and protocols that may be of interest to practicing ophthalmologists. The AAO's early guidelines recommended that ophthalmologists defer any routine or nonurgent appointments in the clinic and postpone all elective surgical cases (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table E1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Thus, we have a responsibility to appropriately triage new and returning patients to ensure the safety of providers, patients, and the general public during and following this unprecedented pandemic. Neuro-ophthalmologists, however, often diagnose vision-threatening and potentially life-threatening disease, and delay in diagnosis or treatment can be devastating. Therefore, alternatives have been proposed to balance our competing interests of individual patient and provider safety from COVID-19 against the potential risk of undiagnosed or untreated neuro-ophthalmic disease. Recent expansion of telehealth benefits for Medicare patients allows and encourages neuro-ophthalmologists to integrate telemedicine into practice (1). The North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) has supported the use of telehealth in practice, and the reader is referred to the NANOS website for updates, resources, and webinars for the instruction of telemedicine skills for neuro-ophthalmologists. Furthermore, there is no doubt that neuro-ophthalmologists are widely recognized as a scarce resource. According to a recent NANOS membership survey of US practicing physicians, there are 1.75 million people per 1.0 CFTE neuro-ophthalmologist, and only 187 total practicing CFTE in the nation (2). With an average wait time of 6 weeks, and with over 30% of survey respondents reporting over 3-month wait times, telemedicine is an intriguing alternative for patients from poorly represented regions of the country. In this article, we present possible \"best practices\" for neuro-ophthalmologists to design and implement tele-neuro-ophthalmology during and following this national and international crisis. We review the previsit, intravisit, and postvisit steps in a practical manner that we hope will be of value to practicing neuro-ophthalmologists. We include sections on how to appropriately implement telemedicine and patient selection, focusing on different types of visits, determining eligible patients, and triaging patients. In addition, we outline the software and hardware requirements for the electronic medical record (EMR), including Epic and non-Epic platforms. We also describe the nuts and bolts of how to get started, including descriptions of the multiple useful applications and software available. As with any medical encounter, privacy regulations, billing, and coding can be significant hurdles to implementation, and we discuss each in detail. We hope that this article will be of use for neuro-ophthalmologists, comprehensive ophthalmologists, and general neurologists because we deal with effects and aftereffects of this COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that this current disruptive innovation will drive the future of telemedicine in neuro-ophthalmology. IMPLEMENTATION AND PATIENT SELECTION Choosing Telehealth Modalities The terms \"telehealth\" and \"telemedicine\" are used interchangeably in this article because there is a significant interagency variation in and continual evolution of these concepts and associated technology modalities. Face-to-face telemedicine encounters between the provider and the patient are conducted through synchronous (live real-time) interaction through electronic audio and video platforms. Email or other time delayed methods (a.k.a. \"asynchronous\" or \"store and forward\") address information electronically stored and used for patient communication, information gathering or dissemination, or provider-to-provider consultation (\"E-consults\"). Specific telemedicine terminology is detailed in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table E2, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Institutional consideration for telemedicine is described in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table E3, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Indications for each of the main modalities of telehealth delivery are described here (also, see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table E4, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). When to Consider a Video Visit Video visit is optimal for those who desire a more personal connection to their provider and for external examinations. Although suboptimal compared with an in-person examination, especially for patients with suspected optic neuropathies with subjective vision changes, returning patients may still find comfort, counsel, and education from the clinician over video. In many cases, an in-person eye examination has already been performed elsewhere, and the neuro-ophthalmic virtual video visit is more of an informative review to discuss diagnostic findings, educate, and plan rather than to repeat the examination. Outside visual field testing, ocular imaging, and neuroimaging can still be presented visually to the patient in a virtual visit through screen-sharing. Video visits can also be particularly useful for visualizing an external lid, strabismus, or orbital problem (e.g., ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, or proptosis). The clinician can instruct the patient to demonstrate any neuro-ophthalmic signs over video platforms (e.g., ocular motility examination or even ice pack testing for myasthenia gravis). Synchronous video telemedicine is the best mimic of an in-person clinic visit, and it may have value in simply fostering uninterrupted time to consult one-on-one with the physician. When to Consider Phone Visits Phone visits may be used for the follow-up of a patient who has a known pathology with subjective outcome measures, such as ischemic cranial nerve palsy with accompanying diplopia, which is expected to recover over 6–12 weeks. If the diplopia is not recovered, the patient can then be brought into clinic or undergo further remote video visits to assess clinical progress. Phone visits also offer an opportunity for providers to adjust medications for patients with migraines or myasthenia gravis. In addition, a physician can use phone visits to triage visual symptoms with a normal dilated eye examination by another provider or discuss medication compliance and tolerance, neuroimaging findings, and laboratory test results. When to Consider Email or Online Portal Communication Established patients may decide to reach out through email or online (EMR) portal regarding their condition. This modality, because it is not real time, is best suited for communications that are not as time-sensitive (e.g., medication refills, test results, treatment plans, overall condition, or scheduling). Online portal communication can also aid in sharing photographs or videos (e.g., external examination findings, OCT, or visual fields) to aid in clinical evaluation. If there is a question or concern raised by the patient that may be better addressed in real time, a video or phone visit may then be undertaken. When to Consider Provider-to-Provider Consultation (\"E-consult\") Neuro-ophthalmologists are often asked by other providers to provide consultations regarding the diagnosis or management of a patient but without the expectation of a clinic appointment (the so-called curbside consultation). This may be preferable for patients located in remote areas, who already have an engaged clinician. In an e-consult, the neuro-ophthalmologist would review clinical records and imaging, and then provide a written summary of impressions and recommendations to the referring provider. This option is ideal if the neuro-ophthalmologist determines that the patient requires related testing or medical care before an appointment or does not need their in-person examination (Fig. 1).FIG. 1.: Choosing the appropriate type of telemedicine visit. *New telephone consults with patients are not typically a covered service. DFE, dilated fundus examination.Selecting Appropriate Patients for Telemedicine Services Selecting cases in neuro-ophthalmology that can be seen safely and effectively through telemedicine is a controversial discussion, but necessary given the COVID-19–related social distancing restrictions and need to maintain access to neuro-ophthalmic care. Particularly, as clinics recover from these restrictions, poor access to specialty care will be further limited, necessitating options for \"work-arounds\" to traditional clinic schedules. Some general guidelines for patient selection are summarized in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table E5, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Triaging Neuro-Ophthalmology Patients Throughout the Crisis In a national crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, the normal triage techniques for appropriate patients may no longer apply in some cases. Before COVID-19, a telemedicine visit might follow an initial in-person visit: the patient could complete local visual field testing, fundus photographs, OCT, and/or MRI, and then review the results with the neuro-ophthalmologist over phone or video as the case history is discussed. In this setting, the neuro-ophthalmologist could use a majority of the information normally gleaned from an in-person examination. Nevertheless, this format may not be possible during a health crisis requiring social distancing in all clinical settings (i.e., no ancillary testing). Thus, what can be seen on videos and gleaned from history is perhaps all the information one may have to make a clinical workup or treatment decision.FIG. 2.: Coding for telemedicine services.For new referrals, the neuro-ophthalmologist may be forced to rely on the review of the patient's previous medical records and ancillary testing to determine whether the patient urgently needs to be seen in-person. Before COVID-19, the solution was generally \"send them to the clinic\" for the neuro-ophthalmologist to perform the initial evaluation before coordinating care; now, some coordination of care may need to precede the face-to-face evaluation. Just as general neurologists and ophthalmologists are trained to order laboratory testing in suspected giant cell arteritis before the patient may see a neuro-ophthalmologist, there are other situations in which a neuro-ophthalmologist may be able to direct referring providers in obtaining appropriate testing before an in-person evaluation. Telemedicine services such as the interprofessional consultation or live video telemedicine evaluation may allow the neuro-ophthalmologist to obtain sufficient data to make a reasonable recommendation on management, effectively reducing the risk of virus exposure by coordinating the patient's care more efficiently. The neuro-ophthalmologist may still elect to evaluate the patient in-person if necessary. The level of urgency dictates the type of visits available to the patient (e.g., in-person examination, video telemedicine visit, phone telemedicine visit, and interprofessional consultation) and the timeframe for management. The decision as to whether to bring a patient into the clinic for evaluation should also take into account the potential for harm should the patient be exposed to and infected with COVID-19. For example, a 32-year-old healthy patient with a complaint suggesting a low likelihood of serious pathology might still be worth bringing in for evaluation to rule out such pathology, whereas an 82-year-old patient with diabetes who is at high risk of mortality from COVID-19 might be better served with an initial video visit. Many subspecialties have provided general triage guidance for their providers (3). In neuro-ophthalmology, practice patterns vary greatly; thus, triage guidelines may vary between geographic regions, institutional capabilities, and individual patient situations. Although definitions of urgency will differ from provider to provider, telemedicine can be an effective tool for urgent triage and assessment, potentially moving a patient between categories of urgency more accurately. The specific modality choice is based on whether quick access to accurate history or seeing the external examination is paramount to determine next steps in care. Combining various modalities may improve efficacy: phone for triaging patient complaints and determining urgency, then an in-person appointment for assessment, and perhaps a follow-up visit by video once the video platform has been successfully established and the patient is clinically stable. The availability of ancillary testing will determine the ability to follow a patient remotely for optic nerve pathology, such as with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which, in addition to history, requires a fundus view, a visual field, and arguably an OCT to determine clinical stability. In all these clinical situations, the physician may be able to use telemedicine tools to enhance their reach across practice settings, leading to potentially superior care, higher patient satisfaction, and, in the case of COVID-19, a safer environment for all. SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND INTERNET REQUIREMENTS Software The choice of software and hardware for tele-neuro-ophthalmology is highly practice or institution dependent. If the institution already has a telemedicine platform that is integrated into the electronic health record (EMR), then the choice is clear and simple. Many institutions, however, may be overwhelmed with onboarding high volumes of providers to their integrated telemedicine platform. Recent changes in the policies and procedures of the Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) have led to waiving of penalties for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violations against health care providers, assuming that they serve patients in good faith. This change allows telemedicine providers to communicate using everyday communication technologies and has permitted for the use of third-party platform applications during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency (4). There are many third-party platform applications available; however, we are highlighting one representative technology in this monograph (doxy.me) (5). Doxy.me is free, is HIPAA compliant, and includes a business associate agreement (BAA) that is easy to use for both provider and patient. Other free platforms, however, include Zoom, Cisco Webex, Skype, and Apple FaceTime, but depending on the version that is selected, clinicians should be aware of issues regarding cost, security, and patient privacy. For example, the free version of Zoom automatically ends the call at 40 minutes if there are more than 3 participants on the call. For full service, one would need to purchase Zoom Pro or Zoom for Healthcare. Clinicians should also consider choosing a platform that is HIPAA compliant (e.g., FaceTime and Skype are not compliant) to avoid compliance issues and/or penalties after the pandemic emergency has ended when the exemptions may be reversed. The Texas Medical Association has also compiled a list of third-party vendors, which includes features and pricing information (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table E6, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422) (5). For the purpose of educating residents or fellows, there is an advantage to platforms that allow more than 2 participants, such as Zoom, so that the resident may join on the visit, with the patient's permission, as part of their resident education. Understanding the setup and needs of one's practice will dictate the best type of third-party telemedicine platform. For example, if one already has an existing EHR and does not want to invest in a telemedicine platform that requires integration with that EHR, obtaining a platform that is independent for a low monthly fee may make most financial sense (e.g., doxy.me and Zoom for Healthcare). If one seeks full integration of appointment scheduling, EHR, telemedicine visits, electronic medication orders, and patient portal communication, other platforms (e.g., AmWell, NextGen, and Zipnosis) offer more comprehensive services. Hardware requirements and some general guidelines for the setup are included in Supplemental Digital Content 2 (see Data E1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A423). The authors are not endorsing any specific vendor, the accuracy, or timeliness of this compilation. TELEMEDICINE USING EPIC AND NON-EPIC PLATFORMS Connecting With the Patient: Implementation of Technology for Telehealth Neuro-Ophthalmology Visits The mechanism used for establishing a video connection with the patient to perform a virtual visit will depend on whether your institution or practice uses Epic and whether telehealth platforms have been formalized and embedded into the Epic system. Before initiation of a telemedicine visit, patient consent is required and must be documented. As a result, you should obtain and document patient consent in the chart before every telemedicine visit. Below is sample language that you can use:\"This is a telemedicine visit that was performed with the originating site at [INSERT PATIENT LOCATION] and the distant site at [INSERT PROVIDER LOCATION]. Verbal consent to participate in video visit was obtained. This visit occurred during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency. I discussed with the patient the nature of our telemedicine visits and its inherent limitations, that: I would evaluate the patient and recommend diagnostics and treatments based on my assessment. Our sessions are not being recorded and that personal health information is protected. Our team would provide follow-up care in person if/when the patient needs it.\" Virtual Visits Through Epic in a Formalized and Embedded System Differences in Epic functionality and appearance may vary across medical centers and practices; thus, what follows serves as an example of how the system appears and functions at a single institution. A prerequisite for provision of virtual visits in Epic is setting up Epic on either an iPhone or iPad. Although Epic can be set up on Android phones, in this institution's example, Android phones cannot currently be used for virtual visits. The Epic application for iPhone use is called Haiku (see Supplemental Digital Content 3, Figure E1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A411) and for iPad use is called Canto. The process of obtaining Haiku on the iPhone or Canto on the iPad, in this example, involves first downloading an application in the App Store called \"Intelligent Hub\" that allows installation of a program called \"AirWatch.\" This allows for remote management of work-related applications and is often the mechanism by which work email is obtained on a smartphone. Therefore, it may already exist on your phone if you receive your work email on your phone. Once installed, the Haiku or Canto application must be set up in Settings to allow for notifications. For those at academic medical centers, the information technology department is typically available to assist. Once Haiku or Canto exists on your iPhone or iPad, respectively, virtual visits may occur using that device. When administrative staff schedule a patient for a virtual visit, these virtual visits are noted on the clinic schedule as a \"Video Visit\" type, and a video camera symbol can be seen on the schedule on Haiku, Canto, or the typical PC Epic schedule (see Supplemental Digital Contents 4 and 5, Figure E2A and E2B, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A412, and https://links.lww.com/WNO/A413). This visit type can occur within an existing face-to-face clinic schedule or on a day consisting of virtual visits alone. An example of such an embedded schedule is the following: a new face-to-face patient at 9 am, an established patient virtual video visit at 10 am, an established face-to-face patient at 10:30 am, etc. The video visit duration will be set on your schedule for the duration that you set for new and established visits, but as in a face-to-face visit, the duration of the visit just holds the spot on the schedule. Once the video visit is started, the video call does not automatically disconnect at any point. You will terminate the call only when the visit is completed. The prerequisite for the patient to have a virtual visit through Epic is for them to have an active online portal account. At the time of scheduling, the patient is instructed to sign on for the visit 15 minutes before the visit time, so that they are ready and waiting in the virtual \"waiting room\" when the appointment time arrives. When the patient is connected, the video icon on the Epic schedule turns green on both desktop Epic and Haiku/Canto (see Supplemental Digital Content 6, Figure E2C, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A414), and a push notification appears on the iPhone or iPad that the physician will use for the video visit (see Supplemental Digital Content 7, Figure E3A, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A425). Reminder push notifications are sent at specific intervals until the physician connects with the patient. When ready to connect with the patient for the visit, the physician may either connect to the patient directly from Haiku/Canto or log onto desktop Epic as usual on either a desktop PC or laptop and click on the patient's visit on the schedule to open the chart. If logging onto desktop PC first, a \"Handoff to Haiku/Canto\" button will be present in the upper left corner (see Supplemental Digital Content 8, Figure E3B, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A415). Pushing this button will activate the iPhone/iPad, allow for Haiku/Canto log on, and connection to the patient through the \"Join Video Call\" button in iPhone/iPad (see Supplemental Digital Content 9, Figure E3C, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A416). The video visit proceeds on the iPhone/iPad, and documentation is completed on desktop Epic. Virtual Visits Through a Third-Party App Supplemental Digital Content 10 (Data E2, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A424) includes specific tips on using these applications. Depending on the third-party platform, a consent form may not be available or integrated into the workflow. Doxy.me Go to https://doxy.me/sign-up on your phone, tablet, or computer. Complete all fields and click sign up (see Supplemental Digital Content 11, Figure E4, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A417). Under account settings, you may select the tab \"BAA\" to generate a BAA if applicable. You can also select the checkbox \"I don't need a BAA.\" The telemedicine visit with your patient through doxy.me will work irrespective of your choice regarding a BAA. You will then be logged into your dashboard, and you will be provided a room name link, doxy.me/(the room name you have selected), which will need to be provided to your patients so that they can connect with you at the time of their scheduled appointment (see Supplemental Digital Content 12, Figure E5, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A418). The patient does not need to download any software or create an account within doxy.me. Their sessions are anonymous, and none of their information is stored. They only need to enter your room link into their web browser, type their name, and select \"check in\" (see Supplemental Digital Content 13, Figure E6, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A419). Before the appointment time, you can run a Pre-call Test (see Supplemental Digital Content 14, Figure E7, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A420) whereby doxy.me will run diagnostics on your device, including video and audio quality and stability. When the patient arrives into the virtual waiting room, you will see their image in the upper left corner under the \"patient queue.\" From your mobile device or tablet, you will see a red circle in the upper left corner when a patient is waiting to see you. You can click on the red dot area and, when ready, click the patient's name to start the video. If you are on a computer, click \"start call.\" Then, select \"video call\" to begin the visit. Always allow the use of your camera and microphone. When the video begins, the patient will be on the large screen and the provider will be on the smaller screen. If you hit \"pause the video,\" you will send the patient back into the \"waiting room.\" Once your visit is complete, you can hang up the call with the red telephone icon. Applications for Home Testing A challenge that many providers identify with telemedicine and remote evaluations is the physical examination and other objective data collection. Although remote physical and ocular examinations are not as useful as those in-person, there are a number of technological outlets to simplify and optimize home testing through telemedicine. Multiple smartphone and tablet applications have been validated for remote visual acuity testing. Patients with Android Galaxy phones and someone to help, as the phone is held 2 m away, can use \"PEEK Acuity,\" a free app validated for distance testing (6,7) and use in children (8). Patients who have Apple iPhone 7 Plus or who do not have an assistant available can use \"Vision@home,\" an online test validated for both near (40 cm) and distance (2 m, assistant needed) visual acuities that is accessible free on their phone browser at www.visionathome.com.au (9). For Apple iPad tablet users, \"Eye Chart Pro\" is a free app validated for distance vision (2.5 m, assistant needed) (10) on the iPad and available but not validated on the iPhone. \"Visual Acuity XL\" has also been validated for distance vision (held at 6 m) using the iPad (11), although its accuracy is highly susceptible to glare and it costs $75. Notably, the commonly used app \"Eye Handbook,\" available for Apple iPad and Android users, has a near card test that may overestimate near VA (12). Refer to Table 1 for a review of the findings of each visual acuity application validation study.TABLE 1.: Visual acuity testing with smartphone and tablet reviewSmartphone applications exist for color vision testing, although options are more limited and are hampered by variation in tablet display manufacturing parameters (13). The most promising is contained within the \"Eye Handbook\" app, which is available free for both Apple iPhone and Android users. The app was validated against the Ishihara color vision test in 2 clinical studies (14,15), although a nonclinical study using image analysis found it likely underestimates color vision loss severity in patients with normal contrast sensitivity (CS) and does not contain as many specially designed plates as Ishihara for differentiation of R-G deficiency from total color blindness (8). Other less promising apps include \"Color Blind Test\" (16) and \"Color Vision Test\" (17). Refer to Table 2 for color validation studies. At the moment, these apps can only approximate a color perception test and detailed color testing needs to be performed in-person.TABLE 2.: Smartphone color vision testing application reviewRegarding perimetry, 2 apps \"MRF Glaucoma Lite\" and \"MRF Neuro Lite\" provide reliable Apple iPad–based threshold perimetry, and \"eyesimplify.com\" uses the same technology in a computer browser form. MRF Glaucoma Lite tests the central 30° horizontally and 20° vertically by implementing a radial testing grid and changing the location of the fixation point held approximately 33 cm away (18). Stimuli have an operating range of 0 dB–30 dB and increase in size with eccentricity from Goldmann size III to IV with a background luminance of 5 cd/m2 (15.71 asb). Unexpectedly, altering ambient lighting and viewing distance (between 25 cm and 75 cm) did not affect the threshold in a small group of testing subjects (18). All MRF measurements were highly correlated with those of the 24-2 Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) across multiple investigations (19–22), showing reliability and reproducibility over multiple visits (20–22), strong sensitivity and specificity (20), and faster testing speed than the HFA SITA-Standard (comparable with the HFA SITA-Fast) (21,22). Notably, the proportion of fixation losses is found to be higher and more variable than the HFA (22,23). The most recent MRF technology has been licensed to \"eyesimplify.com\" and released for beta testing in a home computer browser version found at the aforementioned website. This version allows testing of either the 24-2 or the 10-2 visual field and may shortly be accessible on iPad or Android. \"Visual Fields Easy,\" the predecessor to the MRF programs, is another free iPad application; it does suprathreshold screening visual fields of the central 60° horizontally and 48° vertically at a background luminance of 10 cd/m2 (31.5 asb) of the iPad with size V Goldmann equivalent stimulus at 16 dB intensity. Johnson et al found that \"Visual Fields Easy\" detected most visual defects with moderate to advanced loss as seen on SITA-standard testing but had difficulty identifying loss of less than 6 dB (19,24). Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no validated perimetry testing applications exist for patients with Android, although patients without Apple iPads have access to \"eyesimplify.com\" on a home computer browser. Tablet-based perimetry has the potential to cut detection of rapid visual loss in glaucoma from 2.5 years to 0.9 years with more frequent testing (25), bring access to necessary visual field testing to bed-bound hospital patients (26), and transform remote and home testing (23).

Several studies using animal models have been published. Animal models on retinitis pigmentosa, Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), and Stargardt disease have involved the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver functional genes into mice and canines. Mice models have been used to show that a mutation in cGMP phosphodiesterase that results in retinitis pigmentosa can be corrected using rAAV vectors. Additionally, rAAV vectors have been successfully used to deliver ribozyme into mice with a subsequent improvement in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. By using dog models, researchers have made progress in studying X-linked retinitis pigmentosa which results from a RPGR gene mutation. Mouse and canine models have also been used in the study of LCA. The widely studied form of LCA is LCA2, resulting from a mutation in the gene RPE65. Mice and canines that were injected with normal copies of RPE65 gene showed signs such as improved retinal pigment epithelium transduction, visual acuity, and functional recovery. Studies on Stargardt disease have shown that mutations in the ABCA4 gene can be corrected with AAV vectors, or nanoparticles. Gene therapy for the treatment of red-green color blindness was successful in squirrel monkeys. Plans are at an advanced stage to begin clinical trials. Researchers have also proved that CD59 can be used with AMD. Gene therapy is also able to treat primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in animal models, and studies show it is economically viable.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjopt.2013.02.001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2012646314", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Recent developments include residents performing phaco without previous ECCE experience, residents using topical anesthesia in early surgical cases, virtual surgery, improved techniques for surgical practice with animal eyes, and modular surgical training. Summary Learning to perform cataract surgery is a universal experience for US ophthalmologists. Training in phacoemulsification during residency is one of the most important components of postgraduate education in ophthalmology. The quality of phacoemulsification training in the US is currently threatened by a confluence of factors including decreasing surgical numbers, rapidly changing technology, and shrinking financial resources. The impending decline in quality of phacoemulsification training in US residencies can be prevented if creative and innovative solutions to these problems are applied. These types of solutions include use of improved animal eye practice, virtual surgical practice, alterations in live surgery teaching techniques, and finding additional sources of financial support for surgical teaching.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00055735-200502000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1966007179", "source": "openalex"}

The Journal has experienced significant growth during my first 4-year term. Let me summarize some of the highlights: Submissions have increased approximately 40%. The time from submission to first decision averages 26 days (under 30 days is very quick in biomedical publishing). Forty percent of submissions come from North America and 60% from international contributors. Approximately 200 of our colleagues assist with the peer review process each year. The time from manuscript acceptance until publication averages 8–10 weeks. Our impact factor has increased 60% since 2010 to 1.628, our highest-ever score. Despite our success, we have added, and plan to continue to add, a variety of improvements to ensure that the JNO publishes material of the highest quality, while providing, simultaneously, an enriched author experience. We have enhanced our online site with podcasts that feature contributing authors and created virtual issues on topics such as nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A section has been created entitled “Worldwide Neuro-Ophthalmology” featuring clinical and educational activities in neuro-ophthalmology that take place internationally. The journal now is available through an iPad app, allowing access to the latest publications in neuro-ophthalmology with a touch of a finger! I have altered the JNO editorial board somewhat. I am pleased to welcome the following new members: Janet Rucker, Greg Van Stavern, Byron Lam, Patrick Yu-Wai-Man, and Nitza Goldenberg-Cohen. Discussions are underway regarding increasing publication of the journal from quarterly to 6 times per year. In addition, consideration is being given to transition to a fully online journal, with an option for the subscriber to receive the print version as well. We are also considering publishing theme-based supplements, providing an in-depth publication on a specific neuro-ophthalmic disorder or evolving technology. I am honored to serve as the Editor-in-Chief of the JNO. Any success that we have had rests with the editorial board, our managing editor, Jason Roberts, and, most importantly, members of NANOS and the international neuro-ophthalmic community for submitting high-quality manuscripts.

We studied the incidence of blindness and visual impairment in patients who were enrolled in a photographic control‐ and screening program for diabetic retinopathy. The study cohort consisted of 2133 patients examined between January 1990 and December 1992 and followed until October 1st 1995. The occurrence of blindness (visual acuity ≤ 0.1) and moderate visual impairment (visual acuity 0.2‐0.4) was assessed. The Wisconsin scale was used to grade retinopathy. The mean HbA 1c value for the last 8 years was used to represent long‐term glycaemic control. Average follow‐up time was 2.9 years. Seven patients were blind and 24 had visual impairment caused by retinopathy at the entry of the study. Six patients went blind due to retinopathy during the study period, corresponding to an incidence of 1.0 per 1000 person‐years (95% confidence interval 0.4‐2.1), and 28 became visually impaired, corresponding to an incidence of 4.6 per 1000 person‐years (95% confidence interval 3.0–6.6). Multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant association between blindness/visual impairment and old age, long duration of diabetes, and poor glycaemic control. HbA 1c values in the highest quartile, i.e ≥ 8.5%, were associated with a 65% increase in risk of blindness/visual impairment (95% confidence interval 14–130%). Retinopathy was the major cause of blindness and visual impairment in patients with diabetes. The study revealed a low incidence of blindness, which is in line with recent reports. Control of hyperglycaemia may be of value for the prevention of visual loss.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.1996.tb00729.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059098450", "source": "openalex"}

Analysis of the reading process provides important information about perceptual preconditions and cortical adaptive strategies, which are also of significance for rehabilitation. Methods: Reading performance was examined using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), which allows the simultaneous assessment of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in relation to the stimuli and the eye movements. Visual fields were measured using Tuebingen perimetry and a self-developed SLO perimetry, attentional fields using the Test of Sustained Attention. Results: Patients with absolute central scotomas are only able to read if they learn to use an eccentric PRL. With a ring scotoma, reading ability depends on the size of the intact central island and the fixation behavior.With hemianopia, it is crucial whether there is macular splitting or sparing. Without sparing, reading performance depends on adaptive strategies such as predictive saccades or eccentric fixation.The latter causes a shift of the field border towards the hemianopic side in conventional perimetry. Locations of high attentional capability during central fixation (early stage of maculopathy) correspond to the later eccentric PRL during follow-up. Conclusions: Reading performance depends on the size of the perceptual area and the resolution of the PRL used for reading. Compensating strategies are crucial for regaining reading ability. Eccentric fixation causes a shift of the sensory and oculomotor reference, indicating high cortical plasticity. There is evidence that the location of a future PRL is influenced by sustained attention – a mechanism that could be utilized for specific training. Reading disorders are strongly connected with neuro-ophthalmological issues.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1076/noph.27.1.79.14298", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110969665", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Articles published between 2009 and 2013 by the 20highest-contributing countries in the 20 top-ranked ophthalmology journals were identified by their country of affiliation. The number of articles published and mean impact factor were measured per country for each year and trends explored using regression analysis with 5-year and 10-year forecasts calculated. Data on research expenditure was collected and tested for correlation with the number of articles and mean impact factor. RESULTS: The analysis included 19 338 articles. The USA, UK and Europe accounted for 60.2% of articles published, with the USA contributing 7388 articles (34.0%). The USA also demonstrated the highest mean impact factor (3.5). Research expenditure was significantly correlated with both research output (r=0.86, P<0.001) and scholarly impact (r=0.42, P<0.001). China (P<0.01), Korea (P<0.01) and India (P<0.02) demonstrated a significant growth in research output over the study period.

Labeling patterns in glaucoma specimens were compared with those of normal eyes.In all specimens, cells within collagenous laminar beams and sclera failed to label with any integrin antibodies. In normal eyes, alpha2, alpha3, alpha6, beta1, and beta4 antibodies localized to astrocytes along the margins of laminar beams and within glial columns. alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, alphav, beta1, and beta4 labeled vascular endothelial cells.

Vascular endothelial cell stress may be mediated by integrins alpha3beta1, alpha6beta1, and alpha6beta4, along with alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta1.

All patients had been under proper neurosurgical care and no reduction of visual function was found that could be related to optic atrophy or other changes in the visual pathways. However, ocular motility disorders, including strabismus, were common, although no case of down‐beat nystagmus was observed. Manifest strabismus was found in 11 patients. Esotropia with or without A‐pattern was seen in nine patients. Spontaneous or gaze‐related nystagmus and abnormal optokinetic nystagmus represented the most common disturbances of ocular motility. Abnormalities of horizontal eye‐movements were more common than those of vertical eye‐movements. Strabismus of the manifest type was combined with other ocular motility disturbances in most cases. RÉSUMÉ Evaluation neuroophthalmologique d'enfants et jeunes adultes avec myéloméningocèle et malformation d'Arnold‐Chiari Vingt‐huit patients (14 cas féminins et 14 masculins âgés de quatre à 34 ans) avec myéloméningocèle et malformation d'Arnold‐Chiari ont été examinés sur le plan neuroophtalmologique. Tous les patients avaient bénéficié d'un traitement neurochirurgical adapté et aucune réduction de fonction visuelle n'avait été trouvé, qui aurait pu être reliée à une atrophie optique ou d'autres modifications des voies visuelles. Cependant, les troubles de motilité oculaire incluant le strabisme étaient très habituels bien qu'aucun nystagmus à battement vers le bas n'ait été observé. Un strabisme manifeste fut observé chez 11 des patients. Une ésotropie avec ou sans A‐pattern fut observé chez neuf patients. Le nystagmus spontané ou relié à la déviation du regard, le nystagmus optokinétique anormal constituaient les perturbations oculaires de motilité oculaire les plus communes. Les anomalies du système de mouvements horizontaux étaient plus communes que celles du système vertical. Un strabisme de type manifeste était associé aux autres perturbations de motilité oculaire dans la majorité des cas.

Alle Patienten waren neurochirurgisch versorgt und es wurden keine Einschränkungen der visuellen Funktion gefunden, die auf eine Sehnervenatrophie oder andere Veränderungen der Sehbahnen zurückzuführen wären. Augenmotilitätsstörungen‐einschließlich Strabismus‐waren jedoch häufig, es wurde allerdings kein Fall mit Nystagmus beim Blick nach unten beobachtet. Manifestes Schielen fand sich bei 11 Patienten, bei neun Patienten wurde ein Strabismus convergens concomitans festgestellt. Der Spontan oder blickgerichtete Nystagmus und der abnorme optokinetische Nystagmus stellten die häufigsten Augenbewegungs störungen dar. Veränderungen im horizontalen Motilitätsbereich traten häufiger als im vertikalen Bereich auf. Manifester Strabismus war in der Mehrzahl der Fälle mit anderen Augenmotilitätsstörungen kombiniert. RESUMEN Evaluaciones neuro‐oftalmológicas de niños y jóvenes adultos con mielomeningocele y malformaciones de Chiari Veintiocho pacientes (14 hembras y 14 varones de edad entre cuatro y 34 años) con mielomeningocele y malformación de Chiari fueron examinados neuro‐oftalmológicamente. Todos los pacientes habían sido tratados debidamente quirúrgicamente y no se halló ninguna reducció&amp;#x006e;̀ de la función visual que pudiera relacionarse con atrofia óptica, ni ningún otro cambio en las vias visuales Sin embargo, eran corrientes alteraciones en la motilidad ocular incluyendo estrabismo, aunque no se observó ningún caso de nistagmus hacia abajo. Un estrabismo manifiesto se halló en 11 de los pacientes. Una exotropia, con o sin patrón A, fue vista en nueve pacientes. El nistagmus espontáneo en relación con la mirada y el nistagmus anormal optoquinético representaban las anomalias más corrientes en la motilidad ocular. Las anomalías del sistema de movimiemtos oculares horizontales eran más corrientes que los del sistema vertical. En la mayoría de casos, el estrabismo de tipo manifiesto estaba combinado con otras anomalías de la motilidad ocular.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16960.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2003542241", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the advances in retinal imaging, analysis techniques are still superseded by expert ophthalmologist interpretation. Teleophthalmology presents an immense opportunity, with high rates of sensitivity and specificity, to manage the steadily increasing demand for eye care of patients with diabetes, but challenges remain in the delivery of practical, viable, and clinically proven solutions.

We identified patients scheduled for eye care during pre-COVID-19 (January 1-February 29, 2020) and early COVID-19 (March 16-May 31, 2020) time periods. Missed appointment frequency and characteristics were evaluated during each time period. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to examine adjusted odds of having at least one missed appointment during a given time period. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, preferred language (non-English vs English), insurance, distance from clinic, and diagnosis.Overall, 82.0% (n = 11,998) of pre-COVID-19 patients completed all scheduled visits, compared to only 59.3% (n = 9020) during COVID-19. Missed visits increased dramatically in late March 2020, then improved week by week through the end of May 2020. General ophthalmology/cataract and strabismus clinics had the highest rates of missed clinic visits during the COVID-19 period; neuro-ophthalmology, retina, cornea, oculoplastics and glaucoma had the lowest. Females, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, ages 50+, and married patients had higher adjusted odds of missing clinic visits, both pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Asian, elderly, and cataract patients had the highest adjusted odds of missing clinic visits during COVID-19 and had significant increases in odds compared to pre-COVID-19. Non-married, diabetic macular edema, and wet age-related macular degeneration patients had the lowest adjusted odds of missed visits during COVID-19.Missed clinic visits increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among elderly and nonwhite patients. These findings reflect differences in eye care delivery during the pandemic, and they indicate opportunities to target barriers to care, even during non-pandemic eras.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s341739", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200132735", "source": "openalex"}

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is supported by SARS-CoV-2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Italy has been the first European country recording an elevated number of infected forcing the Italian Government to call for total lockdown. The lockdown had the aim to limit the spread of infection through social distancing. The purpose of this study is to analyze how the pandemic has affected the patient's accesses to the Ophthalmological Emergency Department of a tertiary referral center in central-northern Italy, during the lockdown period. The charts of all patients that came to the Emergency Department during the lockdown period (March 10 -May 4, 2020) have been retrospectively collected and compared with those in the same period of 2019 and the period from 15 January- 9 March 2020. A significant reduction of visits during the lockdown has been observed, compared with those of pre-lockdown period (reduction of 65.4%) and with those of the same period of 2019 (reduction of 74.3%). Particularly, during the lockdown, minor and not urgency visits decreased whereas the undeferrable urgency ones increased. These pieces of evidence could be explained by the fear of patients to be infected; but also revealed patients misuse of emergency services.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239796", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3090135953", "source": "openalex"}

Objective To report prevalence, main characteristics and outcome of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in BD. Patients and methods This is a retrospective monocentric study of 217 patients diagnosed with neuro-Behçet’s disease (NBD), of whom 29 (13.3%) patients presented with neuro-ophthalmological manifestations (55% of men and mean±SD age of 26±8 years). All patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination and were followed up in the internal medicine and the ophthalmology departments. Results Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations were the first presentation of BD in 45% of patients and developed later in the course of the disease in 55% of patients. They are divided into parenchymal (PM) and non-parenchymal (NPM)-related manifestations in, respectively, 13 patients (45%) and 16 patients (55%). PM included papillitis in seven patients (53.8%), retrobulbar optic neuritis in four patients (30.8%) and third cranial nerve palsy in two patients (15.4%). NPM included papilloedema related to cerebral venous thrombosis in all 16 patients, of whom 6 patients (37.5%) had sixth cranial nerve palsy. At initial examination, 93.1% of patients had visual alterations, including mainly decreased visual acuity visual field defects and/or diplopia. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and 79% of patients received immunosuppressive agents. After treatment, the visual outcome improved or stabilised in 66.7% of patients while it worsened in 33.3. The mean±SD logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity improved from 0.4±0.3 at diagnosis to 0.2±0.3 after therapy. 10.3% and 3.4% of patients were legally blind at diagnosis and after therapy, respectively. Conclusion Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations of BD represented 13% of NBD. They could be potentially severe and disabling.

It is basically a disorder of acquisition of written language, probably due to a poorly developed phonological awarness, which in turn may be neurologically related. As anatomical correlates symmetry of the planum temporale and ectopies in the cerebral cortex have been suggested. Functional correlates are discovered with brain electrical mapping and stimulation of brain structures during neuro surgery. From an ophthalmological point of view there are no relations between dyslexia and ocular problems including refractive errors and accommodation, problems of binocular control and stereopsis, eye dominance instability etc. However, contrast sensitivity seems to be reduced in dyslexics for the middle range of spatial frequencies, which may be related to impaired function of the ‘transient’ visual system. With regard to eye movements, there is no firm experimental proof for any disturbances in dyslexia, be it with the different movement systems or in the best movement direction. ‘Backward saccades’ or regressions are typical not only for dyslexic reading but in all types of reading when comprehension is poor. Although there is no treatment for dyslexia itself that can be based on ophthalmological findings, the ophthalmologist must after careful examination discover and treat any ocular, orthoptic or neuroophthalmological problem that may make reading difficult for the dyslexic child. The ophthalmologist must explain to the child and the parents that dyslexia usually has no ophthalmological or visual cause but is a disability with a neurobiological background, still unknown, in which the only efficient treatment is within the area of pedagogy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-3768.1992.tb02085.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061455620", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI) was used to identify the 30 most‐published authors in ‘cataract’ and ‘laser in situ keratomileusis’ (LASIK) (2000–2004 inclusive). SCI was subsequently used to analyse the recorded articles for each author in terms of source journal, the most commonly cited articles and citation source. Results: Of the 30 most‐published authors in the fields of cataract and LASIK, the USA was the most well‐represented source country, accounting for 33%; 20% were from Australia, and 17% from Austria. Germany and Japan each contributed 7%. Eighty per cent of the publications produced by these 30 authors (2000–2004) were in 10 journals, of which the Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (JCRS) published more than one‐third. Of the three most‐cited articles for each author, the greatest number were published in JCRS (35.6%). The citation count of the articles had a weak correlation to the journal impact factor of the source journal; however, the self‐citation rate of these articles did not. Conclusions: The USA and Australia together were the source of more than half of the most‐published authors on cataract and LASIK and the majority of articles published by the 30 most prolific authors were published in only 10 journals.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1999796175", "title": "Closer to nature: new biomaterials and tissue engineering in ophthalmology", "text": "Ophthalmology has a long history of successful conventional biomaterial applications including viscoelastics, drug delivery vehicles, contact lenses, and a variety of implants. A myriad of further possibilities exists as the margins between conventional material concepts and natural tissues continue to blur, and biomaterials move closer to nature. Genetically engineered materials (for example, hyaluronic acid and fibrin tissue glues) harnessing the power and accuracy of biological systems in molecular synthesis are becoming commonplace. New synthetic surfaces capable of upregulating or downregulating biological responses at the tissue/material interface are starting to reach clinical application; and an emerging understanding of matrix/cell interactions may soon allow engineered replacement for a range of tissues in the eye. A basic classification divides materials according to their primary bonding structure into ceramics (ionic bonding), metals (metallic bonding), and polymers (covalent bonding). Modern ophthalmic implants are almost all fabricated from synthetic polymers. Polymeric materials are composed of long chain molecules (polymers) synthesised from repeat units (monomers) whose chemical character and reactivity determine many bulk properties. Most polymer chains have a covalently bonded backbone of carbon atoms joined to a variety of pendant groups. For siloxanes (“silicone”), an important group of synthetic biomaterials, this backbone consists of alternating atoms of silicone and oxygen. Molecular chains vary in length and are irregularly intertwined, although areas of regular arrangement (crystallinity) may exist. Cross linkage density and the density of secondary bonding further determine bulk properties for a given polymeric material.1 Secondary bonding mechanisms (for example, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces) are particularly relevant to biological systems, and are thought to have an important role in modulating protein conditioning—the process by which relatively inert polymeric material surfaces are rendered biologically active by contact with the tissues or body fluids.2 Protein conditioning is partly determined by surface reactivity, which varies …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.83.11.1235", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999796175", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2107207200", "title": "Redefining tissue engineering for nanomedicine in ophthalmology", "text": "Working at the nanoscale means to completely rethink how to approach engineering in the body in general and in the eye in particular. In nanomedicine, tissue engineering is the ability to influence an environment either by adding, subtracting or manipulating that environment to allow it to be more conducive for its purpose. The goal is to function at the optimum state, or to return to that optimum state. Additive tissue engineering replaces cells or tissue, or tries to get something to grow that is no longer there. Arrestive tissue engineering tries to stop aberrant growth which, if left uncontrolled, would result in a decrease in function. Nano delivery of therapeutics can perform both additive and arrestive functions influencing the environment either way, depending on the targeting. By manipulating the environment at the nanoscale, the rate and distribution of healing can be controlled. It infers that potential applications of nanomedicine in ophthalmology include procedures, such as corneal endothelial cell transplantation, single retinal ganglion cell repair, check of retinal ganglion cell viability, building of nanofibre scaffolds, such as self-assembling peptides, to create a scaffold-like tissue-bridging structure to provide a framework for axonal regeneration in the case of optic nerve reconnection or eye transplantation, and ocular drug delivery. Examples of potential arrestive therapies include gene-related treatment modalities to inhibit intraocular neovascularization and to block retinal cell apoptosis. Looking towards the future, this review focuses on how nanoscale tissue engineering can be and is being used to influence that local environment. Nanotechnology is the study of the controlling of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology deals with structures sized 100 nm or smaller in at least one dimension and involves developing materials or devices within that size. Nanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly and from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to investigating whether we can directly control matter on the atomic scale. Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology. The approaches to nanomedicine range from the medical use of nanomaterials, nanoelectronic biosensors, to medical applications of molecular nanotechnology, and it includes advanced drug delivery systems, new therapies and in vivo imaging. Neuro-electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active goal of research. The yet speculative field of molecular nanotechnology may potentially allow cell repair machines that could revolutionize medicine. Nanomedicine also addresses tissue engineering which has usually been thought of as the replacement of what is lost and is often synonymous with regenerative medicine. The actual definition is the ability to influence, in a positive or negative way, any process, cell or organ, to maintain function; in other words, to stop loss, maintain function or increase function (Langer & Vacanti 1983). The use of nanotechnological tissue engineering can involve something as simple as acetylsalicylic acid to reduce inflammation and change the prostaglandin pathways on the molecular level; or something as complex as putting cells back into a three-dimensional, self-assembled matrix to allow reintegration back into the tissue to achieve restoration of function (Guo et al. 2007). Tissue engineering can also be used to enhance the current state of the tissue by changing its structure to function more efficiently. An example is stopping metastasis in cancer: changing the extracellular matrix density can halt the replication of prostate cancer stem cells (Ling et al. 2010). From the perspective of nanobiotechnology, delivering therapeutics to the eye can be very different from drug delivery in other medical disciplines. At the nanoscale, permeability goes to infinity at a molecule diameter of less than 10 nm, while solubility remains the same, changing how therapeutics can be delivered to the eye and the rest of the body. A drug molecule with a size of less than 10 nm can go almost everywhere and normal barriers no longer exist. Drugs in this size category can be applied topically and will penetrate into the eye, independently of other characteristics. In ophthalmology, tissue engineering at the nanoscale was recently used to reverse blindness in animals, not by replacing what was lost, but by changing the environment (Ellis-Behnke et al. 2006a,b; Ellenberg et al. 2009). In these studies, nanobiotechnology was based on the molecular self-assembly production of new or improved materials, as can also be observed in nature. It creates and uses materials and devices at the same scale of intracellular structures and molecules. Regenerative ophthalmology uses stem cells, tissue bioengineering and gene therapy to create effective treatments (Ahmed et al. 2001; Bainbridge et al. 2008; Bhatia et al. 2009; Cho et al. 2005; Ellis-Behnke et al. 2007; Ellis-Behnke et al. 2009; Enzmann et al. 2009; Seale-Goldsmith & Leary 2009; Huang et al. 2003; Kubota et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2006; Maguire et al. 2008; Nguyen et al. 2010; Takács et al. 2009; Thanos 1997; Vossmerbaeumer et al. 2008; West et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2005). By manipulating the environment at the nanoscale, the rate and distribution of healing can be controlled. Looking towards the future, this review focuses on how nanoscale tissue engineering is being used to influence that local environment, in general and in particular in ophthalmology. Working at the nanoscale forces us to completely rethink how to approach engineering in the body in general and in the eye in particular. No longer can we think of tissue engineering as taking a cell, putting it in a particular scaffold, putting it back in the body and hoping that everything will reconnect and function properly. Furthermore, the definition of tissue engineering should not be limited to just the reconstruction of organs, replacement of cells or lost function; it is also important to include stabilizing the native tissue, a critical step in stopping further deterioration to prevent the loss of additional functions (Kawasaki & Player 2005; Ellis-Behnke et al. 2006a,b; Koo et al. 2006; Ellis-Behnke 2007; Leary 2007; Murthy 2007; De Jong & Borm 2008; Haglund et al. 2009; Sajja et al. 2009). Redefining tissue engineering for nanomedicine includes considering that in cellular therapy the type of environment being wrapped directly around the cells first needs to be understood before determining whether to implant directly, or whether the environment needs to be enabled for growth in vitro before implantation. In molecular therapy, redefining tissue engineering for nanomedicine includes the questions: how long does the molecular therapy need to be maintained? How should it be delivered? Is it a long period of time? Is it an acute or chronic issue? Does cell death need to be arrested first through modulating the immune system, or does cell death need to be arrested by inserting a growth factor or antiapoptotic factor? If the disease state remains, will the tissue suffer the same fate or will the new tissue be immune to the environment? In all applications of nanomaterials in nanomedicine, potential immunological aspects may have to be taken into account. It has not been clear so far, which organic or inorganic materials may provoke an unwanted response from the patient leading to a rejection of the used nanomaterials, and perhaps even more important, to a secondary inflammation induced damage of the organisms. Examples applied from the redefinition of tissue engineering by nanomedicine will be discussed in the following sections. There is a graveyard full of therapeutics that held great potential for ophthalmology but which were, because of their large size, unable to be delivered in sufficiently high concentrations into the eye at the site of required action. By using nano-encapsulation and adding targeting moieties, drugs are now able to be delivered directly to the desired target (Kawasaki & Player 2005; Moghimi et al. 2005; Murthy 2007; De Jong & Borm 2008). These principles applied in other fields of medicine, can of course also be applied in ophthalmology (Amrite et al. 2006; Aukunuru et al. 2003; Bourges et al. 2003; De Campos et al. 2003; Diebold et al. 2007; Irache et al. 2005; Kaur et al. 2004; Kompella et al. 2003). For example, to treat herpes simplex virus only in the trabecular meshwork or uveal cells, a small, targeted dose would have to be delivered into the eye with an activation of the drug only when those cells are targeted. Apart from this targeted drug delivery and activation, nano delivery of therapeutics can perform both additive and arrestive functions influencing the environment either way, depending on the targeting. For example, if capillaries and vessels in the eye begin to leak and a proliferation and arborization of those blood vessels develops as a process of neovascularization, additive tissue engineering could possibly transfect the endothelial tissues of the blood vessels resprout capillaries. Arrestive tissue engineering could potentially transfect endothelial cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to stop the proliferation programme of the vasculature in the eye. Important indications for such treatment modalities in ophthalmology are medical therapy of exudative age-related macular degeneration (Aukunuru et al. 2003; Bourges et al. 2003; De Campos et al. 2003; Kompella et al. 2003; Kaur et al. 2004; Amrite et al. 2006; Diebold et al. 2007; Tamaki 2009) including the delivery of dendrimers as an antiVEGF strategy (Marano et al. 2004, 2005), laser-assisted therapy of exudative age-related macular degeneration by nanotechnology-based modifications of photodynamic therapy (Ideta et al. 2005; Jang et al. 2007; Sugisaki et al. 2008), gene therapy of age-related macular degeneration (Bejjani et al. 2005; Lai et al. 2005; Cashman et al. 2006; McGinley et al. 2006; Paskowitz et al. 2007) and other aspects of gene-related ocular therapy (Martin et al. 2003; Farjo et al. 2006; Naash et al. 2006), intraocular antiviral therapies (Irache et al. 2005), and therapy of corneal neovascularization and other ocular surface problems (Chetoni et al. 2004; Cortesi et al. 2006; Jani et al. 2007; Law et al. 2000). Some of the new concepts for the future of nanotherapeutics are based on the idea of implanting machinery, or transfecting the code, to produce the desired therapeutic in the retinal or sclera population using a response unit. When the eye is under stress, it will turn on the machinery to produce the desired therapeutic; when the retina in no longer under stress, the production will stop (Leary 2007; Haglund et al. 2009; Seale-Goldsmith & Leary 2009). One of the drawbacks, however, is that currently there is no way to measure the amount and duration of the drug delivery release of these new formulations; not to mention that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is years away from determining how to approve these new therapeutics. However, with lower doses, safety will be less of an issue. By adding signalling molecules to these drugs, a signal, such as a change of colour, can be sent once the drug is released and targeted properly. These response indicators in nanotherapeutics will offer control and understanding of release and function at the desired level; this is something our body already does naturally. Sometimes nanotechnology is used only to produce the replacement part, where cells are grown but are removed before the tissue is implanted. For example, the substrate on which corneal endothelial cells may be cultured and grown is a nano-structured surface in a so-called cell sheet engineering approach (Yang et al. 2006). Just before the cells are removed from the dish, a transfer medium is used to reduce the temperature. This causes the cells to be released from the culture dish so that the newly grown corneal endothelial sheet can then be implanted onto the Descemet′s membrane in the human eye. In this case, the nanotechnology enables the growth and harvest, but never touches the patient (Yang et al. 2006). By manipulating the cell attachment density, the surface can be tuned to have less adhesive force through the transfer sheet. Size and environment tissue manipulation points to the possibilities of enabling additional tissue and organ growth and transplantation. Replacement of organellar mitochondria has been used during in vitro fertilization and egg revitalization (Tzeng et al. 2004). It may be conceivable that the damaged organelles of retinal ganglion cells or other cells in the eye could also be replaced with organelles from younger cells in the near future. Taking this further, perhaps retinal ganglion cells could potentially be enhanced in preparation for them to survive a surgical operation or exposure to higher levels of radiation. Preconditioning of neural tissue prior to surgery is not new (Slikker et al. 2001; Wan et al. 2001); although it has not yet been tried as an ocular therapeutic at the nanoscale, cerium oxide and yttrium oxide nanoparticles may be an option in the future. Both cause a low level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which rapidly causes a ROS defence system. Exposure of cells to particulate material known to induce low levels of ROS could act as a preconditioning stimulus. Platinum nanowires, far thinner than even the tiniest capillary vessels, have been threaded into the vascular system of tissue samples to successfully detect the activity of individual neurons lying adjacent to the blood vessels, without blocking the normal flow of blood or interfering with the exchange of gasses and nutrients through the blood vessel walls (Llinás et al. 2005). With the ability of these nanowires to be fed into the smallest capillaries of the brain, perhaps they could also be used to check the viability of the retinal ganglion cells in the retina, similar to the way a catheter is used to place a stent in an artery. Much work has been carried out with scaffolds by adding therapeutics and cells before implanting them into the eye. The three-dimensional structure of the scaffolds provides a substrate for cell adhesion and migration, influencing the survival of transplanted cells, as well as the invasion of cells from the surrounding tissue. Scaffolds can be made from natural, synthetic or synthetic biological materials and have been used for everything from stopping the retina from detaching from the pigment epithelium (Lewis & Fisher 2006), to attempting to create an environment for retinal and corneal restoration using cell implantation (Raju & Goldberg 2008). Synthetic materials, PLAs [poly (lactic acid)], PLGAs [Poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid] and methyl methacrylate (MMAs) have known compositions and also have the ability to be custom designed with specific properties. PLAs, PLGAs and MMAs have recently been used to form scaffolds preimpregnated with cells (Newman & McBurney 2004); the entire scaffold is then implanted in the damaged tissue area (Gundablou et al. 2006). The techniques hold much promise but also present one very large issue: when finally broken down, they can become acidic, causing an immune response and subsequent scarring (Willerth & Sakiyama-Elbert 2007). In many cases, this is a desired effect; but in the eye a slight change in pH at the vitreoretinal interface may be an undesired effect. Natural materials like alginate, chitosan, collagen, fibrin and hyaluron can impart intrinsic signals within the structure that can enhance tissue formation (Willerth & Sakiyama-Elbert 2007; Harmening et al. 2009; Heile et al. 2009). Many of the natural scaffolds bring issues similar to synthetic to the environment: an immune response or adhesion. The compatibility may be much better, but the overall deposition of many of these materials is recognized as being out of place in the body and the immune system may attempt to remove them. Synthetic biological materials, the next generation of cell scaffolds, are designed self-assembling peptides that spontaneously form nanofibres, creating a scaffold-like tissue-bridging structure that provides a framework for axonal regeneration (Ellis-Behnke et al. 2006a; Ye et al. 2008). Some of these scaffolds are not perceived by the immune system as being foreign (Ellis-Behnke et al. 2006a,b; Guo et al. 2007), so that normal pathways of peptidases can be used to clean the material from the system in a controlled fashion, without the associated immune system response. Other examples of self-assembled biological materials for building up of scaffolds are based on DNA, RNA and various other materials (De Laporte & Shea 2007). A potential application of the self-assembling peptides that create a scaffold-like tissue-bridging structure may be eye transplantation in which the scaffold is used to enable the regenerating retinal axons of the transplanted eye to grow into the optic nerve remnant of the recipient by bridging the gap between the ends of the two optic nerves (Ellenberg et al. 2009; Su et al. 2007). Arrestive therapies in ophthalmology include strategies to preserve retinal ganglion cells by a nonviral transfection of encapsulated therapeutics. An example is the use of a nanoencapsulated BCL-2 plasmid with a retinal ganglion cell targeting sequence to block the apoptotic pathway to keep the retinal ganglion cells alive in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies (Ellis-Behnke et al. 2003). In a comparable context, materials such as lithium chloride have been shown to be neuroprotective by increasing the BCL-2 expression (Chen et al. 1997; Ellis-Behnke 2002). In a similar manner, arrestive therapy may include small interfering RNA (siRNA). This class of 20–25 nucleotide-long double stranded RNA has been shown to be effective in stopping the proliferation of blood vessels. Perhaps using a nanoencapsulated and targeted sequence could be used to deliver siRNA in the cytoplasm. It would be similar to a nonviral transfection technique mentioned earlier and developed to deliver a BCL-2 plasmid to the cytoplasm (Ellis-Behnke et al. 2003). Arrestive therapies in ophthalmology may also include fullerenes. Fullerene C60 nanoparticles, an engineered material, behave like a 'free radical sponge' quenching cell-damaging ROS (Markovic & Trajkovic 2008); the fullerene C3 appears to be one of the most powerful antioxidants. Fullerenes (also called buckyballs) have also been shown to prevent the in vivo release of histamine and drop in core body temperature (Ryan et al. 2007). A recent study showed that there is a potential for side-effects, such as cataracts (Roberts 2008); however, this is a simple problem to correct with lens replacement. Arrestive therapies may also include the use of some metal nanoparticles which have shown powerful antioxidant powers and qualities that block the production of reactive oxygen species scavengers. These metal nanoparticles may be used to influence the ocular environment and stop the death of retinal ganglion cells. Platinum nanoparticles have shown antiageing properties (Kim et al. 2008). Cerium oxide and yttrium oxide nanoparticles may act as direct antioxidants as well as block ROS production, which inhibit the programmed cell death pathway. As an arrestive therapy, self-assembling peptides may be used to inhibit the proliferation of retinal pigment epithelium cells in the vitreous cavity in the case of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, if the self-assembling peptides are used as a substitute for the vitreous body in surgical vitrectomy. As an almost biological vitreous substitute, they may potentially replace conventional ocular endotamponades such as silicone oil or intraocular gases. Depending on their concentration, the self-assembling peptides forming nano scaffolds may be used to push the retina back in contact with the pigment epithelium (unpublished observations). Interestingly, this self-assembling peptide nanofibre scaffold as vitreous substitute may additionally be used as drug reservoir and slow-release of these drugs. Gold nanoparticles may aid in the treatment of choroidal neovascular membranes in exudative age-related macular degeneration. Combining the gold nanoparticles with a humanized antibody that inhibits new blood vessel growth in a rat model of subretinal choroidal neovascularization has shown regression of new blood vessels (Shukla et al. 2008). The development of nano adhesives is based on bionic observations from nature such as that a gecko can hang on a glass surface using only one toe. This ability of geckos has been attributed to Van der Waals forces and/or water molecules of roughly monolayer thickness on the surface. Efforts have continued to create a synthetic 'gecko tape' that exploited the gecko's abilities. It is part of efforts in the design of biomimetic materials which may be used in tissue engineering as permanent or resorbable tissue implants, with the aim to generate biocompatible scaffolds with appropriate biomechanical and chemical properties to allow the adhesion, ingrowth, and survival of cells (von der Mark et al. 2010). `Dendrimers are repeatedly branched, roughly spherical large molecules, similar to a tree. A dendrimer is typically symmetrical around the core and often adopts a spherical three-dimensional morphology. Applications of dendrimers typically involve conjugating other chemical species to the dendrimer surface that can function as detecting agents (such as a dye molecule), affinity ligands, targeting components, radioligands, imaging agents or pharmaceutically active compounds. Dendrimers have very strong potential for these applications because their structure can lead to multivalent systems. In other words, one dendrimer molecule has hundreds of possible sites to couple to an active species. This may allow to attach both targeting molecules and drug molecules to the same dendrimer, which could reduce negative side affects of medications on healthy cells. The physical characteristics of dendrimers, including their monodispersity, water solubility, encapsulation ability and large number of functionalizable peripheral groups, make these macromolecules appropriate candidates for evaluation as drug delivery vehicles. The use of dendrimers as drug carriers by encapsulating hydrophobic drugs is a potential method for delivering highly active pharmaceutical compounds that may not be in clinical use because of their limited water solubility and resulting suboptimal pharmacokinetics. Self-assembling peptides may have a multitude of applications in medicine and in ophthalmology (as discussed earlier) including sealing of wounds and almost immediate haemostasis without involvement of the blood coagulative cascade (Ellis-Behnke et al. 2006b). It has experimentally been studied in the brain, spinal cord, femoral artery, liver and skin of mammals. This novel therapy stopped bleeding without the use of pressure, cauterization, vasoconstriction, coagulation or cross-linked adhesives. The self-assembling solution was nontoxic and nonimmunogenic, and the breakdown products were amino acids, which were tissue building blocks that could be used to repair the site of injury. The intraocular encapsulated cell-based delivery of drugs can also be regarded to be a part of tissue engineering in ophthalmology (Tao et al. 2002; Bush et al. 2004; Thanos et al. 2004; Sieving et al. 2006; Tao 2006; Lee et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2009). It takes advantage of the anatomy of the intravitreal cavity offering the possibility to directly apply drugs into the eye (Jonas et al. 2005a,b; Spandau et al. 2005). It allows achieving high concentrations of the drugs at the site of their required action almost without systemic side-effects. For the last 10 years, this intravitreal drug delivery has been widely used for the therapy of exudative age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, two of the most common blinding diseases (Gillies et al. 2003; Gragoudas et al. 2004; Rosenfeld et al. 2006). Because the intraocular availability of drugs if given in a soluble form is usually less than 48 hours (Schindler et al. 1982), repeated injections have been necessary (Jonas et al. 2004). With each intraocular injection increases the cumulative risk of injection-related complications, such as an infectious endophthalmitis (Jonas et al. 2003). A possibility to decrease the number of repeated intravitreal injections is to get the drugs produced in the eye, according to a change in a paradigm. Normally, a drug can be produced by genetically engineered cells in sterile conditions in the laboratories of a company, filtered and isolated and prepared for medical application. In intraocular cell-based drug therapy, the genetically modified cells are clustered in tubes (Tao et al. 2002) or in beads encapsulated by a barium cross-linked sodium alginate matrix (Zhang et al. 2009, 2010). The tubes or beads can be implanted in suitable cavities in the body such as the vitreous cavity. In recent experimental investigations, mammalian cells that were genetically engineered to secrete ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were loaded into polymer membrane capsules and implanted intravitreally (Tao et al. 2002; Bush et al. 2004; Tao 2006). The capsules remained in the eyes for 7 weeks before they were explanted, and the output of ciliary neurotrophic factor and the cell viability were evaluated. At the end of follow-up, the explanted capsules still produced a low level of ciliary neurotrophic factor, and the cells in the capsules remained viable. Similar capsules were later implanted into eyes of patients with retinitis pigmentosa, and no adverse effects were observed (Sieving et al. 2006). In the studies on the ciliary neurotrophic factor as well as in our investigation, side-effects of the procedure were not observed. Potential side-effects could be an immunogenically induced intraocular inflammation directed against the implanted cells, elevation of intraocular pressure, retinal detachment or retinal tissue destruction by a retinal cytotoxic effect. In a similar manner, Lee and colleagues previously developed other carrier designs, namely a collagen-alginate composite gel and collagen microspheres embedded in alginate gel in preventing cell leakage, maintaining cell growth and controlling secretion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the cells transduced to overexpress GDNF (Lee et al. 2009). Because many proteins, besides ciliary neurotrophic factor CNTF, endostatin and glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1, may be producible in the intraocular space, this technique may offer possibilities unknown so far. As the next power-of-ten increase in resolution approaches, our ability to define the molecular interaction in more detail will also increase markedly. We need to not only change how we approach tissue engineering but also change how we think about it. In nanomedicine, tissue engineering is the ability to influence an environment either by adding, subtracting or manipulating that environment to allow it to be more conducive for its purpose. Think about engineering a bridge across a river: instead of building a dam or changing the course of the river, the bridge is creating a pathway for traffic to cross it, with little impact on the river itself. Additive tissue engineering is more than just the addition of cells that have died; it should be thought of as recreating the healthy environment so the additions can stay alive and functioning. To cite an example, additive tissue engineering includes creating a permissive environment for axons of retinal ganglion cells to reoutgrow after an optic nerve trauma. Arrestive tissue engineering is the arrest of the degenerative process that is causing one to lose a part of that tissue that may be relevant. An example would be an antiapoptotic approach using the BCL-2 pathway to prevent the death of retinal ganglion cells. With yet unknown future possibilities of nanotechnology in general and nanomedicine and nano-ophthalmology in particular, it is impossible to foresee how much, and in which fields in ophthalmology, this new approach will influence clinical practice and research. Without doubt, however, the emerging field of nanotechnology will markedly change medicine including ophthalmology, potentially leading to the new field of nano-ophthalmology. This article may have given a glimpse of these future developments. Rutledge Ellis-Behnke - shareholder in 3-D Matrix, Japan; Arch Therapeutics, Inc. U.S.A.; Jost B.

Methods Design: Prospective, non-inferiority study analysing agreement in diagnoses and management plans between telemedicine and in-person examinations. Setting: Paediatric ophthalmology clinic. Population: Children 0–17 years, English-speaking or Spanish-speaking, able to participate in age-appropriate manner, either previously seen by the optometrist and required ophthalmology referral or newly referred from outside source. Procedures: Paediatric optometrist conducted examinations using digital equipment and streamed live to a paediatric ophthalmologist who recorded diagnoses and management plans, then re-examined patients in-person. Subjects were masked to the fact they would see the ophthalmologist in-person, same-day. Main outcome measures: Discrepancy in management plan or diagnosis between telemedicine and in-person examinations. Non-inferiority threshold was &lt;1.5% for management plan or &lt;15% for diagnosis discrepancies.

Methods: The average age of the patients treated was 48.8 years. The average duration of disease prior to treatment was 27.6 years and ranged from 4 to approximately 60 years. Affected eyes were treated with either retrobulbar, subtenons and intravenous BMSC or retrobulbar, subtenons, intravitreal and intravenous. Follow up was provided a minimum of 6 months. The primary outcome was visual acuity as measured by Snellen or converted to LogMAR. Results: Following therapy in SCOTS or SCOTS 2, 11 patients (64.7%) showed improved binocular vision averaging 10.23 lines of Snellen acuity per eye over pre-treatment acuity; 8 patients (35.3%) remaining stable over the follow up period; no patients experiencing loss of overall acuity. In 33 treated eyes, 15 eyes (45.5%) improved an average of 7.9 lines of Snellen acuity, 15 eyes (45.5%) remained stable, and 3 eyes (9%) worsened by an average of 1.7 lines of Snellen acuity. Improvements ranged from 1 to 27 lines of vision. Using the LogMAR Scale and calculating delta as a ratio to pre-treatment vision in improved eyes, acuity improvement ranged from 23% to 90% with an average of 40.9% visual acuity improvement over baseline vision. Evaluation of all patients and eyes capable of LogMAR vision showed an average of 31% improvement in vision over baseline. Findings were of statistical significance (P=0.016). There were no surgical complications. Conclusions: The BMSC protocols of the SCOTS achieved meaningful visual acuity improvements or stability in RP that were of statistical significance. Duration of disease did not appear to affect the ability of eyes to respond. Safety was confirmed. Possible mechanisms by which improvement occurred may include transdifferentiation of BMSC into Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN) positive cells, BMSC paracrine secretions or neurotrophic factors and hormones, transfer of mitochondria, release of messenger RNA or other compounds via exosomes or microvesicles.

Materials and Methods: The patients' demographic data, medical history and final diagnosis were recorded in a questionnaire. Results: The mean age of patients was 33.2±16.8 years and 2380 patients (75.6%) were males. While 299 patients (9.5%) were referred for non-urgent reasons, work-related injuries were the most common cause of referral (955 patients; 30.3%). In patients referred due to trauma (1950 patients), work-related injuries occurred in 955 patients (49%) and occurred accidentally (by chance) in 819 patients (42%). The majority of patients referred with traumatic injuries were males (1708 patients; 87.6% versus 242 patients; 12.4%). The most common etiologies of eye trauma (1950 patients) were metal filings (814 patients; 41.8%), blunt trauma (338 patients; 17.3%), fireworks (236 patients; 12.1%) and sharp objects (222 patients; 11.4%). Globe injury was diagnosed in 1865 patients (95.7%) of trauma cases. In patients referred due to non-traumatic reason (1200 patients), eye infection occurred in 482 patients (40.2%) and 299 patients (24.9%) were referred for non-urgent reasons. There was little difference between the frequency of non-trauma-related problems among genders (672 male patients; 56% versus 528 female patients; 44%). Conclusions: This study identified multiple risk factors whose presence significantly increases severity of an eye injury. Male gender, youth and unprotected eyes during high-risk activities such as sports and certain jobs are risk factors for eye injuries. In patients referred due to non-traumatic reasons, males and females are similar. Considerable proportion of non-trauma-related problems was due to eye infection, that one of the most important reasons may be connected to the increasing use of contact lenses in our target population. Thereupon, we need for further educative and preventive interventions at the level of general population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-2700.93104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998210274", "source": "openalex"}

Though safer than many other retinoids in experimental models, in humans 4-HPR may induce adverse effects that mainly affect the eye and visual function. Such effects are thought to be caused by the reduction of plasma retinol levels, which occurs after administration of the retinoid. Methods A series of 826 women treated with 4-HPR was studied to quantify the incidence and temporal pattern of occurrence of visual (dark adaptation) and ophthalmologic complaints (ocular dryness, lacrimation, conjunctivitis or photophobia) and to investigate the possible association between their occurrence and plasma retinol levels. Results The cumulative incidence of visual complaints reached nearly 20% at 5 years. The occurrence of these symptoms was more frequent at the start of treatment. The probability of developing visual complaints was significantly higher in patients with lower plasma retinol concentrations following 4-HPR treatment. The cumulative incidence of ophthalmologic complaints was 8% at 5 years. The occurrence of these complaints was evenly distributed during treatment. Ophthalmologic complaints were not associated with a greater degree of reduction of plasma retinol concentrations, but rather with the patient's age, since symptomatic patients were generally older than asymptomatic patients. Conclusions Visual and ophthalmologic complaints are common during 4-HPR treatment: their estimated 5-year cumulative incidence is close to 20% and 8%, respectively. However, the pattern of occurrence over time and the underlying mechanisms of these two types of complaints seem different.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/030089169608200506", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2460191037", "source": "openalex"}

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-tutoring problem-based-learning (PBL) in ophthalmology clerkship and to assess the student evaluations of this module.Thirty-eight Grade-two students in ophthalmology clerkship at Sun Yat-Sen University were randomly assigned to two groups. In Group A, students learned congenital cataracts through an AI-tutoring PBL module by exploring and operating an AI diagnosis platform. In Group B, students learned congenital cataracts through traditional lecture given with the same faculty. The improvement in student performance was evaluated by comparing the pre- and post-lecture scores of a specific designed test using paired-T tests. Student evaluations of AI-tutoring PBL were measured by a 17-item questionnaire.The post-lecture scores were significantly higher than the pre-lecture scores in both groups (Group A: P<0.0001, Group B: P<0.0001). The improvement of group A in the part of sign and diagnosis test (Part I) was more significant than that of group B (P=0.016).

Quantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with characteristic size and tunable optical properties, which deliver bright and stable fluorescence suitable for bioimaging and labelling. Methods: A systematic search was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. This review systematically searched published data to summarize the characteristics and applications of quantum dots in ophthalmology. Two hundred and eighty published articles were initially selected for this review following searches using the criteria quantum dots AND nanoparticles AND ophthalmology in the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science. Results: After duplicates were removed, a total of 22 eligible articles were included for the review. Quantum dots potentially provide a range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in ophthalmology. Quantum dots offer visible and near-infrared emission, which is highly desirable for bioimaging, due to reduced light scattering and low tissue absorption. Their applications include in vivo bioimaging, labelling of cells and tissues, delivery of genes or drugs and as antimicrobial composites. Conclusion: Quantum dots have been used in ophthalmology for bioimaging, electrical stimulation and tracking of gene/stems cells, and ocular lymphatics.

Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated high performance in segmenting retinal images that may enable fast and lifesaving diagnoses. To our knowledge, there is no systematic review of the current work in this research area. Therefore, we performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of the DL algorithms in retinal vessel segmentation. Methods: A systematic search on EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted for studies that were published between 1 January 2000 and 15 January 2020. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) procedure. The DL-based study design was mandatory for a study’s inclusion. Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for assessing the risk of bias and applicability. Results: Thirty-one studies were included in the systematic review; however, only 23 studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. DL showed high performance for four publicly available databases, achieving an average area under the ROC of 0.96, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.94 on the DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF databases, respectively. The pooled sensitivity for the DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF databases was 0.77, 0.79, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. Moreover, the pooled specificity of the DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF databases was 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.92, respectively. Conclusion: The findings of our study showed the DL algorithms had high sensitivity and specificity for segmenting the retinal vessels from digital fundus images. The future role of DL algorithms in retinal vessel segmentation is promising, especially for those countries with limited access to healthcare.

However, there have been only a few attempts to use OCT for examination of avian eyes, and little is known about structural details of healthy or pathologically affected retinas in living birds.We used SD-OCT (high-resolution spectral domain OCT) to investigate eyes of various avian species including birds of prey. The birds were anesthetized by isoflurane application during OCT examination. Eyes of a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) could be used for a comparative analysis of OCT images and histologic/immunohistochemical examinations.We investigated 45 wild and domestic birds (25 different species, 40 g-7.7 kg body mass) without and with diverse pathologic indications (e.g., body or head trauma). Animals were generally and ophthalmologically examined, and the diagnostic findings of direct ophthalmoscopy and OCT were compared. The OCT examination revealed an increased number of animals with clinical findings and allowed a detailed assessment of structural changes in retinal and choroidal tissue compared to simple direct ophthalmoscopy. Common findings were retinal and choroidal degeneration, retinal detachment, choroidal schisis, drusen, and drusenoid changes. Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis of retinal tissue confirmed the findings of the OCT examination.Spectral domain OCT of eyes in living birds is applicable and useful as a diagnostic tool in veterinary clinical practices and for vision research in general. Optical coherence tomography improves the quality of the common assessment methods in avian ophthalmology, and expands the diagnostic possibilities with respect to identification and prognosis of diseases.

Information on no‐show patients in an ophthalmological out‐patient department was collected and analyzed during one month in 1992 and compared to one month in 1993, after the introduction of a new policy of allocating fines to those patients who did not show for their appointments. In October 1992, 118 patients (6.4% out of 1837 scheduled appointments) and in 1993, 94 patients (5.5% out of 1710 appointments) did not show for the appointment. The strabismus unit showed the highest percentage of no‐show patients for both years (8.4% in 1992, 7.5% in 1993) and the low vision unit the lowest (4.6% in 1992, 4.1% in 1993). In 1992, Tuesday (8.9%), and in 1993 Monday (6.9%) were the weekdays with the highest percentages; the lowest was Wednesday (4.4% in 1992, 2.8% in 1993). By appointment type, consultations from other clinics had the highest percentage in both years (7.9% in 1992, 6.9% in 1993) while the lowest was visits to personnel other than a doctor (3.7% in both years). The age group 31–40 years had the most no‐show patients in both years (10.9% in 1992, 10.2% in 1993). The lowest percentage was in the age group 61–80 years (2.6–4.9% in 1992, 3.0–2.7% in 1993).

This individual variation in drug response could be at least, in part, due to genetic diversity among individuals. Although substantial studies that connect genetic variants to inter-individual variation in drug response have been documented in several diseases such as cancer and heart diseases, such studies are slowly progressing in ophthalmology. In recent years, advancement in technologies has led to the identification of genes associated with several eye disorders. At the same time, some small-scale studies have demonstrated the association of various genotypes or haplotypes with response to drug therapies. However, its integration into clinical practice in ophthalmology is not possible at present. This is because there are many challenging questions that remain to be addressed. For instance, in the case of complex disorders a single gene study is not enough. Multiple genes, environmental factors, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and rare or low frequency variants may contribute to the disease and they must be considered. The functional aspects of many genetic variants are not known. This raises questions of their biological importance and their clinical usefulness. In addition, there are legal, ethical, and social issues that need to be regulated. Moreover, physicians and patients must be educated about the limitation and sensitivity of genetic testing. At present pharmacogenetic studies in ophthalmology are still in their infancy and do not suggest that a pharmacogenetic basis of drug development in ophthalmology is a concept that can yield immediate results, but can become a reality in the future.

Patients with optic nerve related disorders were excluded. Study period was one month. Statistical analysis of collected data was done using Microsoft excel.A total of 198 patients were provided teleconsultations (an average of seven teleconsultations/day). The final analysis included 161 patients after excluding optic nerve related disorders. The median age was seven years. We had a near equal gender distribution (53% males and 47% females) of whom a third were new cases. Video calling was used in 14%, review of clinical photos shared was used in 53%. Rest of the 33% were given telephonic advice. Allergic conjunctivitis (14%), pseudophakia (9%), strabismus (12%), status post strabismus surgery (8%), cranial nerve palsies (11%) were common diagnoses. 19% (n = 30) were advised/needed visit in emergency services on same or next day.Our experience of teleconsultation during COVID-19 times for paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus patients was very encouraging. Pivoting teleconsultation platform can provide primary eye care to most of the patients and work as essential forward triage for rest. As we continue to further explore the currently available avenues in multimedia such as video conferencing and web/mobile based applications, we believe that tele-ophthalmology platform can provide a reliable service in patient care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1675_20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3037412265", "source": "openalex"}

Nineteen (41%) patients had astigmatism of 1.25 diopters or greater. Amblyopia of strabismic, an isometropic, or ametropic etiology was present in 11 (24%) of the patients. Strabismus was present in 25 (54%) patients: 22 (48%) patients had esotropia and three (7%) had exotropia. Nine patients either received or required strabismus surgery. Thirty-three percent of the patients examined for iris transillumination defects had this finding. This study represents the first large series of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome to undergo detailed ophthalmologic evaluation.

Visual loss leads to reduced ability to perform routine activities of daily living and can be a risk for stable mental health. Aim : The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess the incidence of depression in patients treated in an ophthalmological outpatient clinic. To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind in our country. Subjects and method : The number of evaluated patients was a hundred; mean age 41.6 ± 15.9 years, with different educational levels and common ophthalmological disorders. For the assessment of the level of depression the Beck Depression Inventory was used. Patients were divided into two groups: serious ophthalmological diagnoses where we expected psychological problems (N = 65) and the simplest ones (N = 35) as a control. Results : Obtained results show that the levels of depression correlate with the diagnoses. Patients in the first group (serious ophthalmological diagnoses) showed moderate depression in 12% and severe in 13% of patients. It was shown that the most depressed were the patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as well as glaucoma and cataract. The second group showed BDI scores of normal values. The level of depression is positively correlated with age and the level of education (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion : Depression is an important mental problem in ophthalmological practice. It is usually unrecognized and untreated. Depression could be the risk factor for treatment and prognosis of eyes diseases. Some measures for mitigation of psychological problems are proposed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2478/prilozi-2014-0007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046340577", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4206215581", "title": "Neuro-Ophthalmological Optic Nerve Cupping: An Overview", "text": "Abstract: Optic nerve cupping or enlargement of the cup-to-disc ratio is widely recognized as a feature of glaucoma, however it may also occur in non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies. The most well-recognized non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies that cause cupping include compressive optic neuropathies, arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathies, hereditary optic neuropathies, and optic neuritis. Cupping is thought to consist of two main components: prelaminar and laminar thinning. The former is a shallow form of cupping and related to loss of retinal ganglion cells, whereas the latter involves damage to the lamina cribrosa and peripapillary scleral connective tissue. Differentiating glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous optic nerve cupping remains challenging even for experienced observers. Classically, the optic nerve in non-glaucomatous causes has pallor of the neuroretinal rim, but the optic nerve should not be examined in isolation. The patient's medical history, history of presenting illness, visual function (visual acuity, color vision and visual field testing) and ocular examination also need to be considered. Ancillary testing such as optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer may also be helpful in localizing the disease. In this review, we review the non-glaucomatous causes of cupping and provide an approach to evaluating a patient that presents with an enlarged cup-to-disc ratio.

All eligible persons had to be 21 years or older, English speaking, and cognitively able to give informed consent and participate in a health status interview.To provide the data needed to create the NEI VFQ-25, all subjects completed an interview that included the 51-item NEI VFQ. Estimates of internal consistency indicate that the subscales of the NEI VFQ-25 are reliable. The validity of the NEI VFQ-25 is supported by high correlations between the short- and long-form versions of the measure, observed between-group differences in scores for persons with different eye diseases of varying severity, and the moderate-to-high correlations between the NEI VFQ-25 subscales that have the most to do with central vision and measured visual acuity.The reliability and validity of the NEI VFQ-25 are comparable to those of the 51-item NEI VFQ field test version of the survey. This shorter version will be more feasible in settings such as clinical trials where interview length is a critical consideration.

Partial resection of the orbital bones is not uncommon during the excision of anterior and anterolateral skull base tumors. Controversy exists regarding the need for and extent of reconstruction after this procedure. The authors studied this factor in a series of patients. Methods. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 56 patients in whom resection of 57 anterior or anterolateral skull base tumors and partial excision of the orbital bone were performed. Adverse ophthalmological outcomes were noted in 16 patients, in nine of whom adverse outcomes were believed to be directly related to resection of the orbital walls. Some degree of orbital reconstruction was performed during 23 of the 57 procedures. An adverse orbital outcome was strongly associated with resection of the orbital floor and resection of two thirds or more of two or more orbital walls, but not with the presence or absence of orbital reconstruction. The latter finding, however, is likely a function of selection bias. Conclusions. In most patients elaborate orbital reconstruction is not necessary after partial excision of the orbital bones. Isolated medial and lateral orbital wall defects, or combined superior and lateral orbital wall defects, especially in cases in which the periorbita is intact, probably do not require primary reconstruction. In cases of orbital floor defects, whether isolated or part of a multiple-wall resection, primary reconstruction is recommended.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3171/jns.2002.97.4.0851", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135255607", "source": "openalex"}

The reports on the neurological and ocular findings are increasing day after day and several central and peripheral neurological manifestations are already described. However, none specifically describes the neuro-ophthalmological manifestation of HCoVs. This is the first article specifically reviewing neuro-ophthalmological manifestations of HCoVs infection. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched using the keywords: coronaviridae, coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, ocular, ophthalmology, ophthalmological, neuro-ophthalmology, neurological, manifestations. A manual search through the reference lists of relevant articles was also performed. There were no restrictions concerning language or study type and publications not yet printed but available online were considered. Results: Coronavirus eye involvement is not frequent and includes mostly a typical viral follicular conjunctivitis. Recently, retinal anatomical alterations were described using optic coherence tomography. Neuro-ophthalmological symptoms and signs can appear isolated or associated with neurological syndromes. The manifestations include headache, ocular pain, visual impairment, diplopia, and cranial nerve palsies secondary to Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or encephalitis, and nystagmus. Conclusion: Neurological and neuro-ophthalmological syndromes, symptoms, and signs should not be neglected and a complete ophthalmological examination of these patients should be performed to fully describe ocular manifestations related to HCoVs.

Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the correlation between disturbances of ocular motility and the degree of hydrocephalus, tectal plate deformity and dislocation of the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. All patients had Chiari malformations. Strabismus and spontaneous nystagmus were strongly related mainly to the degree of hydrocephalus and to some extent to the amount of lower brainstem deformities. Ocular motility defects with regard to oblique muscle functions and horizontal and vertical gaze and saccadic control often correlated with lower brainstem lesions. Convergence defects correlated with deformities of the upper brainstem. However, these correlations were not valid in the individual patient; some had no strabismus and normal ocular motility, in spite of advanced hydrocephalus and Chiari malformations. RÉSUMÉ Relation entre les données neuroophtalmologiques et les lésions du SNC chez les patients porteurs de myéloméningocele Vingt‐huit patients (14 cas féminins et 14 masculins, âgés de quatre à 34 ans) avec myéloméningocèle ont été étudiés. L'imagerie de résonance magnétique fut utilisée pour déterminer la corrélation entre les perturbations de la motilité oculaire et le degré d'hydrocéphalie, les déformations de la paroi, du cervelet et du bulbe. Tous les patients présentaient une malformation d'Arnold‐Chiari. Il fut noté que le strabisme et le nystagmus spontané étaient fortement reliés au degré d'hydrocéphalie et dans une certaine mesure, à l'importance des déformations de la partie inférieure du tronc cérébral. Les défauts de motilité oculaire en rapport avec la fonction des muscles obliques, le déplacement du regard horizontal et vertical et la contrôle des saccades étaient souvent liés aux lésions de la partie inférieure du tronc cérébral. Les défauts de convergence étaient liés aux déformations de la partie supérieure du tronc cérébral. Cependant, ces corrélations n'avaient pas de signification individuelle: certains patients ne présentaient pas de strabisme et avaient une motilité oculaire normale en dépit d'une hydrocéphalie avancée et d'importantes malformtions d'Arnold‐Chiari. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Relation zwischen neuro‐ophthalmologischen Befunden und ZNS Läsionen bei Patienten mit Myelomeningocele 28 Patienten (14 männliche, 14 weibliche; zwischen vier und 34 Jahren) mit Myelomeningocele wurden untersucht. Mit Hilfe der Kernspinntomographie wurde die Beziehung von Augenbewegungsstörungen zum Grad des Hydrocephalus, zu Fehlbildungen der Tektalplatte und zu Dislokationen von Cerebellum und Medulla oblongata untersucht. Alle Patienten hatten Chiari Mißbildungen. Man fand, daß Strabismus und Spontannystagmus hauptsächlich eine enge Beziehung zum Grad des Hydrocephalus und bis zu einem gewissen Grad auch zum Ausmaß der Mißbildungen im unteren Hirnstammbereich hatten. Die Störungen der Augenbewegungen in Bezug auf die Funktion der quergestreiften Muskulatur, horizontale und vertikale Blickrichtung, sowie die Kontrolle der schnellen Augenbewegungen korrelierten häufig zu Fehlbildungen im oberen Hirnstamm. Diese Korrelationen waren jedoch für den individuellen Patienten nicht zutreffend; einige zeigten keinen Strabismus und normale Augenbewegungen trotz eines ausgeprägten Hydrocephalus und Chiari Mißbildungen. RESUMEN Relación entre hallazgos neuro‐oftalmológicos y lesiones de SNC en pacientes con mielomeningocele Se estudiaron veintiocho pacientes (14 varones y 14 hembras) de edades entre cuatro y 34 años, con mielomeingocele. Se utilizó la Imagen por Resonancia Magnética para demostrar la correlación entre les alteraciones de la motilidad ocular y el grado de hidrocefalia, deformidad de la placa tectal y dislocación del cerebelo y del bulbo. Todos los pacientes tenían malformación de Arnold‐Chiari. Se halló que el estrabismo y el nistagmo espintáneo estaban en fuerte ralación sobre todo con el grado de hidrocefalia y en cierto grado con la cantidad de deformacioines de la zona baja del tronco cerebral. Los defectos en la motilidad ocular con respecto a las funciones de los músculos oblicuos y la mirada vertical y horizontal, así como el control sacádico estaban a menudo correlacionados con lesiones bajas del tronco cerebral. Los defectos de la convergencia se relacionaban con deformidades altas del tronco cerebral. Sin embargo estas correlaciones no eran válidas para el paciente individual. Algunos de ellos no mostraban estrabismo y tenían una motilidad ocular normal, a pesar de un hidrocéfalo avanzado y malformaciones de Chiari.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16961.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1989140446", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2114046206", "title": "An Optomechanical Model Eye for Ophthalmological Refractive Studies", "text": "PURPOSE: To create an accurate, low-cost optomechanical model eye for investigation of refractive errors in clinical and basic research studies. METHODS: An optomechanical fluid-filled eye model with dimensions consistent with the human eye was designed and fabricated. Optical simulations were performed on the optomechanical eye model, and the quantified resolution and refractive errors were compared with the widely used Navarro eye model using the ray-tracing software ZEMAX (Radiant Zemax, Redmond, WA). The resolution of the physical optomechanical eye model was then quantified with a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor imager using the image resolution software SFR Plus (Imatest, Boulder, CO). Refractive, manufacturing, and assembling errors were also assessed. A refractive intraocular lens (IOL) and a diffractive IOL were added to the optomechanical eye model for tests and analyses of a 1951 U.S. Air Force target chart. RESULTS: Resolution and aberrations of the optomechanical eye model and the Navarro eye model were qualitatively similar in ZEMAX simulations. Experimental testing found that the optomechanical eye model reproduced properties pertinent to human eyes, including resolution better than 20/20 visual acuity and a decrease in resolution as the field of view increased in size. The IOLs were also integrated into the optomechanical eye model to image objects at distances of 15, 10, and 3 feet, and they indicated a resolution of 22.8 cycles per degree at 15 feet. CONCLUSIONS: A life-sized optomechanical eye model with the flexibility to be patient-specific was designed and constructed. The model had the resolution of a healthy human eye and recreated normal refractive errors. This model may be useful in the evaluation of IOLs for cataract surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3928/1081597x-20130117-08", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114046206", "source": "openalex"}

Symptoms of DE were evaluated by the Ocular Surface Disease Index and Dry Eye Questionnaire-5. Information on demographics, exposures, past medical and ocular history, and medications was also collected.The frequency of severe DE symptoms was found to be 43% based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index and 30% based on Dry Eye Questionnaire-5. Risk factors significantly associated with increased DE symptoms included dry mouth and gastrointestinal ulcer medications. With regard to signs, aqueous tear deficiency was a less-frequent finding (22%) in our population than evaporative deficiency (94%). Risk factors associated with aqueous tear deficiency were dry mouth and diuretic use. No risk factors were associated with evaporative deficiency. Risk factors associated with meibomian gland dysfunction included old age, male sex, arthritis, and use of an antihypertensive. The only risk factor associated with corneal staining was dry mouth.This is the first study to demonstrate the frequency of symptomatic and clinical DE in a tertiary care ophthalmology center in Mexico. The frequency of DE ranged from 30% using a symptomatic definition to 94% using objective measures.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical potential of state-of-the-art LLMs in ophthalmology using a more robust benchmark than raw examination scores. We trialled GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on 347 ophthalmology questions before GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2, LLaMA, expert ophthalmologists, and doctors in training were trialled on a mock examination of 87 questions. Performance was analysed with respect to question subject and type (first order recall and higher order reasoning). Masked ophthalmologists graded the accuracy, relevance, and overall preference of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 responses to the same questions. The performance of GPT-4 (69%) was superior to GPT-3.5 (48%), LLaMA (32%), and PaLM 2 (56%). GPT-4 compared favourably with expert ophthalmologists (median 76%, range 64–90%), ophthalmology trainees (median 59%, range 57–63%), and unspecialised junior doctors (median 43%, range 41–44%). Low agreement between LLMs and doctors reflected idiosyncratic differences in knowledge and reasoning with overall consistency across subjects and types ( p &gt;0.05). All ophthalmologists preferred GPT-4 responses over GPT-3.5 and rated the accuracy and relevance of GPT-4 as higher ( p &lt;0.05). LLMs are approaching expert-level knowledge and reasoning skills in ophthalmology. In view of the comparable or superior performance to trainee-grade ophthalmologists and unspecialised junior doctors, state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 may provide useful medical advice and assistance where access to expert ophthalmologists is limited.

During this pandemic, ophthalmologists around the world adapted their clinical and surgical practice following such guidelines. This original research examines all publicly available COVID-19 recommendations from twelve major ophthalmology societies around the world. Twelve ophthalmology societies recognised by the International Council of Ophthalmology were included in this study. One society per each WHO region was included: the society selected was the one who had the highest number of national COVID-19 confirmed cases on 11 May 2020. In addition to these countries, the major ophthalmology society in each G7 country was included. Ten out of 12 major international ophthalmology societies from countries covering all six WHO regions have given recommendations regarding urgent patient care, social distancing, telemedicine and personal protective equipment when caring for ophthalmic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While all guidelines emphasise the importance of postponing non-urgent care and taking necessary safety measures, specific recommendations differ between countries. As there is no clear consensus on ophthalmology guidelines across countries, this paper highlights the differences in international ophthalmic care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge of the differences in ophthalmic management plans will allow ophthalmologists and all eye care providers to consider the variety of international approaches and apply best practices following evidence-based recommendations during pandemics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjophth-2020-000525", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3041978143", "source": "openalex"}

It has been proven that some diseases in humans are accompanied by fundus changes; therefore, the health status of people may be interpreted from retinal images. However, the human eye is not a perfect refractive system for the existence of ocular aberrations. These aberrations not only affect the ability of human visual discrimination and recognition, but restrict the observation of the fine structures of human eye and reduce the possibility of exploring the mechanisms of eye disease. Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique that corrects optical wavefront aberrations. Once integrated into ophthalmoscopes, AO enables retinal imaging at the cellular level. This paper illustrates the principle of AO in correcting wavefront aberrations in human eyes, and then reviews the applications and advances of AO in ophthalmology, including the adaptive optics fundus camera (AO-FC), the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AO-SLO), the adaptive optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT), and their combined multimodal imaging technologies.

In this prospective randomized controlled study, we evaluated the impact of SS microscope-integrated OCT (MI-OCT) on ophthalmology residents' performance of ophthalmic microsurgical maneuvers. Methods: Fourteen ophthalmology residents from a single institution were stratified by year of training and randomized to perform four anterior segment surgical maneuvers on porcine eyes with (MI-OCT+) or without (MI-OCT−) direct intraoperative OCT guidance. Subsequently, both groups repeated the same maneuvers without MI-OCT feedback to test whether initial MI-OCT experience affected subsequent surgical performance. Finally, the MI-OCT− group was crossed over and allowed to repeat the same maneuvers with direct MI-OCT guidance. Each resident completed a survey at the completion of the study. Results: With direct MI-OCT feedback, residents demonstrated enhanced performance in depth-based anterior segment maneuvers (corneal suture passes at 50% and 90% depth and corneal laceration repair) compared with the residents operating without MI-OCT. Microscope-integrated OCT+ residents continued to outperform the controls when both groups subsequently operated without MI-OCT. For clear corneal wound geometry, there was no statistically significant effect of MI-OCT as applied in this study. Overall, the resident surgeons rated their subjective experience of using MI-OCT very favorably.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3013500859", "title": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak at the Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital, Norway", "text": "Editor, Since the end of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan has rapidly spread across the world. The disease is designated COVID-19, an abbreviation for coronavirus disease 2019 (World Health Organization 2020a, 2020b). While most patients experience mild sickness or are asymptomatic, COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory illness and even death (Wu & McGoogan 2020). In February 2020, the coronavirus epidemic reached Norway; ground zero was the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital (OUH). The outbreak practically brought all clinical activity to a 2-week standstill. We present a summary of the experience and review potentially modifiable factors. Week 8 is the annual winter holiday in Oslo, and at its end, many citizens return from vacation abroad. On February 24th (Monday, Week 9), the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) published new travel advices in the form of a news bulletin on their homepage. It stated that limited information suggested COVID-19 was spreading in northern Italy, particularly the Lombardy region; travellers returning from areas with risk of contagion were advised to seek medical attention if developing respiratory symptoms within 14 days (Norwegian Institute of Public Health 2020). On February 25th, a physician from the department, who had returned from holiday in northern Italy, developed mild symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The individual had not stayed in any of the areas on the NIPH list and was deemed not to fulfil criteria for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Consequently, the physician completed the workday but called in sick the following day because of exacerbation (fever and myalgia). On February 27th, the individual insisted on testing for SARS-CoV-2 and turned out to be positive. Meanwhile, other physicians at the department were developing similar symptoms, and by the end of week 9, five cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, all of whom were vitreoretinal surgeons. The next week, testing confirmed COVID-19 in a ward nurse, who had not been at work since February 27th. The nurse remains the final affected subject from the department. More than a hundred employees (including several with symptoms of respiratory tract infection) were also tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, and no patients acquired COVID-19 in the department. By the end of week 9, the hospital management at OUH had declared a state of emergency. The six COVID-19 cases were placed in home isolation, and employees, students, and patients who had been in close contact with them were placed in home quarantine. All elective appointments were cancelled. The surgical retina service was shut down, and patients requiring surgery were sent by ambulance plane to other regional centres. The outbreak also attracted considerable media attention, including breaking news headlines and live updates. Following a thorough decontamination, the department will reopen on March 13th, resuming normal activity after 2 weeks. Delayed treatment courses will require extra efforts for months to come. In an unfolding outbreak, coordinating preventive actions and distributing knowledge are particularly challenging. The responsibility must lie with national health authorities; appropriate countermeasures and formal channels of communication are crucial. A COVID-19 epidemic in northern Italy coinciding with citizens returning from winter holiday clearly posed a risk of further spread of the disease. Two weeks prior, World Health Organization had published key considerations for repatriation and quarantine of travellers in relation to the outbreak, but the strictest measures had not been adopted by Norwegian authorities at the time (World Health Organization 2020a, 2020b). Moreover, the NIPH advice regarding travellers returning from specific regions of northern Italy was issued only one day prior in the form of a homepage message, in other words not actively distributed to health services. Without knowledge of further spread of the virus in Italy, mild upper respiratory tract symptoms were ignored (many employees with similar symptoms did indeed not suffer from COVID-19). These observations raise the question as to whether modest preventive measures and warnings were disproportionate to an imminent threat to public health. Fortunately, the infected staff members quickly recovered from COVID-19, and no patients were infected. The true burden was the extensive efforts made to confine the outbreak. To a larger degree than the disease itself, the negative health consequences can be attributed to delayed ophthalmic treatment. A separate building houses the Department of Ophthalmology at OUH. A single site containing specialized healthcare services to a large population is especially vulnerable, not only to an infectious outbreak but also to other setbacks, such as natural disasters or terrorism. Inability to perform retinal surgery or more than a hundred planned intravitreal injections per day, for instance, was a devastating experience. Risk spreading, for example a satellite centre for intravitreal injections, could have limited the negative consequences and should be considered as a precaution when organizing future healthcare services. In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak requires coordinated efforts at both national and international level. Preventive measures should be resolute and proportionate to the public health threat.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14426", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3013500859", "source": "openalex"}

Ocular problems that affect the cornea, trabecular meshwork, sclera, retina, and optic nerve are very common in these patients. However, there was limited literature focusing on comprehensive ocular findings in different types of MPS . Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical ophthalmologic features and electrodiagnostic results of 50 Taiwanese patients with a diagnosis of MPS (34 males and 16 females; age range, 1.1–34.9 years; nine with MPS I, 17 with MPS II , 17 with MPS IV , and seven with MPS VI ). Results Among 44 patients with available data for visual acuity, 15 patients (34%) had a visual acuity of less than 0.5 (6/12) equivalent in their better eye, including 71% of those with MPS VI , 38% with MPS IV , 29% with MPS I, and 14% with MPS II . Severe corneal opacities existed in 57% of MPS VI patients and 11% of MPS I patients, compared with none for MPS II and MPS IV patients. Among 80 eyes with available data of refraction, 11 eyes (14%) had myopia (≦−0.50 D), 55 eyes (69%) had hyperopia (≧0.50 D), and 55 eyes (69%) had high astigmatism (≧1.50 D). Ocular hypertension was found in 45% (28/62) of eyes. There were 16% (14/90), 11% (10/90), 13% (12/90), 31% (27/86), and 79% (30/38) of MPS eyes with lens opacities, optic disc swelling, optic disc cupped, retinopathy, and visual pathway dysfunction, respectively. Intraocular pressure was positively correlated with the severity of corneal opacity ( p &lt; 0.01).

Animals —12 mares free of ophthalmic disease. Procedures —2 μL of 10% sodium fluorescein was instilled onto 1 eye of each horse, and tear samples were collected via microcapillary tubes from the inferonasal conjunctival culde-sac at 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after instillation. Collected tear samples were then measured for fluorescein concentrations with a computerized scanning ocular fluorophotometer. A decay curve plot of concentration changes over time was used to determine tear flow rate and volume through 2 different mathematical treatments of the data (the including method and the excluding method). Results —Fluorescein concentration in tears decreased in a first-order manner. The including method yielded a mean tear volume of 360.09 μL, a turnover rate of 12.22%/min, and a flow rate of 47.77 μL/min. The excluding method yielded values of 233.74 μL, 13.21%/min, and 33.62 μL/min, respectively. Mean ± SD correlation coefficients for the natural logarithm of the fluorescein concentration versus time were 0.93 ± 0.12 for the including method and 0.98 ± 0.03 for the excluding method. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance —The excluding method yielded more accurate results. A tear flow rate of 33.62 μL/min and a tear volume of 233.74 μL imply a complete recycling of the tear volume in approximately 7 minutes and suggest that increased dosing regimens or constant infusion methods for topical administration of ophthalmic drugs may be indicated when treating horses for corneal disease in which high ocular surface concentrations are needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.71.6.671", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2161425259", "source": "openalex"}

Overall, we found 19 published studies of NLP in ophthalmology. The majority of these publications (16) focused on extracting specific text such as visual acuity from free-text notes for the purposes of quantitative analysis. Other applications included: domain embedding, predictive modeling, and topic modeling. Future ophthalmic applications of NLP may also focus on developing search engines for data within free-text notes, cleaning notes, automated question-answering, and translating ophthalmology notes for other specialties or for patients, especially with a growing interest in open notes.

Design - Comparison of results of Medline searches to a \"gold standard\" of known randomised clinical trials in ophthalmology published in 1988; systematic review (meta-analysis) of results of similar, but separate, studies from many fields of medicine. <b>Populations</b>: Randomised clinical trials published in in 1988 in journals indexed in Medline, and those not indexed in Medline and identified by hand search, comprised the gold standard. Gold standards for the other studies combined in the meta-analysis were based on: randomised clinical trials published in any journal, whether indexed in Medline or not; those published in any journal indexed in Medline; or those published in a selected group of journals indexed in Medline. Main outcome measure - Sensitivity (proportion of the total number of known randomised clinical trails identified by the search) and precision (proportion of publications retrieved by Medline that were actually randomised clinical trials) were calculated for each study and combined to obtain weighted means. Searches producing the \"best\" sensitivity were used for sensitivity and precision estimates when multiple searches were performed. <b>Results</b>: The sensitivity of searching for ophthalmology randomised clinical trials published in 1988 was 82%, when the gold standard was for any journal, 87% for any journal indexed in Medline, and 88% for selected journals indexed in Medline. Weighted means for sensitivity across all studies were 51%, 77%, and 63%, respectively. The weighted mean for precision was 8% (median 32.5%). Most searchers seemed not to use freetext subject terms and truncation of those terms. Conclusion - Although the indexing terms available for searching Medline for randomised clinical trials have improved, sensitivity still remains unsatisfactory. A mechanism is needed to \"register\" known trials, preferably by retrospective tagging of Medline entries, and incorporating trials published before 1966 and in journals not indexed by Medline into the system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.309.6964.1286", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2057806510", "source": "openalex"}

Designed to preserve and restore vision on an international scale, the ICO initiative, \"Refocusing Ophthalmic Education,\" enhances ophthalmic education of residents, subspecialists, medical students, and allied eye care personnel by redefining the most effective ways to teach and in creating beneficial educational opportunities. The \"Teaching the Teachers\" program helps ophthalmic educators incorporate more effective methods of training and continuing professional development to meet societal needs, achieved in part through regional courses for residency program directors; symposia, and keynote talks presented by ICO's World Ophthalmology Educational Colloquium, Conferences for Ophthalmic Educators, and ophthalmic surgical competency rubrics. Recognizing that standardized curricula are essential for consistent ophthalmic education, the ICO has developed a curricular framework whereby goals, expectations, knowledge base, competencies, and technical training are delineated. The ICO is defining worldwide models of team training and compiling best practice, which will include training-program accreditation to ensure improvement in the education of ophthalmologists. International Council of Ophthalmology Web-based teaching courses, a Webinar Network, and a technology blog further support information and communication technologies for teaching and learning.

The specific management of ocular manifestations in IBD requires the use of topical steroids and FANS, cycloplegics, systemic steroids or immunosuppressive drugs. When conventional therapies fail to control the ocular manifestations in IBD, the new biologic drugs can be considered as good alternative treatments.

Recent findings The potential reach of social media is overwhelmingly encouraging, but academic organizations have much work to do in order to compete for viewership on social media platforms, and users need to remain vigilant of easily spread misinformation. Individual ophthalmology practices can tailor their social media presence to attract and educate patients. Using hashtags to supplement the experience of academic conferences has boosted engagement both of attendees and other interested parties. As an effective indicator of the popularity of different subjects in medicine, new studies are leveraging social media for epidemiological models. Finally, social media is emerging as a powerful tool for patient advocacy in ophthalmology. Summary The accessibility of social media uniquely positions it to educate patients, disseminate public eye health initiatives, and increase the reach of individual physicians. It is also able to enhance the academic experience of conferences, connecting new research colleagues, and is becoming the subject of epidemiologic studies itself. Whether using social media for patient education, research, clinical practice, or patient advocacy, ophthalmologists will find social media an increasingly important workplace contributor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000772", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3161361048", "source": "openalex"}

The authors present a device which, thanks to the use of simulation, enables actual practice to be dissociated from apprenticeship. While complying with the constraints of realism with regard to habitual conditions of laser use, the device offers access to a wide variety of clinical situations. The apparatus is built around the traditional instrument. A virtual image of the fundus is produced in real time from the sensors which detect the actual gestures used. The calculations make use of textured geometrical models. Digitized color photographs are organized to form a database which reflects the diversity of pigmentations and pathologies. A software interface has been developed to facilitate the use of the device. The prototype is operated using a PC-compatible computer; it displays the images at the rate of at least seven per second on a miniature CGA screen incorporated in the slit-lamp. It is currently being validated for clinical applications. Above and beyond apprenticeship in laser photocoagulation, its potential applications extend to the entire field of ophthalmological symptomatology and, more broadly, to the simulation of any examination conducted with the help of binocular or endoscopic optics.< <ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/10.391167", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119043510", "source": "openalex"}

In the UK, the current licensed and NICE approved indications are for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema secondary to a retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and choroidal neovascularization in pathological myopia. These diagnoses alone account for two-thirds of the main causes of legally registrable visual impairment and blindness. Ranibizumab (Lucentis®; Genentech/Novartis), a drug specifically designed for intraocular use, is the primary licensed medication. Controversially however, clinicians have been using an unlicensed cheaper drug, bevacizumab (Avastin®; Genentech/Roche), originally designed for systemic administration, with a similar mode of action and shown to have a similar efficacy. However, there are fears of greater side effects with bevacizumab though studies have not been sufficiently powered to show statistical difference. In the current global economic climate, anti-VEGF treatment places huge financial and logistical pressure on already strained health care systems. Bevacizumab is considerably more cost effective than ranibizumab, and thus using bevacizumab would widen access to treatment particularly in developing countries. This licensing issue also places clinicians in a difficult medico-legal position especially in Europe, where doctors are duty bound to use a licensed drug for a particular indication if this is available. As the indications of anti-VEGF therapies expand and the cost of health care provision becomes more expensive, the controversies surrounding their use will inevitably become more important.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.12371", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1695648665", "source": "openalex"}

With the approval of the Japanese Ophthalmology Society, a scientific session on neuro-ophthalmology took place in 1964 at the annual congress of Japan Clinical Ophthalmology. This session took place every year until 1973, when it was reorganized into the Society for the Study of Neuro-ophthalmology and 2-day annual meeting was begun under the leadership of Dr Satoshi Ishikawa (Fig. 1). In 1980, the organization was renamed the Japanese Neuro-ophthalmology Society (JNOS). A formal membership system in JNOS was created in 1984, and the official journal, the Japanese Journal of Neuro-ophthalmology (Shinkei Ganka), has been published quarterly since then. In 1985, in Hakone, Japan, JNOS hosted the sixth meeting of the International Neuro-ophthalmology Society (INOS), the 14th International Pupil Colloquium, and an international workshop on extraocular muscle proprioception. These meetings attracted more than 1,000 participants from 24 countries.FIG. 1: Professor Satoshi Ishikawa.The International Scholarship (now Tsutsui-Fujino Fund) was instituted in 1992 to provide travel expenses for Asian neuro-ophthalmologists and offer them a chance to attend the annual JNOS meeting. Since then, 20 recipients from 10 Asian countries have attended the meeting. The 1st Congress of the Asian Neuro-ophthalmology Society (ASNOS) was presided over by Dr Akio Tagbuchi, and it was held in Tokyo jointly with the 40th annual meeting of JNOS in October 2002. In 2006, about 400 neuro-ophthalmologists gathered in Tokyo for the 16th INOS meeting, 3rd ASNOS meeting, and 44th JNOS meeting. Notably, a program entitled “Walsh in Asia,” modeled after the annual Frank B. Walsh Symposium, was held for the first time. It is now a part of every ASNOS meeting. Currently, there are 964 members of JNOS, including 722 ophthalmologists, 59 neurologists, 57 orthoptists, 8 otolaryngologists, and 34 basic science researchers. The current president of JNOS is Dr Masato Wakakura. There are 80 medical schools in Japan.

However, the method of delivery and tissue specificity remain the main hurdles of these approaches. Exosomes are natural carriers of functional small RNAs and proteins, representing an area of increasing interest in the field of drug delivery. It has been demonstrated that the exosome cargo, especially miRNAs, is at least partially responsible for the therapeutic effects of exosomes. Exosomes deliver their luminal content to the recipient cells and can be used as vesicles for the therapeutic delivery of RNAs and proteins. Synthetic therapeutic drugs can also be encapsulated into exosomes as they have a hydrophilic core, which makes them suitable to carry water-soluble drugs. In addition, engineered exosomes can display a variety of surface molecules, such as peptides, to target specific cells in tissues. The exosome properties present an added advantage to the targeted delivery of therapeutics, leading to increased efficacy and minimizing the adverse side effects. Furthermore, exosomes are natural nanoparticles found in all cell types and as a result, they do not elicit an immune response when administered. Exosomes have also demonstrated decreased long-term accumulation in tissues and organs and thus carry a low risk of systemic toxicity. This review aims to discuss all the advances in exosome therapies in ophthalmology and to give insight into the challenges that would need to be overcome before exosome therapies can be translated into clinical practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14932", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3171766475", "source": "openalex"}

Unfortunately, undergraduate ophthalmology teaching also had to bear the brunt of the pandemic due to the sudden discontinuation of teaching classes. To ensure that the students would not lose precious time and could continue with their academics during the lockdown, our college has shifted to online teaching of undergraduate students. Our college has an education management system (EMS) on the college website which can be accessed by the students with his/her unique ID. The ophthalmology lecture scheduled for that day was uploaded in PowerPoint format on the EMS. While making the presentation, we tried to highlight the salient points and include clinical scenarios and photographs to make it interesting for the students and to encourage them to read further on that particular topic. In addition, a WhatsApp group of all the class students along with the ophthalmology faculty was created. Reference material and related videos of clinical examination and surgical procedures were shared in this group and the students were encouraged to clear any doubts regarding the topic on this platform. Simultaneously, a Google form of 10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on the topic uploaded was designed and was shared on the WhatsApp group which was to be filled within 1 day. This served a dual purpose of ensuring that the students were reading the study material provided in a time-bound manner and also as formative assessment to gauge the student understanding of the topic. Feedback from the students was taken regarding their perception of online classes. 97.2% students felt that online classes were a viable alternative to classroom lectures in the current scenario. 84.7% of the students were familiar with online teaching platform as they had undertaken online coaching classes earlier. The main advantages as perceived by the students were: Ease of access anytime (24.7%), from anywhere (17.6%), the material could be read at any pace (12.9%), as many times (8.2%), with the comfort of accessing reference material simultaneously (7.1%). 17.6% students felt that the MCQs helped them in self-assessment. The main disadvantages as perceived by the students were that this mode of teaching was not as interactive as classroom lectures (60%), and doubts could not be cleared instantaneously (29.4%). The main hurdle faced by the students was poor Internet connectivity (85.7%) or nonavailability of device to access the study material (7.2%). In conclusion, we feel that the challenges in education posed by the COVID-19 pandemic should be treated by us as an opportunity to explore new and innovative teaching-learning techniques which could shape the nature of medical education as we currently know it. Though the platform of online teaching is not a substitute for clinical and practical learning in any way, and is not without its shortcomings, it is helping the students carry on with their academics in these uncertain times.

Ocular non-nephropathic cystinosis is typically diagnosed during adulthood, when patients present with corneal crystal deposition and no systemic involvement. Due to the rarity of the condition, diagnosis is often delayed and can have a significant impact on the overall prognosis of the disease. Early diagnosis is therefore imperative to ensure successful treatment and improve quality of life, as most of its clinical manifestations can be prevented or delayed. Early detection strategies and practical approaches for the ocular management of cystinosis were discussed during the Ophthalmology Cystinosis Forum, a 1-day meeting held in Berlin, Germany during June 2017. Recommendations for early detection comprise ophthalmic assessment, including self- and clinician-assessed recording of photophobia, and visual acuity, slit-lamp examination and tonometry ophthalmic examinations. In vivo confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography were highlighted as valuable techniques in evaluating cystine crystals in the cornea, in vivo and non-invasively. The mainstay of ocular cystinosis treatment is the cystine-depleting aminothiol cysteamine. Indeed, early treatment with and strict adherence to cysteamine therapy has a considerable impact on the long-term prognosis of ocular cystinosis. In rare diseases such as ocular cystinosis, standardised guidelines and recommendations for detection, patient care and follow-up assessments are essential. Such guidelines provide a support tool for healthcare professionals caring for ocular cystinosis patients. Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) are essential for delivering gold standard care and improving quality of life for patients and their families. This review paper highlights current early detection policies, clinical treatment strategies and practical approaches for the ocular management of cystinosis, including implementing a cystinosis MDT.

This systematic review aims to investigate software and hardware applications developed exclusively for educational environments related to ophthalmology and provide an analysis of other related tools. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages, limitations, and challenges involved in the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and game technologies in this field are also presented.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/info13050222", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4224582649", "source": "openalex"}

The significant turning point was availability of commercial digital color fundus photography in the late 1990s, which caused digital screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) to take off. Automated Retinal Disease Assessment software was then developed using machine learning to detect abnormal lesions in fundus to screen DR. The use of this version of AI had not been generalized because the specificity at 45% was not high enough, although the sensitivity reached 90%. The recent breakthrough in machine learning is the invent of deep learning, which accelerates its performance to be on par with experts. The first 2 breakthrough studies on deep learning for screening DR were conducted in Asia. The first represented collaboration of datasets between Asia and the United States for algorithms development, whereas the second represented algorithms developed in Asia but validated in different populations across the world. Both found accuracy for detecting referable DR of >95%. Diversity and variety are unique strengths of Asia for AI studies. There are many more studies of AI ongoing in Asia not only as prospective deployments in DR but in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, cataract, and systemic disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Some Asian countries have laid out plans for digital health care system using AI as one of the puzzle pieces for solving blindness.

The author reared normal infant monkeys, under conditions of binocular decorrelation, to determine if this alone was sufficient to cause esotropia and associated behavioral as well as neuroanatomic deficits.Binocular decorrelation was imposed using prism-goggles for durations of 3 to 24 weeks (in 6 experimental, 2 control monkeys). Behavioral recordings were obtained, followed by neuroanatomic analysis of ocular dominance columns and binocular, horizontal connections in the striate visual cortex (area V1).Concomitant, constant esotropia developed in each monkey exposed to decorrelation for a duration of 12 to 24 weeks. The severity of ocular motor signs (esotropia-angle; dissociated vertical deviation; latent nystagmus; pursuit/optokinetic tracking asymmetry; fusional vergence deficits), and the loss of V1 binocular connections, increased as a function of decorrelation duration. Stereopsis was deficient and motion visual evoked potentials were asymmetric. Monkeys exposed to decorrelation for 3 weeks showed transient esotropia but regained normal visuomotor behaviors and binocular V1 connections.Binocular decorrelation is a sufficient cause of infantile esotropia when imposed during a critical period of visuomotor development. The systematic relationship between severity of visuomotor sign, and severity of V1 connectivity deficit, provides a neuroanatomic mechanism for several of these signs. Restoration of binocular fusion and V1 connections, after short durations of decorrelation, helps explain the benefits of early repair in human strabismus.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145610277", "source": "openalex"}

The recent development of new enzyme therapy emphasises the need for early diagnosis and treatment of undiagnosed patients. One of the affected organs of Anderson-Fabry disease is the eye. Cornea verticillata – corneal opacities and corneal dystrophy – as well as tortuositas vasorum can occur in an early stage of the disease affecting almost all hemizygous men and more than 70% of heterozygous women. In order to identify unknown cases with Anderson-Fabry disease, we carried out a screening programme contacting Austrian ophthalmologists. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; All 658 Austrian ophthalmologists were asked to record patients with cornea verticillata as well as tortuositas vasorum – twice at an interval of 3 months. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; 33% of the contacted ophthalmologists replied, identifying 5 patients suspected of having Anderson-Fabry disease.

In exudative cases, the success rate of laser treatment guided by indocyanine green angiographic findings can vary considerably, and it is now known which angiographic presentations are not as likely to benefit. In dry macular degeneration, indocyanine green angiography appears to add clinically useful information, such as helping to identify plaques in fellow eyes with choroidal neovascularization or watershed zones that may be predictive of future exudative transformation.

Purpose: Ophthalmic features of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) include juvenile cataract, retinal hamartomas and tumours of the cranial nerves. We hypothesize that these tumours lead to strabismological and neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms, including palsies of cranial nerves III, IV and VI, nystagmus and gaze palsies. Methods: We carried out a retrospective review of 73 patients with known genotype. They underwent ophthalmic, neuro‐ophthalmological and strabismological examination. Statistical analysis was performed by calculating odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. Results: Mean best corrected visual acuity was 0.85. Strabismus was found in 38 of 73 patients (52%). A deviation based on a cranial nerve palsy was found in 16 patients (22%) and three had supranuclear palsies. Eleven of 73 patients had a nystagmus, mostly caused by peripheral–vestibular disturbance. Binocular single vision was normal in 41 (58%), subnormal in six (8%) and not present in 24 (34%) patients. The average refractive error was − 0.57 D. Myopia of ≥ 0.5 D was present in 47 (33%) eyes and hyperopia of ≥ 2.0 D was measured in 11 (8%) eyes. In the subgroup analysis of NF2 mutation types, the relative risk for cranial nerve palsies and negative stereopsis was statistically significantly increased for the nonsense mutation group. The mosaicism group had a statistically significant decreased relative risk for concomitant squint, as did patients with unfound mutations for strabismus and poor stereopsis. Conclusions: The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine a larger collection of NF2 patients for strabismological and neuro‐ophthalmological lesions. Compared with the normal population, our sample showed a higher amount of strabismus, refractive errors and an increased incidence of vestibular nystagmus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01088.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998809241", "source": "openalex"}

Data on pregnancy, birth and family history were collected. Patients were screened for any pathology in the fellow eye in unilateral disease and for any systemic anomaly.Sixteen patients had blind unilateral microphthalmos. To date there has been only one case of bilateral microphthalmos. Congenital anophthalmos was unilateral in 38 and bilateral in 20 patients. Only one of the children had a positive family history for anophthalmos. None of the mothers had had problems in pregnancy or during delivery. There were more associated systemic findings in anophthalmic (50%) than in microphthalmic (17.6%) patients. Typically, the pathology was characterised by Goldenhar's syndrome, facial clefts and developmental cerebral anomalies. Four out of 16 patients with unilateral microphthalmos (25%) and 18 out of 38 patients with unilateral anophthalmos (47.4%) had anomalies in the fellow eye, predominantly coloboma, dermoid, sclerocornea and glaucoma.

It is more profound than fire or electricity.\" - Sundar Pichai It was 72-years-ago that the British mathematician Alan Turing had posed a provocative question \"Can machines think?\" in his landmark 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\". He also described a test to evaluate the humanness of the computer.[1] The Turing Test is a 3-player imitation game in which a computer tries to fool a human interrogator into thinking that it's a person.[1] Seven decades later, despite all the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), no computer has conclusively passed the Turing Test. Despite the failure to conquer the bar of artificial general intelligence prescribed by Turing, computers have come to become an inseparable part of our lives and times. Perhaps, AI is not meant to evolve like a human mind. As Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig pointed out, \"Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\" The evolution of AI has opened yet unfathomable new paradigms in several domains that intricately affect us, including medicine. The Bloom Beyond the Dark AI Winter Unimate, the first industrial robot arm, Eliza, the natural language processor to mimic human communication, and Shakey, the first electronic person were the significant milestones in the early evolution of AI from 1950 to 1970.[2] The period 1970-2000 is referred to as AI winter when skepticism and the prohibitive cost leashed the rapid development of AI.[2] Despite the general winter, the application of AI in medicine saw some progress in these years. A consultation program for glaucoma based on casual-associational network (CASNET), MYCIN, and EMYCIN which guided decision-making for antibiotics and DXplain to generate symptoms-based differential diagnosis evolved during this period.[2] Advances in computational power, newer learning algorithms, availability of massive computer-readable data from electronic medical records, wearable health devices, accessible funding, and the positive influence of the passionate thought leaders have resulted in a seminal transformation in AI and systematic exploitation of the potential of machine learning (ML) in the last two decades. There are essentially three types of AI – artificial narrow intelligence (weak AI), artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence.[3] Based on likeness to the human mind, AI and AI-enabled devices can be classified as 1. reactive machines, 2. limited memory machines, 3. theory of mind AI, and 4. self-aware AI.[3] AI has itself evolved into several unique but inter-connected subfields [Fig. 1]. The domain of ML has radically expanded to include deep learning (DL) and neural networks [Fig. 2].Figure 1: Various domains of artificial intelligenceFigure 2: Deep learning is a type of machine learning. A convolutional neural network is a variant of deep learningConvolutional neural network (CNN) is an advanced multilayered variant of DL, which simulates interconnected neurons of the human brain to analyze an input image to recognize patterns.[2] Le-NET, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet are some of the CNN algorithms.[2] IBM Watson was developed to answer the quiz show Jeopardy!. In 2011, it competed on Jeopardy! against champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, winning the prize of $1 million. It is based on DeepQA (which \"deeply analyzes natural language input to better find, synthesize, deliver, and organize relevant answers and their justifications\")[4] and leads the pack in clinical applications of AI. Watson Sugar. IQ helps optimize diabetes management.[4] Watson for Oncology (WFO) supports 12 common cancers accounting for 80% of overall cancer incidence. WFO, together with Watson for Genomics, Watson Clinical Trials Matching, and Watson for Drug Discovery, is helping to make cancer care knowledge-powered, evidence-based, and target-driven to optimize the outcomes.[5] Current real-world applications of AI in medicine include disease diagnosis (based on input X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, histopathology, clinical photographs, electrocardiogram, etc), triage, risk stratification, risk prediction, AI-assisted clinical decision-making, personalized treatment, virtual nursing assistant, target drug development and repurposing, and gene editing.[6] AI and the Eye Ophthalmic applications of AI are not new. The CASNET-based glaucoma consultation program in 1976 was demonstrated the feasibility of applying the ML aspect of AI in clinical practice.[7] Ophthalmology, being an image-based and data-rich specialty of medicine, possibly has the widest scope for the application of AI. DL algorithms in ophthalmology are designed centered on disease-based learning, where the clinician assigns specific known characteristics of the disease on the image canvas for the machine to recognize and learn, and the output is verifiable against the identifiers of the disease recognizable by expert human observers.[8] The Google Brain DL algorithm intriguingly taught itself to correctly identify the recognition attributes of DR in anonymized images, and this is termed image-based (\"black box\") learning.[9] The most promising AI tools are currently in the field of the retina – for diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). There are AI models applicable to glaucoma, keratoconus, cataract, and other anterior segment diseases and oculoplastic surgery.[8] This issue of the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology carries publications on AI-applications in glaucoma, ultrasonography, and the acceptability of AI-based retinal screening.[101112] Diabetic retinopathy Community-based screening, timely referral, and appropriate treatment constitute the robust three-pronged strategy to prevent blindness from DR. Availability of adequate screening resources, however, remains a challenge. The application of AI can help screen large populations with minimal manpower and maximal efficiency, and accurately identify the pre-defined referrable disease for expedited treatment and thus, can have far-reaching consequences. Abràmoff et al.[13] reported a sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 87.0% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.980 in the detection of referable DR. Gargeya et al.[14] cross-validated the results and found comparable results with two other datasets. Gulshan et al.[15] reported excellent results using a Google AI-based DL system with an AUC was 0.990 and 0.991 for two different datasets. Ting et al.[16] validated the application of AI in DR screening using real-world data from 10 datasets in 6 countries with an AUC of 0.936, sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 91.6% in detecting referable DR and an AUC of 0.958, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 91.1% in detecting vision-threatening DR. In a prospective study, Abràmoff et al.[17] achieved 87.2% sensitivity and 90.7% specificity. Their IDx-DR (Digital Diagnostics, Corville, IA, USA) was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved autonomous AI device in medicine, designed to detect diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.[18] Topcon TRC-NW400 (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) digital fundus camera is IDx-DR incorporated.[18] EyeArt (Eyenuk, Woodland Hills, Ca, USA) is a FDA-approved autonomous AI to detect more-than-mild and vision-threatening DR and works with with two non-mydriatic fundus cameras - Canon CR-2 AF and the Canon CR-2 Plus AF (Canon, Irvine, CA, USA).[18] EyeArt achieved a high 96% sensitivity and a modest 88% specificity in detecting more-than-mild DR as compared to expert observers. It demonstrated 92% sensitivity and 94% specificity in detecting vision-threatening DR.[18] Age-related macular degeneration and other macular diseases With AMD becoming a looming public health problem, the application for AI for screening of referrable AMD is of immediate interest. Ting et al.,[16] using the DR screening image set, demonstrated 0.932 AUC, 93.20% sensitivity, and 88.70% specificity in detecting referable AMD. A diagnostic accuracy ranging from 88.4% and 91.6%, with an AUC between 0.94 and 0.96 was reported using image segmentation with the AREDS data.[19] Grassmann et al.[20] reported 84.2% sensitivity in the detection of any AMD. The large-scale availability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, relative consistency of OCT scans, and intricate structural details that OCT images provide make these an ideal fodder for DL in macular diseases.[16] Beginning with the automated classification of AMD using the two-dimensional OCT images, then on to segmentation of retinal anatomical boundaries and finally combining the power of segmentation and classification to identify standard retinal lesions, DL is now used to triage patients with macular pathologies (choroidal neovascularization, macular edema, drusen, geographic atrophy, epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular traction, macular hole, central serous chorioretinopathy, etc.), for triage and referral (urgent, semi-urgent, routine, observation) in the setting of an unsupervised virtual clinic with accuracy comparable to that of experts.[16] Retinopathy of prematurity The management of retinopathy of prematurity is based on timely screening. While expert- and telemedicine-based screening are established strategies, a fully automated DL system was able to accurately identify plus disease with an AUC of 0.98.[21] The i-ROP DL system matched the consensus diagnosis more often than six of the eight international experts.[22] It could also assign an objective severity score for monitoring of disease progression, regression, and response to treatment over time.[22] In being able to detect pre-plus or worse disease, DL algorithm had 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity when compared to the experts.[22] Homegrown 3 nethra camera (Forus Health Incorporated, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India) has also demonstrated high performance in accurately identifying the ROP stage in retinal images.[23] Glaucoma Glaucoma is a potentially blinding disease that is amenable to screening. DL algorithms have been trained to identify glaucoma-like disc and to recognize glaucomatous nerve fiber layer damage on wide-angle OCTs,[24] detect early visual field loss,[25] and recognize progression earlier than conventional strategies. A prediction tool that uses intraocular pressure and visual field data to project trajectories of clinical scenarios at various levels of target IOPs is available.[26] Future possibilities include the identification of optic discs associated with the potential loss of visual field and recognition of serial structural changes in the optic disc over time. Anterior segment disorders Goh et al.[27] have explored the application of AI for cataract screening using ophthalmic imaging such as fundus photographs or slit lamp images and to automate the selection of best-fit intraocular lens. Wu et al.[28] have provided an elaborate compilation of the scope and range of anterior segment AI applications [Fig. 3]. Data from a Scheimpflug camera has been used to detect keratoconus or identify preclinical keratoconus,[2930] and to assess corneal power after refractive surgery.[31] There are attempts to perform AI-based eyelid and periorbital measurements, and to plan the surgery for horizontal strabismus.[32]Figure 3: Anterior segment applications of artificial intelligence (reproduced from Wu X, Liu L, Zhao L, Guo C, Li R, Wang T, Yang X, et al. Application of artificial intelligence in anterior segment ophthalmic diseases: diversity and standardization. Ann Transl Med 2020;8:714)Challenges In ophthalmology, AI has the potential to universalize patient access to disease screening and diagnosis, help triage referral, expedite treatment as appropriate, and monitor outcomes. However, the real-life challenges to large-scale clinical application of AI in ophthalmology include \"1. availability of validated AI solution suitable for practical application by a combination of DL systems with clinically acceptable performance and ability to receive images of varying quality from commonly used devices in a standard clinical setting; 2. resolution of issues of the non-homogeneous patient population, acquisition standards, and image quality; 3. dealing with interobserver variation in clinical findings and agreement between the experts regarding the threshold for referral and intervention; 4. establishing a fair quotient of trust (on part of the patient and the treating ophthalmologist) in AI-based system for critical decision-making and potential medico-legal liability and acceptability; 5. establishing standardized reporting format and consensus criteria for diagnosis/referral/triage, and 6. negotiating technological challenges and gray areas\".[33] Great Power, Greater Responsibility The World Health Organization has identified six key areas of ethical concern: \"1. Protecting human autonomy, 2. promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest, 3. ensuring transparency, explainability, and intelligibility, 4. fostering responsibility and accountability, 5. ensuring inclusiveness and equity, and 6. promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable.\"[34] As emphasized by Gerke et al.,[35] \"Informed consent, uncompromised data protection and privacy, adequate cyber resilience and cybersecurity, inherent algorithmic fairness, built-in transparency and regulatory oversight, high standards of safety and effectiveness, and provision for liability\" are the key ethical and legal elements that need to be incorporated to create a system with high level of public trust. Will AI take over the role of ophthalmologists and make them redundant? It is a very unlikely scenario. On the contrary, AI could help perform baseline screening of a large number of patients with resource-efficiency, and bring in a new set of patients (who would otherwise have been missed) with referable/treatable disease to the ophthalmologist. If played well, it is likely to be a win-win game for all the stakeholders. In 2022, we are unenviably positioned at the road divide – a physician-based medical practice as it exists today versus the attraction of AI. Do we continue to trudge through the familiar territory, or risk taking the least traveled but a potentially exciting route? A middle path with an optimal blend of traditional personal care and technology-driven personalized ophthalmology, where artificial intelligence does not cast a deep shadow on the art of medicine yet maximizes the efficiency and precision, maybe the ideal sweet spot. \"Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.\" – Ginni Rometty", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_644_22", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4225724957", "source": "openalex"}

The question of whether ChatGPT could be used to aid in medical education is yet to be answered, particularly in the field of ophthalmology. Objective The aim of this study is to assess the ability of ChatGPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5) and ChatGPT-4.0 (GPT-4.0) to answer ophthalmology-related questions across different levels of ophthalmology training. Methods Questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) steps 1 (n=44), 2 (n=60), and 3 (n=28) were extracted from AMBOSS, and 248 questions (64 easy, 122 medium, and 62 difficult questions) were extracted from the book, Ophthalmology Board Review Q&amp;A, for the Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program and the Board of Ophthalmology (OB) Written Qualifying Examination (WQE). Questions were prompted identically and inputted to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0. Results GPT-3.5 achieved a total of 55% (n=210) of correct answers, while GPT-4.0 achieved a total of 70% (n=270) of correct answers. GPT-3.5 answered 75% (n=33) of questions correctly in USMLE step 1, 73.33% (n=44) in USMLE step 2, 60.71% (n=17) in USMLE step 3, and 46.77% (n=116) in the OB-WQE. GPT-4.0 answered 70.45% (n=31) of questions correctly in USMLE step 1, 90.32% (n=56) in USMLE step 2, 96.43% (n=27) in USMLE step 3, and 62.90% (n=156) in the OB-WQE. GPT-3.5 performed poorer as examination levels advanced (P&lt;.001), while GPT-4.0 performed better on USMLE steps 2 and 3 and worse on USMLE step 1 and the OB-WQE (P&lt;.001). The coefficient of correlation (r) between ChatGPT answering correctly and human users answering correctly was 0.21 (P=.01) for GPT-3.5 as compared to –0.31 (P&lt;.001) for GPT-4.0. GPT-3.5 performed similarly across difficulty levels, while GPT-4.0 performed more poorly with an increase in the difficulty level. Both GPT models performed significantly better on certain topics than on others. Conclusions ChatGPT is far from being considered a part of mainstream medical education.

Setting: All practice types within the United States. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A survey was distributed through email listservs to several national ophthalmology societies. Participants completed a modified Mini Z Burnout Survey, a 10-item questionnaire measured in 5-point Likert scales, followed by demographic questions. The Mini Z Burnout survey assessed 3 main outcomes: stress, burnout, and work satisfaction. The percentage of subgroups experiencing burnout were presented and comparisons made with odds ratios from logistic regression modeling. Results: Of the 592 ophthalmologists responding to the survey, 37.8% (224) self-reported symptoms of burnout with a low of 30.8% (12/39) for vitreoretinal specialists to a high of 45.4% (30/66) for uveitis specialists.

The week leading up to the March 21, all appointments in the study period were categorized as follows: (1) requiring an in-person visit, (2) face-to-face visit that could be postponed, and (3) consultation required but could be virtual. Teams of administrators, schedulers, and ophthalmic technicians used defined scripts and standardized emails to communicate results of categorization to patients. Flowcharts were devised to schedule and implement telemedicine visits. Informational videos were made accessible on social media to prepare patients for the telemedicine experience. Simultaneously our children's hospital launched a pediatric on-demand e-consult service, the data analytics of which could be used to determine how many visits were eye related.ResultsA total of 237 virtual ophthalmology consult visits were offered during the study period: 212 were scheduled, and 206 were completed, of which 43 were with new patients and 163 with returning patients. Following the initial virtual visit, another was required on average in 4 weeks by 21 patients; in-person follow-up was required for 170 patients on average 4.6 months after the initial virtual visit. None needed review within 72 hours. The pediatric on-demand service completed 290 visits, of which 25 had eye complaints.ConclusionsWith proper materials, technology, and staffing, a telemedicine strategy based on three patient categories can be rapidly implemented to provide continued patient care during pandemic conditions. In our study cohort, the scheduled clinic e-visits had a low no-show rate (3%), and 8% of the on-demand virtual access for pediatric care was eye related.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2020.05.008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3082322785", "source": "openalex"}

Concerns persist regarding potential negative impacts on clinical workflow. In particular, the impact of EHR operating room (OR) management systems on clinical efficiency in the ophthalmic surgery setting is unknown.To determine the impact of an EHR OR management system on intraoperative nursing documentation time, surgical volume, and staffing requirements.For documentation time and circulating nurses per procedure, a prospective cohort design was used between January 10, 2012, and January 10, 2013. For surgical volume and overall staffing requirements, a case series design was used between January 29, 2011, and January 28, 2013. This study involved ophthalmic OR nurses (n = 13) and surgeons (n = 25) at an academic medical center.Electronic health record OR management system implementation.(1) Documentation time (percentage of operating time documenting [POTD], absolute documentation time in minutes), (2) surgical volume (procedures/time), and (3) staffing requirements (full-time equivalents, circulating nurses/procedure). Outcomes were measured during a baseline period when paper documentation was used and during the early (first 3 months) and late (4-12 months) periods after EHR implementation.There was a worsening in total POTD in the early EHR period (83%) vs paper baseline (41%) (P < .001). This improved to baseline levels by the late EHR period (46%, P = .28), although POTD in the cataract group remained worse than at baseline (64%, P < .001). There was a worsening in absolute mean documentation time in the early EHR period (16.7 minutes) vs paper baseline (7.5 minutes) (P < .001). This improved in the late EHR period (9.2 minutes) but remained worse than in the paper baseline (P < .001). While cataract procedures required more circulating nurses in the early EHR (mean, 1.9 nurses/procedure) and late EHR (mean, 1.5 nurses/procedure) periods than in the paper baseline (mean, 1.0 nurses/procedure) (P < .001), overall staffing requirements and surgical volume were not significantly different between the periods.Electronic health record OR management system implementation was associated with worsening of intraoperative nursing documentation time especially in shorter procedures.

Ophthalmology consultations in a hospital present unique challenges to those seen in an outpatient clinic, for which the consulting ophthalmologist should be prepared. The purpose of this study was to profile the emergency room and inpatient ophthalmology consultations seen at an academic institution. A prospective study of 581 patients was conducted on inpatient and emergency room ophthalmology consultations at the University of Illinois at Chicago over twelve months. Characteristics such as the consulting service, type of and reason for consultation, subspecialty staffing service, diagnosis, and suitability for in-hospital evaluation were recorded. Consultations were received from either inpatient wards (59.4%) or the Emergency Department (40.6%). The most common inpatient consulting services were internal medicine (22%), followed by neurosurgery (16%) and neurology (7%). All the consultations were categorized as acute (72.3%), chronic (6.0%), or screening (21.7%). Consultations categorized as screening included papilledema (31.0%), fungemia (20.6%), syndromic evaluation (19.8%), visual field evaluation (17.5%), and miscellaneous evaluation (11.1%). We classified the ophthalmic diagnoses into 63 unique diagnoses. Amongst the ophthalmic subspecialties, neuro-ophthalmologic diagnoses were the most common (32.0%), followed by retina (20.1%) and cornea (19.4%). Neuro-ophthalmology had the highest proportion of screening consultations (36.6%), while glaucoma had the least overall number of consultations (10.1%), and the least proportion of screening consultations (3.6%). A significant proportion of nonacute consultations (19.0%) was deemed to be more suitable for outpatient evaluation. Consultation databases can be useful in preparing trainees for in-hospital clinical care. A wide range of ocular pathologies may present to the ophthalmology consultant, from acute trauma to screening for systemic syndromes. Some consultations may be more suitable for outpatient evaluation which may help optimize patient care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/7807391", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2911492826", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Ten patients with orbital fibrous dysplasia underwent bifrontal craniotomy through a coronal flap, with the removal of the supraorbital arch and dysplastic process involving the anterior and middle base of the skull. Four patients underwent superior orbital fissure and optic nerve canal decompression. Reconstruction was performed by using an autologous bone graft for both the adults and children, in whom a rib graft was preferred. The mean follow-up was 53.2 ± 18.3 months (range, 14 to 94 months). The patients’ preoperative status and postoperative status were compared. Results: The immediate and long-term morphologic and aesthetic results were good in all cases. All of the patients complained of some degree of diplopia during the immediate postoperative period, but the problem spontaneously resolved within 1 to 6 months in all but one case. No postoperative reduction in visual function was observed in the patients who underwent optic nerve decompression. The only reported complication was the irregular reabsorption of regrafted dysplastic bone in one patient.

Similarly, the students self-assessed their skills. In Year 3, a required ophthalmology small-group module during the family medicine (FM) clerkship reinforced these skills. The authors audited history and physicals in two Year 3 clerkships and in one Year 4 subinternship to evaluate charted examination performance. They objectively assessed simulator-based ophthalmoscopy post-FM clerkship and post-Year 3 training.Preceptors rated 100% of students competent in all eye examination modalities post initial training; 98% of students self-rated themselves competent in disc visualization. An expert auditor found documented FM funduscopies (46%) surpassed those in a prior observational study (11%). Funduscopic retraining significantly improved performance on post-Year 3 objective assessment (mean score 55% retrained versus 19% nonretrained, P=.0005). However, 43% of FM and 91% of internal medicine workups reflected inadequate overall eye evaluations. Subinternship notes documented muscle excursions in 95% and pupils in 71% but recorded no funduscopies.Additional training successfully reinforced skills performance, which nonetheless decayed when not habitually practiced.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of medical records from patients who underwent corneal transplantation surgeries at Fundación Oftalmológica de Santander (FOSCAL) in Bucaramanga, Colombia, between August 2004 and August 2011. Results: During this period from a total of 450 corneal transplants performed, we had access to 402 medical records (89.4%). The patients’ mean age was 55. Leading indications were: pseudophakic/aphakic bullous kerathopathy (PBK/ABK) (34.6%), corneal scar (15.7%), active infectious keratitis (14.4%) and keratoconus (12.7%).

Recent findings The advent of deep learning in medicine has introduced models with remarkable accuracy. However, the inherent complexity of these models undermines its users’ ability to understand, debug and ultimately trust them in clinical practice. Novel methods are being increasingly explored to improve models’ ’interpretability’ and draw clearer associations between their outputs and features in the input dataset. In the field of ophthalmology, interpretability methods have enabled users to make informed adjustments, identify clinically relevant imaging patterns, and predict outcomes in deep learning models. Summary Interpretability methods support the transparency necessary to implement, operate and modify complex deep learning models.

However, information regarding ophthalmological manifestation and its impact on vision is sparse in the literature. This study evaluated the spectrum of ophthalmological manifestations in tuberculous meningitis, including retinal nerve fiber layer thickness assessment by optic coherence tomography and its correlation with visual and clinical outcome. This was a prospective observational study done from October 2015 to March 2017. Consecutive patients of tuberculous meningitis, diagnosed as per consensus case definition were included in the study. The patients were divided into two categories: uncomplicated and complicated tuberculous meningitis. Clinical evaluation, cerebrospinal fluid examination and contrast enhanced MRI of brain was done. Detailed ophthalmological evaluation including optic coherence tomography was done in all patients. All the patients were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was blindness or low vision after 6 months. The secondary outcome was death or severe disability after 6 months. It was defined as modified Barthel index (MBI) ≤ 12 at 6 months (including disability plus death). Appropriate statistical analysis was done. Out of 101 patients of tuberculous meningitis, 47 patients of TBM belonged to uncomplicated category, while 54 patients were of complicated group. The visual impairment was present in 24 out of 101 (23.76%) patients out of which 20 (19.8%) patients had low vision while 4 (3.96%) had blindness. The visual impairment was more evident in complicated group, low vision 0.03 (1.2–31.5). The most common abnormality on fundus examination was papilledema (22.8%). The complicated group had more incidence <0.0001 (19.6–48). Optic atrophy was found in three patients while choroid tubercles were found in eight patients (all complicated TBM group). RNFL thinning was noted in 10 patients in both the eyes. On univariate analysis, presence of diplopia at baseline, impairment of color vision at baseline, visual impairment at baseline, cranial nerve VIth involvement, optic atrophy and papilledema at baseline, RNFL thinning, abnormal VEP and baseline MBI were associated with poor visual outcome. On multivariate analysis, none of the factors were found to be independently associated with poor visual outcome. On univariate analysis, many factors including baseline MRC staging, altered sensorium, seizure, hemiparesis, basal exudates, infarcts, optochiasmaticarachnoiditis, visual impairment at baseline were found to be associated with poor clinical outcome at 6 months. On multivariate analysis, presence of seizure (P = 0.047, odds ratio = 78.59, 95% confidence interval (1.07–578.72)) was the only factor found to be independently associated with poor outcome. Wide spectrum of ophthalmological manifestation was observed in patients of tuberculous meningitis. The visual impairment was more evident in complicated tuberculous meningitis. Ophthalmological findings like optic atrophy, papilledema and RNFL thinning were associated with poor visual outcome on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Visual impairment at baseline, among other factors was associated with poor clinical outcome on univariate analysis, whereas seizure was the only factor independently associated with poor outcome on multivariate analysis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcz037", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2921161490", "source": "openalex"}

Methods : A review of the follow up, subsequent management and outcomes of the neuro‐ophthalmological complications of eight patients with SLE. Results : The patients presented with a myriad of symptoms of varying severities. The most common manifestations were that of optic neuropathy and eye movement abnormalities. The outcome was variable ranging from complete recovery to optic atrophy with navigational visual acuity. Treatment was often empirical, although early treatment with corticosteroids has been tried with varying success. Conclusions : The pathophysiology in the neuro‐ ophthalmological manifestations of SLE is thought be due to vaso‐occlusive disease of the small vessels of the nerve and brain, secondary to an autoimmune process.

The median age of arthritis onset in children who developed uveitis was 2.5 years (range 1-10) versus 5.0 years (range 1-15) in those who did not. Sex ratio was 3.5:1 (girl:boy). The most prevalent JIA subtype was oligoarthritis (75%). All but one child with uveitis was found to be ANA (+). The median interval between diagnosis of arthritis and uveitis was 12 months. Only one child developed uveitis between the fourth and fifth years after arthritis onset. Ocular complications were recorded in 45.6% (26/57 affected eyes) at last follow-up.

Public health response includes a rapid reorganization of the Italian National Healthcare System in order to reduce transmission of COVID-19 within hospitals and healthcare facilities, while optimizing the assistance to patients with severe COVID-19 complications. Methods We analysed the actions that were taken in three ophthalmology centres in northern Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and how these measures affected patient’s attendance. In addition, due to the rapidly evolving scenario, we reviewed the evidence available during the course of this pandemic. Results A full reorganization of ophthalmology services is mandatory according to current existing infection containment measures in order to continue dispensing urgent procedures without endangering the community with amplification of the diffusion chain. Ophthalmologists are considered at elevated risk of exposure when caring patients and vice versa, due to their close proximity during eye examination. High volumes of procedures typically generated by ophthalmologists with concurrent implications on the risk of infection are considered when re-assessing healthcare facilities reorganization.

These pressures are especially pronounced in academic medical centers, where delivery of care must be balanced with medical education. However, the association of the presence of trainees with clinical efficiency in outpatient ophthalmology clinics is not known.To quantify the association of the presence of trainees (residents and fellows) and efficiency in an outpatient ophthalmology clinic.This single-center cohort study was conducted from January 1 through December 31, 2014, at an academic department of ophthalmology. Participants included 49 448 patient appointments with 33 attending physicians and 40 trainees.Presence vs absence of trainees in an appointment or clinic session, as determined by review of the EHR audit log.Patient appointment time, as determined by time stamps in the EHR clinical data warehouse. Linear mixed models were developed to analyze variability among clinicians and patients.Among the 33 study physicians (13 women [39%] and 20 men [61%]; median age, 44 years [interquartile range, 39-53 years]), appointments with trainees were significantly longer than appointments in clinic sessions without trainees (mean [SD], 105.0 [55.7] vs 80.3 [45.4] minutes; P < .001). The presence of a trainee in a clinic session was associated with longer mean appointment time, even in appointments for which the trainee was not present (mean [SD], 87.2 [49.2] vs 80.3 [45.4] minutes; P < .001). Among 33 study physicians, 3 (9%) had shorter mean appointment times when a trainee was present, 1 (3%) had no change, and 29 (88%) had longer mean appointment times when a trainee was present. Linear mixed models showed the presence of a resident was associated with a lengthening of appointment time of 17.0 minutes (95% CI, 15.6-18.5 minutes; P < .001), and the presence of a fellow was associated with a lengthening of appointment time of 13.5 minutes (95% CI, 12.3-14.8 minutes; P < .001).Presence of trainees was associated with longer appointment times, even for patients not seen by a trainee.

Despite the highly variable phenotypic penetration, its classical triad include a) optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH), b) agenesis of septum pellucidum and corpus callosum, and c) hypoplasia of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. SOD has stringent diagnostic criteria requiring 2 or more features of the classic triad, therefore it represents a separate entity from other conditions such as ONH and achiasmia syndromes which share only some of these aspects, or SOD plus syndrome which is characterized by additional cortical abnormalities. Starting from its etiology and epidemiology, this narrative review focuses on the management of SOD patients, including their diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. To date, SOD is not curable; nonetheless, many of its symptoms can be improved through a tailored approach, consisting of hormonal replacement, corrective ophthalmological surgery and neuropsychological support.

A total of 3220 diabetic patients, 483 with an age at diagnosis <30 years, and 2737 with an age at diagnosis > or = 30 years, were included. Retinopathy was graded on fundus photographs using the Wisconsin Scale, and the visual acuity was assessed. The average HbA1c value was calculated for each patient for the previous 8 years to estimate long-term glycaemic control. Mortality data were obtained from death certificates. Two hundred and sixty-three diabetic patients (8.2%) died during the mean follow-up time of 3.4 years, 13 (2.7%) of those with younger-onset (<30 years) and 250 (9.1%) of those with older-onset (> or = 30 years) diabetes. Of them, 148 (56.3%) died from cardiovascular and 23 (8.7%) from cerebrovascular disorders. After adjusting for differences in age and sex, more severe retinopathy and the use of antihypertensive drugs were associated with a decreased overall survival rate as well as an increased mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. A statistically significant association between HbA1c values in the highest quartile, i.e. > or =8.4%, and cardiovascular and all cause mortality did not remain when retinopathy was entered into the multivariate analyses. Duration of diabetes, but not change of treatment to insulin therapy, was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality in patients whose diabetes was diagnosed after the age of 30 years.

This paper presents a comparative study of stochastic, momentum, Nesterov, AdaGrad, RMSProp, AdaDelta, Adam, AdaMax and Nadam gradient descent algorithms based on the speed of convergence of these different algorithms, as well as the mean absolute error of each algorithm in the generation of an optimization solution. The obtained results show that AdaGrad algorithm represents the best performances than the other algorithms with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.3858 in 53 iterations and AdaDelta one represents the lowest performances with a MAE of 0.6035 in 6000 iterations. The case study treated in this work is based on an extract of data from the keratoconus dataset of Harvard Dataverse and the results are obtained using Python.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1743/1/012002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3124567770", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: The LitCovid database was systematically reviewed for ophthalmology-focused COVID-19 articles. The quality of the evidence was assessed for articles investigating conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients. Results: There were 21,364 articles in LitCovid on June 12, 2020, of which 215 (1%) were ophthalmology-focused. Of articles on COVID-19 transmission, 3.3% were ophthalmology-focused. Ophthalmology-focused articles were published in 68 journals and originated from 25 countries. The top five countries publishing ophthalmology-focused articles (China, India, United States of America, Italy, and United Kingdom) produced 145/215 (67%) articles. A total of 16 case reports/series from eight countries reported that conjunctivitis can be the initial or the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. Conjunctivitis may occur in the middle phase of COVID-19 illness.

We propose that the future of IOL selection will be guided by 3D quantitative imaging of the crystalline lens to map lens opacities, anticipate IOL position, and develop fully customized eye models for ray-tracing-based IOL selection. Conversely, visual simulators (in which IOL designs are programmed in active elements) allow patients to experience prospective vision before surgery and to make more informed decisions about which IOL to choose.

Patients were sedated with 80 mg/kg of chloral hydrate (CH) given orally with top up dose given at half dose as required. All demographic data, sedation and procedure duration, sedation success and adverse events were recorded. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with success and complications. <h3>Results</h3> Data was collected for 1509 sedation episodes. More boys were sedated compared with girls (56.3% vs 43.7% p=0.0003) with an average age of 23.86 months and weight of 11.76 kg. A higher proportion of patients had an American Society of Anaesthesiologists status of II than I (58.5%:41.5%, p=0.0001). Successful sedation was obtained in 96.69% of children with 4.77% requiring a top up dose to achieve this. The average sedation duration was 53.4 min (SD=21.5) with an average of 1.7 procedures performed; the most common being a detailed examination (93.5%) and electroretinogram (45.1%). Adverse events included paradoxical reaction (1.33%), oxygen desaturation (0.99%) and vomiting (0.53%). There were no serious complications or hospital admission. Multiple logistic regression analysis found weight greater than 15 kg and needing a top up dose to be significant risk factors for Failure (OR=2.49 and 8.69, respectively) and Adverse events (OR=2.1 and 3.97, respectively). Sex and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status score did not significantly affect outcomes. <h3>Conclusions</h3> CH sedation allows detailed examination and investigations in the majority of children with few side effects. Patients over 15 kg and need for a top up dose are risk factors for failure and adverse events.

One direction towards enhancing ocular tissue regeneration on biomaterials, in the laboratory is by applying biomimicry. Specifically to engineer biomaterials with important functional elements of the native extracellular matrices, such as topography, that support and organise cells into coherent tissues. Further problems in regenerative ophthalmology can be potentially solved through application of biomimicry. They include, more efficient ways of moving and transplanting cultivated tissues into correct therapeutic locations inside the eye and scar‐less, non‐destructive healing of surgical incisions and wounds, to repair structural integrity of tissues at the ocular surface. Two examples are given to show this potential for redeveloping an ocular epithelium onto a nanostructured insect wing surface and producing an origami membrane modelled on deployable structures in nature.

SCOTS is an Institutional Review Board approved clinical study utilizing autologous BMSC in the treatment of optic nerve and retinal diseases that meet inclusion criteria.The average age of the patients treated was 69.8 years. The average duration of visual loss in eyes treated was 9.8 years and ranged from 1 to 35 years. Affected eyes were treated with either retrobulbar, subtenons and intravenous BMSC or, following vitrectomy, intra-optic nerve, subtenons and intravenous BMSC. The primary outcome was visual acuity as measured by Snellen or converted to LogMAR.Following therapy in SCOTS, 80% of patients experienced improvement in Snellen binocular vision (P=0.029) with 20% remaining stable; 73.6% of eyes treated gained vision (P=0.019) and 15.9% remained stable in the post-operative period. There was an average of 3.53 Snellen lines of vision improvement per eye with an average 22.74% and maximum 83.3% improvement in LogMAR acuity per eye. The average LogMAR change in treated eyes was a gain of 0.364 (P=0.0089). Improvements typically manifested no later than 6 months post procedure.The use of BMSC in the Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study achieved meaningful visual improvements in a significant percentage of the NAION patients reported. Improvements typically manifested no later than 6 months post-procedure. Duration of visual loss did not appear to affect the ability of the eyes to respond to treatment. Possible mechanisms by which visual improvement occurred may include BMSC paracrine secretion of proteins and hormones, transfer of mitochondria, release of messenger RNA or other compounds via exosomes or microvesicles and neuronal transdifferentiation of the stem cells.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21037/sci.2017.11.05", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768806303", "source": "openalex"}

Baseline visual acuity (VA) was tabulated and analysis of the RPE tear was performed with multimodal imaging. Follow-up VA, progression of the tear, and severity of fibrosis were evaluated, and each was correlated with number of anti-VEGF injections.Average follow-up for the 56 eyes was 42 months, and mean logMAR VA at baseline was 0.88 (Snellen VA 20/150) with minimal decline over 3 years. LogMAR VA plotted against number of anti-VEGF injections demonstrated that more frequent and cumulative injections correlated with better VA (P<.0001). A greater number of anti-VEGF injections was associated with minimal progression of the RPE tear, reduced fibrosis, and lower risk of a large, end-stage exudative disciform scar.Fifteen to 20% of vascularized pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) may develop RPE tears after anti-VEGF therapy due to progressive contraction of the type 1 choroidal neovascular membrane in a PED at risk. Continued monitoring of RPE tears for exudative changes warranting anti-VEGF therapy may stabilize VA, improve anatomical outcomes, reduce fibrosis, and decrease the risk of developing a large blinding end-stage exudative disciform scar.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2186806850", "source": "openalex"}

This review summarizes recent works on mechanisms of apoptosis, from its initiation and modulation to the switching-on of its execution machinery. Interactions of cell death with cell division programs to orchestrate ontogenesis, aging, and adult life and their alterations in human diseases are pointed out. Two main apoptotic signaling pathways are identified: a death receptor-dependent (extrinsic) pathway and a mitochondrion-dependent (intrinsic) pathway. Mitochondrion harbors both anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-X L ) and apoptotic factors (Smac/Diablo, Apaf-1, cytochrome c). Its permeability transition pore (mPTP) is the main trigger of cell suicide. The process of mPTP opening, in association with extrusion to cytoplasm of a variety of apoptotic factors, is shown. Cytochrome c is one of these apoptotic factors. When expelled to cytoplasm, this double-faced respiratory chain component assembles with two other modules, Apaf-1 and procaspase 9, to form a protein complex – the apoptosome – that starts apoptosis execution. Another respiratory chain component, the CoQ 10 , is believed to counteract mPTP opening. What makes apoptosis particularly exciting for medicine is that its dysfunctions play a central role in the pathogenesis of several human diseases. For instance, excesses of apoptosis lead to cell loss that accompanies neurodegenerative diseases, whereas genetically determined defects of apoptosis lead to the deregulated cell proliferation typical of cancer. A variety of ophthalmologic diseases, such as post-keratectomy haze, corneal lesions, cataract, glaucoma, senile maculopathies, and genetic ocular pathologies, that underlie apoptosis dysfunctions are treated in detail in the other reviews of this issue.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/112067210301303s03", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143708081", "source": "openalex"}

Deep features were extracted from fundus images with the proposed R-CNN+LSTM structure. Among the deep features extracted, those with high representative power were selected with an approach called NCAR, which is a multilevel feature selection algorithm. In the classification phase, the SVM algorithm, which is a powerful classifier, was used. The proposed approach is evaluated on the eight-class ODIR dataset.

Patient opinions regarding these data help us to understand concerns and policymakers to improve reporting mechanisms for such payments.To assess patient perceptions of Open Payments information.This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted in 3 ophthalmology clinic sites of an academic institution in Manhattan, New York City, New York. All patients older than 18 years who were waiting for appointments were eligible. Data were collected from January to June 2016 and analyzed from June to September 2016.Participants answered 27 questions about the Open Payments database in English or Spanish. Demographic information was also collected.Key questionnaire results included patient awareness of the Open Payments database and perceptions of physicians' financial relationships. Cronbach α validation of the survey was performed, and Poisson multivariable regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between patient characteristics and responses.A total of 407 individuals participated. The mean (SD) age of study participants was 58.8 (17.9) years, and 220 (54.2%) were women. Of these, 30 (7.3% [95% CI, 5.1%-19.4%]) were aware of the Open Payments database, and 109 (26.8% [95% CI, 24.8%-34.0%]) planned to access it. More than half (n = 212; 53.5% [95% CI, 48.6%-58.5%]) wanted to know if their physician receives industry payments. Regarding payments of any kind valuing $100, 161 (41.9% [95% CI, 37.0%-46.9%]) disapproved. Similarly, 178 (45.8% [95% CI, 40.8%-50.7%]) disapproved of $500 payments, and 221 (57.0% [95% CI, 52.0%-61.9%]) disapproved of $25 000 payments. Poisson multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that participants who took the survey in Spanish were 38% more likely to approve of physicians receiving payments than were those who took the survey in English (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.38 [95% CI, 1.19-1.59]; P < .001). For every 1 year of age, the likelihood of approval for a physician receiving payments decreased by 1% (IRR, 0.995 [95% CI, 0.99-1.00]; P = .007). Participants with graduate degrees were 20% less likely to approve of physicians receiving payments, compared with those with less than a high school degree (IRR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.97]; P = .02).If the survey is validated, and if these results are generalizable outside of the 3 academic centers in ophthalmology surveyed, the findings suggest that many patients disapprove of physicians receiving payments from industry. However, few patients had accessed the Open Payments database or planned to access it.

This study sought to identify factors affecting the choice to pursue or not pursue neuro-ophthalmology fellowship training by graduating ophthalmology residents and recently graduated neuro-ophthalmology fellows.An anonymous survey was sent to Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology residency directors to distribute to post-graduate Year 4 (PGY4) ophthalmology residents graduating in either 2018 or 2019. A second anonymous survey was distributed via the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) Young Neuro-Ophthalmologists listserv to ophthalmology-trained neuro-ophthalmology fellows. A total of 147 respondents, including 96 PGY4 ophthalmology residents not going into neuro-ophthalmology and 51 practicing neuro-ophthalmologists are included.The most common reasons for residents to choose to not pursue further training in neuro-ophthalmology included a stronger interest in other fields, types of patients seen, no intraocular surgery, and the assumption that it is a nonsurgical discipline. The leading factors influencing graduated, ophthalmology-trained fellows to choose neuro-ophthalmology included interest in the clinical diseases treated, interaction with other specialty fields, and a supportive NANOS culture. Interestingly, despite perceptions of graduating residents, two-thirds of the neuro-ophthalmologists surveyed perform surgery. There were no differences between the 2 groups with respect to the degree of exposure to neuro-ophthalmology in medical school, presence of a dedicated neuro-ophthalmology rotation in residency, or timing of the rotation.There are a variety of factors influencing decisions regarding pursuing neuro-ophthalmology fellowship among ophthalmology residents. The perceived lack of surgical opportunities in neuro-ophthalmology is a deterrent for many. However, a significant number of neuro-ophthalmologists continue to perform surgery, including intraocular surgery. Repeated exposure later in residency may provide an opportunity to reconsider the field and to re-emphasize opportunities to remain surgically involved as a neuro-ophthalmologist. Exposure to the practice patterns of recently graduated neuro-ophthalmologists offers residents in training excellent exposure to the contemporary practice of neuro-ophthalmology. Hence, ensuring trainees receive a balanced exposure to practicing neuro-ophthalmologists across the spectrum of seniority and scope of practice may promote greater interest among ophthalmology residents to pursue a career in neuro-ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000001239", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4225426842", "source": "openalex"}

However, details on the prevalence, severity and impact of ophthalmological disorders thus far lacking. We aimed to identify PD patients with undetected ophthalmological disorders in a large cross-sectional, observational study. Methods We previously delivered a screening questionnaire to detect ophthalmological symptoms (Visual impairment in PD questionnaire; VIPD-Q) to 848 patients. Here, we report on a subgroup of 102 patients who received complete ophthalmological assessment aimed at identifying clinically relevant ophthalmological diseases, which were classified as either vison-threatening or not. Impact on daily life functioning was measured using the visual functioning-25 questionnaire (VFQ-25) and fall frequency. Results Almost all patients (92%) had one or more clinically relevant ophthalmological disorders. Of those, 77% had a potentially vision-threatening disease, while 34% had a potentially treatable ophthalmological disease which impacted on quality of life. The most prevalent ophthalmological disorders were dry eyes (86%), ocular misalignment (50%) and convergence insufficiency (41%). We found a weak but significant association between clinically relevant ophthalmological diseases and both fall frequency ( R 2 = 0.15, p = 0.037) and VFQ-25 score ( R 2 = 0.15, p = 0.02). The VIPD-Q could not correctly identify patients with relevant ophthalmological disorders. Conclusions Surprisingly, in our study sample, many participants manifested previously undetected ophthalmological diseases, most of which threatened vision, impacted on daily life functioning and were amenable to treatment. Screening for these ophthalmological disorders using a questionnaire asking about symptoms seems insufficient. Instead, episodic ophthalmological assessments should be considered for PD patients, aiming to identify vision-threatening yet treatable diseases.

A masked observational non-interventional study included 304 eyes of 152 consecutive glaucoma cases attending general clinic. CCT was measured using a hand-held pachymeter. IOP, as measured by the Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT), was adjusted for CCT using a normogram. Two identical study sheets were retrospectively constructed from each subject's case notes: one included the CCT and adjusted IOP information, the other excluded. Study sheets were randomly presented to a single masked observer to decide glaucoma management. The difference in management decision was noted. The mean ± standard deviation CCT was 561.5 ± 35.7 μm, 538.9 ± 41.4 μm, 538.3 ± 40.3 μm for ocular hypertension (OHT), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) subjects respectively. IOP adjustment was greater than ±2 mmHg in 33.9%(103/304) of eyes. CCT and adjusted IOP information led to different treatment option in 37%(55/152). Of the most important changes 20.4%(31/152) cases would have been commenced on additional IOP-lowering medication, 2.0%(3/152) would have been counselled for trabeculectomy surgery and 3.3%(5/152) of the cohort would have been observed rather than treated. CCT and adjusted IOP measurement can influence glaucoma management in a clinical context.

Data analysis was completed in March 2019.Comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation for children with primary brain tumors.Percentage of patients with ophthalmology evaluation, prevalence of abnormal ophthalmic findings, and their association with tumor characteristics.A total of 141 children (73 [52%] male; median [range] age, 7 [0-18] years) with primary brain tumors were enrolled in this study. Seventy-three patients (41 [52%] male; median [range] age, 8 [0-17] years) never had formal ophthalmologic evaluation. Sixty-eight patients (32 [48%] male; median [range] age, 7 [0-18] years) were evaluated by 1 of 4 board-certified, fellowship-trained pediatric and/or neuro-ophthalmologists for any visual impairment over a total of 222 visits. Five-year overall survival for patients who had eye examination was not significantly different from those who did not (mean [SD] survival, 78.3% [6.2%] vs 84.9% [4.7%]). Median (range) time from tumor diagnosis to initial ophthalmologic evaluation was 9 (0-94) months. Only 10 of 68 children (15%) presented with visual symptoms at tumor diagnosis, while 61 of 68 (90%) had abnormal findings on examination, including strabismus (41 [60%]), visual acuity impairment (37 [54%]), amblyopia (26 [38%]), papilledema (24 [35%]), visual field defects (13 [19%]), optic atrophy (12 [18%]), and keratopathy (10 [15%]). Strabismus occurred more frequently in patients with posterior fossa tumors (26 of 68 in posterior fossa vs 15 of 68 in other locations; P = .02).

The theoretical foundations of DL are well-rooted in the classical neural network (NN). Rule extraction is not a new concept, but was originally devised for a shallow NN. For about the past 30 years, extensive efforts have been made by many researchers to resolve the \"black box\" problem of trained shallow NNs using rule extraction technology. A rule extraction technology that is well-balanced between accuracy and interpretability has recently been proposed for shallow NNs as a promising means to address this black box problem. Recently, we have been confronting a \"new black box\" problem caused by highly complex deep NNs (DNNs) generated by DL. In this paper, we first review four rule extraction approaches to resolve the black box problem of DNNs trained by DL in computer vision. Next, we discuss the fundamental limitations and criticisms of current DL approaches in radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology from the black box point of view. We also review the conversion methods from DNNs to decision trees and point out their limitations. Furthermore, we describe a transparent approach for resolving the black box problem of DNNs trained by a deep belief network. Finally, we provide a brief description to realize the transparency of DNNs generated by a convolutional NN and discuss a practical way to realize the transparency of DL in radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2019.00024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2939881857", "source": "openalex"}

Its onset is before 25 years of age, with mean ages of onset and death between 11 and 38 years, respectively. The incidence is 1 in 30,000–50,000 persons. It is caused, in 97% of cases, by a homozygous guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) trinucleotide mutation in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene on chromosome 9 (9q13–q1.1). The mutation of this gene causes a deficiency of frataxin, which induces an altered inflow of iron into the mitochondria, increasing the nervous system’s vulnerability to oxidative stress. The main clinical signs include spinocerebellar ataxia with sensory loss and disappearance of deep tendon reflexes, cerebellar dysarthria, cardiomyopathy, and scoliosis. Diabetes, hearing loss, and pes cavus may also occur, and although most patients with FRDA do not present with symptomatic visual impairment, 73% present with clinical neuro-ophthalmological alterations such as optic atrophy and altered eye movement, among others. This review provides a brief overview of the main aspects of FRDA and then focuses on the ocular involvement of this pathology and the possible use of retinal biomarkers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11080708", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3183379709", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2026622082", "title": "Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology", "text": "Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology David J. Spalton, Roger A. Hitchings, Paul A. Hunter. Philadelphia: Elsevier Mosby, 2005. $229.00. I was excited when asked to review the third edition of Spalton's Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology. I have been a devotee of the previous editions, recommending them often to students and practitioners alike, and very much looked forward to evaluating the most recent book. I was not to be disappointed. For those of you unfamiliar with the Spalton series, a little background. The first edition, edited by Spalton, Hitchings, and Hunter, based in London, was published in 1984. Its 20 chapters were an introduction to clinical ophthalmology detailing ocular disease as well as the principles and techniques of the visual examination. The major emphasis was in the presentation of the most common ocular disorders encountered in clinical practice. What set this book above all others are the hundreds of beautifully colored ocular photographs and illustrations of ocular disorders. This first edition was so outstanding that it garnered the \"Best Medical Textbook of Year Award\" and was included, by the Archives of Ophthalmology, in the list of the hundred most important ophthalmology books of the 20th century. The second edition, in 1994, presented additional photographs and updated text and represented an improvement on the earlier book. A very valuable asset, that was available with each edition, was a complete set of 35-mm slides of the photographs featured in both books. Now, in 2005, comes the third edition. It is hard to imagine how the editors could improve on their previous efforts, but indeed, they have achieved just that. Each chapter has been totally revised. Many chapters have new authors chosen from a list of internationally recognized experts. The revisions reflect the latest advances and new technologies in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease. Complete new sections have been added. Wavefront analysis, ophthalmic imaging, including OCT, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and developments in cell biology and ocular genetics are among the new topics that are covered. The section on corneal dystrophies, describing the inheritance, location of the genetic mutation, and the specific protein involved, illustrates the impact that biologic science has made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders. Most of the chapters are organized using the same format. Each begins with a review of the embryology and anatomy of the structure being studied, i.e., eyelids, conjunctiva, or cornea. This is followed by variations of normal and then by the most frequently encountered, as well some of the more unusual, disorders known to affect each structure. Tables aiding in the differential diagnosis are concise and easy to understand. This book is about the identification of disease. It is not a cookbook on the specific details of treatment. The majority of the photographs are accompanied by black and white line drawings. Complete with arrows, these drawings enhance comprehension by indicating the salient features of each picture. This is one of the strongest aspects of the \"Atlas.\" How often have you looked at a picture and wondered what the written explanation was describing? These labeled illustrations direct one's attention to the areas of interest leaving little room for doubt. Throughout, the authors remind us of the relationship that the visual system and ocular disease have to the body as a whole. However, again, it is the thousands of carefully chosen and incredibly beautiful photographs that make this book so visually satisfying. Once the reader adapts to the peculiar English way of spelling (colour, aetiology, papilloedema), this is an easy read. Each section is written with the clinician clearly in mind, providing the information so valuable in understanding ocular disease without making the subject boring or too complex. This time, instead of 35-mm slides, a CD-ROM of the photographs is provided. The intent of the editors is for the CD to be used as a \"teaching archive\" and have made it easy for the incorporation of images into PowerPoint presentations. This book is invaluable for anyone involved in eye care whether you are an educator, a student, or a clinician with many years of experience. Do not let the term textbook deter you. The Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology will prove to be an indispensable clinical reference regardless of your level of expertise. It will not just occupy a shelf in your bookcase, but will become an integral part of your clinical practice. I can guarantee that its use will give you better insight into the disease process, improve your diagnostic abilities, stimulate your desire to learn more, and give you a better appreciation of the advances made in this ever-changing field. What more could you ask? This is a monumental accomplishment and the authors have clearly accomplished their goal of contributing to the recognition and understanding of the pathogenesis of ocular disease. If you want to buy just one book, this is it. You may not find the “Atlas” suitable for bedtime reading (it is heavy and over 700 pages), but it is a page-turner. You could spend hours enjoying its incredible ocular photographs and marveling at the wonders encountered in our chosen profession. I hope by now you can tell that I love this book and believe that you too will find it to be a valuable addition to your professional library.FigureKaren Walker-Brandreth School of Optometry University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, California", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.opx.0000197517.46191.a4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026622082", "source": "openalex"}

This study assesses COVID-19’s impact on ophthalmology gender authorship distribution and compares the gender authorship proportion of COVID-19 ophthalmology-related articles to previous ophthalmology articles. Methods This cohort study includes authors listed in all publications related to ophthalmology in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset and CDC COVID-19 research database. Articles from 65 ophthalmology journals from January to July 2020 were selected. All previous articles published in the same journals were extracted from PubMed. Gender-API determined authors’ gender. Results Out of 119,457 COVID-19-related articles, we analyzed 528 ophthalmology-related articles written by 2518 authors. Women did not exceed 40% in any authorship positions and were most likely to be middle, first, and finally, last authors. The proportions of women in all authorship positions from the 2020 COVID-19 group (29.6% first, 31.5% middle, 22.1% last) are significantly lower compared to the predicted 2020 data points (37.4% first, 37.0% middle, 27.6% last) ( p &lt; .01). The gap between the proportion of female authors in COVID-19 ophthalmology research and the 2020 ophthalmology-predicted proportion (based on 2002–2019 data) is 6.1% for overall authors, 7.8% for first authors, and 5.5% for last and middle authors.

In the field of uveitis, for instance, comprehension of the mechanisms that underlie sympathetic ophthalmia would not only improve the management of this disease in those rare patients that contract it, but also might throw light on the pathogenesis of many disorders that result in intraocular inflammation from whatever cause.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4213094632", "title": "Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology at 50", "text": "This year we celebrate the publication of the 50th volume of Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (CEO), the official journal of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO). The roots of the journal lie in the Transactions of the Ophthalmological Society of Australia, which was published annually from 1939 to 1971 to record the proceedings from the annual meeting of the Ophthalmological Society of Australia. With the formation of the Australian College of Ophthalmologists in 1969, a standardised training programme was developed for Australian ophthalmologists. It was then decided that the annual meeting proceedings would be suspended, and a full journal would be launched to stimulate reporting of clinical and academic activities, and to support clinical education. Thus, in 1973, the first of three annual issues of the Australian Journal of Ophthalmology (AJO) was published. Today, with an estimated 30 000 or more academic journals currently in existence, the launch of another would hardly raise eyebrows. However, 50 years ago the founding members felt obliged to apologise for adding to the number of scientific publications: ‘While the proliferation of another medical journal is regretted, it is a necessary part of fulfilling some of the objectives of the College’.1 Each of the five decades since the launch has seen change and transformation as the journal has kept abreast with developments in academic publishing. Since the launch of what was to become CEO in 1973, there have been nine Editors-in-Chief, each of whom shaped the journal with their own vision and strategy. The 1980s was a period of early growth. In 1982, external reviewers were utilised for the first time, as the Editor-in-Chief recognised that the Editorial Board would struggle to provide expert opinions on the diverse yet increasingly specialised topics. In 1985, the AJO merged with the Transactions of the Ophthalmological Society of New Zealand to form the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Ophthalmology (ANZJO). This cemented the ties between the ophthalmic communities of both countries and was the precursor to the merging of the Australian and New Zealand ophthalmic societies a decade later. During the 1990s, the Editor-in-Chief discussed the merits of the emerging ISI ‘citation index’2 and worked to entice Australasian authors to publish their best research in ANZJO. In 1999 the journal expanded to six annual issues, and was also launched online on the World Wide Web, enabling readers from all over the world to access articles. The 2000s were a time of globalisation as the journal evolved from a regionally focussed publication into a highly respected international journal. In 2000, the journal name was changed to Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology to appeal to a larger and more international authorship and readership, and 6 years later the annual volume was expanded to the current nine issues. In 2009, the first Special Issue was published, featuring a selection of invited review papers on the theme of imaging in ophthalmology. During the 2010s, CEO became the first ophthalmology journal to launch an iPad app, and evolved into a top tier journal. After a decade of dedicated focus by the Editors-in-Chief on improving the quality of the published articles, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) increased such that by 2019, CEO was ranked 11th in the field of ophthalmology in the world and the journal became one of the highest JIF-ranked medical journals in Australasia. In the past 2 years, CEO has become the first quartile-1 ophthalmology journal to appoint a woman Editor-in-Chief, and women's representation on the Editorial Board has increased to 50%. The first CEO Social Media Editor has recently been appointed, and the subsequent launch on Twitter has resulted in CEO papers achieving record Altmetric scores. Of course the ultimate success of a journal can be measured by the impact of the published papers on fellow researchers, practice or policy. Citations are considered the key indicator of impact, so as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of CEO, it seems timely to reflect on the articles that have generated the most citations over the years. Looking at the impactful articles from the last 50 years, seven papers stand out, having attracted more than 200 cites since publication. The oldest of these was published in 1998; a clinical science study presenting an 18-month follow-up of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and intravitreal triamcinolone.3 The remaining six were all published in the current millennium. Two more clinical science papers feature in this list; one 2003 paper from the Blue Mountains Eye Study reporting on the prevalence and associations of dry eye syndrome in an older population,4 and another paper from 2001 looking at the safety and efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone for cystoid macular oedema in uveitis.5 This latter paper is the second highest cited CEO article of the past 50 years, and has received 290 citations to date. The popularity and impact of review papers is evident, along with their ability to quickly accrue citations; four of the seven most cited papers are review articles, with three of them published in the last decade. A 2012 article focused on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of central serous chorioretinopathy,6 while a 2000 review that described the early pathology of retinal neurodegeneration in diabetes7 is the third highest cited CEO article on the list, with 282 citations to date. The remaining two papers were commissioned for editions of the journal Special Issues; the first Special Issue was published in 2009, and one has been published almost every year since. The 2012 Special Issue was based around the theme of glaucoma, and the highest cited paper from that issue aimed to define the clinical and experimental concepts of glaucoma.8 The most cited article published in 50 years of CEO is also the most recently published of all the top-cited 50 articles; a review of the global prevalence, major risk factors, screening practices and public health challenges of diabetic retinopathy9 was commissioned for the 2016 Special Issue on diabetic eye disease, and this has attracted 359 citations at the time of this article going to press. Every Editor-in-Chief knows how difficult it can be to predict which articles will have the most impact, particularly as it can take a number of years for an article to reach its peak annual citation frequency. Thus, it is interesting to look at the most cited of the recently published papers to find any clues as to new hot topics. Examining papers published during the last 2 years there are five research paper themes which are accruing good numbers of citations. Papers in the areas of glaucoma,10, 11 AMD,12, 13 cataract14, 15 and refractive surgery16 are already generating significant attention. Topical papers on COVID-1917-19 and climate change20 are also having impact, reflecting two of the most important issues facing society at this time. Examining the articles that are impacting on fellow researchers can highlight topical themes in the short term, and can measure research influence in the longer term. However, no study of the most impactful ophthalmic research published in Australasia would be complete without travelling back 80 years to Norman Gregg's seminal article, ‘Congenital cataract following German measles in the mother’,21 published in 1941 in Transactions of the Ophthalmological Society of Australia. Gregg noticed a relationship between congenital cataracts in babies born to mothers who reported rubella infection while pregnant. Despite a degree of scepticism from some peers, Gregg's theory became universally accepted, and ultimately altered the study of birth defects as researchers expanded the potential causes to include viruses. At the time of this article going to press, Gregg's paper has been cited 1289 times. As we celebrate 50 years of the RANZCO journal, we thank past and present Editors-in-Chief, Editorial Board members, authors and reviewers for their support and contributions over the years.

Therefore, this study sought to better understand the occurrence rate of acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in Chinese small and medium-scale departments of ophthalmology, as well as identify its risk factors and assess the treatment options. This investigation revealed 52 postoperative endophthalmitis cases in 46,185 operations at 30 hospitals from 2011 to 2013, at an occurrence rate of 0.11%. A small cataract surgery volume of less than 500 cases per year (OR 2.21; p = 0.006), the absence of 0.5% povidone iodine (PVP-I) irrigation (OR 1.73; p = 0.046), and intraoperative posterior capsular rupture (PCR) with vitreous loss (OR 4.40; p = 0.034) showed statistically significant associations with endophthalmitis in the multivariate analysis. The rate of culture positivity was 44.2%, with Staphylococcus epidermidis being the most common organism isolated in China. More than 40% of the endophthalmitis cases were treated with a nonstandard antibiotics regimen, and only 32.7% of these had a visual acuity of better than 20/40. We concluded that the occurrence rate of acute-onset endophthalmitis following cataract surgery in Chinese small and medium-scale departments of ophthalmology lags behind the level of developed countries, as well as Chinese top eye centers. Overall, the use of 0.5% PVP-I irrigation seemed to be an effective measure to reduce the risk of the development of postoperative endophthalmitis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep40776", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2573919344", "source": "openalex"}

Logistic regression model was constructed, and results were reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.A total of 117 residents responded to the survey with a 70% response rate. The response rate was above 65% for each training programs by region. 41% of ophthalmology residents scored a positive burnout result on the common subscales (Emotional Exhaustion and/or Depersonalization). Further sub-analysis of data showed positive Spearman's correlation with number of call days per month and EE subscale (r 0.195). Multivariate logistic regression of the sample yielded significant results with satisfaction with work/life balance and choosing medicine again as a graduate level major p ≤ 0.05. The regression model also showed the Southern program had significantly higher burnout on the common subscales p ≤ 0.05.Prevalence of burnout among ophthalmology residents was lower when compared to plastic surgery and otolaryngology residents in Saudi Arabia. Work hours and on call days were associated with higher burnout. Actions must be taken to ensure that all training programs implement work hour limitations.

Standardized clinical photographs are part of an armamentarium for any ophthalmologist interested in enhancing his or her practice. Unfortunately, many clinicians still avoid taking patient photographs for want of basic knowledge or inclination. The ubiquitous presence of the digital camera and digital technology has made it extremely easy and affordable to take high-quality images. It is not compulsory to employ a professional photographer or invest in expensive equipment any longer for this purpose. Any ophthalmologist should be able to take clinical photographs in his/her office settings with minimal technical skill. The purpose of this article is to provide an ophthalmic surgeon with guidelines to achieve standardized photographic views for specific procedures, to achieve consistency, to help in pre-operative planning and to produce accurate pre-operative and post-operative comparisons, which will aid in self-improvement, patient education, medicolegal documentation and publications.

From the United States, 526 ophthalmologists who performed cataract surgery participated in the study; there were 276 from Canada, 89 from Barcelona, and 82 from Denmark.Although in all 4 sites most surgeons reported that they performed A-scanning, fundus examination, and refraction routinely before surgery, significant crossnational variation was observed in preoperative ophthalmic and medical testing. While preoperative medical tests were virtually unused in Denmark, they were widely used in the other sites. A significantly higher proportion of the surgeons in the United States and Barcelona reported that they performed less than 100 extractions per year compared with surgeons in Canada and Denmark (P < .001). A significantly higher proportion of the surgeons in the United States and Canada were performing predominantly phacoextraction compared with surgeons in Denmark and Barcelona (P < .001). Both within and across sites, considerable variation in number of follow-up visits and postoperative tests was observed.Significant international variation in the management of healthy patients with cataracts has been observed.

More common causes for visual impairment include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (Zhu et al. Molecular Medicine Reports, 2015; Kolb et al. 2007; Machalińska et al. Current Eye Research, 34(9),748–760, 2009) among a few. As cases of retinal and optic nerve diseases rise, it is vital to find a treatment, which has led to investigation of the therapeutic potential of various stem cells types (Bull et al. Investigative Opthalmology & Visual Science, 50(9), 4244, 2009; Bull et al. Investigative Opthalmology & Visual Science, 49(8), 3449, 2008; Yu et al.

In previous studies, some of the stem cell variants used include human Muller SCs and bone marrow derived SCs. Some of the regenerative potential characteristics of mesenchymal progenitor stem cells (MSCs) include their multilineage differentiation potential, their immunomodulatory effects, their high proliferative activity, they can be easily cultured in vitro, and finally their potential to synthesize and secrete membrane derived vesicles rich in growth factors, mRNA and miRNA which possibly aid in regulation of tissue damage regeneration. These facts alone, explain why MSCs are so widely used in clinical trials, 350 up to date (Switonski, Reproductive Biology, 14(1), 44–50, 2014). Animal studies have demonstrated that sub-retinal transplantation of MSCs delays retinal degeneration and preserves retinal function through trophic response (Inoue et al. Experimental Eye Research, 85(2), 234–241, 2007). Umbilical cord derived MSCs (UC/MSCs) have also been shown to contain neuroprotective features of ganglion cells in rat studies (Zwart et al.

In this article, we present the results of our DL system designed to determine optic disc laterality, right eye vs left eye, in the presence of both normal and abnormal optic discs. Methods: Using transfer learning, we modified the ResNet-152 deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), pretrained on ImageNet, to determine the optic disc laterality. After a 5-fold cross-validation, we generated receiver operating characteristic curves and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values to evaluate performance. The data set consisted of 576 color fundus photographs (51% right and 49% left). Both 30° photographs centered on the optic disc (63%) and photographs with varying degree of optic disc centration and/or wider field of view (37%) were included. Both normal (27%) and abnormal (73%) optic discs were included. Various neuro-ophthalmological diseases were represented, such as, but not limited to, atrophy, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, hypoplasia, and papilledema. Results: Using 5-fold cross-validation (70% training; 10% validation; 20% testing), our DCNN for classifying right vs left optic disc achieved an average AUC of 0.999 (±0.002) with optimal threshold values, yielding an average accuracy of 98.78% (±1.52%), sensitivity of 98.60% (±1.72%), and specificity of 98.97% (±1.38%). When tested against a separate data set for external validation, our 5-fold cross-validation model achieved the following average performance: AUC 0.996 (±0.005), accuracy 97.2% (±2.0%), sensitivity 96.4% (±4.3%), and specificity 98.0% (±2.2%). Conclusions: Small data sets can be used to develop high-performing DL systems for semantic labeling of neuro-ophthalmology images, specifically in distinguishing between right and left optic discs, even in the presence of neuro-ophthalmological pathologies. Although this may seem like an elementary task, this study demonstrates the power of transfer learning and provides an example of a DCNN that can help curate large medical image databases for machine-learning purposes and facilitate ophthalmologist workflow by automatically labeling images according to laterality.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000827", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2970508074", "source": "openalex"}

Improvement in education of patients, the provision of specialist ophthalmic training for GPs and optometrists, and expansion of outpatient services are needed so that casualty remains a genuine emergency service.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/emj.2007.057604", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017878945", "source": "openalex"}

The focus was on companies selectively marketing to ophthalmology practices, and, therefore, most were selected based on their representation at the 1998 and/or 1999 American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting. Software companies that responded to repeated inquiries in a timely fashion were included.Sixteen companies were evaluated. Electronic medical records packages ranged from $3000 to $80 000 (mean, approximately $30 000). Company demographics revealed a range from 1 to 1600 employees (mean, 204). Most of these companies have been in business for 6 years or less (range, 1-15 years; mean, 6 years). My opinions concerning various aspects of the EMR are presented.There is a wide range of EMR products available for the ophthalmology practice. Computer technology has matured to a point at which the graphical demands of the ophthalmology EMR can be satisfied. Weaknesses do exist in the inherent difficulty of recording an ophthalmology encounter, the relative adolescence of software companies, and the lack of standards in the industry.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.119.4.590", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2028054639", "source": "openalex"}

Global trends on indications and forms of keratoplasty performed in 2011/2012 were obtained from national keratoplasty or eye banking registries, corneal/ophthalmological societies, national eye banks, and national ophthalmic institutions.Global rates of EK surgery vary widely, from 52% (Sweden) to 0% (South Africa), with higher adoption by industrialized countries. ALK adoption rates similarly vary from 28.7% (China) to 1.0% (Philippines). SCTS data show high adoption rates in Singapore: EK 44% and ALK 28%. Our surgical modifications to big-bubble deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) surgery resulted in visual outcomes matching PK, and a low conversion to PK of 2.1%, whereas our evolving approaches to donor insertion in Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) show significant reduction in 1-year postoperative endothelial cell loss rates from 60% (folding), to 22% to 30% (Sheets Glide), to 15% (EndoGlide inserter).Improvements in various forms of ALK and EK surgery can lead to better visual outcomes, longer graft survival, and reduced complications, as compared to PK.

Acupuncture is an ancient procedure with empirical effects on pain. Previous studies established the increased output of messengers at neuronal junctions in spinal cord and hypothalamic locations, especially of endorphins which inhibit the perception of pain. We treated several painful symptoms with acupuncture and evaluated the outcome of the treatment. Patients with various kinds of therapy-refractory pain and patients in whom conventional treatment methods could not be applied were included in the study. The diagnoses included glaucoma. Tolosa-Hunt-Syndrome, ophthalmic migraine, blepharospasm, and dry eyes. In one case acupuncture was used for analgesia during surgery. Acupuncture was performed with sterile disposable needles, at points known to have an empirical analgesic effect. The stimulation was adapted to the patient's individual needs. VAS assessments before and after acupuncture were compared. The t-test was used for statistical evaluation. Acupuncture had no side effects, but reduced pain to a variable extent. Especially in cases of severe pain and in surgery, very effective pain reduction was achieved. In general, pain was significantly reduced in all patients by the use of acupuncture. A statistically significant effect was noted (p < 0.05). Further studies should be conducted to demonstrate the specific effect in larger patient populations. Monitoring neurotransmitter activity will possibly help to illustrate the effect.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3727/036012902816025988", "url": "https://openalex.org/W97197900", "source": "openalex"}

Improving the effectiveness of ophthalmology service delivery can promote national policy goals of population health improvement and system sustainability. This study examined the performance variation of public ophthalmology service in Malaysia, estimated the potential output gain and investigated several factors that might explain the differential performance.Data for 2011 and 2012 on 36 ophthalmology centres operating in the Ministry of Health hospitals were used in this analysis. We first consulted a panel of ophthalmology service managers to understand the production of ophthalmology services and to verify the production model. We then assessed the relative performance of these centres using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Efficiency scores (ES) were decomposed into technical, scale, and congestion component. Potential increase in service output was estimated. Sensitivity analysis of model changes was performed and stability of the result was assessed using bootstrap approach. Second stage Tobit regression was conducted to determine if hospital type, availability of day services and population characteristics were related to the DEA scores.In 2011, 33% of the ophthalmology centres were found to have ES > 1 (mean ES = 1.10). Potential output gains were 10% (SE ± 2.92), 7.4% (SE ± 2.06), 6.9% (SE ± 1.97) if the centres could overcome their technical, scale and congestion inefficiencies. More centres moved to the performance frontier in 2012 (mean ES = 1.07), with lower potential output gain. The model used has good stability. Robustness checks show that the DEA correctly identified low performing centres. Being in state hospital was significantly associated with better performance.Using DEA to benchmarking service performance of ophthalmology care could provide insights for policy makers and service managers to intuitively visualise the overall performance of resource use in an otherwise difficult to assess scenario. The considerable potential output gain estimated indicates that effort should be invested to understand what drove the performance variation and optimise them. Similar performance assessment should be undertaken for other healthcare services in the country in order to work towards a sustainable health system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-015-1011-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123881848", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Ophthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers.

We assessed articles published between 2010 and 2015 in the five major relevant journals with the highest impact factors.The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify systematic reviews published between January 2010 and December 2015 in the following 5 major ophthalmology journals: Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, Ophthalmology, Archives of Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology, and Survey of Ophthalmology. The screening, identification, and scoring of articles were independently performed by two teams, and the results were submitted to statistical analysis to determine medians, ranges, and 95% CIs.A total of 115 articles were included. The median compliance was 15 out of 27 items (56%), the range was 5-26 (26-96%), and the inter-quartile range was 10 (37%).

Their effects of mydriasis and vasoconstriction are useful in refraction, in ophthalmoscopic examination, in the therapy of conjunctivitis and of uveitis, and in control of surgical bleeding. Also, because of their prolonged hypotensive effect, sympathomimetic-miotic combinations have been used in the therapy of wide-angle glaucoma. Thus, the importance of the sympathomimetic drugs, both diagnostically and therapeutically, is well recognized. However, ophthalmologists generally regard this important group of drugs as harmless, except for the possibility of precipitating acute narrow-angle glaucoma. We, therefore, feel it worth while to present a case of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from the use of phenylephrine and to discuss other reported hazards of the sympathomimetic drugs. <h3>Report of a Case</h3> A 35-year-old white man had been treated two weeks for an acute iritis O.

We hypothesize that BAK also influences trabecular meshwork (TM) degeneration.Trabecular specimens were examined using immunohistology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A trabecular cell line was stimulated by BAK and examined for apoptosis, oxidative stress, fractalkine and SDF-1 expression, and modulation of their receptors. An experimental model was developed with BAK subconjunctival injections to induce TM degeneration. Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging assessed BAK penetration after repeated instillations in rabbit eyes.Trabecular specimens showed extremely low densities of trabecular cells and presence of cells expressing fractalkine and fractalkine receptor and their respective mRNAs. Benzalkonium in vitro induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and fractalkine expression and inhibited the protective chemokine SDF-1 and Bcl2, also inducing a sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) increase, with dramatic apoptosis of trabecular cells and reduction of aqueous outflow. MS imaging showed that BAK could access the TM at measurable levels after repeated instillations.BAK enhances all characteristics of TM degeneration typical of glaucoma-trabecular apoptosis, oxidative stress, induction of inflammatory chemokines-and causes degeneration in acute experimental conditions, potentially mimicking long-term accumulation. BAK was also shown to access the TM after repeated instillations. These findings support the hypothesis that antiglaucoma medications, through toxicity of their preservative, may cause further long-term trabecular degeneration and therefore enhance outflow resistance, reducing the impact of IOP-lowering agents.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109656527", "source": "openalex"}

We aim to evaluate medical students' perceptions of the current ophthalmology curriculum without mandatory rotation at New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM). Design A cross-sectional Internet survey. Methods A cross-sectional Internet survey was distributed to all NYUSOM students in March to May 2017. The main parameters measured in the study were students' self-reported confidence with ophthalmology skills and satisfaction with curriculum. Results Response rate was 27.5% (166 of 604) of NYUSOM students. Many students reported they were not comfortable diagnosing eye emergencies (64%), using a direct ophthalmoscope (71%), or testing visual acuity (50%). The majority of students did not want ophthalmology to become a mandatory rotation, but reported additional in-person training would be most helpful, compared with videos, web-based didactics, lectures, or virtual training. Completion of an ophthalmology elective and more hours of ophthalmology training were associated with increased confidence with eye examination and greater satisfaction with the curriculum. Conclusions It is critical for all physicians-in-training to have adequate skills in eye examination. Identifying areas of improvement and determining the best teaching modality will be important in updating the ophthalmology curriculum for medical students. The majority of medical students are not at all or only slightly confident with eye examinations.

We investigated whether functional abnormalities in visual processing exist in children born preterm but without major neuromotor impairment (i.e. cerebral palsy). Twelve such children (&lt; 33 weeks gestation or birthweight &lt; 1000 g) without major neuromotor impairment and 12 born full‐term controls were assessed at 8–12 years of age by means of ophthalmological assessment (visual acuity, colour vision, stereopsis, stereoacuity, visual fields, ocular motility, motor fusion), cognitive tests of visual‐motor, visual‐perceptual and visual‐spatial skills and pattern‐reversal visual evoked potentials (PR‐VEPs). All participants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and neuromotor assessments. No significant differences were found between the groups on the ophthalmological, visual cognitive, neurological, neuromotor or MRI measures. The P100 component of the PR‐VEP showed a significantly shorter latency in the preterm compared with the full‐term participants. Whilst this P100 finding suggests that subtle abnormalities may exist at the neurophysiological level, we conclude that visual dysfunction is not systematically associated with preterm birth in the context of normal neurological status.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00925.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1495034184", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: The authors prospectively studied 30 patients clinically diagnosed as having Williams syndrome as confirmed by the fluorescence in situ hybridization test. Patient history included gender, age, race, education level, previous illnesses, and surgeries. The ophthalmologic examination included best-corrected visual acuity, dynamic and static refraction, extraocular motility test, stereopsis test (Titmus and Lang), and direct and indirect funduscopy. Results: Thirty patients were included in this study. The mean age was 14.5 ± 1.38 years (range: 7 to 26 years). Fifty percent of the patients were male and 50% were female. Among the children examined, 77% had a refractive error. Hyperopia and astigmatism were noted in 67% and 20% of the patients, respectively, and myopia in 7%. Only one case of amblyopia was noted. On external examination, 23% of children had epicanthus; via biomicroscopy, 3 children with stellate patterns of the irides were observed. Eleven patients (36.6%) had measurable strabismus, 9 (82%) had esotropia, and 2 (18%) had exotropia. Binocular vision was abnormal in 43% of patients. Diffuse arteriovenous tortuosity on funduscopy was observed in 27% of patients. Conclusions: Williams syndrome is rare and is associated with multiple phenotypes and diseases that are susceptible to treatment. Multidisciplinary clinical management is critical and, in some cases, surgical intervention is required.

Many \"omics\" studies have been developed over the last decade. Metabolomic analysis enables dynamic measurement of the metabolic response of a living system to a variety of stimuli or genetic modifications. Important targets of metabolomics is biomarker development and translation to the clinic for personalized diagnosis and a greater understanding of disease pathogenesis. The current review highlights the major aspects of metabolomic analysis and its applications for the identification of relevant predictive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for some ocular diseases including dry eye, keratoconus, retinal diseases, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. To date, possible biomarker candidates for dry eye disease are lipid metabolites and androgens, for keratoconus cytokeratins, urea, citrate cycle, and oxidative stress metabolites. Palmitoylcarnitine, sphingolipids, vitamin D related metabolites, and steroid precursors may be used for distinguishing glaucoma patients from healthy controls. Dysregulation of amino acid and carnitine metabolism is critical in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Further work is needed to discover and validate metabolic biomarkers as a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of ocular diseases, to provide knowledge on their etiology and pathophysiology and opportunities for personalized clinical intervention at an early stage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5507/bp.2020.028", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3044565922", "source": "openalex"}

The present review article highlights 50 ophthalmology-related publications about the application of PRGF in the treatment of acute and chronic pathologies in ophthalmology as well as most relevant challenges and future prospects.Expert opinion PRGF technology provides a wide range of formulations that can be used therapeutically in many different acute and chronic ocular pathologies. In addition to eye drops enriched with autologous growth factors, PRGF enables the preparation of both immunologically safe and fibrin-based formulations. Recent advances in the field have promoted PRGF storage for 12 months under freezing conditions, its daily use for 7 days at room temperature and the freeze-dried formulation. The thermally treated immunosafe formulation has shown promising clinical results for the treatment of several diseases such as Sjögren syndrome, graft versus host disease or cicatrizing conjunctivitis. In addition, several fibrin formulations have been preclinically evaluated and clinically incorporated as an adjuvant to ocular surface or glaucoma surgeries, dermal fat graft procedures, limbal stem cell expansion and retinal surgeries.

Analysis of factors associated with patient satisfaction in ophthalmology: the influence of demographic data, visit characteristics and perceptions of received care. Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31 , 580–587. doi: 10.1111/j.1475‐1313.2011.00869.x Abstract Purpose: To identify factors associated with satisfaction among patients receiving ophthalmic services and to indicate the intensity of this relationship. Methods: The data used was obtained through a self‐administered, post‐visit questionnaire from randomly selected 507 patients treated in seven eye clinics in Germany. The instrument assessed satisfaction with several aspects of care and patient baseline and visit characteristics. Bivariate and multivariate techniques were used to reveal relations between indicators and overall satisfaction. Results: Factor analysis yielded two factors, ‘medical aspects of care’ and ‘performance of service’, explaining 55% of total variance. Cronbach’s α coefficient for both scales indicates acceptable internal consistency. Bivariate analysis showed strong relations between overall satisfaction and perceived care with weaker findings pertaining to visit characteristics. Not any of the demographic variables was associated with overall satisfaction. Perceived length of stay, intention to return to the clinic, and occurrence of complications were influential attributes on satisfaction ratings. The multivariate analysis identified seven factors associated with overall satisfaction including the treatment outcome (OR: 4.57), kindness of the nurses (OR: 5.27) and medical practitioners (OR: 2.23), room amenities (OR: 2.72), organization of procedures and operations (OR: 2.71), information about anaesthesia (OR: 1.95), and cleanliness (OR: 1.93). Conclusions: Factors associated with patient satisfaction in ophthalmology concern medical aspects like the organization of procedures and operations but also aspects that are not directly related to technical care, such as kindness of the nurses and cleanliness. Results show that patients’ subjective experiences of received care and services relate more strongly and consistently to overall satisfaction than patient demographic data or visit characteristics.

A significant positive correlation was identified between doxycycline concentration and body weight (r = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Detectable doxycycline concentrations were achieved in the tear film of ophthalmologically normal dogs following oral administration of doxycycline at 5 or 10 mg/kg, every 12 hours.

This editorial assesses ChatGPT's potential applications and limitations in ophthalmology across clinical, educational, and research settings. In clinical settings, ChatGPT can serve as an assistant, offering diagnostic and therapeutic suggestions based on patient data and assisting in patient triage. However, its tendencies to generate inaccurate results and its inability to keep up with recent medical guidelines render it unsuitable for standalone clinical decision-making. Data security and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) also pose concerns, given ChatGPT’s potential to inadvertently expose sensitive patient information. In education, ChatGPT can generate practice questions, provide explanations, and create patient education materials. However, its performance in answering domain-specific questions is suboptimal. In research, ChatGPT can facilitate literature reviews, data analysis, manuscript development, and peer review, but issues of accuracy, bias, and ethics need careful consideration. Ultimately, ensuring accuracy, ethical integrity, and data privacy is essential when integrating ChatGPT into ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.40765", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4381683042", "source": "openalex"}

With more than 1,000,000 infections around the world, SARS-Cov 2 is responsible for the most severe healthcare crisis in the last 100 years. Aim. The paper analyzes the impact of COVID 19 pandemic upon the current ophthalmological clinical activity. Materials and Method. A comparative analyses was carried regarding the clinical activity in March 2019 and March 2020: the number of one day hospitalizations, of continuous hospitalizations, the percentage of emergencies, the number of surgeries, bed turn over, mean hospital stay. The protocols for the health care personnel protection and decontamination were analyzed. Results. During March 2019, 381 patients were treated in the day hospitalization and 297 patients in the continuous hospitalization regime, with an average length of hospitalization of 3.2 days, and a bed turnover of 6.05. Of these, 76.43% underwent ophthalmic surgery and 14.1% represented ophthalmological emergencies. The comparative analysis shows that in March 2020, the number of one day hospitalizations decreased by 87.4%, and that of the hospitalizations continued with 89.2%. Of the patients admitted, 46.8% were in emergency. Clinical ophthalmological practice has been deeply changed in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic in order to prevent contamination both for patients and medical personnel. Conclusions. The ocular manifestations associated to SARS-Cov 2 infection are self-limited, but the possibility of infection due to the presence of the virus at the level of the tear secretion is an aspect that we must consider in the ophthalmological clinical practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4323/rjlm.2020.96", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3036050743", "source": "openalex"}

A number of other eye structures may also be affected in these disorders and the ophthalmologist is in a unique position to detect and interpret these findings. The presence of these ophthalmologic manifestations may be the first clue that the patient has an underlying mitochondrial disease with the eye as the initial or most prominently affected organ. The phenotypic manifestations of mitochondrial disease are protean and variable, and there are no clear-cut, minimal features that define these disorders. The possibility of a mitochondrial disorder should be raised when any of the mitochondrial eye manifestations (Table 1) are present, either alone or in concert with the neurological and systemic (Table 2) manifestations of mitochondrial disease. A maternal family history of an ophthalmologic, neurological, or systemic illness is also compatible with a mitochondrial disorder. The ophthalmologist should not loose sight of the fact that mitochondrial disorders have systemic manifestations and implications, even when the primary manifestations are ocular.

Neuro-ophthalmology faces unique challenges, given our dependence on aspects of the physical examination and on immediate diagnostic testing. Impaired access impedes our ability to differentiate benign conditions from vision- and life-threatening neurologic emergencies. Detailed history and some examination components, such as visual acuity and pupillary examination, are feasible; however, visual field testing and ophthalmoscopy are difficult or impossible to perform remotely. Decisions regarding diagnostic testing and therapeutic interventions must weigh urgency versus COVID-19 exposure risk. We review changes precipitated by COVID-19, emphasizing those with the potential to outlast the immediate pandemic. A central strategy for neuro-ophthalmic clinical care has been rapid implementation of virtual visits except for emergencies.1Klein B.C. Busis N.A. COVID-19 is catalyzing the adoption of teleneurology.Neurology. 2020; 10: 1-2Google Scholar At NYU Langone Health, institution-wide data show that more than 5000 video visits were conducted daily within 1 month of the pandemic onset, a timeframe that included institutional rollout of an Epic telehealth platform (Epic Systems Corp, Verona, WI) with physician onboarding.2Testa P. Sherwin J. How NYU Langone Health grew its telemedicine program. January 10, 2020.https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2020/01/how-nyu-langone-health-grew-its-telemedicine-programGoogle Scholar At Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 2000 virtual visits were performed daily after establishing Epic as the medical record in February 2020. At the Singapore National Eye Centre, plans are underway for video consultation clinics for several subspecialties, including neuro-ophthalmology. Remotely capturing the neuro-ophthalmologic examination has been a major challenge. In the United States, a multi-institutional physician working group meets weekly to discuss examination techniques and digital applications. Visual acuity can be tested with a printable near card or EyeHandbook application (Cloud Nine Development LLC, Overland Park, KS), and afferent pupillary defect testing can be successful with a patient-performed swinging flashlight test. Ocular motor range and detection of nystagmus also can be easily assessed virtually. Telemedicine has many challenges and several benefits, including protection of patients, physicians, and the general public from virus exposure,3Hollander J.E. Carr B.G. Virtually perfect?

Despite this concern, we anticipate virtual visits will be integral to future practice, including for assessment of evaluation urgency. Long-term impact: Initial patient encounters likely will remain in person, but virtual visits may play an important role for follow-up. In the United States, it remains to be seen if current reimbursement policies from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance will remain in force after the pandemic subsides.5Cohen B.H. Busis N.A.

Long-term impact: \"Combined visits,\" in which patients have in-office testing and a physician virtual visit may evolve, because they may improve access to neuro-ophthalmologic care. Teleneurology consultation has been explored most thoroughly in stroke.12Dorsey E.R. Glidden A.M.

For example, NYU Langone Health now has access to Epic functionality allowing direct clinician-to-clinician video connection at the bedside for real-time subspecialty consultation. Long-term impact: Video conferencing may facilitate our involvement in complex neuro-ophthalmic cases. Reimbursement models will be key in determining whether this strategy thrives. Some existing models are the teledizzy services in early development in the United States and Europe.13Müller-Barna P. Hubert N.D. Bergner C. et al.TeleVertigo: diagnosing stroke in acute dizziness: a telemedicine-supported approach.Stroke. 2019; 50: 3293-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar Although clinical trial enrollment has been impacted by minimal in-person evaluation, researchers have pivoted toward data analysis from home while maintaining Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards. Investigators have adopted online work management platforms for team members. Long-term impact: Online work management platforms will remain useful. Observational studies have been inspired by implementation of virtual visits, for example, the interinstitutional Telemedicine Experience in Neuro-Ophthalmology in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic study captures patients' and physicians' perspectives to optimize this model and identify symptoms that are easily addressed virtually. At the Singapore National Eye Centre, the ongoing Epidemiology of Neuro-Ophthalmic Disorders in Asians will capture patients demonstrating neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of COVID-19 and also will allow patients to consent for their data to be used for future research. All conferences and lectures have transitioned to remote learning. Although this poses challenges, it opens new vistas for educational innovation. For instance, virtual visits allow for simultaneous evaluation by fellows and attending physicians. Virtual divisional business meetings, conferences, and happy hours to bolster morale have been critical. Having no choice but to adopt virtual platforms has taught us that, although there is no replacing face-to-face interaction, we can successfully unite educationally and socially while also maintaining distance. Long-term impact: We anticipate instituting video-based bedside neuro-ophthalmology teaching. If a neuro-ophthalmic patient is admitted to any hospital within one of our health systems, we can connect to residents at the bedside for integrated teaching during predetermined didactic sessions. A virtual curriculum in the preclinical years has been operational in the United States since at least 1997, and the time is now to bring virtual teaching into resident education.14Morrison G. University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.Acad Med. 2010; 85: S495-S500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar This virtual platform will be useful in the future for residents rotating at other hospitals because of travel constraints as well as grand rounds sessions that could be broadcast to satellite locations adjacent to or remote from the primary teaching hospital. Transition to life in the era of COVID-19 has been challenging, but out of this difficult period arise many opportunities to improve on our practices from \"before.\" Neuro-ophthalmology is a unique and anatomically based subspecialty at the intersection of 2 fields and is well positioned to implement innovative changes to clinical practice and the education of future physicians after the acute threat of COVID-19 has resolved.

Following its approval in 2011, reports of ophthalmological/dermatological pigmentation/discoloration led to a restriction of the indication in 2013, and in 2017, retigabine was voluntarily withdrawn from the market because of its limited usage. Here, data are reported from four open-label extension studies focusing on long-term safety with particular emphasis on ophthalmological and dermatological events.MethodsStudies 113413 (NCT01336621), 114873 (NCT01777139), 115097 (NCT00310388), and 115098 (NCT00310375) were multicenter, open-label extension studies of retigabine (300–1200 mg/day) for the adjunctive treatment of adults with POS. Safety assessments included monitoring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). When new safety issues were identified, protocols were amended to include additional on-treatment safety evaluations, including ophthalmological and dermatological examinations. Patients who had abnormal retinal pigmentation, unexplained vision change, pigmentation of nonretinal ocular tissue, or abnormal discoloration of skin, lips, nails, and/or mucosa at the end of the treatment phase were asked to enter a safety follow-up continuation phase comprising 6-monthly ophthalmological/dermatological assessments.ResultsThe safety population (patients receiving ≥1 dose of retigabine in the open-label phase) comprised 98, 30, 376, and 181 patients for studies 113413, 114873, 115097, and 115098, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) treatment exposure ranged from 529 (424) to 1129 (999) days. In total, 68%–96% and 4%–27% of patients across the studies experienced TEAEs and TE SAEs, respectively. There were seven on-treatment deaths and two after discontinuation. Overall, 14%–73% of patients had an on-treatment eye examination, of whom 8/53, 4/22, 17/54, and 14/36 had abnormal retinal pigmentation and 15/53, 7/22, 15/54, and 11/36 had nonretinal ocular pigmentation in studies 113413, 114873, 115097, and 115098, respectively. Four patients had confirmed acquired vitelliform maculopathy. In patients with unresolved events at discontinuation and ≥1 posttreatment follow-up, retinal pigmentation resolved completely in 1/3, 0/3, 0/10, and 1/7 patients and nonretinal ocular pigmentation in 1/4, 0/3, 8/10, and 4/6 patients, respectively. Overall, 12%–83% of patients had an on-treatment dermatological examination, of whom 11/58, 0/25, 23/46, and 23/37 had any-tissue discoloration, respectively. In patients with unresolved events at discontinuation and ≥1 posttreatment follow-up, discoloration of skin, lips, nails, and/or mucosa resolved completely in 2/3, 0/0, 7/13, and 1/11 patients, respectively.ConclusionsThe safety profile of retigabine in adults with POS across four open-label studies was generally consistent with data from previous placebo-controlled studies. Discoloration of various tissues occurred in a proportion of patients treated with retigabine and resolved completely in a small number of these patients following treatment discontinuation. In addition, comprehensive eye examination identified a new adverse reaction of acquired vitelliform maculopathy in a limited number of patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.106580", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2982803386", "source": "openalex"}

The aim was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of AA keratitis in a large tertiary ophthalmology department in Denmark. Methods A search was performed in our electronic patient records by the keywords: ‘ PHMB /polyhexanid’, ‘Brolene’ or ‘amoeba and chlorhexidine’ from year 1994 to 2018, and afterwards medical records were reviewed. A total of 65 cases of AA keratitis were hereby identified. Results Patients were relatively young, median (range) age of 38 (15–70) years. A significant increase of diagnosing AA keratitis occurred from 0.13 cases per million per year in the first 5 years to 2.7 cases per million per year the last 5 years. Eighty‐nine per cent of patients were contact lens users, and 49% had received corticosteroids before the diagnosis was established. Severe pain was present in 34% of patients.

Design Retrospective data analysis of de-identified application and matching data. Participants Registrants for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 ophthalmology residency matches conducted by the SF Match. Methods Descriptive statistics of candidates, comparison of continuous and categorical variables between matched and nonmatched candidates, and linear regression modeling were performed. A recursive partitioning method was used to create a probability of matching algorithm. Main Outcome Measures Probability of successfully matching based on quantifiable candidate characteristics. Results Over the 3-year period, 1,959 individuals submitted an average of 64 applications and received a mean of nine interview invitations. The overall match rate was 71%, with 78% matching at one of their top five choices. Successful matches were more likely to occur in US medical school graduates (78% vs 20%, p &lt; 0.001) and applicants on their first attempt (76% vs 29%, p &lt; 0.001). The association between matching and number of programs applied became negative with &gt; 48 applications. Probability of matching was “high” (&gt; 80%) among US graduates with a step 1 United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) score &gt;243 (regardless of number of programs applied to), a step 1 USMLE score of 231 to 243 who applied to at least 30 programs, and first-time applicants with a step 1 score &gt;232.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2955060407", "title": "Commentary: Rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence in ophthalmology", "text": "Less than a decade ago, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning were more a part of science fiction, and were often depicted as going rogue in several fictional movies. Skynet in \"Terminator\", HAL9000 in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", Ultron in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\", the sentient machines in \"The Matrix\", Sonny in \"I, Robot\", and the supercomputer in WarGames are just a few examples. But with the coming of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI has crept up stealthily into our daily lives. This industrial era is characterized by a fusion of technologies referred to as cyberphysical systems. It is marked by revolutionary technology innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, 3D printing, robotics, industrial Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and so on. There is artificial intelligence in our smartphone digital assistants (Google Now, Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Bixby), Gmail (email filters, smart replies, reminders), Facebook (newsfeed, image recognition, proactive detection), Amazon (product recommendations), Maps (route planning with traffic data), chatbots, and much more. Dermatology, radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology are leading the AI wave in healthcare, due to the large volume of images to process to obtain a diagnosis. Ophthalmology is a very visual subject, and there are a lot of images that we have to see and analyze, including fundus images, retinal SD-OCT (spectral domain optical coherence tomography), RNFL (retinal nerve fibre layer) OCT, anterior segment images, slit images for AC depth, AS-OCT, corneal topography, visual field perimetry, Hess charting, diplopia charting, 9 gaze images, A-scan, B-scan, and a few more. These lend themselves to the possibility of image processing and analysis using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Deep learning, which uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a subset of machine learning, which itself can be considered to be a subset of AI. Way back in 2016, Google had reported the use of a deep CNN to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.[1] Although it had a high sensitivity (97.5%) and specificity (93.4%), there was the Black Box problem, which meant that the AI could not explain what features in the images it had used in the CNN to arrive at the diagnosis. However, in April 2019, Google has published how they used Integrated Gradients Explanation to show a heatmap on the fundus image to show the features the deep CNN used to make the diagnosis. They showed that this opening up of the Black Box improved the accuracy of, and confidence in, DR grading in an AI-assisted grading setting.[2] The main areas of ophthalmology where major strides in AI[3] have been made are in analyzing fundus images of DR, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and glaucoma.[4] Some work has also been published about grading cataract, analyzing topography, predicting progression of myopia, and detecting ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) from unstained histopathology specimens. The author is currently working on AI algorithms related to glaucoma and has seen a few commercial AI algorithms do their work and they have great potential, to say the least. Rajalakshmi et al. published in March 2018, their study on automated AI screening of fundus photos taken on an iPhone using Remidio Fundus on Phone (FOP) showing high sensitivity (95.8%) and specificity (80.2%) for detecting DR. These machine learning algorithms are getting better at diagnosis, leading to April 2018, when IDx-DR became the first FDA-approved AI software to screen fundus photos for DR. These software (or their innovative variants)[5] can potentially run on any smartphone, which can be converted into a smartphone fundus camera such as DIYretCAM[6] or T3Retcam[7] for less than a dollar. The accompanying review article, titled \"Artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy: a natural step to the future\",[8] looks at various studies which used different types of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to screen fundus images for DR. The wide variety of techniques in the different studies itself tells us that we are standing on the cusp of a massive boom in AI in healthcare. The authors also look at the downsides of AI, legal aspects and the future outlook of AI in Ophthalmology. As newer AI systems start to perform better than human ophthalmologists, a fear might arise that machines might take our jobs, but experts assure us that AI would only augment our clinical armamentarium. We can rest assured that some AI named EyeNet, may not evolve into Skynet. Let us wait and see what wonderful technologies the future holds.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_622_19", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2955060407", "source": "openalex"}

However, the ocular biological responses after THz electromagnetic exposure have not been investigated. We conducted a rabbit study to evaluate the safety profiles of THz scanning on eyes, at a tissue, cellular, structural and functional level. Eight animals (16 eyes) were analysed after excessive THz exposure (control, 1 h, 4 h, and 1 week after continuous 4-h exposure; THz frequency = 0.3 THz with continuous pulse generated at 40 µW). We found that at all the time points, the corneas and lens remained clear with no corneal haze or lens opacity formation clinically and histopathologically. No thermal effect, assessed by thermographer, was observed. The rod and cone cell-mediated electroretinography responses were not significantly altered, and the corneal keratocytes activity as well as endothelial viability, assessed by in-vivo confocal microscopy, was not affected. Post-exposed corneas, lens and retinas exhibited no significant changes in the mRNA expression of heat shock protein (HSP)90AB1), DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), and early growth response (EGR)1. These tissues were also negative for the inflammatory (CD11b), fibrotic (fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin), stress (HSP-47) and apoptotic (TUNEL assay) responses on the immunohistochemical analyses. The optical transmittance of corneas did not change significantly, and the inter-fibrillar distances of the corneal stroma evaluated with transmission electron microscopy were not significantly altered after THz exposure.

Its use for ophthalmology residents in preparation for endoscopic endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy has not been previously studied. Methods: Eight of 15 ophthalmology residents recruited for this experimental study underwent training on the endoscopic endonasal surgery simulator, completing the novice and intermediate modules. All 15 residents then participated in cadaver surgical training, performing defined surgical tasks including endoscopic navigation, identification of nasal anatomy, endonasal injection, and middle turbinate medialization. Performance on these tasks was videotaped and graded by 2 masked observers. Total mean scores and variance by task category were compared between subjects and controls and interobserver variance was compared between observers. Results: Correlation between the 2 masked observers' scores was strong (R = 0.677), with total mean scores of 2.34 and 2.38, respectively. Total mean scores were 2.79 for subjects, and 1.86 for controls (F value 0.735, p = 0.01). Residents who trained on the simulator performed significantly better during endonasal navigation (mean scores 2.58 for subjects versus 1.74 for controls, p = 0.04) and endonasal injection (mean scores 2.73 for subjects versus 1.72 for controls, p = 0.03) and minimally better at identification of nasal anatomy (mean scores 2.93 for subjects versus 1.88 for controls, p = 0.18) and middle turbinate medialization (mean scores 3.13 for subjects versus 2.78 for controls, p = 0.36).

Implanting toric intra-ocular lenses (IOL) is a safe way to increase the chance of spectacle independence after cataract surgery (Holland et al. 2010); however, toric IOL′s cost more than conventional IOL′s, and in many public ophthalmology departments, toric IOL′s are simply not offered to patients, unless the preoperative corneal astigmatism (PCA) is very high. We experience an increasing patient demand for surgical astigmatism correction in the setting of an upcoming cataract surgery, in particular among younger patients. In this letter, we set out to estimate the need for toric IOL implantation in public ophthalmology departments by analysing the preoperative keratometry values in a large population of cataract operated patients. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional survey of the electronic surgical charts from the Department of Ophthalmology at Glostrup University Hospital between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2013 (12 years).

PCA in dioptre (D) was measured by the IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany), Retinomax (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) or Lenstar device (Haag-Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). Under current Danish law, register studies of this nature do not require approval from The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics. In the surveyed period, 14 071 patients (21 524 eyes) were cataract operated, 5558 (39%) men and 8513 (61%) women. Mean age at time of surgery was 72 years (standard deviation (SD) = 12 years). Preoperative, mean power of the flat meridian was 43.19 D (SD = 1.67 D) and mean power of the steep meridian was 44.25 D (SD = 1.72 D). Mean PCA was 1.06 D (SD = 0.90 D). The distribution of PCA in different age groups is seen in Table 1. In 721 (3%) eyes, PCA was 3.00 D or more due to corneal dystrophy/scar(s) (13%), previous vitreoretinal surgery (11%), previous corneal transplantation/keratoconus (5%) or other known causes (7%). The cause was unknown/idiopathic in the remaining eyes (64%). The beneficial effect of toric IOL implantation has been documented for eyes with PCA of 1.50 D or more (Visser et al. 2013). In the present study, 20% of all cataract operated eyes had PCA of 1.50 D or more. For comparison, 16% had a PCA of 1.50 D or more in a large study from a German private eye surgery centre (Hoffmann & Hütz 2010). As seen in Table 1, changing the level of PCA where toric IOL implantation should be considered has a major impact on the number of potential candidates. It is important to remember, though, that all eyes would require cataract surgery with IOL implantation anyway. The number of candidates is also moderated by the contraindications for toric IOL implantation, for example large amounts of irregular astigmatism, presumed capsular instability or eyes that might need keratoplasty in the future. In addition, the proportion of eyes with a high degree of PCA was higher in the 80 years or more age group, which most likely is a result of the increasing corneal astigmatism with age (Gudmundsdottir et al. 2005). It is possible that older patients find spectacle freedom for distance vision less important than younger patients and therefore are less interested in toric IOL implantation. Our results show that there is a large need for toric IOL implantation in public ophthalmology departments. In effect, many patients with cataract could enjoy the benefit of spectacle freedom for distance vision after surgery. Whether the healthcare system in a particular region or country is willing to reimburse toric IOL lenses is another question.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.12584", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119928072", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2592049107", "title": "Optical Coherence Tomography and Neuro-Ophthalmology", "text": "Over the past decade, the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology has published approximately 70 articles pertaining to optical coherence tomography (OCT). In addition, OCT is used in almost every article describing an optic neuropathy since 2006 and, therefore, there are a countless number of articles that mention OCT. This is an amazing amount of literature considering that OCT has only been commercially available since 2002. Various versions of OCT machines are now found in almost every ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmology clinic and have become essential in facilitating the ability to diagnose and monitor many retinal and optic nerve disorders. The initial OCT machines used time-domain technology and had lower resolution, but still allowed for measurement of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (1). This led to improved detection of optic neuropathies, including glaucoma and nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies. The technology of OCT has been continuously improving, resulting in faster scans, better resolution, and improved analysis of the data, which were discussed in several reviews (2–4). These advances have led to the ability to segment and measure the thickness of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers, which has many applications in neuro-ophthalmology that were detailed by both Kardon and Lam (5,6). A recent study reported the use of multicolor imaging to view various layers of the retina and optic nerve (7). OCT is very useful in the setting of papilledema, which was reviewed in an article by Kardon (8), \"Optical coherence tomography in papilledema: what am I missing?\" OCT can be used to measure the RNFL thickness and quantify the amount of optic disc edema. In addition, analysis of the macula and the ganglion cell layer allows for the ability to detect and monitor optic neuropathy in the presence of disc edema. A recent article reported thinning of the macula in the setting of resolving papilledema, especially in patients with atrophic papilledema (9). Two separate studies showed that retinal ganglion cell layer loss precedes RNFL thinning in optic neuritis (10) and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (11). The orientation of Bruch membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been shown to be helpful in differentiating papilledema for other optic neuropathies. With raised intracranial pressure, there is an upward deflection of peripapillary RPE and Bruch membrane on OCT, which normalizes when papilledema resolves (12,13). Sibony et al (14) found that the peripapillary RPE also has an upward deflection toward the vitreous in patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma. By contrast, a backward deflection of the lamina cribrosa from low intracranial pressure may be detected in normal tension glaucoma (15). OCT is critical in providing insight into the structural causes for glaucoma and differentiating glaucoma from nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy (16,17). In addition to changes in the lamina cribrosa orientation, enhanced depth-OCT has demonstrated that the lamina cribrosa tends to be thinner with more focal defects in normal tension glaucoma compared with high-pressure glaucoma (18,19). OCT is helpful in diagnosing and monitoring optic disc drusen. A study using spectral-domain OCT showed that OCT was helpful in differentiating optic disc drusen from papilledema (20). Enhanced depth imaging and swept source OCT allow for deeper imaging and were shown to improve detection and imaging of optic nerve head drusen (21). A recent study showed that peripapillary RNFL thinning correlated with the anatomic location of optic disc drusen and visual field defects, especially in patients with superficial optic disc drusen (22). OCT can be used to localize lesions along the visual pathway. Thinning of the macular ganglion cell layer is seen early in cases of toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy, which supports the concept that the papillomacular bundle is primarily damaged in this optic neuropathy (23). OCT also is helpful in detecting chiasmal injury. A case report discussed the use of OCT to identify the chiasmal hypoplasia variant of septo-optic dysplasia, causing thinning of the nasal and temporal quadrants of the peripapillary RNFL, in contrast to glaucoma that tends to affect the superior and inferior poles (24). Although the pattern of the RNFL thinning can sometimes detect chiasmal injury, a recent study evaluating chiasmal compression from tumors showed that analysis of the macular ganglion cell complex is more sensitive than measurement of the peripapillary RNFL (25). Chiasmal compression from tumor leads to a preferential thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex in the nasal hemiretina (8,26,27). Analysis of the macular ganglion cell complex also can help predict visual recovery following pituitary tumor surgery, where patients with less ganglion cell loss have better postoperative visual field results (25). While binasal thinning of the macular ganglion cell layer is seen in chiasmal injury, optic tract lesions cause homonymous hemimacular thinning, which was seen in a case report of optic tract injury from neuromyelitis optica (28). In 2 studies, OCT demonstrated that isolated occipital lesions may cause transsynaptic retrograde retinal degeneration and homonymous ganglion cell complex thinning (29,30). In contrast to optic tract lesions, where thinning is seen within weeks of injury, transsynaptic retrograde degeneration likely takes many months or years to develop. The observation of transsynaptic retrograde degeneration has implications in using OCT in neurodegenerative conditions. OCT has been proposed as a method of monitoring neurodegenerative diseases where the eye serves as the \"window to the brain.\" Iseri et al (31) showed RNFL and inner retinal thinning in patients with Alzheimer disease, which correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment. OCT studies also have demonstrated inner retina, ganglion cell complex, and RNFL thinning in patients with Parkinson disease (32–34), where the extent of thinning may correlate with the severity and duration of the disease. One article showed that there may be subclinical visual dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease, which correlates with thinning of the ganglion cell layer (35). OCT has been extensively used to study subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) (36–39) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (40,41). Davies et al (42) showed that patients with MS have a thinner ganglion cell complex thickness, especially if they had prior optic neuritis. Optic neuritis leads to thinning of the peripapillary RNFL in both NMOSD and MS. While NMOSD related optic neuritis tends to cause more thinning of the RNFL than MS-related optic neuritis (43,44), a study by Lange et al (41) revealed that there is an overlap between the 2 groups, and therefore RNFL alone is unable to differentiate the 2 forms of optic neuritis. In addition, patients with MS without clinical episodes of optic neuritis have been reported to have progressive thinning of the RNFL on OCT (45,46). Abalo-Lojo et al (46) found that RNFL thickness correlated with brain atrophy and disability scores in patients with MS, and thus OCT has been proposed as a method to monitor MS disease progression. Studies on subclinical RNFL loss in NMOSD are mixed in the literature, including those published within the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology (43). Interestingly, a 4-year observational study of 9 patients with NMOSD without optic neuritis did not demonstrate thinning of the RNFL over time, suggesting that the lack of progressive thinning of the RNFL could be used to distinguish NMOSD from MS (47). However, a study by Brody et al (48) found that patients with NMOSD can have subclinical optic neuritis. OCT is now an outcome measure of most clinical trials involving the optic nerve, including the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial (49–51), venous stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (52), nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (53) and MS (37). OCT allows for visualization of all layers of the retina and has provided insight into some disease processes. For example, 2 OCT studies showed outer plexiform layer retinal edema and subfoveal detachments in neuroretinitis, which suggests that the submacular detachments in neuroretinitis result from diffusion of fluid from the optic disc to the outer plexiform layer and through the outer limiting membrane to the subretinal space (54,55). In addition, OCT is important in documenting the ocular changes that occur during space flight, including optic disc edema and choroidal folds (56,57). Because OCT is very sensitive in detecting optic atrophy, it has been used to detect and monitor optic neuropathies in inherited conditions. Case reports and series showed that patients with Friederich ataxia (58), spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (59), spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (60), and panthothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (61) all have RNFL thinning on OCT. One article showed central retinal thinning of the retina and disorganized photoreceptor layers on OCT in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia Type 1 (62). While OCT is critical for the analysis of the optic nerve and retina and has revolutionized our ability to diagnose and track diseases, proper interpretation of the scans is important (63). There can be artifacts on OCT leading to misinterpretation of the imaging data. The most common artifacts of OCT were reviewed by Chen and Kardon (64). Failure to recognize these can lead to misdiagnoses or inappropriate investigations. Interestingly, an understanding of these artifacts can be used to diagnose and quantify cyclotorsion of the eyes, which was reported in a case of skew deviation from MS (65). It is important to note that there are differences in the standard measurements obtained by the different commercially available OCT devices, including thickness of the central macula and RNFL (66). For example, eyes with no light perception from chronic optic neuropathy have been shown to have an average RNFL thickness of 45.42 μm with time-domain OCT and 34.18 μm with spectral-domain OCT (67,68). These differences are important to recognize when comparing the results from different OCT machines. In summary, OCT is an evolving technology with faster scans and higher resolution being developed. Enhanced depth imaging and swept-source OCT allow imaging of the deeper layers of the eye. OCT angiography will allow better visualization of the capillaries and an approximation of ocular flow. These advances will ultimately provide us with a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and allow us to be better clinicians.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000505", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2592049107", "source": "openalex"}

Aims: The aim of this study is to analyze the degree of influence of various prognostic factors affecting visual outcome; the pattern of visual recovery and develop a scoring system for prognostication. Settings and Design: This is a retrospective study carried out from January 2004 till June 2011. Materials and Methods: Patients were analyzed on the basis of clinical, radiological, and surgical factors that appeared to affect the outcome. A special scoring system (according to the guidelines of the German Ophthalmological Society) was adopted to quantify the extent of ophthalmological disturbances. Statistical Analysis Used: Comparison of categorical variables between the two was performed using chi-square test and a P value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Logistic regression was used when multivariate analysis was required. Results: Vision improved in 27% and deteriorated in 7.3%. A prognostic scoring system (score 4–13) was developed depending on the degree of influence of significant prognostic factors. The patients with a score of ≤6 had improved vision postoperatively (44%), whereas none of those with a score &gt; 6 improved. Completeness of visual recovery was perceived in 100% of patients within 3 months. Complete resectability was achieved in 73% of patients. Conclusions: The proposed scoring system is very useful in prognosticating the visual outcome of these patients. The patients with a score of ≤6 have the best visual outcome postoperatively. Complete resectability is better achieved with extended bifrontal and unilateral frontal approaches.

Given the high curricular burden placed on medical schools, the authors sought to better characterize existing ophthalmology curricula and to delineate which offerings are closely related to high numbers of students applying and matching into ophthalmology residencies. Method The authors reviewed the extent of ophthalmology curricula between 2007 and 2017 via a survey administered in 2018 to all U.S. Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-affiliated medical schools. They obtained residency application and match data with permission from the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology. The authors compared metrics of ophthalmology exposure with the number of students who applied and matched into ophthalmology during the corresponding year using mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis. Results This study includes 49 U.S. AAMC-affiliated medical schools. When adjusted for the number of applicants per year, the following were significantly ( P &lt; .05) associated with matching into an ophthalmology residency: the presence of an ophthalmology department, an ophthalmology residency program, an ophthalmology interest group, ophthalmologists on faculty, ophthalmology content in the preclinical curriculum, preclinical lectures taught by ophthalmologists, and the availability of an optional fourth-year ophthalmology elective. Multivariable analysis indicated both that the presence of an ophthalmology residency program was the only independent predictor of matching into an ophthalmology residency and that the presence of an ophthalmology residency program, ophthalmology content in the preclinical curriculum, and preclinical lectures taught by ophthalmologists are independent predictors for applying.

Conclusions The accuracy of ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 in diagnosing patients with neuro-ophthalmic diseases was 59% and 82%, respectively. With further development, ChatGPT Plus v4.0 may have potential to be used in clinical care settings to assist clinicians in providing quick, accurate diagnoses of patients in neuro-ophthalmology. The applicability of using LLMs like ChatGPT in clinical settings that lack access to subspeciality trained neuro-ophthalmologists deserves further research. Summary Highlights - The goal of this study was to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT for the diagnoses of different neuro-ophthalmic diseases using specific case examples. - There was general agreement between ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and two neuro-ophthalmologists in final diagnoses. - ChatGPT was more general while neuro-ophthalmologists were more methodical and specific when listing diagnoses.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.13.23295508", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4386733942", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: A 12-question survey was distributed to United States–based pediatric ophthalmologists on the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus discussion board and various social media fora. Demographic, economic, and workforce pattern data were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 243 pediatric ophthalmologists completed the survey. One hundred seven (44.0%) respondents reported a surgical revenue decrease between 10% and 25%, 117 (48.1%) a clinical revenue decrease of less than 10%, 111 (45.6%) an overall income decrease of less than 10%, and 127 (52.2%) an overhead cost increase between 10% and 25%. Seventy-two (29.6%) respondents reported subsidizing income with pursuits outside of pediatric ophthalmology, 27 (11.1%) stopped operating due to reimbursement cuts, 75 (30.8%) limited the number of Medicaid or other public funded patients, 16 (6.5%) retired in the past 3 years, and 92 (37.8%) would not recommend a resident pursue a pediatric ophthalmology fellowship. Conclusions: There is a potential upheaval in the field of pediatric ophthalmology marked by increasing levels of disillusionment among current providers, a progressive decline in the number of trainees pursuing fellowship programs, and workforce issues suggestive of diversification of practice patterns outside of pediatric ophthalmology. The current economic crisis, in conjunction with these complex workforce issues, is and will continue to create a shortage of practicing pediatric ophthalmologists, seriously limiting access to pediatric and adult strabismus eye care.

Each of the type of glue is unique in terms of its advantages as well as limitations and so is used in different indications. Although the presently available tissue adhesives are good enough for the procedures mentioned, there is still a demand for newer adhesives. The increasing acceptance of these adhesives by the clinicians promises this to be a standard procedure for surgical wound closure. The existing cyanoacrylate glue is mainly used as a corneal patch to seal acute corneal perforations and improve visual outcomes, with reduced enucleation rates and need for tectonic keratoplasty in many situations. Fibrin glue is a biological adhesive, which reduces the total surgical time. The multiple advantages has extended its use in all the superspeciality fields of ophthalmology like corneal and conjunctival surgeries; strabismus, cataract, refractive, glaucoma, and even retinal surgeries. A newer tissue adhesive like biodendrimers and photocrosslinkable ones has better biocompatibility, rapid sealing properties and increased binding forces. It promises to overcome the drawbacks and risks associated with the existing ones but still under research. The increasing acceptance of all these promises it to be a standard procedure for surgical wound closure and probably will introduce a newer modality for drug delivery.

In the last 10 years, 31 articles describing 202 cases of Terson's syndrome (TS) were published. Only 3 out of the 31 were printed in non-ophthalmological journals. The findings of our prospective study underline the fact that too little attention is paid to TS in the early treatment of patients with SAH. Between 1/95 and 8/97, 89 patients with spontaneous SAH (7% of all admissions) were transferred to our hospital for post acute phase rehabilitation. Out of these, 13 patients (19 eyes) could be diagnosed with TS. This corresponds to an incidence of 14.6% of all patients with SAH (previous studies: 2-27%). However, only one patient had been correctly diagnosed with TS in the referring clinic. Early recognition of TS is of high importance since diminuation of visual acuity even to functional blindness, complicated in the bilateral case, can hamper the rehabilitative process considerably. Moreover, complications can lead to significant and irreversible damage, i.e. proliferative vitreo-retinopathy (PVR), retinal breaks, traction amotio, and cataract. Suspicion of TS is raised in either cooperative patients complaining of compromised visual acuity or in patients where funduscopy shows vitreous opacity. According to our results, visual evoked potentials (VEP) have only a limited role in diagnosis because of their low sensitivity. Not infrequently, however, VEP may point to accompanying optic nerve atrophy, thereby suggesting conservative treatment. Absolute indications for surgical interventions are PVR and its sequelae; relative indications are subjective visual impairment, impediment of rehabilitation, or lack of spontaneous resorption of the hemorrhage. The surgical procedure of choice is the pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Rare complications of this operation are retinal damage, endophthalmitis, and reoccurrence of hemorrhage.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2394989838", "source": "openalex"}

Some texts are designed as clinical manuals, which provide a quick synopsis without much detail, whereas others provide overwhelming encyclopedic information. Neuro-Ophthalmology: Diagnosis and Management, by Grant T. Liu, Nicholas J. Volpe, and Steven L. Galetta, strikes a balance of providing pertinent clinical information along with the anatomy, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of a disorder; all presented in a highly readable format. This second edition provides a comprehensive update on all topics, expanded illustrations, and major revision of migraine, multiple sclerosis, and neuro-imaging from the first edition (in 2001). The result is an excellent clinical reference for the practicing optometrist, the optometry resident, or the optometry student with an interest in neuro-ophthalmic disorders. The text is divided into four parts: History and Physical Examination with two chapters; Visual Loss and Other Disorders of the Afferent Visual Pathway with 10 chapters; Efferent Neuro-Ophthalmic Disorders with six chapters; and Other Topics with one chapter. Each chapter covers a specific clinical topic within each section. This organizational structure reflects that this is a text book written by clinicians for clinicians. Common clinical entities are presented with a succinct description, followed by a section on the demographics, pathology, pathogenesis, neuro-ophthalmic symptoms/signs, diagnostic/studies/evaluation, and treatment. The genius of the text is that it presents supplemental and detailed information for more common disorders and tightly edited information for less common or rare disorders. This provides for a comprehensive coverage of common clinical disorders while giving a brief overview of less common and rare disorders. The text is remarkably well illustrated with full-color clinical photographs and diagrams supplemented with neuroimaging studies, pathology, visual fields, OCT results, and fluorescein angiography as appropriate. The clinical photographs are of high quality with excellent resolution providing the novice a clear picture of the clinical finding being discussed. Each figure legend contains instructive comments on important clinical observations. Tables summarize the major clinical points of the text. Each chapter is well annotated with >400 primary references provided for the major clinical chapters. The text comes with a DVD-ROM that contains video of eye movements, eyelids, pupils, and examination techniques, as well as downloadable figures and tables. Neuro-Ophthalmology: Diagnosis and Management is highly recommended to the optometry student, the optometry resident, and the primary care clinical optometrist as a superb clinical reference with essential diagnostic details while providing an understanding of the pathophysiology of neuro-ophthalmic disorders.

The Eye Surgical Skills Assessment Test (ESSAT), a laboratory-based surgical skills obstacle course, was developed in response to the need for improved tools for the assessment of surgical skills during residency. The ESSAT has previously been shown to have face and content validity, and in this study we sought to determine its inter-rater reliability and, to some extent, its construct validity. <h3>Methods:</h3> Twenty-seven content experts (residency programme directors and faculty members involved with resident surgical training) watched videos of a junior resident and senior resident completing the three ESSAT stations (skin suturing, muscle recession, and phacoemulsification: wound construction &amp; suturing technique) and completed assessment forms, both task-specific checklists and a global rating scale of performance. <h3>Results:</h3> The ESSAT showed strong inter-rater reliability for determining whether a resident \"passed\" a threshold of competency at each station for both the checklists and global rating scale. In addition, for each station, the senior resident was consistently rated above a \"passing\" threshold using either assessment form, whereas the junior resident was more often rated below (94% vs 30% passing on completed forms). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> These results, along with the findings of our face and content validity analysis, support the reliability and validity of the ESSAT, and indicate that it could be a useful tool for improving the assessment of surgical skill during residency. The ESSAT is a tool that all residency programmes could implement as a part of their ophthalmic surgical curriculum and competency assessment, and may be useful to set a threshold of competence that all residents would need to achieve prior to entering the operating room.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.2007.123083", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973030015", "source": "openalex"}

This paper aims to introduce how GANs can be deployed for image synthesis in ophthalmology and to discuss the potential applications of GANs-produced images. Recent findings Image synthesis is the most relevant function of GANs to the medical field, and it has been widely used for generating ‘new’ medical images of various modalities. In ophthalmology, GANs have mainly been utilized for augmenting classification and predictive tasks, by synthesizing fundus images and optical coherence tomography images with and without pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Despite their ability to generate high-resolution images, the development of GANs remains data intensive, and there is a lack of consensus on how best to evaluate the outputs produced by GANs.

Among the clinical findings, one constant concern is the high prevalence of visual disorders that, if left untreated, can negatively affect child development. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ophthalmological findings among patients who attended an outpatient clinic for patients with Down syndrome in southern Brazil between 2005 and 2016. A cross‐sectional study including 1,207 patients medical records were done, which 492 (40.8%) had some ophthalmological disorder. These data were subjected to descriptive analysis using Statistica software. Among the 492 patients with any ophthalmological disease, the need for glasses was found in 434 (36%) patients, keratoconus in 254 (42.1%), congenital cataract in 27 (15.1%), nasolacrimal duct obstruction in 25 (2.0%), strabismus in 22 (1.9%), nystagmus in four (0.3%), and juvenile cataract in two (0.2%). Two young adults with keratoconus underwent corneal transplantation. Although the prevalence of an ophthalmological disease among the present sample (40.8%) was lower than described in the current literature, it still reinforced the importance of routine and early evaluations in infants. These should begin at 6 months of age and be repeated half‐year until 2 years old, annually until 7 years old, biennial in adolescents, and triennial in adults and elderly. Our findings of a high frequency of keratoconus support a detailed corneal study in such patients for early detection and treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.61845", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3087240611", "source": "openalex"}

Indeed, OCT has emerged as a surrogate end-point in the diagnosis and follow up of several demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS), including optic neuritis (ON) associated with: multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. Recent advancements in enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT have distinguished this technique as a new gold standard in the diagnosis of optic disc drusen (ODD). Moreover, OCT may enhance our ability to distinguish cases of papilledema from pseudopapilledema caused by ODD. In the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), OCT has shown benefit in tracking responses to treatment, with respect to reduced retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measures and morphological changes in the angling of Bruch's membrane. Longitudinal follow up of OCT measured ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness may be of particular value in managing IIH patients who have secondary optic atrophy. Causes of compressive optic neuropathies may be readily diagnosed with OCT, even in the absence of overt visual field defects. Furthermore, OCT values may offer some prognostic value in predicting post-operative outcomes in these patients. Finally, OCT can be indispensable in differentiating optic neuropathies from retinal diseases in patients presenting with vision loss, and an unrevealing fundus examination. In this review, our over-arching goal is to highlight the potential role of OCT, as an ancillary investigation, in the diagnosis and management of various optic nerve disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21037/aes.2018.05.08", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2810066259", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2715769787", "title": "Ophthalmology postgraduate training in India: Stirring up a hornet's nest", "text": "Medical Council of India (MCI) is an autonomous regulatory authority responsible for setting the standards of undergraduate as well as Postgraduate Medical Education besides certifying the availability of adequate infrastructure, clinical teaching material, and the trained workforce in the training institutes. Specifically, the Postgraduate Medical Education is governed by the MCI Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 with the goal of producing competent specialists who are expected to master most of the competencies to enable them to carry out their professional duties ethically.[1] Each discipline is expected to define competencies clearly to be brought to the notice of the new entrants so that they spend all their efforts in acquiring those competencies during the 3-year course of study. All training medical institutes, with the exception of some autonomous central institutes which are deemed universities, need an affiliation with a university for the conduct of the certifying examination for the award of MS/MD degree. More importantly, however, the universities are responsible for the development of an enabling and dynamic curriculum that is responsive to the changing demands of the community. However, with few exceptions, the curriculum, if developed, is not available publically for scrutiny by the society and worse still, may not have been changed ever since it was designed by the affiliating university's board of studies. Moreover, in a majority of the training institutes, the infrastructure development has not kept pace with the changing times. Additionally, there is no provision to test the quality of training or the trainers either by the MCI or the affiliating university. Training of the residents is left to the whims and fancies of the department faculty and perhaps largely, the head of the department, who may or may not have the will, belief or resources to keep pace with the changing technology or learning resources. It is a common observation that although the equipment is physically present, it may not be functional, or in the worst case, access to equipment may be restricted.[2] In the absence of a standard curriculum, modern equipment, learning environment, and a peer-reviewed quality assurance, the graduating ophthalmologists expectedly come out of our training institutes with hugely variable competencies. I am sure, the ophthalmology leadership in the country is fully aware of this.[34] In the current issue of the journal, the authors have stirred up a hornet's nest by reflecting on the training standards and the expectations of the ophthalmologists who trained 2–10 years before they were recruited for this survey.[5] In an update on a much smaller survey done in the past,[6] the authors of the present study managed to get a fairly large sample size (no = 531) of ophthalmologists representing all regions of India to answer questions on their perceptions of at least two important competencies, the clinical examination skills and the surgical skills in their training program. I applaud the authors for undertaking this painstaking study and exposing the truth with warts and all. The first step before taking a course correction is admitting that all is not well with ophthalmology training in India. To bring out a clear perspective on ophthalmology training in our country, 241 medical institutions are certified by the MCI for running the MS Ophthalmology course with an annual intake of 1026 students.[7] A total of 118 Government Medical Colleges and 123 private trust medical colleges are certified to run the MS Ophthalmology course. Twice as many seats (683:343) are available every year in the Government Medical Colleges compared to the private institutions.[7] Besides 120 medical colleges also run a DO course (66 government; 54 trust). Twice as many seats exist in the Government institutes for DO 242 versus 113 for the trust institutes.[7] In January 2017, 147 DNB seats were available in 66 specialist eye hospitals and two multispecialty hospitals practically all in the private sector the so-called \"corporate hospitals.\"[8] On a rough estimate, nearly, 1500 newly minted Ophthalmologists become available every year to practice in India. Given that nearly 60% of the ophthalmologists come out of government medical institutes, the critical question that has been addressed albeit to a limited extent is whether the clinical skill training is perceived to be better in the government medical institutions or the private trust institutions? Are the doctors who are trained in the National Board of Examination (NBE) accredited institutions for DNB degree better trained? As expected, the government institutes fared badly on the basic clinical skills such as the slit lamp examination, gonioscopy, applanation tonometry, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and the biomicroscopic fundoscopy. Times have changed and expectedly uniform poor performance across the training institutes on refraction reflects the students' own indifference rather than the opportunities and the training material. Likewise, the evaluation skills for children including the squint and vision assessment were poorly performing primarily because of students' indifference. As far as the surgical skills are concerned, the emphasis appears on extracapsular cataract extraction and small incision cataract surgery. It is really unfortunate that nearly 50% of the trainees did not perform independently or under supervision, phacoemulsification, squint, and trabeculectomy. It is a paradox that while the trainee ophthalmologists from the western world flock to India for training in phacoemulsification, our own trainees are deprived of this opportunity. That they did not get to see or assist posterior segment procedures, corneal grafting, or the laser procedures reflect on the lack of infrastructure and the trained faculty in the training institutes. This calls for a serious introspection by the authority to allow such institutes to keep training the ophthalmologists for the nation. I would have loved the authors to dissect their data to compare the surgical skills training in government versus the private sector institutes to have a clearer perspective on this critical aspect of training. The residency programs in the western world are far more competitive, structured, regulated, and peer-reviewed.[9] Excellent modules are available from the International Council of Ophthalmology and NBEs for emulation by the training institutes in India. It is high time they shed their inertia.

Due to its low incidence and broad spectrum of symptoms, LS does not have an obvious clinical diagnosis and can confuse the clinician managing the patient. Furthermore, it is equally difficult to treat patients suffering from LS as it requires a multidisciplinary approach from multiple subspecialties. Thus, communication between hospitalists, radiologists, otolaryngologists, neurologists, and ophthalmologists is critical towards quickly diagnosing the disease condition so that prompt antibiotics, anticoagulation, and surgical intervention can occur. Atypical presentations can also exist, making the diagnosis and management exponentially more challenging. Ophthalmologic symptoms are a particularly rare and atypical presentation of LS. These rare symptoms in LS can be terrifying for patients and providers alike; yet, there does not seem to be any modern medical literature that summarizes ophthalmologic complications for LS patients. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of LS with a focus on ophthalmologic complications that has been done. The main objective of this review paper is to provide an up-to-date literature review of LS epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment while also performing a novel systematic review of reported cases of LS with ophthalmological complications. We hope to bring more awareness towards LS and its atypical presentations so that physicians will be better able to rapidly diagnose and treat their patients in order to minimize long-term morbidity and mortality.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9326", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3044073732", "source": "openalex"}

Increasing patterns of antibiotic resistance have necessitated the development of new antimicrobial agents for use in bacterial keratitis and other serious ocular infections. With a view to exploring the use of novel antimicrobial peptides in the management of ocular infection, we performed a series of experiments using synthetic antimicrobial peptides designed for the eradication of common and serious ophthalmic pathogens.Experiments were performed with three clinical ocular isolates--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis--in three experimental settings: (1) in vitro in a controlled system of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, (2) in vitro in modified chondroitin sulfate-based corneal preservation media (Optisol), and (3) in an in vivo animal model (rabbit) simulating bacterial keratitis. In all cases, outcomes were measured by quantitative microbiological techniques.The candidate peptides (CCI A, B, and C and COL-1) produced a total reduction of the test pathogens in phosphate buffered saline. In modified Optisol, the peptides were effective against S epidermidis at all temperatures, demonstrated augmented activity at 23 degrees C against the gram-positive organisms, but were ineffective against P aeruginosa. The addition of EDTA to the medium augmented the killing of P aeruginosa but made no difference in the reduction of gram-positive organisms. In an in vivo rabbit model of Pseudomonas keratitis, COL-1 demonstrated neither clinical nor microbicidal efficacy and appeared to have a very narrow dosage range, outside of which it appeared to be toxic to the ocular surface.Our data indicate that the antimicrobial peptides we tested were effective in vitro but not in vivo. In an age of increasing antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptides, developed over millions of years as innate defense mechanisms by plants and animals, may have significant potential for development as topical agents for the management of severe bacterial keratitis. However, modifications of the peptides, the drug delivery systems, or both, will be necessary for effective clinical application.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1451368151", "source": "openalex"}

Medical students are often taught irrelevant details with little or no reference to their potential clinical significance. Alternatively, integrated teaching warrants that the complete teaching material is covered by each faculty member not considering areas of personal expertise. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of integrated teaching in ophthalmic training.The main outcome measures of this retrospective study were a) comments and recommendations made anonymously by the fifth-year medical students in the evaluation questionnaires filled in at the end of their training, and b) scores obtained by students in their final examination at the end of their training in the 2nd Department of Ophthalmology as part of the core Curriculum of the Medical School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The latter outcome was analyzed with respect to the implementation of integrated teaching.The score obtained by students in the final examination, which is an objective outcome measure, increased significantly after the implementation of integrated teaching. The final grade (scores out of 10) of students who were trained with the integrated system (6.17±1.67, mean ± standard deviation) was significantly higher compared to those (5.52±2.20) trained with the conventional system (P<0.001). The positive outcome of this process was evident as there was a significant increase in the number of students satisfied with the teaching process compared to previous academic years.Based on the experience of eight academic years and as a result of interactive assessment process our department has modified its medical student teaching process from conventional to integrated; all teaching staff members are involved in the teaching process, while students are divided in small groups. In conclusion, integrated teaching in small student groups appears to be an efficient teaching method (for both theoretical and clinical skills) of ophthalmic training for medical students.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/amep.s71759", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010357266", "source": "openalex"}

The potential for AI to transform medicine is increasingly becoming part of popular discourse, although the origin of these technologies can be traced back to Alan Turing's research in the 1930s.1 The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by John McCarthy in 1955 to describe the science of creating intelligent machines which replicate human behavior.2 It has many subtypes and modern examples include machine learning (ML), which learns automatically from data sets in the absence of explicitly programmed rules. A subset of ML is deep learning (DL), which trains itself using multiple layers of neural networks which are adaptable programming units inspired by the structure of human neurons.3 Most modern progress has been made with DL, which has gained extraordinary attention since the publication of a seminal 2012 paper on image recognition.4 Deep learning relies on data moving through layers of neural networks and excels at identifying correlations within input data. Convolutional neural networks, a class of DL, are particularly well-suited for image recognition in highly image-driven medical specialties such as ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology. These convolutional neural networks utilize vast quantities of labelled imaging data and have been at the forefront of AI research. Significant recent progress has been achieved in ophthalmology, as fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are routinely used clinically to make a diagnosis. Not surprisingly, the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved AI diagnostic device was in the field of ophthalmology.5 Ophthalmologists, as well as other medical professionals who monitor and manage patients at risk of developing ocular disease such as general practitioners and endocrinologists, therefore, have a unique opportunity to lead the way for the adoption of these technologies. The successful clinical adoption of AI will ultimately be achieved if it is implemented in environments which are safe, evidence-based, and meaningful in improving patient outcomes, and our experience may be instructive for medicine as a whole. Significant progress in the development of AI algorithms for ophthalmology has already been achieved and is extensively detailed by Balyen and Peto in this issue of the Journal.6 However, key challenges remain. This editorial will focus on the accuracy and challenges which must be resolved prior to the wide adoption of these technologies within clinical care. Rapid advances have been achieved in the performance, imaging modalities, and multitude of diseases able to be detected by ML and DL algorithms. Recent publications have demonstrated AI's efficacy in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR),5,7,8 age-related macular degeneration (AMD),9,10 glaucoma,11,12 and retinopathy of prematurity.13 Gulshan et al7 in 2016 trained an AI diagnostic algorithm using 128,175 de-identified retinal images from combined US and Indian databases, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 for the detection of referable DR. Similarly, Li et al8 trained and tested a DL algorithm for referable DR using over 100,000 images, achieving an AUC of 0.99 on internal validation and 0.955 on external validation using an independent multi-ethnic data set. Ting et al9 in 2017 collated 494,661 retinal images to train an AI system which was externally tested in 11 multi-ethnic cohorts, achieving clinically acceptable diagnostic performance in referable DR, as well as high accuracies in the diagnosis of glaucoma and AMD which may be concurrently present in the same eye. Following the successful development of AI algorithms using retinal photographs, De Fauw et al14 at DeepMind in 2018 applied DL to OCT, developing a model which automatically segmented tissue layers, achieving a diagnostic performance meeting and exceeding those of human expert graders for 50 common ophthalmic conditions. Despite the promise of these research advances, significant deficits remain in the validation of these algorithms. Of note, many AI algorithms remain validated in silico with testing typically completed on retrospective data. Validation of diagnostic algorithms in real-world settings—with differing camera systems, operators, image quality—and in geographically and racially diverse settings, remains an emerging area.15 Algorithms have so far typically performed less accurately in prospective real-world studies compared with their in silico counterparts.3 The limitations of retrospective in silico validation are increasingly being recognized. As such, several research groups have commenced validation of these algorithms in real-world prospective trials.5,16-18 Notably in a recent review of AI research within all areas of medicine, prospective real-world clinical trials had only been completed in 5 disease areas, 2 of which were in ophthalmology.3 Furthermore, it is common for these algorithms to be trained and validated using retinal images which are given a subjective clinical label based on the consensus of multiple clinicians, rather than the ground truth diagnosis. This kind of labelling may be sufficient for performing straightforward tasks; however, disease classification or pattern recognition may require a more accurate ground truth diagnosis based on real-world clinical data. For example, the diagnosis of glaucoma is made based on several factors such as family history, intraocular pressure, anterior chamber angle, visual field results, and optic nerve appearance. Information such as a confirmed medical history, visual field damage, or evidence of progression is a far superior ground truth for diseases such as glaucoma and this type of high-level information will likely lead to the highest levels of diagnostic accuracy. Significant attention has been devoted recently to the development of a regulatory framework for AI systems. Artificial intelligence algorithms are typically classified as “Software as a Medical Device” and may be assessed through the FDA's Software Precertification Program which has recently been piloted.19 Further, AI systems are designed to continuously adapt and improve over time as they receive and train with more data input. The performance of a DR screening system, for example, may improve over time as it adapts to the unique patient characteristics of a particular real-world site. Existing regulatory approvals have been for ‘locked box’ systems where training and diagnostic thresholds have been completed and set, denying the adaptive nature of these systems. The first-ever regulatory-approved autonomous AI diagnostic system, the IDx-DR,5 has been approved using this initial pathway.20 To provide a potential framework which accounts for the evolving nature of these systems, the FDA has recently published a discussion paper for public feedback.21 Overall, the regulatory framework for AI systems is crystallizing, although elements are yet to be finalized. To achieve FDA's approval, the team behind the IDx-DR system performed a prospective cohort study of 900 participants across 10 primary care sites in the US.5,20 The system was able to detect more-than-mild DR at a sensitivity and specificity of 87.2% and 90.7%, respectively,5 which ultimately led to it becoming the first-ever approved autonomous AI diagnostic system. Following this precedent, prospective and real-world validation trials of AI systems will be essential for future regulatory approval. Further to this, the uptake of these systems will be reliant on the creation of a commercial product that can be easily deployed and utilized by end-users. There is a plethora of published work on the performance of these AI systems but very few have developed a commercial product. Researchers from the Centre for Eye Research Australia have developed a fully functioning EyeGrader clinician interface, with integrated, automated diagnosis which produces an immediate grading report for clinicians that can function both online and offline. Unlike the IDx-DR system, EyeGrader is able to grade for 4 common blinding eye diseases including referable DR,8 suspect glaucoma,11 late-wet AMD, and cataract. The feasibility and acceptability of the EyeGrader system has been pilot-tested in real-world settings in Australia with great success. Over 95% of screened patients reported that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the automated screening model.17 Early analysis of in-depth interviews suggests that the system is well-accepted by clinicians and has the potential to improve overall patient care (J Scheetz and MK He, unpublished). As discussed above, AI algorithms have been shown to be able to carry out repeatable tasks with great accuracy, speed and consistency, including the automated diagnosis of fundal images and OCT scans. However, thought must be given to which clinical settings are most suitable for the adoption of AI systems given that close to 50% of eye diseases remain undiagnosed in countries such as Australia.22,23 It is likely that AI systems will be of most benefit in rural and remote centers where access to specialist care is limited, as well as opportunistic screening of at-risk individuals by non-eye health care professionals such as general practitioners and endocrinologists since many common blinding eye diseases are asymptomatic in their early stages. Whilst retinal imaging is an effective screening tool for the detection of many ocular conditions, it is highly dependent on image interpretation by clinical experts. The introduction of automated retinal grading has the potential to remove the barriers associated with previous retinal screening models. Such systems will give non-eye health care professionals the capacity to detect disease in patients who have previously had no access to ophthalmic care or are in the early stages of disease and are asymptomatic. This in turn will lead to more timely treatment and potentially reduce the burden of visual impairment and blindness. Whilst there are many potential benefits to the introduction of AI systems there are significant ethical and legal considerations which remain, particularly surrounding possible harm which may arise from AI systems. Iatrogenic harm which may result from a mistaken algorithm used across populations can be immense. A key component to addressing these concerns is understanding how an AI algorithm reaches its decision. The immense complexity of AI algorithms means that the rationale for how these systems generate outputs may often not be interpretable nor understood—this is known as the ‘black box’ problem. This opacity, particularly if an algorithm reaches a false conclusion, may limit the ability of end users to identify root causes and prevent future errors from recurring. Concern for the intelligibility of AI decision-making may thus constrain clinical acceptance and adoption. Significant research efforts have been underway to visualize and interpret the features DL models evaluate to produce their outputs, in an effort to address these concerns around interpretability and clinician acceptance.12,24 As a discipline, ophthalmology is leading the way in the use of AI in medicine. The review by Balyen and Peto6 importantly highlights the ever-evolving use of AI and its potential clinical use in diagnosing ophthalmic disease. Significant challenges remain in translating recent research advances into changes to routine clinical care; however, clinician and patient acceptance for the potential of these technologies is growing.17 Ophthalmologists' experience and leadership may be instructive for the medical community as a whole in harnessing the extraordinary potential for AI to improve patient care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.22608/apo.2019122", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2964067592", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the importance of systematic evaluation of the purpose, target disease, effectiveness, and utility of smartphone applications to their effective utilization, few studies have formally evaluated their validity, reliability, and clinical utility.Clinical relevanceThis report identifies smartphone applications with potential for clinical implementation in ophthalmology and summarizes the evidence on their practical utility.MethodsWe searched PubMed and EMBASE on July 28, 2022 for articles reporting original data on the effectiveness of treatment, disease detection, diagnostic accuracy, disease monitoring, and usability of smartphone applications in ophthalmology published between January 1, 1987 and July 25, 2022. Their quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist.ResultsThe initial search yielded 510 articles. After removing 115 duplicates and 285 articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the full texts of the remaining 110 articles were reviewed. Further, 71 articles were included in the final qualitative synthesis. All studies were determined to be of high (87.3%) or moderate (12.7%) quality. In terms of respective application of interest, 24 (33.8%) studies assessed diagnostic accuracy, 17 (23.9%) assessed disease detection, and 3 (4.2%) assessed intervention efficacy. A total of 48 smartphone applications were identified, of which 27 (56.3%) were publicly available. Seventeen (35.4%) applications included functions for ophthalmic examinations, 13 (27.1%) included functions aimed at disease detection, 10 (20.8%) included functions to support medical personnel, five (10.4%) included functions related to disease education, and three (6.3%) included functions to promote treatment adherence for patients. The largest number of applications targeted amblyopia (18.8%), followed by retinal disease (10.4%). Two (4.2%) smartphone applications reported significant efficacy in treating diseases.ConclusionIn this systematic review, a comprehensive appraisal is presented on studies related to diagnostic accuracy, disease detectability, and efficacy of smartphone applications in ophthalmology.

In recognition of seasonal variations in patient visit volumes, the 10 months before implementation (August 1, 2014, to May 31, 2015) were compared with complementary periods in 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017.The study tabulated encounters, charges, and visit length for outpatients seen on the same day or by previously scheduled appointments. For the ED patients, volume, diagnoses, charges, and length of stay data were collected. The numbers of SDA patients who indicated urgency were tabulated.The number of SDA patients increased from 22 781 to 26 579 for the first year after SDA implementation. The mean charge was $258 (95% CI, $250-$266; median, $184; interquartile range [IQR], $175-$320), and the mean clinic transit time was 1.55 hours (95% CI, 1.54-1.57 hours; median, 1.28 hours). For patients seeking eye care in the ED, the mean professional fee was $401 (95% CI, $390-$411; median, $360; IQR, $255-$500), the mean (SD) total hospital charge was $1040 ($999) (95% CI, $729-$1079; median, $1002; IQR, $334-$1429), and the mean length of stay was 7.30 hours (95% CI, 7.01-7.57 hours; median, 7.20 hours). The top 4 ophthalmic diagnoses for ED patients were conjunctivitis, cornea abrasion, iritis, and visual loss, which were unchanged after SDA implementation. In calendar year 2017, a total of 4062 SDA patients reported urgency; their estimated savings in charges compared with an ED visit were $580 866 in professional fees and $3 176 484 in hospital charges.Same-day access appears to be less expensive and to require less time in the health care system than a visit to the ED for an ophthalmic diagnosis. Substantial savings in time and money might be achieved if urgent eye care is delivered in the clinic rather than the ED.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.0864", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2942443797", "source": "openalex"}

This review highlights the challenges and opportunities with tele-neuro-ophthalmology. Recent findings Tele-neuro-ophthalmology programs can be used for triage, diagnostic consultation, and long-term treatment monitoring. Formats include telephone appointments, interprofessional collaborations, remote data interpretation, online asynchronous patient communication, and video visits. Barriers to long-term implementation of tele-neuro-ophthalmology arise from data quality, patient engagement, workflow integration, state and federal regulations, and reimbursement. General neurologists may collaborate with local eye care providers for ophthalmic examination, imaging, and testing to facilitate efficient and effective tele-neuro-ophthalmology consultation.

We performed natural language processing (NLP) of 743 838 operative notes recorded for 315 246 surgeries to ascertain two variables needed to study the comparative effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in cataract surgery. The first key variable was an exposure variable, intracameral antibiotic injection. The second was an intraoperative complication, posterior capsular rupture (PCR), which functioned as a potential confounder. To help other researchers use NLP in their settings, we describe our NLP protocol and lessons learned. Methods For each of the two variables, we used SAS Text Miner and other SAS text-processing modules with a training set of 10 000 (1.3%) operative notes to develop a lexicon. The lexica identified misspellings, abbreviations, and negations, and linked words into concepts (e.g. \"antibiotic\" linked with \"injection\"). We confirmed the NLP tools by iteratively obtaining random samples of 2000 (0.3%) notes, with replacement. Results The NLP tools identified approximately 60 000 intracameral antibiotic injections and 3500 cases of PCR. The positive and negative predictive values for intracameral antibiotic injection exceeded 99%. For the intraoperative complication, they exceeded 94%. Conclusion NLP was a valid and feasible method for obtaining critical variables needed for a research study of surgical safety. These NLP tools were intended for use in the study sample. Use with external datasets or future datasets in our own setting would require further testing.

With advances in electronic health record data collection and the development of other specialty-based clinical data registries, the AAO launched a task force in 2012 to explore the creation of an ophthalmic disease data registry.3Parke 2nd, D.W.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS® Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight clinical data): a look back and a look to the future.Ophthalmology. 2017; 124: 1572-1574Google Scholar At its initial launch in 2014, the registry collected data from 3000 clinicians throughout the United States, but the project has since expanded rapidly. As of October 2021, the IRIS Registry includes data on more than 412 million patient visits from more than 70.8 million unique patients, with nearly 16 000 eye clinicians reporting.4American Academy of OphthalmologyIRIS Registry data analysis.https://www.aao.org/iris-registry/data-analysis/requirementsGoogle Scholar Although estimates differ, approximately 70% of all 18 000 active practicing ophthalmologists in the United States are currently contributing to the IRIS Registry (Flora Lum, MD, personal communication, 2021). The goals for the IRIS Registry include creating both national and interpractice benchmark reports on best practices for improving patient care; assisting practices with meeting federal reporting requirements; enabling data analysis for population health, rare disease research, and new scientific discovery; and identifying safety signals in new drugs and devices. The IRIS Registry has already had a significant impact on clinical practice. For example, providers who use the IRIS Registry to demonstrate their compliance with required quality measures avoid penalties (an average of $36 156 per ophthalmologist for 2020) and can receive small bonuses (the top was $7191 per ophthalmologist in 2019) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.3Parke 2nd, D.W.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS® Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight clinical data): a look back and a look to the future.Ophthalmology. 2017; 124: 1572-1574Google Scholar In addition, the IRIS Registry allows physicians to compare their performance with that of other clinicians (both in their own practice and nationally) and to improve patient outcomes.5Rich W.L. Chiang M.F. Lum F. et al.Performance rates measured in the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS® Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight).Ophthalmology. 2018; 125: 782-784Google Scholar Clinician performance measures such as cataract surgery visual acuity outcomes were shown to have improved since the IRIS Registry began.5Rich W.L.

Lum F. et al.Performance rates measured in the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS® Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight).Ophthalmology. 2018; 125: 782-784Google Scholar Advancing scientific discovery has been another major goal of the IRIS Registry. In 2017, the AAO selected several academic centers with the capacity for big data analytics for the IRIS Registry Analytic Center Consortium through an application process. Researchers at these selected centers were allowed to develop research questions for consideration and were granted access to the IRIS Registry data in late 2019 that would allow in-house analytics instead of relying on the AAO or its affiliated team. After an application process, the University of Washington, Stanford University, Wills Eye Hospital/Thomas Jefferson University, and Massachusetts Eye and Ear/Harvard Ophthalmology were selected. Over several years, principal investigators in the IRIS Registry Analytic Center Consortium have worked together with the AAO leadership, the AAO Committee on IRIS Registry Analytics, and technology partners such as Verana Health to develop data abstraction methods for big data research approaches using the IRIS Registry data. To date, the Analytic Center Consortium has published more than 10 major studies in addition to numerous meeting abstracts and paper presentations.4American Academy of OphthalmologyIRIS Registry data analysis.https://www.aao.org/iris-registry/data-analysis/requirementsGoogle Scholar,6Lee C.S.

The size of the IRIS Registry allowed this study to include 3.5 times more patients undergoing immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery than previous similar studies.8Herrinton L.J. Liu L.

Despite these successes, several challenges continue to exist in using the IRIS Registry data. Although the data collected from the clinicians who report to the IRIS Registry are quite extensive, to ensure patient confidentiality, strict criteria were implemented to limit the data variables that are accessible to researchers. Although clinicians own their individual practice data, the AAO owns the de-identified, aggregated data after it is uploaded to the IRIS Registry.3Parke 2nd, D.W. Rich 3rd, W.L. Sommer A. Lum F. The American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS® Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight clinical data): a look back and a look to the future.Ophthalmology. 2017; 124: 1572-1574Google Scholar Although the goal is for the Analytic Center Consortium to receive a comprehensive version of the aggregated data that can be used for multiple studies, many important variables such as detailed medication data and practice geographic information were not accessible in the initial IRIS Registry versions made available to the analytic centers (codenamed Rome 1 and Rome 2). This was because of the imposition of patient privacy protections that were even stricter than the safeguards established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This is in contrast to what has traditionally been available to researchers outside the Analytic Center Consortium through the foundation, subspecialty society funded grants, or industry-sponsored mechanisms mentioned above. For such projects, the AAO provides a dataset that is specific to the study question or even performs the analyses to ensure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, and these datasets often include data fields that are not part of the Rome 1 or 2 versions. Multiple studies have been published through this route, all based on specially selected datasets and analyses that were tailored to the specific research question.13Vanner E.A. Sun C.Q.

The recently updated version of de-identified IRIS Registry data, Chicago, contains many additional variables, such as medication, cup-to-disc ratio, and refraction data, compared with those provided in earlier versions. Additionally, it provides a single standardized resource for all analyses, including the Analytic Center Consortium and the other supported programs, which should decrease discrepancies in available data quality. As the number of important clinical variables become available, the IRIS Registry will allow more sophisticated analyses such as feature-based analyses, where researchers identify biomarkers of a disease or its progression or generate new avenues of investigation using a purely data-driven, hypothesis-agnostic approach.24Lee C.S. Brandt J.D. Lee A.Y. Big data and artificial intelligence in ophthalmology: where are we now?.Ophthalmology Science. 2021; 1: 100036Google Scholar In addition, findings from IRIS Registry studies that are consistent with other study results from smaller populations with limited geographic representation would support the validity of those findings in a national sample. However, the inherent limitations of a large, clinical practice-based dataset, including missing data and coding errors, must be considered at all times.25Lee C.S. Lee A.Y. Holland G.N. et al.Big data and uveitis.Ophthalmology. 2016; 123: 2273-2275Google Scholar Undoubtedly, the completeness of clinical notes depends on factors including clinicians' documentation habits or examination settings within the IRIS Registry. Even in the updated version, the de-identified dataset still lacks important variables such as refractive target, axial length, and imaging results. Also, the dataset is ophthalmology centric, and therefore, the potential to investigate any correlations between ophthalmic findings and systemic diagnoses or medications is limited. Any free-written text in the electronic health record will remain unavailable for the foreseeable future. Future goals include automatic abstractions of free-written text and numeric data from diagnostic instruments such as visual fields and retinal imaging. Despite these limitations, immeasurable value exists in being able to assess the routine clinical practice patterns and clinical outcomes that often differ from the results of randomized clinical trials. Still, novel findings from big data may not be possible to validate because of the lack of other independent datasets of similar size or quality. Thus, researchers must be cautious in understanding the scope and limitations of the available dataset and must perform careful sensitivity analyses to explain the plausibility of any results that deviate from previous literature.26Thabane L.

The long-term vision for the IRIS Registry, to become a multidimensional dataset that incorporates multimodal and nonophthalmic medical data, is truly exciting. As it currently stands, the IRIS Registry Analytic Center Consortium is uniquely positioned to address relevant research questions because their investigators were instrumental in developing the data abstraction and analysis methods, are aware of the limitations in the datasets available to them, and are capable of adjusting their analyses to accommodate these limitations. Additional centers have been accepted to join the IRIS Registry Analytic Center Consortium, and this process will continue on a regular basis. The experience gained by the 4 analytic centers from the early challenges will be instrumental in expediting the onboarding and success of new centers. Journal editors, reviewers, and the general readership should be aware of current strengths and limitations of the IRIS Registry Analytic Center Consortium projects.

Methods Two hundred and seventeen children were included in the study. Best‐corrected distance and near visual acuities ( VA ) were measured using logMAR charts. Cycloplegic retinoscopy was performed, and spherical equivalent and astigmatism were determined. Examination of ocular movement and cover test for distance and near were performed. Stereopsis was assessed with the TNO test, and contrast sensitivity with the V istech test. The R oyal A ir F orce rule was used for assessing accommodation, and near point of convergence was measured with the L ang fixation stick. Ophthalmoscopy was performed through dilated pupils. Results Eighty‐two per cent of the children had a distance VA of −0.1 log MAR (1.3 S nellen acuity) or better. None of the children were visually impaired [ VA &gt;0.6 log MAR (&lt;0.3 S nellen acuity)]. Ninety‐three per cent had a near VA of −0.1 log MAR (1.25 S nellen acuity) or better. Mean spherical equivalent was 0.6 D. Eight (3.6%) children had hypermetropia (≥+2 D), and 17 (7.8%) were myopic (≤−0.5 D).

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate and relate visual function, ocular dimensions and neuropaediatric findings in adoptees from Eastern Europe. Methods: We studied 72 of 99 children, born during 1990–95 and adopted from Eastern Europe to western Sweden during 1993–97. The children (mean age 7.5 years, range 4.8–10.5 years; 41 boys, 31 girls) were examined after a mean period of 5 years post‐adoption by a multidisciplinary team. Correlations between ophthalmological findings and neuropaediatric data were analysed. Results: Bivariate and regression analyses indicate a significant positive correlation between visual acuity (VA) and perceptual organization (p &lt; 0.001), as well as between strabismus and verbal comprehension (p &lt; 0.02). Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was correlated with low VA (p &lt; 0.02), subnormal stereovision (p &lt; 0.009) and small optic discs (p &lt; 0.02). Small head circumference was related to low VA (p &lt; 0.015) and small optic discs (p &lt; 0.03). Furthermore, small optic discs were related to low birthweight (p &lt; 0.005) and preterm birth (p &lt; 0.01). Large optic cups were correlated with poorer perceptual organization (p &lt; 0.02). Conclusions: In this group of adoptees from Eastern Europe, ophthalmological findings were correlated to neuropaediatric findings, especially those arising from prenatal adverse events resulting in growth deficiency and central nervous system damage.

Given a novel image to analyze, for example, AI may misdiagnose a patient based on an incomplete or inadequate training set. Machine learning and especially deep learning platforms need to be trained on large amounts of historical data (e.g., fundus photography) to learn which features of an image are associated with a particular condition. When a novel image is presented that is atypical, such as if a diabetic retinopathy AI model is given an image harboring central retinal vein occlusion, the AI model may provide false or even nonsense answers. Without transparency, it may be impossible to explain why a particular failure occurred. Even if the general explanation is that the training set is insufficiently broad, what data are missing or needed may be opaque.Transparency is arguably secondary to the capacity for AI to improve patient outcomes and public health. Machine learning systems in ophthalmology have been tested, but to date only 1 trial has demonstrated improved patient outcomes.13Abràmoff M.D. Lavin P.T.

In some cases, accurate, empirically verified results may be sufficient. In infectious disease, for example, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be tried in the absence of detailed information of a pathogen.8Rudin C. Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead.Nat Mach Intell. 2019; 1: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar However, ophthalmology is highly explainable in diagnostic terms, with strict definitions for most diseases. Deferring to AI may present a significant decrease in confidence in the diagnostic process, especially when only modest increases in verifiability are achieved. The degree to which this arises, and how this trade-off between transparency and confidence varies by specialty, needs further investigation.Lack of sufficient transparency may exacerbate other issues in the use of medical AI. Although human physicians can reflect on and justify their actions to colleagues, an AI model's mistakes are predetermined through training. Errors may propagate from a single point of failure if they become the diagnostic standard across, say, an entire hospital network. Patients may seek a second opinion, but if an algorithm is widely distributed, the same system may be performing the diagnosis at a separate clinic. Future AI models may be able to revise their predictions in response to new data, but this presents its own challenges, especially if these revisions lack transparency. Excessive trust in AI may be worse for patient outcomes than if AI were approached more skeptically.15Gerke S. Babic B. Evgeniou T. Cohen I.G. The need for a system view to regulate artificial intelligence/machine learning-based software as medical device.NPJ Digit Med. 2020; 3: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google ScholarSometimes, the benefits of AI may outweigh transparency concerns. Consider ROP, a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. The clinical benefit of screening is well established, but is hampered globally by cost and human labor requirements.1Ting D.S.W. Pasquale L.R. Peng L. et al.Artificial intelligence and deep learning in ophthalmology.Br J Ophthalmol. 2019; 103: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar Artificial intelligence may provide a low-cost screening option in resource-scarce settings, where even modest improvements in testing and treatment could have a significant impact, given the steep long-term costs of ROP.16Frick K.D. Mashfeghi D.M.

Evans N.G. The social value of candidate HIV cures: actualism versus possibilism.J Med Ethics. 2017; 43: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar the large potential benefits and low cost justify the use of AI.Explainable AI may obviate some of these transparency concerns. However, Rudin8Rudin C. Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead.Nat Mach Intell. 2019; 1: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar has noted that explainability may be a misnomer. Instead, the focus should be on creating models that are inherently interpretable, rather than attempting to generate solutions for unexplainable AI. For the foreseeable future, then, a tension exists between deploying black-boxed AI immediately or waiting for explainable AI, where delays may come at the cost of improvements to patient outcomes.ResponsibilityEthical frameworks may distinguish between the responsibility for ensuring AI performs in a certain way and the moral or legal liability when harms occur. Herein, we deal with only ethical responsibilities and not, for example, legal liability, although these are related issues. In health care, a responsibility gap arises when responsibility cannot be easily attributed to 1 or more actors, including hospitals, health and malpractice insurers, individual physicians and nurses, and so on. In ophthalmology, 1 private company, IDx, has accepted responsibility for errors in their AI platform, effectively attempting to close the responsibility gap through claiming responsibility for AI outcomes, enshrining this in legal terms by purchasing liability and malpractice insurance on behalf of the platform.5Abràmoff M.D. Tobey D.

In their consideration of the legal aspects of AI, for example, IDx claims their principles require that creators \"assume liability for harm caused by the diagnostic output of the device when used properly and on-label.\"5Abràmoff M.D. Tobey D.

Here, responsibility for appropriate use might include managing which data are retained by the system. For these adaptive regimes, evaluating performance for on-label and off-label conditions will require continuous postmarket monitoring, rather than the current premarket approval approach for pharmaceuticals or other devices.Allocating responsibility at the level of governance and regulation is an additional challenge. Others have argued that regulation of AI should focus on continuous monitoring20Beede E. Baylor E. Hersch F. et al.A human-centered evaluation of a deep learning system deployed in clinics for the detection of diabetic retinopathy.in: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.

However, implementing this in practice would require overhauling the institutions that govern medical innovation and practice.One preliminary approach would require large, adaptive clinical trials of human adjudication versus AI diagnosis. This approach could validate AI performance in a variety of contexts to improve outcomes, adapt to other potential uses, and develop trust in the system. In 2018, engineers at Google demonstrated that image adjudication by retinal specialists improved algorithmic outcomes for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.21CN Pharm Co., Ltd.New progress in AI research and development.

Consider a near-future hypothetical. In the United Kingdom, the English National Health Service Diabetic Eye Screening Program screened more than 2 million patients from 2015 through 2016 for diabetic retinopathy.22Scanlon P.H. The English National Screening Programme for diabetic retinopathy 2003–2016.Acta Diabetol. 2017; 54: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar We could imagine a case in which this service incorporates AI diagnosis, an implementation that could place most cases of diabetic retinopathy in the country under a single algorithm.Two failure modes exist for mass AI-driven diagnostics. First, standard errors in diagnostics matter at scale: a sensitivity of 99.9% for a test that applies to a condition affecting hundreds of millions of patients still entails hundreds of thousands of false-negative results.2Lee A. Machine diagnosis.Nature. 2019 Apr 10; (Online ahead of print.)https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-01112-xCrossref Google Scholar Importantly, transitioning to AI could redistribute false-positive or false-negative results in a population. This raises concerns of justice if, for example, AI misdiagnoses disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups, as has occurred with pulse oximeters23Sjoding M.W. Dickson R.P.

However, we do know that racial bias in ophthalmologic clinical trials is an ongoing concern,26Coney J.M. Racial bias in clinical trials: what you need to know. Retina Today.https://retinatoday.com/articles/2021-mar/racial-bias-in-clinical-trials-what-you-need-to-knowGoogle Scholar and this trend could continue into AI development if it remains unchecked.However, the distribution of harms using AI might be traded against the distribution of services through the deployment of AI, such that:1.Some patients have worse outcomes than others because of the distribution of risk by AI; yet2.Those patients have better outcomes than they would otherwise have had becausea.The AI model is ultimately less biased than physician treatment alone orb.The benefits of access to services outweigh the potential harms of bias orc.Both.Consider the proliferation of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for individuals who otherwise may experience delayed diagnosis or treatment.27Evans N.G.

A potential trade-off arises between errors caused by AI when a physician cannot directly access the patient and the benefits of receiving early diagnosis. In rare or emergent cases (such as a pandemic) where the risk of travel to a medical facility presents additional risk, AI may provide preliminary guidance on whether to seek care inside a clinical setting.30Evans N.G. Sekkarie M.A. Allocating scarce medical resources during armed conflict: ethical issues.Disaster Mil Med. 2017; 3 (eCollection 2017): 5https://doi.org/10.1186/s40696-017-0033-zCrossref PubMed Google Scholar Moreover, even if AI does produce worse outcomes than a physician diagnosis, AI may be justified to the extent that delayed or missed diagnosis is worse.However, the social benefit of AI to telemedicine relies in part on the extent to which inequalities of access to information technology can be remedied. Telemedicine is unevenly adopted by providers, may not be supported by insurers, and depends on reliable internet access. However, smartphone penetration may be higher than access to specialist medical care in some if not many areas, and thus favorable tradeoffs may exist through local AI-driven solutions. Like other emerging technologies.The setting in which medical AI is implemented is a major determinant of the risks and benefits.A second failure mode is a systemic failure that affects all or most users simultaneously. These very low-probability, very high-consequence events could arise, for example, in the case of a continual learning AI system intended to improve with additional data,31Lee C.S. Lee A.Y. Clinical applications of continual learning machine learning.Lancet Digit Health. 2020; 2: e279-e281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar but that, through sustained machine error, ultimately diverges radically from its original parameters and begins assigning false results. Depending on how submissions to the AI platform are structured, adversarial uses could arise in which intentionally doctored images are submitted to achieve the same effect.Protection from systemic failures is unlikely to be achieved through self-governance and will require regulatory action to guard against. Adding ongoing cyber security and fault tree testing to the approval requirements is 1 solution, but 2 challenges arise. First, premarket regulation typically does entail continuous monitoring of the system; study of results by human analysts and quality control tests against the algorithm to prevent system failures may become dysfunctional on a large scale. Second, the Food and Drug Administration regulates only medical devices, of which IDx is one, but some AI models (such as the Apple Watch pulse oximeter [Apple, Inc]) may constitute a general wellness product designed to be sold directly to consumers.32Minssen T. Gerke S. Aboy M. et al.Regulatory responses to medical machine learning.J Law Biosci. 2020; 7 (eCollection Jan-Dec 2020): lsaa002https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa002Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar Addressing both challenges may reduce the possibility of low-probability and high-consequence events, but represent trade-offs in system efficiency and resource use around AI in medicine.In response, the Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies in other countries may require reform to accommodate the challenges presented by AI. Alternatively, the mismatch between the current regulatory structure and the potential impacts of AI in medicine may mean that the Food and Drug Administration is ultimately not well-suited for regulating AI. In the latter case, a new agency may be required, or governance could occur through a different mechanism entirely, for example, through government payment choices in national health insurance schemes.In conclusion, artificial intelligence presents a range of novel opportunities to improve medical care and to make health care more widely accessible to patients. However, the use of AI raises many ethical concerns, even in cases where it augments the capabilities of human physicians and technicians. These issues are in part endogenous to AI, and are in part a function of the regulatory, social, and political circumstances in which it is developed and implemented. Realizing the full benefits of AI will require reaching a consensus on which trade-offs are acceptable as this technology is implemented at scale. Rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI) promise improved diagnosis and care for patients, but raise ethical issues.1Ting D.S.W. Pasquale L.R.

Population data from the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau and the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS) were analyzed to illustrate provider-to-population relationships by state.Survey studies demonstrated a deteriorating economic situation marked by progression in reimbursement cuts, reductions in pediatric ophthalmologists accepting Medicaid patients, and dwindling numbers of residents pursuing pediatric ophthalmology fellowships. Provider-to-population relationships revealed that pediatric ophthalmologists are not evenly distributed to meet population demand, and that many states are suffering from a shortage of pediatric ophthalmologists. Furthermore, many states with high percentages of Medicaid coverage simultaneously have lower AAPOS members/million person ratios.The simple economic principles of supply and demand reveal a crisis in access to pediatric eye and adult strabismus care. The economic downtown and change in practice patterns may produce rippling effects outside pediatric ophthalmology in fields such as pediatrics and comprehensive ophthalmology. An interdisciplinary effort among health care providers and governmental officials is needed to revive the field of pediatric ophthalmology and improve access to eye care.

Methods: New Zealand‐based researchers involved in ophthalmology or vision science research, including ophthalmologists, optometrists and vision scientists were identified via professional colleges, universities and electronic databases. Peer‐reviewed publications by these authors were identified by both searching electronic databases (MEDLINE/Pubmed) and personal communication with individual researchers. Results: Eighty‐five New Zealand‐based researchers involved in ophthalmology or vision science research published 446 articles in 84 scientific journals during the 10‐year period. The cohort consisted of 59 ophthalmologists and 26 other researchers based in a diverse range of ophthalmology, optometry and university departments. Significant collaboration was observed between groups within New Zealand and with international institutions. Comparing ophthalmologists and ‘other’ researchers, ophthalmologists produced 69% of all ophthalmology and vision science research publications and those classified as ‘active ophthalmologist researchers’ published an average of 11 (range 5–55) papers each during this decade, compared to eight (range 5–25) for the group ‘other active researchers’. This was also reflected in the high productivity rate by ophthalmologists of 277 publications per 1000. Publications were identified in a wide range of journals with the majority in top 20‐ranked ophthalmology journals. The trend over the decade highlighted an increase in number of scientific publications, from 43 per annum in 1993, to 68 per annum in 2002. Conclusions: Despite a relatively small and geographically isolated population, New Zealand ophthalmology and vision science research is highly active and collaborative, with significantly increased research productivity during the period 1993–2002. The present study is the first to document these trends and provides strong evidence to justify continued support for ophthalmology and vision science research in New Zealand.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9071.2004.00934.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2052483208", "source": "openalex"}

From 1982 to 1993, serum specimens of 383 cases and intraocular fluid samples of 22 cases were serologically screened for Toxocara infection with five immunodiagnostic tests. Fifty-five sera and 11 intravitreous fluid samples were estimated to have significantly high antibody levels against larval excretory-secretory (ES) antigens of T. canis. Eight cases were positive in both serum and vitreous fluid, and three were positive only in the vitreous fluid. Among the 58 antibody positive samples, 20 cases were omitted due to a lack of detailed description of ocular findings. The remaining 38 cases are described in this study. Of these 38 cases, 34 (89%) were older than 20 years of age. Ocular lesions were located in the posterior fundus in 11 cases, in the peripheral fundus in 18 cases, and in both areas in seven cases. Of the eight cases in which papillary oedema or redness was observed, chorioretinal lesions were also present in seven of them. Tractional retinal detachment was present in five cases. These observations suggest that ocular toxocariasis in Japan has a different clinical profile compared with those in the other countries, and indicate a need for revised classification of ocular toxocariasis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022149x99000608", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2210367305", "source": "openalex"}

With the relative lack of ophthalmology teaching at medical school and the often inconsistent formal teaching of fundamental examination and clinical techniques during initial posts, ophthalmology trainees often feel they are being ‘thrown in at the deep end’ early on in their career. In addition, trainees are now expected to clearly demonstrate evidence of having acquired the expected knowledge, clinical, technical, and surgical skills at each stage of their training in order to progress. This book aims to help address these issues by mapping the stages of the Ophthalmic Specialist Training curriculum and providing trainees with the core knowledge and clinical skills they will require to succeed. As a theoretical and practical aid, it guides readers through postgraduate Ophthalmic Specialist Training. Emphasis is placed on the practical assessment and management of key ophthalmic conditions.

India is home to a quarter of the blind population of the world, but unfortunately, the number of trained ophthalmologists is lagging behind the current need.[12] Our country needs 25,000–30,000 ophthalmologists till 2020, which means adding 300 training slots per year.[1] This needs a major revamp of our residency system as the existing system is found to be inadequate in its current form.[3] Most of the residency programs are not focusing much on the surgical training of the residents. The International Council of Ophthalmology designed its Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubrics (ICO-OSCAR) to facilitate assessment and teaching of surgical skill.[4] However, these are used during surgical training and cannot be used before that, during wet lab. We believe that wet lab training should be made mandatory for all residents before surgical training on actual eyes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no assessment tool currently being used for wet lab training. We propose the ICO-OSCAR tools be used for wet lab training and be made part of the teaching curriculum. The ICO-OSCAR is used to evaluate surgeries,[45] but we have modified if to be used in wet lab for Phacoemulsification training. The modified OSCAR can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sdV-PMylzyMm5fZXRIQVRGbzQ/view. We ran a pilot study in one of the Educational Institutes in Trujillo, Peru, last year using this modified OSCAR tool. This study was done on an Orbis International Flying Eye Hospital program, where 12 3rd-year residents were trained in phacoemulsification, in the wet lab, by a certified trainer from the United States. The 3rd-year residents were already doing phacoemulsification and had done a minimum of 20 phacoemulsification surgeries before this wet lab training. The trainer was a long-term volunteer faculty with Orbis International and had done several instruction courses on Orbis programs and is the residency director of the ophthalmology-training program at her institute. The training exercise was held over 5 days. 1st day, the residents were trained in wound construction, 2nd day on capsulorrhexis and hydroprocedures, 3rd and 4th day on phacoemulsification technique, and 5th day on intraocular lens insertion and wound closure. The training also had 11 didactic lectures. Participating ophthalmologists were asked to complete an evaluation sheet (modified OSCAR) before starting the wet lab. The evaluation sheet had 22 questions to assess areas covered during training under various categories. Trainees completed the same evaluation sheet after the wet lab as well. A similar evaluation sheet was completed by the trainer for each trainee, and discussion was held at the end of the day between the trainer and the trainee evaluating the day's session. We found that the trainer's scores did not match that of the trainee's self-assessment scores for most of the task. The trainer's and trainee's scores matched more closely in the following skills – instrument handling (P = 0.9), wound construction (P = 0.655), and phacodynamics (P = 0.334). There was discrepancy between both scores in capsulorrhexis (P = 0.003), hydrodissection (P = 0.003), and irrigation/aspiration (P = 0.003). From this exercise, we learned that modified OSCAR offers a reliable way to objectively assess the surgical skills acquired during wet lab training. We saw that trainees tend to overestimate their skills. The tool is useful to develop self-awareness among trainees and to identify gaps, lead active continuous professional development plan, and eventually improve their surgical skills. Such modified OSCAR tools can be developed for other surgical wet labs also, and we should find a way to integrate this in our residency curriculum. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

On postnatal (p) day ages p0, p8, p11-p14, and p18, retinas from the model or room-air (RA) age-matched pups were analyzed for mRNA of VEGF splice variants and receptors using real-time polymerase chain reaction or VEGF protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.On p14, when retinas were only 70% vascularized in the model but fully vascularized in RA, VEGF₁₆₄ expression was threefold greater in the model compared to RA. On p18, intravitreous neovascularization was associated with a 5-fold increase in VEGF₁₆₄ mRNA in the model compared to RA. By analysis of variance, VEGF₁₆₄ and VEGFR2 mRNAs were up-regulated in association with increasing developmental age (P<.0001 for both comparisons) or exposure to the model compared to RA (P<.0001 and P=.0247, respectively), whereas increasing developmental age was associated only with up-regulated VEGF₁₂₀ (P=.0006), VEGF₁₈₈ (P=.0256), and VEGFR1 (P<.0001) mRNAs.

It has become the major criterion for laser treatment in ROP, but its assessment is subjective and prone to error. ROPtool is a computer program that traces retinal blood vessels, measures their tortuosity, and determines whether there is sufficient tortuosity for plus disease. The purpose of this study was to prospectively determine if assessment of tortuosity by ROPtool is more accurate than by individual pediatric ophthalmologists.One hundred eighty-five high-quality RetCam images from premature infants were circulated to 3 ROP experts to develop reference data and to 3 other pediatric ophthalmologists (\"examiners\") who graded the tortuosity in each quadrant as normal, pre-plus, or plus. These same images were analyzed using ROPtool. Overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ROPtool relative to expert consensus were compared to that of the individual examiners.By expert consensus, 37 of the 185 eyes (20%) had tortuosity sufficient for plus disease. The overall accuracy of ROPtool of 95% (175/185) for identifying tortuosity sufficient for plus disease was similar to that of examiner 1 (93%, 172/185, P = .5), examiner 2 (93%, 172/185, P = .5), and examiner 3 (91%, 168/185, P = .1).

RESULTS: The aims of our infection control measures are to 1) minimize cross-infection within the hospital; 2) protect and support hospital staff; 3) ensure environmental control. To minimize the risk of cross-infection, outpatient attendance and elective surgery have been reduced by 40%, and general anesthesia procedures were reduced by 90%. Patients entering the hospital are screened for fever, travel history, contact and cluster history, and COVID-19 related symptoms. To protect and support hospital staff, we ensure provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and provide clear guidelines on the level of PPE needed, depending on the clinical situation. Other protective measures include provision of work uniforms, easy access to alcohol-based hand rub, opening new lunch areas, implementation of self-monitoring and self-reporting systems, and communication via online education and updates.

Methods The medical records of patients who presented with any ophthalmologic symptoms during a 6-month period were prospectively evaluated. In all, 2,710 patients (1,492 female and 1,218 male) aged 6 months-91 years were included in the study. Each patient underwent complete ophthalmologic evaluation. Results Among the 2,710 patients, 30 (1.1%) (7 female and 23 male) with a mean age of 14.62 ± 17.45 years (range 6 months-60 years) had AHP. In total, 24 (80%) of the patients with AHP were aged ≤16 years. The initial complaint in the patients with AHP was ocular misalignment in 18 (60%) patients, AHP in 4 (13.3%), abnormal ocular movements in 4 (13.3%), double vision in 3 (10%), and droopy eyelid in 1 (3.3%). Comitant strabismus, nystagmus, and Duane syndrome were the most common causes of AHP. Other diagnoses included fourth nerve palsy, sixth nerve palsy, Brown syndrome, congenital muscular torticollis, ptosis, and blowout orbital fracture. Conclusions The leading underlying causes of AHP in patients who presented to an ophthalmology clinic were ocular and treatable.

Progress has been made in the symptomatic management of visual manifestations of multiple sclerosis and visual outcome measures are now being included in clinical trials, with important quality of life ramifications. Perhaps the most prominent contribution from neuro-ophthalmology research in multiple sclerosis has been the establishment of the visual system as a model to study disease pathogenesis, and for the systematic, objective, and longitudinal detection and monitoring of protective and restorative neurotherapeutic strategies. The emergence of these sophisticated capabilities has been in large part due to the application of high speed, high definition, and objective methods for the elucidation of both the structure and function of visual system networks.Advances in neuro-ophthalmology research in multiple sclerosis have led to the establishment of the visual system as a model to objectively study disease pathogenesis, and for the identification of novel neurotherapeutic capabilities.

In group A, residents learned PM through an AI-based PM identification system. In group B and group C, residents learned PM through a traditional lecture given by two senior specialists independently. The improvement in resident performance was evaluated by comparing the pre-and post-lecture scores of a specifically designed test using a paired t -test. The difference among the three groups was evaluated by one-way ANOVA. Residents’ evaluations of the AI-based PM identification system were measured by a 17-item questionnaire.

MS is attractive for the simplicity it offers toward total profiling of lipids, the identification and characterization of individual entities directly after extraction from complex biological mixtures utilizing an infusion mode. Fundamentally, two types of mass analyzers exist, depending upon whether the fragment ion resolution and analysis occurs in space domain or in time domain within the mass spectrometer. Compared to MS, chromatographic methods are cumbersome. Nuclear magnetic resonance, which provides unequivocal elucidation of structures, necessitates much higher absolute amount and demands purity of lipids.

In past decades, due to less number of technologies and equipment’s it was challenging to diagnose it. As time passes, technologies i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI) grow and became popular in the medical field especially in ophthalmology at proliferating rate. But, still, many of the diseases are diagnose manually. (i.e., eye disease disorder) which is time consuming, expensive, and tedious task. Existing prediction systems can resolve medical issues such as ocular disorder but the accuracy of prediction is very less.OBJECTIVES: This study gives a brief overview of the analysis of traditional systems with modern approaches. Further, this study highlights the different allied techniques and impact of transfer learning on ophthalmology for the detection of various eye diseases i.e., Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Glaucoma, etc.METHODS: AI and Machine Learning Technique are used to conduct this research for analysis.RESULTS: The result of this paper concludes AI with allied techniques may reshape and revolutionize the medical community especially in the area of ophthalmology.CONCLUSION: This paper presented a comprehensive review of AI with allied techniques in ophthalmology.

The grafted silicone hydrogels possessed excellent hydrophilic surfaces due to the enrichment of amino acids, which was confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle, and equilibrium water content measurements. Remarkable resistance to bovine serum albumin and lysozyme fouling was observed for the silicone hydrogels immobilized with neutrally charged amino acids because of the formation of zwitterionic surfaces with pairs of protonated secondary ammonium cations and deprotonated carboxyl anions. Meanwhile, the silicone hydrogels grafted with positively or negatively charged amino acids were able to repulse same charged protein with reduced deposition and attract oppositely charged protein with increased adsorption. Preliminary cytotoxicity test indicated that the zwitterionic silicone hydrogels were non-cytotoxic. Similarly, three types of natural amino acids, including serine, aspartic acid and histidine, modified silicone hydrogel contact lenses exhibited excellent hydrophilicity and non-damage to the rabbit's eyes, but only serine modified zwitterionic contact lens showed superior protein fouling resistance compared with the current commercial hydrogel contact lens, which may have great potential application in ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09205063.2016.1201916", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2437622022", "source": "openalex"}

Endovascular therapy for DSS is emerging as a potential alternative to treat IIH. Here, we present the results of our case series. METHOD We prospectively collected angiographic and manometric data on patients that underwent angioplasty/stenting for IIH. All patients had failed maximal medical therapy (MMT) and had confirmed sinus stenosis. Demographic, clinical and radiological presentation, and outcomes were collected retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 18 patients underwent 25 procedures. Demographics revealed a mean age of 30 (range 15‐59), 83% (15/18) were female, 72% (13/18) were white, and mean body mass index of 36 (range 23‐59.2). All patients presented with classic IIH. Symptom improvement or resolution was reported in 94% (17/18) of patients. All patients had resolution and/or stabilization/improvement of their papilledema. Headaches related to increased pressure improved in 56% (10/18). Re‐stenosis and retreatment occurred in 33% (6/18). No procedural related complications were reported. CONCLUSION Dural sinus angioplasty and stenting is relatively safe, feasible, and clinically efficacious for patients with symptomatic sinus stenosis who have failed standard therapy. The long‐term durability of patency and clinical improvement remains unknown.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12072", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1571389846", "source": "openalex"}

In some cases the skull films had been misleading by not showing significant pathology and had consequently created considerable delay before diagnosis was reached. It is therefore unjustifiable to use skull films as a method of screening for orbital or intracranial disease and there is little indication for skull radiography in ophthalmology, except in detection of intraocular foreign bodies, facial and orbital fractures and simple sinusitis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02841859409174330", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150897579", "source": "openalex"}

As a directly applied biomaterial, the hAM should be available in a ready to use manner in clinical settings. However, an extended period of time is obligatory for performing quality and safety tests. Hence, the low temperature storage of the hAM is a virtually inevitable step in the chain from donor retrieval to patient application. At the same time, the impact of subzero temperatures carries an increased risk of irreversible alterations of the structure and composition of biological objects. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the hAM as a medicinal product; this is intended for a novel strategy of application in ophthalmology requiring a GMP production protocol including double freezing–thawing cycles. We compared clinically relevant parameters, such as levels of growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins content, morphology, ultrastructure and mechanical properties, before and after one and two freezing cycles. It was found that epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hyaluronic acid, and laminin could be detected in all studied conditions without significant differences. Additionally, histological and ultrastructure analysis, as well as transparency and mechanical tests, demonstrated that properties of the hAM required to support therapeutic efficacy in ophthalmology are not impaired by dual freezing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21114029", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3034102119", "source": "openalex"}

A wide variety of headache disorders may manifest with a myriad of neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms, including orbital pain, disturbances of vision, aura, photophobia, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, ptosis, and other manifestations. The differential diagnosis in these patients is broad and includes both secondary, or symptomatic, and primary headache disorders. Awareness of the headache patterns and associated symptoms of these various disorders is essential to achieve the correct diagnosis.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2690236772", "title": "Ophthalmology residency training in India: <i>Quo vadis</i>?", "text": "Residency training is an essential phase of metamorphosis in the life cycle of a medical student that marks the transformation of a theoretical generalist into a practically oriented specialist gearing up to assume personal responsibility for patient care. Over the years, the process of surgical training has evolved from an unstructured apprenticeship of unlimited duration in the distant past, and a more organized Halstedian pyramidal model in the 20th century, to the current standardized rectangular model with defined timelines.[12] However, the essential Halstedian concept \"See one, do one, teach one\" continues to be ingrained in our residency training. The process of residency training is physically, emotionally, and intellectually demanding. The essential requirements of an ideal residency program are a learning and working environment that fosters excellence in safety and quality of care and professionalism; faculty trained to teach, train, evaluate, and mentor; optimal exposure to patients, clinical investigations and procedures; and the necessary facilities and equipment to provide standardized care. Even in situations where the facilities, faculty, training standards, evaluation, and exit criteria are all harmonized, and residency selection is based on meritocracy, the overall quality of the final output is known to vary substantially. The situation becomes much more complex when the entry points into the program are disparate, training standards and exit criteria vary, and the faculty and facilities range from exceptional to very basic, as in India. About 60% of ophthalmic residency training in India is in the domain of government-run organizations, and the rest in private facilities. Training is imparted in varied settings – national institutes, regional institutes, medical universities, medical colleges, private institutes, and private hospitals, in rural and urban locations. Goals, culture, commitment, willingness to change, and the agility to implement change vary widely, and that often reflects in the quality of the output. Can we change this? Can we ensure that we produce safe and conscientious specialists uniformly with an ideal set of skills, knowledge, and attitude with optimal proficiency in all the domains of patient care? Can we do this despite all the ills that the system suffers? Change for the better is driven more by the motivation and interest of the training imparters to excel and less by the threat of regulatory authorities. We also realize that quality teaching and learning can be accomplished even in the absence of state-of-the-art equipment by incorporating some of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) concepts of supervised training and graded and progressive responsibility.[3] In every residency program, it is possible to provide an environment of teaching and learning by facilitating the residents to have \"direct patient interaction under the guidance and supervision of faculty who give value, context, and meaning to those interactions\" as envisaged by the ACGME.[3]\"As residents gain experience and demonstrate growth in their ability to care for patients, they may assume roles that permit them to exercise those skills with greater independence\"[3] and start imparting training to their juniors, thus relieving some pressure off the faculty. The ACGME states that \"supervision has the goals of assuring the provision of safe and effective care to the individual patient; assuring each resident's development of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to enter the unsupervised practice of medicine; and establishing a foundation for continued professional growth.\"[3] While the numbers are important in surgical training, the foundation can be laid at wet laboratory training and by supervised step-by-step surgical exposure. Incorporation of these elements may reduce the dependency on \"numbers\" to gain confidence in surgical skills. Incorporation of the International Council of Ophthalmology OSCAR modules could make the surgical skills' evaluation process more objective.[4] Residents have a major role to play in having their training transformed into a holistic experience by incorporating the six ACGME elements - medical knowledge, patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice.[5] Their current conditioned and hypertrophic cataract-centric focus should give way to an open-minded intensive learning of comprehensive ophthalmology, and cherry-picking of \"commercially viable\" skills should change to a more broad-based approach. With the availability of vast and well-curated online resources, there is no excuse not to self-learn and fill in for any deficiencies in the training. They should aim to become good comprehensive ophthalmologists with essential surgical skills to be able to take care of about 80%–90% of patients that they may see as primary care ophthalmologists. An excellent foundation of comprehensive ophthalmology is essential to further build subspecialty skills. Individual department heads and the residency training coordinators need to muster the will to change and lead the change. The increasing commercialization has resulted in a constraint in the time available for the teachers to teach. However, if their primary responsibility is to teach, time has to be found to accomplish it. Subtle reorganization within the department, time management, motivating the young faculty with an aptitude and interest to teach, and making them coordinate the teaching program, one-to-one mentoring of residents, having a fixed-time daily teaching schedule, all help in any given situation. The All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) has invested time and energy into developing a common national curriculum for residency training. Instead of waiting for the wheels of the regulatory authorities to move to implement this curriculum, each program could voluntarily incorporate the essential aspects into their existing training modules. We will elaborate more on the AIOS curriculum in one of the future issues of IJO. The seriousness of focus of AIOS and IJO on improving and standardizing residency training can be gauged by several publications in the past, and two important publications in the current issue.[67891011121314] Residency training programs in India have an immense and untapped potential. Patients are plenty, pathology is varied, teachers are vastly experienced, students are the cream of their fraternity, and AIOS is keen to partner – so all that we need now is the will to change and do our very best through what is possible under the circumstances, while continuing to energetically push for better facilities with all the gusto.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_502_17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2690236772", "source": "openalex"}

Bibliometrics is a statistical method to analyze scientific literature. Among benchmarking methods, the h-index has been the most widely accepted. The h-index samples a researcher's publication quantity while controlling for quality through citation count. The m-quotient adjusts the h-index according to the number of years since the first peer-reviewed publication, allowing for productivity assessments independent of career length. This study utilizes bibliometrics to create profiles for academic ophthalmology in the United States. <b>Methods</b> Bibliometric profiles were created for 2,824 ophthalmologists from 110 nonmilitary departments. Profiles included the h-index and m-quotient calculated from an online citation database. Comparisons between academic rank, gender, region, and subspecialty were performed. Departments were ranked by the summation as well as the mean of h-indices for each faculty member. <b>Results</b> The mean h-index and m-quotient were 10.56 ± 11.96 and 0.52 ± 0.44, respectively. Both of these values exhibited a positive relationship with increasing academic rank (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Faculty with subspecialties in ocular oncology, pathology, vitreoretinal disease, neuro-ophthalmology, and uveitis had higher mean h-indices than those in cornea and external disease, glaucoma, pediatrics, oculoplastics, anterior segment, and comprehensive ophthalmology. Males (<i>n</i> = 1,989) demonstrated a significantly higher mean h-index than females (<i>n</i> = 835), 12.12 ± 12.66 versus 6.84 ± 9.07. This difference was still significant after correcting for academic rank (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in m-quotients between genders (<i>p</i> = 0.955). Ranked by summed h-indices, the top five programs for publication productivity in the United States in descending order were Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, University of Miami, Thomas Jefferson University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Wisconsin. <b>Conclusion</b> This report benchmarks the publication productivity of academic ophthalmologists and academic ophthalmology departments in the United States. These results may serve program development in academic ophthalmology departments and prospective trainees and faculty.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1581111", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2333354482", "source": "openalex"}

The association between author conflicts of interest and the publication of randomized controlled trials is unclear. The objective of this study was to use randomized controlled trials in ophthalmology to evaluate (1) the agreement in the reported main outcome results by comparing abstracts and corresponding publications and (2) the association between the author conflicts of interest and publication of the results presented in the abstracts. We considered abstracts describing results of randomized controlled trials presented at the 2001–2004 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology conferences as eligible for our study. Through electronic searching and by emailing abstract authors, we identified the earliest publication (journal article) containing results of each abstract's main outcome through November 2013. We categorized the discordance between the main outcome results in the abstract and its paired publication as qualitative (a difference in the direction of the estimated effect) or as quantitative. We used the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology categories for conflicts of interest: financial interest, employee of business with interest, consultant to business with interest, inventor/developer with patent, and receiving ≥ 1 gift from industry in the past year. We calculated the relative risks (RRs) of publication associated with the categories of conflicts of interest for abstracts with results that were statistically significant, not statistically significant, or not reported. We included 513 abstracts, 230 (44.8 %) of which reached publication. Among the 86 pairs with the same main outcome domain at the same time point, 47 pairs (54.7 %) had discordant results: qualitative discordance in 7 pairs and quantitative discordance in 40 pairs. Quantitative discordance was indicated as < 10, 10–20, > 20 %, and unclear in 14, 5, 14, and 7 pairs, respectively. First authors reporting of one or more conflicts of interest was associated with a greater likelihood of publication (RR = 1.31; 95 % CI = 1.04 to 1.64) and a shorter time-to-publication (log-rank p = 0.026). First author conflicts of interests that were associated with publication were financial support (RR = 1.50; 95 % CI = 1.19 to 1.90) and one or more gifts (RR = 1.42; 95 % CI = 1.05 to 1.92). The association between conflicts of interest and publication remained, irrespective of the statistical significance of the results. More than half the abstract/publication pairs exhibited some amount of discordance in the main outcome results, calling into question the dependability of conference abstracts.

METHODS We conducted focus groups and interviews with parents (N = 47) of VLBW infants and interviews with neonatal intensive care unit and ophthalmologic providers (N = 28) at 6 sites in Massachusetts and South Carolina. Themes are reported according to consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research guidelines. RESULTS Respondents perceived that legal liability and low reimbursement contributed to shortages of ROP providers. Some neonatal intensive care units offered subsidies to attract ophthalmologic providers or delayed transfers to institutions that could not provide ROP examinations and/or treatment. Sites used variable practices for coordinating ROP care. Even at sites with a tracking database and a dedicated ROP coordinator, significant time was required to ensure that examinations and treatment occurred as scheduled. Parents' ability to manage their children's health care was limited by parental understanding of ROP, feeling overwhelmed by the infant's care, and unmet needs for resources to address social stressors. CONCLUSIONS Under accountable care organizations, hospitals and ophthalmology practices should share responsibility for ensuring coordinated ROP care to mitigate liability concerns. To promote integrated care, reimbursement for ROP care should be bundled to include screening, diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate follow-up. Clinical information systems should be enhanced to increase efficiency and limit lapses in care. Self-management tools and connections to community resources could help promote families' attendance of follow-up appointments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archophthalmol.2012.1890", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2106063535", "source": "openalex"}

Opportunities to improve the quality of care provided to premature infants with ROP will result.A retrospective review of a series of 13 ROP malpractice cases in which the author served as a paid consultant, as well as a review of the literature for additional cases, was conducted. The series of 13 involved a review of the entire medical record as well as testimony and depositions. The characteristics of each case are tabulated, including state, date, allegations, defendants, disposition, award, the medical facts and care issues involved, and the judgment of medical error. In addition, a merit review was performed on the care in each case, and an error assessment was performed.The quality of care issues included neonatology failure to refer or follow up in 8 of 13, failure to adequately supervise resident care in 2 of 13, ophthalmologic failure to follow up in 6 of 13, and failure to properly diagnose and manage in 9 of 13. The latter included 4 of 13 that hinged on zone III issues and the presence or absence of full nasal vascularization with or without previous zone II disease. Merit review found negligent error by at least one party in 12 of 13. Ophthalmology error was found in 6 of 13. Malpractice, ie, negligent error causing negligent harm, was judged to be present in 9 of 13.Negligent errors are common in malpractice cases that proceed to disposition. There are a limited number of repetitive errors that produce malpractice.

For controls pattern sensitivity was lower than flicker sensitivity in central vision. The converse held in peripheral vision. The balance between pattern sensitivity and flicker sensitivity was markedly abnormal in part or all of the visual field for many patients. There were examples in all patient groups. In some patients flicker sensitivity was depressed relative to pattern. In others the converse was true. Of 10 patients with ocular hypertension and no perimetric field loss 8 had a significantly abnormal ratio between pattern sensitivity and flicker sensitivity at some point in the visual field. The balance between pattern and flicker sensitivity was more sensitive to visual pathology than absolute sensitivity to either pattern or flicker.

Lee is an ophthalmologist and director of clinical neuro-ophthalmology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, Iowa. Paul W. Brazis is a neurologist and head of the neuro-ophthalmology service at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Both authors have extensive training and experience in the field of neuro-ophthalmology. In this book, they provide the reader with an evidence-based approach to basic neuro-ophthalmological disorders, such as various optic neuropathies, papilloedema, eye movement disorders, lid lag, pupillary abnormalities and many others. The authors have synthesized 30 years of clinical evidence into a series of useful algorithms covering all the major neuro-ophthalmological disorders. In his foreword to the book, Dr. Neil Miller writes, ‘Never in the history of medicine have physicians had so many ways to both diagnose and treat disease, and never have physicians had so many bureaucratic barriers to performing these activities. This paradox has necessitated a return to the days when clinical judgement was at least as important as diagnostic testing.’ Clinical Pathways in Neuro-Ophthalmology teaches the reader how to approach a patient with a known or presumed neuro-ophthalmological problem in a logical, straightforward and cost-effective manner. The book has 20 chapters. Section headings commonly take the form of a question. There are several, easy-to-follow algorithms offering step-by-step approaches aimed at helping in differential diagnosis and clarifying diagnostic and management choices. Evidence-based data are packed into 125 tables. There is also an extensive list of current references at the end of each chapter for further information. The text is dense and includes no illustrations. Moreover, a significant amount of background knowledge is assumed. Thus, Clinical Pathways in Neuro-Ophthalmology is not a basic neuro-ophthalmology book for a resident.

Over half of cases are linked with autosomal dominant mutations in either FOXC1 or PITX2, which reflects the molecular role of these genes in regulating neural crest cell contributions to the eye, face, and heart. Within the eye, ARS is classically defined as the combination of posterior embryotoxon with iris bridging strands (Axenfeld anomaly) and iris hypoplasia causing corectopia and pseudopolycoria (Rieger anomaly). Glaucoma due to iridogoniodysgenesis is the main source of morbidity and is typically diagnosed during infancy or childhood in over half of affected individuals. Angle bypass surgery, such as glaucoma drainage devices and trabeculectomies, is often needed to obtain intraocular pressure control. A multi-disciplinary approach including glaucoma specialists and pediatric ophthalmologists produces optimal outcomes as vision is dependent on many factors including glaucoma, refractive error, amblyopia and strabismus. Further, since ophthalmologists often make the diagnosis, it is important to refer patients with ARS to other specialists including dentistry, cardiology, and neurology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s379853", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4323863225", "source": "openalex"}

Pages: 1600. Price: $229.00. ISBN 0-323-01634-0. Ophthalmology, 2nd edition, edited by Myron Yanoff and Jay S. Duker, accomplishes the seemingly overwhelming task of presenting almost every aspect of ophthalmology in a single volume. The material is presented in a well-organized fashion, allowing the reader to access quick references on everything ranging from optical coherence tomography to diagnosis and management of uveitis. With almost 1700 pages of text, the book is divided into 12 color-coded sections for easy navigation. Each section covers a broad category and is subsequently subdivided into more specific sections detailing basic ocular science, disease, and ocular surgery. Part one discusses genetics and ocular embryology, whereas part three is an entire portion devoted to refractive surgery. Anterior segment and strabismus are covered extensively, including summary tables for differential diagnoses. The largest section of the book, almost 300 pages, is devoted to retinal anomalies and is divided into nine sections, including but not limited to a discussion of dystrophies, vascular disorders, and macular disorders. Within most of these sections, specific disorders are characterized by epidemiology and pathogenesis, systemic associations, ocular manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, course, and prognosis. In addition, the text is supplemented by color photographs and fluorescein angiograms that are very beneficial. Also, though not particularly helpful, histological photographs are presented for many of the disorders. Finally, part 12 contains 200-plus pages devoted strictly to glaucoma; the discussion includes epidemiology, evaluation and diagnosis, types, and treatment options for glaucoma. In addition to the description of ocular conditions, much of the text and diagrams is devoted to explaining particular ocular surgical approaches and techniques. For recent optometry graduates, the necessity for detailed surgical techniques is not relevant to the scope of optometric practice, and hence, a meticulous surgical discussion is probably not exceptionally valuable. However, a basic understanding of such surgical approaches is essential and can be accomplished quite easily with this text. Although pharmacology is touched upon throughout the book, there is no single section devoted strictly to ocular pharmacology or the ocular effects of systemic drugs. Although one section dedicated to this topic would unquestionably be advantageous, the text is not compromised because of a lack thereof, as sufficient pharmacology is presented throughout the text. With such a large, comprehensive text, a major advantage is the contribution of more than 300 individuals to the final organization of the book. Consequently, contributors to the text wrote specifically about their respective areas of expertise. Thus, the book is truly an arrangement of shorter, specialized topics combined to form a single, manageable text. Overall, Ophthalmology is an excellent resource because it reports on almost every aspect of ophthalmology in a convenient, single volume. The color photographs, charts, tables, and illustrations enhance the text and highlight the most important aspects of specific ocular conditions.

Seventy-seven patients with acute, self limited, nontraumatic, unilateral, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis over a two-year period were identified. Results: Ninetyfour episodes of AAU occurred in 77 patients (42 men, 35 women).The median number of episodes of AAU was three episodes per month (range: 0–14 episodes/month). An increased number of episodes was found in December of both years (11 in December 1996 [p < 0.01] and 14 in December 1997 [p < 0.003]). Smaller clusters of AAU were seen in other months, but did not reach statistical significance.

The existing information can be conflicting. We looked at alpha-blockers and intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and lastly anticholinergic medications and glaucoma. There is no conclusive scientific data on what to do if the risk of urinary retention is low to moderate, however, we recommend that patients having cataract surgery should stop alpha-blocker medications preoperatively. If there is a high risk of urinary retention, the alpha-blocker should not be withheld, with the active involvement of the ophthalmologist. The role of using 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) can be considered. There is no convincing evidence that PDE5 inhibitors cause non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), but patients should be advised of the possible risk of visual loss, especially in patients with risk factors of ischemic heart disease. Acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG or closed angle glaucoma) is very rarely caused by anticholinergic medications in patients with narrow angle anterior eye chambers. However, these medications are safe in patients with open angle glaucoma or treated closed angle glaucoma. Urologists should inquire about the patient's glaucoma history from his/her ophthalmologist before starting an anticholinergic medication.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.11037", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1507742606", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Seventy‐eight MLP children [gestational age (GA) 32–36 weeks; 34 girls; mean age 5.7 years] were investigated. Gestational age, weight, length and head circumference at birth and at the time of assessment were registered. Visual acuity (VA), refraction, orthoptic evaluation, slit‐lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy were conducted, and a history of visuoperceptual problems was recorded. The data were compared with age‐ and sex‐matched controls born full term ( n = 35). Results Ophthalmological abnormalities were noted in 82% of MLP children and 47% of controls (p = 0.0004). There was a significant difference with regard to impaired motility (p = 0.03), heterophoria at distance (p = 0.006) and refraction expressed as spherical equivalent dioptre (p = 0.01). Amongst auxological data at birth, birthweight (BW) was the strongest predictor to ophthalmological abnormalities (p = 0.0003). In a stepwise logistic regression, GA was the strongest predictor of VA outcome at time of assessment (p = 0.0036). Moderate‐to‐late preterm birth showed a 2.4‐fold increased risk of refractive errors compared with full‐term children (RR 2.39: 95% CI 1.10–5.20; p = 0.02). Conclusion Based on our findings, MLP birth may be associated with increased ocular morbidity compared with their full‐term counterparts. Auxological data at birth, especially BW, seems to be an important factor when conducting an ophthalmological diagnosis in preschool MLP children, and an increased VA was correlated to a higher GA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.12763", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1941318287", "source": "openalex"}

Only one out of 10 000–18 000 newly born children in European populations presents with this disease. However, being a disease of usually recessive inheritance, the incidence may be 10 times higher in communities with high consanguinity, and in these cases the disease may manifest early and often in a more severe form. Cases presenting soon after birth are difficult to treat, especially in the presence of cloudy corneas. Most cases without cloudy corneas are diagnosed late, either by the family members or, less frequently, by an ophthalmologist or paediatrician at a routine neonatal examination. Even after the condition has been suspected, the mean interval between detection and first presentation at the ophthalmologist was still 2.2 months according to a recent study1 in Germany despite adequate access to ophthalmic care. Despite its low incidence, the management of congenital glaucoma is lifelong and largely dependent on surgical intervention. Primary congenital glaucoma occurs once every 12 000 births, giving an incidence of 0.008% as compared with 0.8% in primary open angle glaucoma in adult caucasians.2 3 Hence, only one of 100 new glaucoma patients will be a patient with primary congenital glaucoma.

While the relatively recently developed therapies, antivascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors for the treatment of age‐related macular degeneration, and prostaglandin analogues for the treatment of glaucoma are beneficial for some patients, there are many individuals with sight‐threatening diseases for whom no effective pharmacological therapy is available. For many of these diseases, the molecular mechanisms remain to be comprehensively elucidated, thus precluding the design of successful therapies against specific pathological targets. The current review summarises recent attempts to elucidate molecular mechanisms of ocular diseases, including diabetic retinal disease, age‐related macular degeneration and inherited blindness using proteomic methodologies. A novel hypothesis can be generated from global protein expression analysis of disease tissue, which can then be addressed with cellular and in vivo functional studies. For example, the identification of extracellular carbonic anhydrase from the vitreous of diabetic retinopathy patients using MS based proteomics led to the elucidation of a new pathway involved in intraretinal edema, which could be inhibited by a number of agents targeting different proteins in this pathway in relevant animal models. The potential of protein biomarkers for diagnosis and the identification of novel disease mechanisms are also discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/prca.200780094", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007534177", "source": "openalex"}

Due to their regenerative, reparatory, and immunomodulatory capacities, MSCs have been widely investigated as therapeutic agents in the cell-based treatment of chronic ophthalmic pathologies. However, the applicability of MSC-based therapy is limited by suboptimal biocompatibility, penetration, and delivery to the target ocular tissues. An emerging body of research has elucidated the role of exosomes in the biological functions of MSCs, and that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) possess anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, tissue repairing, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory properties similar to MSCs. The recent advances in MSCs-derived exosomes can serve as solutions to the challenges faced by MSCs-therapy. Due to their nano-dimensions, MSC-derived exosomes can rapidly penetrate biological barriers and reach immune-privileged organs, allowing for efficient delivery of therapeutic factors such as trophic and immunomodulatory agents to ocular tissues that are typically challenging to target by conventional therapy and MSCs transplantation. In addition, the use of EVs minimizes the risks associated with mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. In this literature review, we focus on the studies published between 2017 and 2022, highlighting the characteristics of EVs derived from MSCs and their biological functions in treating anterior and posterior segment ocular diseases. Additionally, we discuss the potential use of EVs in clinical settings. Rapid advancements in regenerative medicine and exosome-based drug delivery, in conjunction with an increased understanding of ocular pathology and pharmacology, hold great promise for the treatment of ocular diseases. The potential of exosome-based therapies is exciting and can revolutionize the way we approach these ocular conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15041167", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4362665757", "source": "openalex"}

Design: The paper is a retrospective review of the currently available literature in the English language indexed in PubMed. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by the authors using the following terms: Traumatic optic neuropathy, megadose, steroids, methylprednisolone. Relevant original articles, review articles, and case reports related to the topic of discussion were evaluated and discussed in the paper. Results: There is no prospective randomized control trial evaluating the effect of steroids in TON. There are varying reports on the effect of steroid therapy from significant improvement to no difference compared to observation. Conclusion: The decision to give steroids to patients with TON has to be on an individual case to case basis and must involve informed consent from the patient. There are documented advantages and disadvantages of steroid therapy and a prospective, randomized, controlled trial is necessary comparing steroids, surgery and observation before definitive management can be evolved.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0301-4738.146021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006206899", "source": "openalex"}

Ocular involvement is a prominent clinical feature of mitochondrial disease. This can manifest as optic nerve dysfunction specifically involving retinal ganglion cells as typified by Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), or progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and ptosis involving the extraocular muscles which is commonly associated with either primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations or acquired mtDNA defects secondary to a nuclear genetic disorder of mtDNA maintenance.

The survey contained questions on demographic information, medical education, residency training, career goals and factors influencing their career choice. The data were categorized by gender. The influence of gender on outcome was assessed in a univariate fashion using the Chi-square or Fisher exact test when appropriate. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant for all analyses.A total of 68 out of 85 residents (80%) responded to the survey. Over one-half of the residents preferred to pursue a fellowship within Saudi Arabia (53%), while others (25%) planned to train in North America. The majority of respondents wished to practice in an urban setting (63%). Anterior segment was the most desired subspecialty, while general ophthalmology and glaucoma were not a popular choice. Most residents were interested in refractive surgery (77%) and research (75%). The main factor influencing the decision to pursue ophthalmology was the ability to combine medicine and surgery (97%), while a positive elective experience was also an important factor, particularly for female respondents (91% vs. 57%; P < 0.001).Concerted efforts are required to encourage adoption to ophthalmic practice in public institutions rather than in private practice. In addition training in underrepresented subspecilaties should be encouraged to ensure adequate ophthalmic care for all citizens of Saudi Arabia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-9233.71606", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2032003343", "source": "openalex"}

The index case initially presented with asymptomatic retinopathy, cerebral microvascular disease, nephropathy and raised inflammatory markers. The clinical, neuro‐radiological, biochemical and histopathological findings in this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary endotheliopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and stroke (HERNS). Linkage analysis has identified a locus for HERNS on chromosome 3p21.1‐p21.3. This locus is shared with two other diseases: hereditary vascular retinopathy (HVR) and cerebroretinal vasculopathy (CRV). Although peripheral retinal involvement is a feature of HVR, it has not previously been described in HERNS. This case represents a novel phenotype of HERNS, and serves to blur the distinction between the vasculopathies mapping to chromosome 3p21. Although previously thought to be distinct clinical entities, it is possible that HERNS, HVR and CRV simply represent different phenotypes of the same disease. This will only be clarified with the identification of the gene or genes. This case also raises the question of how best to manage rare forms of vascular retinopathy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9071.2005.00976.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2018403227", "source": "openalex"}

Few studies in ophthalmology have examined patient preferences for physician attire. Objective To understand patient preferences for physician attire in ophthalmology practices in the United States. Design Survey-based, cohort study. Setting Two private and two academic ophthalmology practices. Participants A convenience sample of patients receiving ophthalmic care between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016. Methods A questionnaire containing 22 questions and photographs of a male and female physician in seven forms of attire were presented to patients; 14 unique questionnaires were randomly distributed. Patient preference for physician attire was the primary outcome determined by summing ratings of how knowledgeable, trustworthy, caring, approachable, and comfortable the pictured physician made the respondent feel. One-way ANOVA assessed differences in mean composite scores. Comparisons between respondent demographics, practice type, and attire preferences were assessed by chi-square tests. Patient satisfaction was assessed by agreement with questions about importance of physician attire and whether this influences happiness with care. Results In total, 1,297 of 1,826 (71.0%) questionnaires were completed. Physician attire was rated as “important” by 62.9% of participants. A total of 43.6% of participants indicated that physician attire influenced how happy they were with their care. Overall, formal attire with white coat was preferred to casual, formal, and business attire (all comparisons, p &lt; 0.05). No differences in composite scores between formal attire with white coat, scrubs alone, scrubs with white coat, or casual attire with white coat were observed. However, compared with formal attire with white coat, physicians wearing scrubs without white coat appeared less knowledgeable (mean [standard deviation]: 8.2 [1.8] vs. 7.4 [2.1]; p &lt; 0.05) and trustworthy (8.3 [1.8] vs. 7.6 [2.1]; p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, casual attire with white coat was rated as less knowledgeable compared with formal attire with white coat (7.4 [2.0] vs. 8.2 [1.8]; p &lt; 0.05). Preferences for attire varied by clinical setting: patients preferred surgeons (45.2%) and physicians in emergency rooms (41.7%) in scrubs rather than formal attire with white coat.

Since the first study on the relationship between body temperature and diseases by Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich at the end of the 19th century, various forms of thermometers have been developed to measure body temperature. Traditionally, methods for measuring temperature can be invasive, semi-invasive, and non-invasive. In recent years, great technological advances have reduced the cost of thermographic cameras, which allowed extending their use. Thermal cameras capture the infrared radiation of the electromagnetic spectrum and process the images to represent the temperature of the object under study through a range of colors, where each color and its hue indicate a previously established temperature. Currently, cameras have a sensitivity that allows them to detect changes in temperature as small as 0.01 °C. Along with its use in other areas of medicine, thermography has been used at the ocular level for more than 50 years. In healthy subjects, the literature reports that the average corneal temperature ranges from 32.9 to 36 °C. One of the possible sources of variability in normal values is age, and other possible sources of variation are gender and external temperature. In addition to the evaluation of healthy subjects, thermography has been used to evaluate its usefulness in various eye diseases, such as Graves’ orbitopathy, and tear duct obstruction for orbital diseases. The ocular surface is the most studied area. Ocular surface temperature is influenced by multiple conditions, one of the most studied being dry eye; other diseases studied include allergic conjunctivitis and pterygium as well as systemic diseases such as carotid artery stenosis. Among the corneal diseases studied are keratoconus, infectious keratitis, corneal graft rejection, the use of scleral or soft contact lenses, and the response to refractive or cataract surgery. Other diseases where thermographic features have been reported are glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vascular occlusions, intraocular tumors as well as scleritis, and other inflammatory eye diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/life13030723", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4323568994", "source": "openalex"}

The significance of comparisons between groups of doctors were calculated by the use of chi-squared tests and adjusted residuals.Ophthalmology was the first choice of long term career for 2.3% of men and 1.5% of women one year after qualification; 2.0% of men and 1.4% of women three years after; and 1.8% of men and 1.2% of women at five years. Comparing early choices with eventual destinations, 64% who chose ophthalmology in year one, 84% in year three, and 92% in year five eventually practised in the specialty. The concordance between year one choice and eventual destination was higher for ophthalmology than for most other specialties. 'Enthusiasm for and commitment to the specialty' was the most important single factor in influencing career choice. The prospect of good working hours and conditions was also an important influence: it influenced career choice a great deal for a higher percentage of those who chose ophthalmology (66% in the third year) than those who made other surgical choices (23%).Those choosing ophthalmology show a high level of commitment to it. Their commitment is strengthened by the prospect of attractive hours and working conditions. Many doctors who become ophthalmologists have already made their choice by the end of their first post-qualification year.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2415-8-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2032828788", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2077781376", "title": "Developing the Educational Milestones for Ophthalmology", "text": "A key dimension of the Next Accreditation System is the educational Milestones. Assessment of resident performance on Ophthalmology Milestones will allow programs to offer enhanced feedback to their trainees on progress in dimensions of performance relevant to the unsupervised practice in the specialty. Aggregated to the program level, the Milestones will be 1 indicator of the educational effectiveness of residency programs, moving the focus of resident education from process to outcomes.In 2000, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Outcomes Project was initiated; the ophthalmic community, like other specialty stakeholders groups, was charged with developing or identifying tools to evaluate the specialty-specific competencies. Educational leaders in ophthalmology were asked to delineate “outcomes” for the competencies and the metrics by which the residency review committee (RRC) would evaluate the effectiveness of programs in teaching and assessing residents. The American Board of Ophthalmology (ABO) task force on the competencies, comprised leaders in the ophthalmology program director community, developed several tools, including the competency-based global evaluation and the Ophthalmic Clinical Evaluation Exercise.In 2010, after the formation of Milestone working groups for several core ACGME specialties, the leaders of both the ABO and the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology (AUPO) Program Directors Council began to explore Milestone development for ophthalmology. The ABO initiated discussions with the ACGME to investigate the formation of an Ophthalmology Milestone Working Group. Members for an Ophthalmology Milestone Working Group (composed of leadership of the PDC, RRC, and ABO, and including 1 resident member) and an advisory group (composed of leadership from ABO, ACGME, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and AUPO) were selected, and vetted jointly by ABO and ACGME. Anthony C. Arnold, MD, was selected to chair the group (box).The working group engaged in 3 face-to-face meetings and extensive online review and editing, utilizing an iterative, consensus-based process for revision. The group reviewed the literature on the acquisition of competence in ophthalmology,1–5 along with documents from other specialties' experience in developing educational Milestones (eg, internal medicine, urology, surgery, and pediatrics). Throughout the process of developing and refining the Ophthalmology Milestones, updates were communicated to the program director community via the ophthalmology RRC newsletter and the ACGME's weekly e-Communication (e-mailed announcement digest).The draft Milestones were reviewed in a face-to-face session of the AUPO program directors, with small and large group discussions for each competency section, including review of time-dependent expected achievement language. Outcomes from these sessions were collated and used to refine the Milestone document, which was re-reviewed by the working group and sent to program directors for comments. This draft version was piloted by 10 ophthalmology programs, and feedback provided to the working group. The final version of the Ophthalmology Milestones was released in late 2013.The Ophthalmology Milestones are designed as a template for evaluation of resident physicians at various points of training, from entry through completion. The Milestones are organized using the 6 ACGME competencies of physician performance, with a set of subcompetencies for each competency. Performance language is provided as a guide to allow categorization across a set of Milestones, from beginning resident to graduation (OPH 1–5). Implicit in the Milestones within the set are assumptions about the level of supervision required (direct, indirect, oversight). Categorization at a specified level assumes that a resident physician meets standards of the given level, and is qualified to supervise the level below.The Ophthalmology Milestones incorporate a total of 24 subcompetencies (or Milestone sets), including 8 Milestone sets for patient care, 2 for medical knowledge, 4 for professionalism, 4 for interpersonal and communication skills, 3 for practice-based learning and improvement, and 3 for systems-based practice. An appendix to the Ophthalmology Milestones supplements the patient care subcompetencies to provide sufficient granularity for assessment of knowledge and skills without requiring reporting on each of these items.The initial Ophthalmology Milestones were formulated by a national team of educators and content experts, with face validity established by their development and review. Existing studies, as listed in the references, were used in development, and documents and processes of other specialty groups were consulted. A pilot study involving 10 programs was accomplished, and structured feedback was collated and forwarded to the working group to refine the document. Ongoing dialog with the ABO is expected to result in integration of Milestone structure into the certification process.The Milestone document incorporates a structured framework for assessing resident performance at various stages of training. Review of the Milestone data at 6-month intervals provides early assessments that facilitate identification of residents requiring added training experiences and/or remediation. In addition, the specificity of the document allows for targeted enhanced training and follow-up assessments to ensure that satisfactory performance has been achieved. The final report documents whether residents have achieved competence to enter unsupervised practice, with more clarity and scientific justification than has previously been present.With the majority of ophthalmology programs ranging from 6 to 24 residents, it is expected that the Clinical Competency Committees (CCCs) will include 3 to 6 faculty members with significant exposure to, and roles in, resident education. The CCCs will meet twice yearly to make Milestone categorization assignments for all residents in the program. Each faculty member will be assigned several residents, receive results of assessments for the previous reporting period, and make a preliminary decision regarding Milestone categorization. At the meeting, discussions about each resident will allow for final Milestone level assignment, and discussion of summary performance for all residents in the program will identify opportunities for curricular improvements.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4300/jgme-06-01s1-37", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077781376", "source": "openalex"}

It is vital that specialists in ophthalmology and neurology are informed of the potential complications of COVID-19 and gain a deeper understanding of how COVID-19 can cause diseases of the nervous system. In this review we detail four possible mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection may result in neurological or neuro-ophthalmological complications: 1) Toxic and metabolic effects of severe pulmonary COVID-19 disease on the neural axis including hypoxia and the systemic hyper-inflammatory state, 2) endothelial dysfunction, 3) dysimmune responses directed again the neuroaxis, and 4) direct neuro-invasion and injury by the virus itself. We explore the pathological evidence for each of these and how they may link to neuro-ophthalmological disorders.

Recent advances in neurosurgical techniques, endovascular treatments, and neurocritical care have improved the optimal management of symptomatic unruptured aneurysms, but whether the chosen treatment has an impact on neuro-ophthalmologic outcomes remains debated. Evidence Acquisition: A review of the literature focused on neuro-ophthalmic manifestations and treatment of intracranial aneurysms with specific relevance to neuro-ophthalmologic outcomes was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Cavernous sinus aneurysms were not included in this review. Results: Surgical clipping vs endovascular coiling for aneurysms causing third nerve palsies was compared in 13 retrospective studies representing 447 patients. Complete recovery was achieved in 78% of surgical patients compared with 44% of patients treated with endovascular coiling. However, the complication rate, hospital costs, and days spent in intensive care were reported as higher in surgically treated patients. Retrospective reviews of surgical clipping and endovascular coiling for all ocular motor nerve palsies (third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves) revealed similar results of complete resolution in 76% and 49%, respectively. Improvement in visual deficits related to aneurysmal compression of the anterior visual pathways was also better among patients treated with clipping than with coiling. The time to treatment from onset of visual symptoms was a predictive factor of visual recovery in several studies. Few reports have specifically assessed the improvement of visual deficits after treatment with flow diverters. Conclusions: Decisions regarding the choice of therapy for intracranial aneurysms causing neuro-ophthalmologic signs ideally should be made at high-volume centers with access to both surgical and endovascular treatments. The status of the patient, location of the aneurysm, and experience of the treating physicians are important factors to consider. Although a higher rate of visual recovery was reported with neurosurgical clipping, this must be weighed against the potentially longer intensive care stays and increased early morbidity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000515", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2731320111", "source": "openalex"}

Ophthalmological evaluation at diagnosis enables early detection of vision loss, decision-making about treatment, and when applicable, the timely use of visual interventions. However, awareness of visual impairment in clinical practice is suboptimal, and adherence to ophthalmological evaluation needs to be improved. Objective To assess the prevalence and types of abnormal ophthalmological findings in youths with a newly diagnosed brain tumor. Design, Setting, and Participants In this nationwide, prospective cohort study, youths aged 0 to 18 years with a newly diagnosed brain tumor between May 15, 2019, and August 11, 2021, were consecutively enrolled in 4 hospitals in the Netherlands, including the dedicated tertiary referral center for pediatric oncology care. Exposures A standardized and comprehensive ophthalmological examination, including orthoptic evaluation, visual acuity testing, visual field examination, and ophthalmoscopy, was performed within 4 weeks from brain tumor diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were prevalence and types of visual symptoms and abnormal ophthalmological findings at brain tumor diagnosis. Results Of 170 youths included in the study (96 [56.5%] male; median age, 8.3 years [range, 0.2-17.8 years]), 82 (48.2%) had infratentorial tumors; 53 (31.2%), supratentorial midline tumors; and 35 (20.6%), cerebral hemisphere tumors.

Overall, 101 youths (59.4%) presented with visual symptoms at diagnosis. Abnormal findings were found in 134 patients (78.8%) during ophthalmological examination. The most common abnormal findings were papilledema in 86 of 164 patients (52.4%) who underwent ophthalmoscopy, gaze deficits in 54 of 161 (33.5%) who underwent orthoptic evaluation, visual field defects in 32 of 114 (28.1%) with reliable visual field examination, nystagmus in 40 (24.8%) and strabismus in 32 (19.9%) of 161 who underwent orthoptic evaluation, and decreased visual acuity in 13 of 152 (8.6%) with reliable visual acuity testing. Forty-five of 69 youths (65.2%) without visual symptoms at diagnosis had ophthalmological abnormalities on examination. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this study suggest that there is a high prevalence of abnormal ophthalmological findings in youths at brain tumor diagnosis regardless of the presence of visual symptoms. These findings support the need of standardized ophthalmological examination and the awareness of ophthalmologists and referring oncologists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons for ophthalmological abnormalities in this patient group.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2022.3628", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4295908218", "source": "openalex"}

An overwhelming majority found research to have benefited their education, clinical practice and career; 67.1% of the respondents intended to do research in the future. Although a majority (56.4%) felt research to be beneficial to ophthalmology training, 42.3% felt research would be of limited or no benefit when selecting candidates for vocational training. However, 97.5% of respondents felt that ophthalmology trainees should undertake some form of research during training, with most supporting small studies or case reports (44.4%) or a short structured training course in research (42.0%). Interestingly, 86.6% felt that research methodology and data analysis should be taught in a structured fashion with most supporting courses or seminars of a few weeks duration during the vocational training period. Many ophthalmologists felt inadequately equipped or trained to mentor and supervise trainees undertaking research and 41.5% of consultant ophthalmologists felt further training to fulfil this role would be beneficial.This survey suggests that New Zealand ophthalmologists generally approve of and support a place for research, possibly of a more structured design, during ophthalmology training.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-9071.2003.00678.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145249706", "source": "openalex"}

The first 100 relevant English posts of each hashtag were studied. Selected hashtags were #Ophthalmology, #ophthalmosurgery, #ophthalmologyresident, #ophthalmologist, and #ophthalmicphotography. Posts were classified according to the type of post, post author, post intent, and whether the post was educational. Posts deemed educational were then categorized separately using the same classification system as above to determine whether there were defining characteristics of educational posts.One thousand posts were recorded and analyzed and a total of 500 posts were included in the study. The majority of posts 79.8% (n = 399), were by medical doctors with 95% (n = 379) being ophthalmology specialists. Sixty-three percent of posts (n = 315) were deemed educational, 25% promotional (n = 127), and 12% (n = 58) were entertainment posts. Medical retina (n = 119) and anterior segment (n = 90) were the most common subspecialties explored. #ophthalmicphotography (P = 0.001) was the hashtag with the highest number of educational posts (n = 91). The least educational hashtag was #ophthalmologist with only 44% of posts (n = 44) that were deemed to be educational. One hundred percent of glaucoma posts (n = 19), 98% of cornea posts (n = 41), and 99% of medical retina posts (n = 118) were found to be educational which was significantly more educational than the other topics posted (P ≤ 0.001).Ophthalmologists are the main authors of posts in popular ophthalmology hashtags.

The main advantage of this approach lies in its flexibility in handling any type of variable (categorical and quantitative, with or without missing values) while at the same time taking dependencies among those variables into account without the need of modelling them. NPC methodology enables to deal with repeated measures, paired data, restricted alternative hypotheses, missing data (completely at random or not), high-dimensional and small sample size data. Hence, NPC methodology can offer a significant contribution to successful research in biomedical studies with several endpoints, since it provides reasonably efficient solutions and clear interpretations of inferential results.

Methods: A survey was emailed to the program director at each accredited US ophthalmology training program. Results: Completed surveys were received from 37/117 (32%) programs. Most respondents identified panretinal photocoagulation (100%), laser for retinal tear (100%), laser for diabetic macular edema (94%), laser for macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion (92%), intravitreal injection (83%), and vitreous tap/intravitreal injection (78%) as procedures residency graduates should be competent to perform; 89%, 3%, 64%, 17%, 14%, and 3% reported residents perform >20 such cases, respectively, as primary surgeon, and 0%, 56%, 6%, 37%, 46%, and 63% reported residents perform one to five such cases, respectively.

Martin and James J. Corbett. Mosby, Inc., St. Louis, MO, 2000. ISBN: 0-323-00182-3. $95.00 Scope: This is an introductory text on clinical neuro-ophthalmology aiming for a place between briefer board review outlines and a comprehensive reference book. It is part of a “Requisites” series, with volumes for other ophthalmic subspecialties. The book’s size and writing style suggest that it is designed to be read in its entirety rather than being used piecemeal for specific topics. The book’s 256 pages are broadly divided into four parts: history, the sensory visual system, the visual motor system, and miscellaneous topics. The two larger middle sections each begin with a chapter on examination techniques. These skills (for example, measuring strabismus with a single Maddox rod) are presented with enough detail that a beginner would be able to accomplish the task without additional training. The remaining chapters, each about 20 pages in length, have a uniform organization: an outline, the presented material, a recapitulation of the major teaching points, and suggested readings. Each chapter covers an anatomical grouping, such as “Optic Nerve Disorders.” Typically, they start with a review of the relevant anatomy and then go through a selection of common diseases. The more important conditions have sections that discuss evaluation and management but may not include sufficient detail to be used as an exclusive source. Strengths: This book makes outstanding use of illustrations, often using several techniques to show different sides of a topic. For example, internuclear ophthalmoplegia is illustrated with 1) a sagittal diagram of the eye movement circuits in the brainstem; 2) a pseudo-three dimensional drawing of the connections between the cranial nerve nuclei, the medial longitudinal fasciculus, and the eyes in right and left gaze; 3) a set of clinical photos showing eye movements; and 4) an axial magnetic resonance image showing the lesion. The authors also make good use of tables and boxes to emphasize teaching points and to provide more extensive differential diagnoses than could be included in the text. It is clear that the illustrations were a major design consideration and not an afterthought to the written material. Weaknesses: The more neurologic topics such as headache are not as rigorously discussed using the same format of anatomy through treatment. Similarly, nystagmus is treated descriptively without the same level of specific examination techniques, evaluation and treatment options, or even illustrations. Recommended Audience: Residents and general ophthalmologists and neurologists would benefit from this book. Critical Appraisal: In addition to being an excellent introduction to the field, its size, organization, and illustrations make it useful for a brief review when one is faced with a neuro-ophthalmic patient in office practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00041327-200409000-00018", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1993083671", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: We studied SD-OCT images from 975 patients imaged from January 2011 to December 2014. The variety of cases that underwent an SD-OCT was analyzed. Cases examples from different case scenarios were selected to showcase unique examples of many diseases. Results: Three hundred and sixty-eight infants (37.7%) were imaged for retinopathy of prematurity, 362 children (37.1%) underwent the test for evaluation of suboptimal vision or an unexplained vision loss, 126 children (12.9%) for evaluation of nystagmus or night blindness, 54 children (5.5%) for an intraocular tumor or a mass lesion such as retinoblastoma, and 65 children (6.7%) for other diseases of the pediatric retina. The unique findings in the retinal morphology seen with some of these diseases are discussed. Conclusion: The handheld SD-OCT is useful in the evaluation of the pediatric retinal diseases.

Concerning reports emerged suggesting that ophthalmologists could be at higher risk of infection because of their proximity to patients during clinical encounters. In the midst of a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment, we wondered how we could both protect our residents and continue the educational missions of our departments. We gathered through teleconferencing and shared strategies for keeping residents and patients safe. To reduce the chances of infection, we developed distinct teams of residents who were caring for inpatient and emergency room consultation patients and separated them from outpatient clinics. We discussed testing, quarantine, and difficulties with knowing when a resident could return to work after coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. We discussed personal protective equipment use and shared strategies on the reuse and sterilization of limited supplies. How would we continue to teach ophthalmology now that clinical and surgical training had come to a sudden halt? Because all of our lectures had migrated to teleconferencing platforms, we decided that there existed a special opportunity for all New York–area residents to be able to attend each other's lectures. Since mid March, we have shared more than 45 lectures across institutions, and many have been attended by residents from different programs. Our trainees now have access to more ophthalmic didactics than they did before COVID-19. We developed risk-stratification guidelines to determine if patients needed to be seen in person or could be deferred. Simultaneously, we built telemedicine programs in accordance with new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education guidelines to allow residents to connect with anxious patients who did not require an in-office visit. By late March, most New York training programs had declared stage 3 pandemic emergency status, which allowed hospitals to have the flexibility to increase physician availability for patient care. Core and specialty-specific requirements of residency were suspended, provided that adequate resources, training, supervision, and work-hour requirements were met. By early April, ophthalmology programs either were redeploying residents or were developing plans to do so to meet the surging demands of the pandemic. Programs with an earlier start gave much-needed guidance to others about the major stressors to trainees—discomfort with unfamiliar roles and the psychological challenges of seeing so many extremely sick patients die alone. As program directors, we worried about putting our trainees and their families at risk by being on the front line. We shared strategies for providing emotional support while developing connections with counseling services to provide easy access for individual trainees. By mid April, every single ophthalmology program in the greater New York area had many trainees and faculty members who had been redeployed to intensive care units and COVID-19 medicine floors. We are cautiously optimistic that we now have passed this peak of the New York City epidemic. Although many of our faculty and residents are still redeployed and clinics remain limited to urgent and emergent visits, we are starting to plan for an uncertain future in which COVID-19 exists alongside some semblance of regular life. Our weekly teleconference program director meetings have transformed from a tool for coping into one for optimization. For all of us, now is an opportunity to examine closely our current program structures and discard what was done simply in the name of tradition while paving new paths for residency education in the 21st century. Going forward, resident didactics will be altered, for the better. Remote conferencing has proven so valuable in this time that we will continue lectures in this format after the COVID-19 crisis. Continuing in the spirit of collaboration, our New York-area programs are developing a citywide core education curriculum with focused subspecialty talks given by faculty from different institutions. This curriculum will serve as a foundation for all programs; individual institutions will provide supplemental didactics to their trainees. Shortages of personal protective equipment and suspensions of elective surgery have forced us to reconsider how we teach ophthalmic surgery with fewer total surgical cases. In addition to more frequent surgical video teaching conferences, a logical conclusion is that virtual simulation platforms and practice on model eyes must play an even larger role in the surgical training of our residents. Although we anticipate a return to elective surgery in the coming months, a greater reliance on simulation training before actual surgery will benefit our residents and patients in the future. Teleophthalmology will play a permanent role in ophthalmic practice, and our residents will become skilled in this care model. Developing standardized protocols and incorporating objective testing into teleophthalmology will create more opportunities for its use. Uncomplicated postoperative care likely can be transitioned to virtual visits, as can some consultations for external and lid pathologic features. New patient triages may be screened through video examinations first. Efficient diagnostic-only visits (e.g., vision, pressure, imaging) with remote consultation follow-ups may be used for other conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy or stable glaucoma. Thoughtful restructuring of care models will save patients from endless hours in waiting rooms and will concentrate more severe pathologic features for our trainees to learn from and take care of in clinic. As New York-area program directors, we are extremely proud of our residents. Although we may graduate our seniors virtually this year, we will always be bound to them by this shared experience. This pandemic has presented all of us with unprecedented challenges, but it also has provided us with a rare opportunity to innovate and collaborate side by side with our trainees.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2020.05.006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3020989265", "source": "openalex"}

Tracking data guided changes for clinic processes based on Lean management approaches, including reorganization of the reception desk, consolidation of forms, creation of task sheets to improve communication, installation of door flags on examination rooms, and training the staff in service excellence. Tracking was repeated after changes were implemented. A patient satisfaction survey was also conducted prior to and after the changes.After intervention, significant increases were measured in the average time patients spent in the clinic (99.3 minutes vs 112.8 minutes). Significant decreases were seen in the times patients spent with the optometrists (15.4 minutes vs 12.1 minutes), testing (24.7 minutes vs 23.0 minutes), and together with both the attending and the resident (8.3 minutes vs 5.8 minutes). The patient satisfaction survey indicated improvements in patients' perception of the helpfulness/friendliness of the staff, the length of time patients perceived they waited, and overall clinic experience.Both RTLS and Lean management approaches may be feasible ways to track and improve patient flow and satisfaction if certain limitations can be overcome.

Tedizolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial that may have reduced the potential for mitochondrial toxicity. Study Question: Based on the results of 2 studies (NCT01623401 and NCT00671814) conducted early in the tedizolid development program, what is the potential for drug-induced optic and peripheral neuropathies with tedizolid treatment? Methods: Two phase-1 studies were conducted in healthy volunteers. The first was an open-label study in which subjects received 200 mg of oral tedizolid phosphate once daily for 10 days. The second was a double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, dose-escalating (multiple-administration) study in which subjects received 200, 300, or 400 mg of oral tedizolid phosphate once daily or 600 mg of oral linezolid twice daily or oral placebo for 21 days. Overall safety and tolerability were assessed, and extensive ophthalmologic and neurologic assessments were performed in both studies. Results: In these 2 studies in healthy subjects, tedizolid administered for up to 21 days was not associated with drug-related ophthalmologic or neurologic adverse events. Incidences of adverse events involving the eye or the nervous system were generally low, and no clinically meaningful changes in ophthalmologic or neurologic test results were recorded during either study. Conclusions: Using an extensive battery of ophthalmologic tests and detailed neurologic clinical examination, there was no evidence of clinical or subclinical neurologic or ophthalmologic changes suggestive of peripheral or optic neuropathy in healthy volunteers who received therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of oral tedizolid for periods of up to 21 days.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mjt.0000000000000534", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2560167772", "source": "openalex"}

As such, development of imaging techniques for the visual system is crucial for unveiling the neural basis of visual function or impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers non-invasive probing of the structure and function of the neural circuits without depth limitation, and can help identify abnormalities in brain tissues in vivo. Among the advanced MRI techniques, manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) involves the use of active manganese contrast agents that positively enhance brain tissue signals in T1-weighted imaging with respect to the levels of connectivity and activity. Depending on the routes of administration, accumulation of manganese ions in the eye and the visual pathways can be attributed to systemic distribution or their local transport across axons in an anterograde fashion, entering the neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels. The use of the paramagnetic manganese contrast in MRI has a wide range of applications in the visual system from imaging normal neurodevelopment to assessing and monitoring neurodegeneration, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. In this review, we present four major domains of scientific inquiry where MEMRI can be put to imperative use — deciphering neuroarchitecture, tracing neuronal tracts, detecting neuronal activity, and identifying or differentiating glial activity. We deliberate upon each category studies that have successfully employed MEMRI to examine the visual system, including the delivery protocols, spatiotemporal characteristics, and biophysical interpretation. Based on this literature, we have identified some critical challenges in the field in terms of toxicity, and sensitivity and specificity of manganese enhancement. We also discuss the pitfalls and alternatives of MEMRI which will provide new avenues to explore in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2019.00035", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2945271351", "source": "openalex"}

Successful therapy is not yet available for the majority of patients, especially not for patients with dry AMD. AMD at cellular and molecular levels is at least in part a microcirculatory disorder of the retina. Rheopheresis is a safe and effective modality of therapeutic apheresis to treat microcirculatory disorders and represents a novel treatment option for patients with dry AMD. Elimination of a defined spectrum of high molecular weight proteins from human plasma including pathophysiologically relevant risk factors for AMD such as fibrinogen, cholesterol, von Willebrand factor, and alpha 2-macroglobulin results in the reduction of blood and plasma viscosity as well as erythrocyte and thrombocyte aggregation. Pulses of lowering blood and plasma viscosity performed as a series of Rheopheresis treatments lead to rapid changes of blood flow, subsequently inducing sustained improvement of microcirculation and recovery of retinal function. Two controlled randomized clinical trials demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Rheopheresis for the treatment of AMD patients, especially for those with the dry form. Recently the interim analysis of the sham-controlled, double blind, randomized multicenter Multicenter Investigation of Rheopheresis for AMD (MIRA-I) trial confirmed these results. The framework of completed and still ongoing controlled clinical trials in combination with postcertification studies including the RheoNet registry represents a comprehensive quality management approach for this novel interdisciplinary therapy for AMD.

Clinical records, voice messages, and fundus and slit-lamp images were transmitted from Xiamen, and an off-line dialogue by e-mail and Internet-relay chat was conducted. The time delay from transmission to receipt was 30 minutes, which would be adequate to respond to most ophthalmic emergencies. This pilot project will promote computer literacy among doctors, and inter-institutional interaction in the health care profession. OphthWeb can provide telemedicine and electronic medical records at a low cost and great convenience.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126614958", "source": "openalex"}

They have also modified the working hours of their trainees/residents to reduce unwarranted exposure to coronavirus in hospitals. Surgical training in ophthalmology is severely affected as most of the surgeries are elective in our specialty. With the implementation of standard COVID precautions in hospitals, travel restrictions and fear among patients to contract COVID, the surgical volume will take some time to restore back to normal.[3] A large number of residents are also deployed in the care of COVID positive patients, hampering their training in ophthalmology. These reasons have given rise to stress and anxiety among residents and other stakeholders. These findings are aptly highlighted in the present study.[4] The need of the hour is to restructure residency programs, trying to address the gaps in the existing ones. This will require the use of technology, innovative ideas and coordinated efforts among stakeholders.[5] It should focus on achieving excellence in 3 important domains – patient care, academic teaching, and research. Trainee health and safety should be always kept on priority. Most institutes have devised a rotation strategy for residents where some residents are posted in active clinical duty and others are kept in reserve. Residents who are not on active duty can also be involved in patient care, decision making, and surgical planning. This can be easily done by conducting daily briefings about various clinical cases on digital platforms like Zoom, Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, etc.[6] Virtual grand rounds can also be undertaken by faculties discussing clinical cases. This will ensure uninterrupted learning of all residents. Didactic lectures/interactive sessions/symposiums/conferences can easily be held on these digital platforms on a routine basis. Technology has now removed barriers of time, space and boundaries. Collaborative sessions can also be held comprising eminent speakers from different regions, sharing their experiences. The present study has also found these online teaching methods useful. Group discussions can also be held among residents on platforms like WhatsApp where they can discuss and clear their doubts.[7] Getting proficiency in surgical training will be difficult in present times due to limited number of surgeries. Residents can use virtual surgical simulators for basic cataract and vitreoretinal surgery training.[5] Institutes can formulate roster-based posting of residents in skills lab where they can perform basic surgical techniques on goat's eye and wax models. Some specialties have roped in various 3D printed models to improve basic surgical training, accuracy and muscle memory of residents.[8] They can also learn online from a vast database of surgical videos of different case scenarios. Teachers can discuss important surgical tips through online video-assisted surgical training sessions. Residents must be increasingly involved in the development of their non-technical skills like crisis management, teamwork, financial literacy, patient communication, etc.[2] Special peer groups can be formed to take care of the mental and emotional health of residents. These can also help in mentoring students in crisis times. Residents must also be encouraged to engage in research activities which will improve their analytical skills. Institutions can formulate revised guidelines for all patient-based clinical studies to make their sample size feasible. These will help residents to complete their research thesis/projects. Some of the countries are thinking to postpone the recruitment of new batch of fellows temporarily till the conditions revert back to normal.[9] There will be a grace period for existing fellows to make up for their surgical training and become proficient in their field. Virtual exams/interviews can be conducted, limiting large gatherings. Surgical qualifying and certification exams have been postponed globally. Some adjustments and exemptions can be made in these examinations, compensating for hardships related to COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to formulate policies regarding residency training at a national level. Crises are opportunities in disguise. Efforts must be made to address the existing gaps productively and innovatively.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1462_20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3031365699", "source": "openalex"}

Although the safety data of the clinical trials did not report specific concerns regarding neuro-ophthalmological adverse events, they involved a limited number of individuals and were conducted over a relatively short time. The aim of the current review is to summarize the available postmarketing data regarding the occurrence of neuro-ophthalmological and other ocular complications of the COVID-19 vaccines. Evidence Acquisition: Electronic searches for published literature were conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The search strategy incorporated controlled vocabulary and free-text synonyms for the concepts of COVID, vaccines, and visual and neuro-ophthalmologic diseases and symptoms. Results: A total of 14 case reports and 2 case series have been selected for inclusion in the final report, reporting 76 cases of post-COVID-vaccination adverse events. The most common adverse event was optic neuritis (n = 61), followed by uveitis (n = 3), herpes zoster ophthalmicus (n = 2), acute macular neuroretinopathy (n = 2), optic disc edema as an atypical presentation of Guillain–Barré syndrome (n = 1), (arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; n = 1), abducens nerve palsy (n = 1), oculomotor nerve palsy (n = 1), Tolosa–Hunt syndrome (n = 1), central serous retinopathy (n = 1), acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (n = 1), and bilateral choroiditis (n = 1). Most cases were treated with high-dose steroids and had a favorable clinical outcome. Conclusion: Since the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the past year, several post-COVID-vaccination neuro-ophthalmological complications have been described. However, considering the number of individuals that have been exposed to the vaccines, the risk seems very low, and the clinical outcome in most cases is favorable.

They also need to prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase (when pandemic-associated service reductions are eased).To describe a flexible and scalable scoring algorithm for patients with glaucoma that considers glaucoma severity and progression risk vs the presence of high-risk features for morbidity from COVID-19, using information from a large data repository.In this cross-sectional study, patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma from March 16, 2020, to April 16, 2020, at an academic institution enrolled in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative (SOURCE) Ophthalmology Electronic Health Record Data Repository were identified. A risk stratification tool was developed that calculated a glaucoma severity and progression risk score and a COVID-19 morbidity risk score. These scores were summed to determine a total score for each patient.Total scores and percentages of clinic appointments recommended for rescheduling.Among the 1034 patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma, the mean (SD) age was 66.7 (14.6) years. There were 575 women (55.6%), 733 White individuals (71%), and 160 Black individuals (15.5%). The mean (SD) glaucoma severity and progression risk score was 4.0 (14.4) points, the mean (SD) COVID-19 morbidity risk score was 27.2 (16.1) points, and the mean (SD) total score was 31.2 (21.4) points. During pandemic-associated reductions in services, using total score thresholds of 0, 25, and 50 points would identify 970 appointments (93.8%), 668 appointments (64.6%), and 275 appointments (26.6%), respectively, for postponement and rescheduling. The algorithm-generated total scores also helped prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase.A tool that considers the risk of underlying ophthalmic disease progression from delayed care receipt and the morbidity risk from COVID-19 exposure was developed and implemented, facilitating the triage of upcoming ophthalmic appointments.

Monkeypox ophthalmic manifestations may present to the ophthalmologist, or the ophthalmologist may be involved in comanagement. This narrative review creates a primer for the ophthalmologist of clinically relevant information regarding monkeypox, its ophthalmic manifestations, and the 2022 outbreak. Observations Monkeypox virus is an Orthopoxvirus (genus includes variola [smallpox] and vaccinia [smallpox vaccine]). The 2022 outbreak is of clade II (historically named West African clade), specifically subclade IIb. In addition to historic transmission patterns (skin lesions, bodily fluids, respiratory droplets), sexual transmission has also been theorized in the current outbreak due to disproportionate occurrence in men who have sex with men. Monkeypox causes a characteristic skin eruption and mucosal lesions and may cause ophthalmic disease. Monkeypox-related ophthalmic disease (MPXROD) includes a spectrum of ocular pathologies including eyelid/periorbital skin lesions, blepharoconjunctivitis, and keratitis). Smallpox vaccination may reduce MPXROD occurrence. MPXROD seems to be rarer in the 2022 outbreaks than in historical outbreaks. MPXROD may result in corneal scarring and blindness. Historical management strategies for MPXROD include lubrication and prevention/management of bacterial superinfection in monkeypox keratitis. Case reports and in vitro data for trifluridine suggest a possible role in MPXROD. Tecovirimat, cidofovoir, brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous may be used for systemic infection. There is a theoretical risk for monkeypox transmission by corneal transplantation, and the Eye Bank Association of America has provided guidance. Smallpox vaccines (JYNNEOS [Bavarian Nordic] and ACAM2000 [Emergent Product Development Gaithersburg Inc]) provide immunity against monkeypox. Conclusions and Relevance The ophthalmologist may play an important role in the diagnosis and management of monkeypox. MPXROD may be associated with severe ocular and visual morbidity. As the current outbreak evolves, up-to-date guidance from public health organizations and professional societies are critical.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2022.4567", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4308060531", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W17161140", "title": "[The importance of informed consent in the field of ophthalmology].", "text": "Ocular diseases have some characteristics that are different from diseases of other organs. First, patients clearly can judge for themselves whether or not they can see better postoperatively. Second, because several parameters such as visual acuity and intraocular pressure, are obtained from patients, patient's families and others can objectively judge the post-treatment status. Therefore, clinical information is easily available to others besides the physician. Third, except for acute ocular diseases such as retinal detachment, acute glaucoma, and ocular trauma that easily can result in blindness, ophthalmologists usually treat eyes that will maintain a certain visual acuity level. These are the primary reasons why patients and families complain about unfavorable post-treatment subjective symptoms. Because of these three characteristics of ocular disease, informed consent (IC) is extremely important in the field of ophthalmology. I studied ophthalmology and IC at Harvard Medical School, Boston, from 1980 to 1983, and again in 1989. Strict IC is mandatory in the United States. However, the concept of IC in the US cannot always be adapted to fit Japanese culture. The different legal concepts of IC in the two countries are discussed in this paper. Since I returned to Japan, our Department of Ophthalmology incorporated several new concepts into our clinical practice. For example, we now broadcast live surgeries of patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy by closed-circuit TV to their families in the hospital. This has fostered great communication and confidence among patients, their families, and doctors. In 1994, we also began inter-hospital and international IC via telemedicine and telescience. The video conferencing system VisionSeries (Panasonic Broadcast and Television System Company) is used to communicate between Asahikawa Medical University and 10 branch hospitals. INS net 1500 or INS net 64 (3 lines) transmits full-motion (30 frames/second) color fundus images and biomicroscopic images. Ocular surgeries performed by ophthalmologists using operating microscopes at each branch hospital also are transmitted to Asahikawa Medical University to facilitate consultation with more experienced ophthalmologists. The transmitted images of the fundus and biomicroscopic findings are satisfactory, and they allow surgeons to conduct useful discussions among themselves and with the family members during the surgeries in real time. When the patients' families are in local cities, surgeons can transmit the operations via the telemedicine system link to the nearby hospital, and the ophthalmologists there can narrate the surgeries in real time. On November 14, 1996, our technology was used internationally for the first time to transmit ocular images and live ocular surgeries between Asahikawa Medical University, Japan, and the Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. Telemedicine and telesurgery will be useful scientific tools in the field of Ophthalmology in the near future. We believe that this technology literally opens up the world to scientific and medical collaboration. Patients with vision deficiencies and blinding disease are certain to be the ultimate beneficiaries of these interactions. Lastly, ideal implementation of IC in the field of Ophthalmology are discussed in this paper.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W17161140", "source": "openalex"}

Retinoblastoma is an intraocular tumor with hereditary and sporadic forms. 8,000 new cases of this ocular malignancy of the developing retina are diagnosed each year worldwide. The major gene responsible for retinoblastoma is RB1 , and it harbors a large spectrum of pathogenic variants. Tumorigenesis begins with mutations that cause RB1 biallelic inactivation preventing the production of functional pRB proteins. Depending on the type of mutation the penetrance of RB is different. However, in small percent of tumors additional genes may be required, such as MYCN , BCOR and CREBBP . Additionally, epigenetic changes contribute to the progression of retinoblastoma as well. Besides its role in the cell cycle, pRB plays many additional roles, it regulates the nucleosome structure, participates in apoptosis, DNA replication, cellular senescence, differentiation, DNA repair and angiogenesis. Notably, pRB has an important role as a modulator of chromatin remodeling. In recent years high-throughput techniques are becoming essential for credible biomarker identification and patient management improvement. In spite of remarkable advances in retinoblastoma therapy, primarily in high-income countries, our understanding of retinoblastoma and its specific genetics still needs further clarification in order to predict the course of this disease and improve therapy. One such approach is the tumor free DNA that can be obtained from the anterior segment of the eye and be useful in diagnostics and prognostics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40246-023-00529-w", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4386385125", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1993922039", "title": "Pediatric ophthalmology: The oldest ophthalmology subspeciality", "text": "Pediatric ophthalmology is quite a fascinating branch, but frustrating sometimes, as it is difficult to examine a child. At the same time the process of acquiring the art of child examination is very exciting. It is a constantly changing and evolving field. The general ophthalmologist and subspecialist are taught most of their pediatric ophthalmology during their training and many new advances and current concepts are not well disseminated into the ophthalmic community. Going back to the past, the evolution of this branch is to be seen close to its associated branch, Pediatrics. Pediatrics evolved from general medicine, to a certain extent for social reasons, which still exist today. At the end of the eighteenth century a movement that considered children to be a special national treasure swept across Europe. This movement marked the inception of recognizing the need for special care for children. Within a few years, hospitals dedicated to the care of children thrived in every nation in Europe. The first few children's hospitals in the United States were in Philadelphia, in 1855, Boston, in 1869, and Detroit, in 1886. These all started as very small units of 20 beds or fewer. Ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology (ENT) were emerging from general surgery in the nineteenth century due to the special skills needed that were separate from general surgery. Those with a special interest in Ophthalmology saw the need to come together, to share ideas and learn. The first and oldest specialty society was the German Ophthalmology Society, inaugurated in 1857. In the United States, in 1864, the American Ophthalmological Society was founded in 1864. The All India Ophthalmological Society was established in the year 1930. Frank D. Costenbader was an American physician, frequently credited as the world's first pediatric ophthalmologist.[1] In 1943, Dr. Costenbader limited his practice to children and became the first pediatric ophthalmologist. He was bothered by the fact that those ophthalmologists interested in strabismus were mostly interested in adults with strabismus or older children. Surgery was directed at cosmetic straightening of the eyes and not establishing binocular function. To this point there were no other sub-specialties in Ophthalmology. Dr. Costenbader took his first trainee, Marshall M. Parks, in 1947. Costenbader and Marshall M. Parks (his mentee who would later be known to many as 'the father of pediatric ophthalmology') began the first Ophthalmology Fellowship Training Program of any subspecialty at the Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., now known as the Children's National Medical Center.[23] Organization of a Pediatric Ophthalmology Society and a Periodic Pediatric Ophthalmology meeting were discussed on October 31, 1967, at the invitation of Dr. Marshall Parks, held in the Palmer House in Chicago, at the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology (AAOO) (Academy) meeting. Dr. Arthur Jampolsky and Dr. Cuppers had organized a very extensive strabismus meeting in Geissen. Jampolsky, Cuppers, Parks, Costenbader, and a few others met in Gruenberg to discuss forming an International Strabismus Association (ISA), which would have meetings associated with the International Congress Meetings. This was the formation of the ISA. The formation of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology (AAPO) was legally accomplished in 1974, and in 1976, Dr. Jampolsky made the motion to change the name from AAPO to AAPOS (American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus). Although Pediatric Ophthalmology Departments are being set up in the tertiary care eye hospitals, strabismology has been recognized as a distinct subspeciality in India for decades. Many tertiary eye hospitals in India established a Strabismus Department as early as in the 1960s. The Strabismological Society of India was founded in 1982, and has meetings every year. However, the need for a Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus Society similar to other countries is still felt.[4] India is in a transitional state addressing treatable and preventable causes of blindness. In India, about 320,000 children are blind, resulting in a prevalence of 0.08%, according to the Website of Orbis International, a nonprofit agency dedicated to eliminating unnecessary blindness by increasing access to and improving eye care. ORBIS has launched the 'India Childhood Blindness Initiative' to overcome this crisis. They have planned to develop 50 Pediatric Ophthalmology Centers across the country by 2012, with ORBIS-trained staff in place to treat childhood blindness. Major causes of childhood blindness include corneal scarring secondary to vitamin A deficiency, congenital cataract, Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), and congenital glaucoma. One needs to address these issues in the early stage to save a child's vision and future. Trends of management for ROP are evolving. Since the first time intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) were used for ROP there has been tremendous interest shown in the potential of these drugs.[5] The role of intravitreal Avastin in the treatment of ROP has been under trial. The goal of this issue is to both update ophthalmologists on topics they may have learned during training and introduce a number of new therapeutic options we have at our disposal. The authors of these studies have summarized a wide variety of topics seen in Pediatric Ophthalmology. Most of the studies include summaries of our current thinking and management of common diseases. We have also included some discussion of pediatric eye disease in developing nations. It is our hope that this collection of studies will improve both the knowledge and level of care offered by ophthalmologists to their pediatric patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0301-4738.86304", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1993922039", "source": "openalex"}

Setting This study involves international setting. Participants The participants involved were ophthalmologists at any career level. Methods Routine internet search was used to identify LDPs targeting ophthalmologists. LDPs identified were categorized by the outcome data available into four levels based on prior literature. Participants were assessed using previously validated software for gender (Gender-API, 2020) and race or ethnicity (NamSor, 2020) Results Nine programs were identified which were classified into LDP generations. The first LDP in ophthalmology was the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) LDP, which served as the nidus for the formation of four multinational LDPs, together forming the Global LDP. These LDPs were similar in size and scope; program size ranging from nine to 30 participants; a length of 1 to 2 years; with similar curricular offerings; with funding primarily derived from cost-sharing with a nominating society. The second generation of ophthalmology LDPs in the United States has targeted female scientists or faculty (Women's LDP by ARVO) and academic ophthalmology leaders (Academic LDP by Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology). The AAO's LDP appears increasingly diverse with approximately 13% women at inception, gradually increasing from 40 to 65% women in the last 5 years ( n = 389). There has also been a notable increase in ethnic diversity. Conclusion and Relevance AAO LDP is the preeminent leadership training program for ophthalmologists, and it has influenced the creation of a new generation of LDP offerings. There remains a paucity of LDP evaluation metrics and reported outcomes. Newer iterations are successfully targeting academic leadership and attempting to address known disparities in gender and race or ethnicity. Further expansion of LDPs and related research can ensure equity and diversity in the pipeline.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1723001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3134564397", "source": "openalex"}

Dry immersion (DI), an analog to microgravity, rapidly induces a centralization of body fluids, immobilization, and hypokinesia similar to that observed during spaceflight. The main objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to assess the neuro-ophthalmological impact during 5 days of DI and (2) to determine the effects of venoconstrictive thigh cuffs (VTC), used as a countermeasure to limit headward fluid shift, on DI-induced ophthalmological adaptations. Eighteen healthy male subjects underwent 5 days of DI with or without VTC countermeasures. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups of 9: a control and cuffs group. Retinal and optic nerve thickness were assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) was measured by ocular ultrasonography and used to assess indirect changes in intracranial pressure (ICP). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was assessed by applanation tonometry. A higher thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in the temporal quadrant was observed after DI. ONSD increased significantly during DI and remained higher during the recovery phase. IOP did not significantly change during and after DI. VTC tended to limit the ONSD enlargement but not the higher thickness of an RNFL induced by DI. These findings suggest that 5 days of DI induced significant ophthalmological changes. VTC were found to dampen the ONSD enlargement induced by DI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.692361", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3177812328", "source": "openalex"}

Among numerous comorbidities which are part of the phenotype of individuals with Down syndrome, ocular problems appear to be highly prevalent. Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations, such as ocular alignment and motility disturbances, amblyopia, hypoaccommodation or optic nerve abnormalities, and other organic ocular anomalies frequently reported in Down syndrome, may lead to an overall decrease in visual acuity. Although numerous studies have reported ocular anomalies related to Down syndrome, it remains challenging to determine the impact of each anomaly upon the decreased visual acuity, as most such individuals have more than one ocular problem. Even in children with Down syndrome and no apparent ocular defect, visual acuity has been found to be reduced compared with typically developing children. Pediatric ophthalmological examination is a critical component of a multidisciplinary approach to prevent and treat ocular complications and improve the visual outcome in children with Down syndrome. This narrative review aims to provide a better understanding of the neuro-ophthalmological manifestations and discuss the current ophthalmological management in children with Down syndrome.

Lack of effective CS in current PG students' results in patient distrust and dissatisfaction, conflicts, and compromised healthcare. The regulatory authorities of medical education have recognized the need to inculcate soft skills among medical graduates, one of which is CS. The purpose of this study was to assess the need for teaching CS to ophthalmology PG students and develop and introduce a module for the same. Methods: In this prospective, interventional study done at the ophthalmology department of a tertiary hospital, a validated 8 day CS workshop was conducted for 60 PG students through interactive lectures, observations, video sessions, and role plays. Feedbacks were obtained through narratives, validated Google survey, reflections and verbal method and analyzed. Results: In the needs assessment done on 27 departmental faculties, 20 faculties found poor communication to be a major reason for patient complaints. All faculties agreed that CS should be taught to medical students. Statistically significant improvement in CS awareness was noted among students after the workshop. Lack of CS training, work burden, and language were identified as main barriers to effective communication. All the students were satisfied with the workshop and wanted it to be conducted regularly. Conclusion: This study establishes that CS training is essential to improve patient satisfaction and patient-doctor relationships.

Although many mechanisms are thought to be involved in the development and progression of the disease, only an increased intraocular pressure has been established as a clinically significant modifiable risk factor. Nevertheless, up to 40% of patients develop glaucoma without evidence of increased intraocular pressure. Ample evidence suggests that alterations in the control of arterial blood might negatively affect optic nerve function. However, evidence-based guidelines on the management of arterial blood pressure in glaucoma patients are lacking. Regrettably, intraocular pressure is generally not included as a secondary end-point in clinical trials on arterial hypertension. Considering the relative simplicity of intraocular pressure measurements and large number of patients included in hypertension studies, the benefits of including intraocular pressure as a secondary end-point could be of a great value for improving care for glaucoma patients. Therefore, closer collaboration between cardiologists and ophthalmologists is needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5603/cj.2019.0008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2921170082", "source": "openalex"}

There are several studies that reported physiologic and behavioral responses to painful and stressing screening examination. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of sucrose and acetaminophen in pain control during eye examination in premature infants. A prospective randomized clinical trial was carried out in a tertiary level NICU. One hundred twenty preterm infants were randomly allocated in to 3 groups. Group A received oral acetaminophen 15mg/kg 30 minutes before eye examination and 0.2ml sterile water, given by mouth using a syringe, during examination; group B 0.2ml sucrose 25% and group C 0.2ml sterile water given by mouth using a syringe during examination. Ophthalmologic examinations were recorded by videotape. Pain score was determined by using PIPP during first 45 seconds and at last 45 seconds of eye examination. There was no significant difference between groups regarding gestation age, birth weight and age at examination. The mean PIPP score at first 45 sec were 12.9±2.4, 9±2.1 and 13.7±1.6 for groups A, B, and C respectively (p<0.001).

The purpose of this study was to assess the satisfaction with health services and its associated factors among patients attending a national institute of ophthalmology in Vietnam. In a cross-sectional study utilizing quantitative methods, 500 inpatients and their relatives attending a national institute of ophthalmology in Vietnam were approached for data collection. The results indicated that under 50% of the patients were satisfied with eye care services. However, when classified by level of satisfaction, only 6.8% were very satisfied with all domains of care. There was no significant difference in satisfaction by gender and income, while significant differences by department, residence, and education were found. Patients who were from rural areas, were better educated, and used the services of the glaucoma department, were more satisfied with eye care than those from urban areas, were less educated, and used the services of treatment-on-demand department. Multivariable regression detected 2 main factors, gender and location, associated with patient satisfaction. Patients who were female and came from rural and remote areas were more likely to be satisfied than patients who were male and living in urban areas. The study suggests that to continue to improve health care quality, it is important to eliminate differences in providing eye care services regardless of whether patients are male or female, and whether they come from a rural or urban area.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2449", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2755571890", "source": "openalex"}

Systematic reviews on the management of cataract were searched for in an established database. Each relevant systematic review was mapped to 1 or more of the 24 management categories listed under the Management section of the table of contents of the 2011 AAO PPP guidelines. Data were extracted to determine the reliability of each systematic review using prespecified criteria, and the reliable systematic reviews were examined to find whether they were referenced in the 2016 AAO PPP guidelines. For comparison, we assessed whether the reliable systematic reviews published before February 2010 the last search date of the 2011 AAO PPP guidelines were referenced in the 2011 AAO PPP guidelines. Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Satellite did not provide systematic reviews to the AAO during the development of the 2011 AAO PPP guidelines.Systematic review reliability was defined by reporting eligibility criteria, performing a comprehensive literature search, assessing methodologic quality of included studies, using appropriate methods for meta-analysis, and basing conclusions on review findings.From 99 systematic reviews on management of cataract, 46 (46%) were classified as reliable. No evidence that a comprehensive search had been conducted was the most common reason a review was classified as unreliable.

The aim of this study was to identify all technical procedures that should be integrated in a simulation‐based curriculum in ophthalmology. Methods Key opinion leaders involved in the education of ophthalmologists in Denmark including heads of departments, heads of clinical education, professors and board members of the society were invited to participate in a three‐round Delphi process. Round 1 aimed at identifying technical procedures that physicians should be able to perform competently when completing specialty training; round 2 involved characterization of each procedure including frequency, number of operators, risk and/or discomfort for patients associated with an inexperienced physician, and feasibility of simulation‐based training; round 3 included a priority ranking of procedures. Results The response rate for each round was 71%, 64% and 64%, respectively. Sixty‐five procedures were reduced to 25 prioritized procedures during the three rounds. Two‐thirds of the procedures that were identified and highly prioritized were therapeutic procedures such as intravitreal injection therapy, yttrium–aluminium–garnet laser iridotomy/capsulotomy, minor ocular surface procedures and retinal argon laser therapy. The diagnostic procedures that were prioritized were ocular ultrasound, superficial keratectomy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Conclusion The Delphi process identified and prioritized 25 procedures that should be practised in a simulation‐based environment to achieve competency before working with patients. The list may be used to guide the development of future training programmes for ophthalmologists.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.13700", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2789705925", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, single-blind comparative digital imaging validation study. Digital photographs of patients with cataract were taken using a smartphone camera (an iPhone 5) on a telescopic mount and a Canon EOS 10D anterior segment camera. Images were graded and compared according to the Lens Opacification Classification System III (LOCS III). Results: A total of 440 anterior segment images were graded independently by 2 ophthalmologists, 2 residents and 2 medical students. Intraclass correlation (ICC) between the iPhone and anterior segment camera images were fair for nuclear opalescence (NO) and nuclear colour (NC), and excellent for cortical (C) and posterior subcapsular (PSC) (NO: ICC 0.40, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.57; NC: ICC 0.47, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.66; C: ICC 0.76, 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.81; PSC: ICC 0.81, 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.85). There was no difference in grader impression of confidence and images usability between both cameras (P = 0.66 and P = 0.58, respectively). Conclusion: Anterior segment images taken from an iPhone have good reproducibility for retro-illuminated images, but fair reproducibility for NO and NC under low light settings. There were no differences in grader confidence and subjective image suitability.

SCOTS/SCOTS 2 is an Institutional Review Board approved and NIH registered (NCT 03011541) clinical study that uses autologous bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSC) in the treatment of optic nerve and retinal disease. Methods: This is an open label, non-randomized clinical study using natural history of the disease as the comparator. BMSC were separated from aspirated autologous bone marrow with minimal manipulation using an FDA cleared Class II medical device. Patients were treated with combinations of retrobulbar, subtenons, intravitreal or subretinal placement of BMSC followed by intravenous injection of BMSC depending on the arm of the study chosen. There were no surgical complications. Results: Of the patients treated, 83.3% (5 of 6 patients) experienced visual improvements and in all of these cases both eyes improved. Ten eyes or 83.3% experienced gains in visual acuity with a median improvement of 2.125 Snellen lines, or approximately 10.63 letters. Two eyes were considered unchanged compared to longstanding measurements. Using LogMAR, the average improvement in vision for all eyes was 29.5%. The averagevisual acuity increasein eyes that improved was 33.3%. Findings were statistically significant with P<0.001. Conclusions: Using autologous BMSC per protocols developed in the SCOTS/SCOTS 2 clinical studies resulted in statistically significant visual acuity improvements in patients with DOA or Kjers Optic Neuropathy.

Indigenous healers rubbed or scraped the eyes or eyelids to treat inflammation, corneal opacities, and even eye irritation from smoke. European settlers used harsh treatments, such as bleeding and blistering, when the eyes were inflamed or had loss of vision with a normal appearance (gutta serena). In New Spain, surgery for corneal opacity was performed in 1601 and cataract couching in 1611. North American physicians knew of contralateral loss of vision after trauma or surgery (sympathetic ophthalmia), which they called \"sympathy.\" To date, the earliest identified cataract couching by a surgeon trained in the New World was performed in 1769 by John Bartlett of Rhode Island. The American Revolution negatively affected ophthalmology, as loyalist surgeons were expelled and others were consumed with wartime activities. After the war, cataract extraction was imported to America in earnest and academic development resumed. Charles F Bartlett, the son of John, performed cataract extraction but was also a \"rapacious privateer.\" In 1801, a doctor in the frontier territory of Kentucky observed anticholinergic poisoning by Datura stramonium (Jimsonweed) and suggested that this agent be applied topically to dilate the pupil before cataract extraction. John Warren at Harvard preferred couching in the 1790s, but, after his son returned from European training, recommended treating angle closure glaucoma by lens extraction. Other eye procedures described or advertised in America before the 19th century included enucleation, resection of conjunctival lesions or periocular tumors, treatment of lacrimal fistula, and fitting of prosthetic eyes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1179172117721902", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2739025381", "source": "openalex"}

However, less is known about their joint occurrence. Information on concurrence may improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and is required to estimate the disease burden of onchocerciasis. We analysed data from 765 individuals from forest villages in the Kumba and Ngambe Health districts, Cameroon. These data were collected in 1998, as baseline data for the evaluation of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control. Concurrence of symptoms was assessed using logistic regression. Onchocerciasis was highly endemic in the study population (63% nodule prevalence among males aged ≥20). Considerable overall prevalences of onchocercal visual impairment (low vision or blindness: 4%), troublesome itch (15%), reactive skin disease (19%), and skin depigmentation (25%) were observed. The association between onchocercal visual impairment and skin depigmentation (OR 9.0, 95% CI 3.9-20.8) was partly explained by age and exposure to infection (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.7). The association between troublesome itch and reactive skin disease was hardly affected by adjustment (adjusted OR 6.9, 95% CI 4.2-11.1). Concluding, there is significant concurrence of morbidities within onchocerciasis. Our results suggest a possible role of host characteristics in the pathogenesis of depigmentation and visual impairment.

The phantom and a set of calibration vials were scanned simultaneously in a GE 1.5 T MR imager using the Hahn spin‐echo pulse sequence with a TR of 2000 ms and two TEs of 20 ms and 100 ms. The values were evaluated on a pixel‐by‐pixel basis using custom‐built software on a DEC alpha workstation and converted to dose using calibration data.

Design This is a cross-sectional study. Methods An anonymous survey was sent to ophthalmology residents in the United States from the graduating class of 2018. The main outcome measure was the decision to seek fellowship training or to practice comprehensive ophthalmology. Information on demographics, residency program characteristics, and factors influencing career choices were collected. Results The overall response rate was 24.0% (112/467). Among the 112 respondents, 88 (78.6%) matched into subspecialty training. Compared with residents entering comprehensive ophthalmology, there was a greater proportion of Asians (37.5 vs. 8.3%) and a smaller proportion of non-Hispanic whites (47.7 vs. 70.8%, p = 0.029) among residents pursuing fellowship training. Residents pursuing fellowships had fewer children (0.4 vs. 0.8, p = 0.049), had less debt (median debt ≤ $100,000 vs. &gt; $200,000, p = 0.008), had more first-author publications (4.3 vs. 1.2, p&lt; 0.001), decided on their postgraduate career path earlier (median time postgraduate second year [PGY2] versus postgraduate third year [PGY3], p = 0.016), and were more likely to plan to practice in an academic setting (51.1 vs. 29.2%, p&lt; 0.001) and in an urban location (44.3 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.004). In a multiple logistic regression model, factors predictive of fellowship training included a desire to acquire special skills (odds ratio [OR] =4.39; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.70–16.37) and work with new technology (OR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.16–10.02). Factors that predicted a career in comprehensive ophthalmology were higher levels of educational debt (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12–0.77), a later timing of postgraduate decision (OR = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.02–0.65), and lifestyle considerations (OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03–0.36). Gender, prestige, or perceived favorable job market was not significant factors. Conclusion The majority of U.S. ophthalmology residents matched into fellowships. A desire to gain special skills and a desire to work with new technology were major factors influencing residents to seek fellowship training. Lifestyle considerations and educational debt were more important in the decision to choose a comprehensive ophthalmology career. Future research that includes more trainees and programs may minimize the selection bias issues present in this study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1715808", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3082930346", "source": "openalex"}

With the need to limit COVID-19 exposures, telemedicine has become an increasingly important format for clinical care. Compared with other fields, neuro-ophthalmology faces unique challenges, given its dependence on physical examination signs that are difficult to elicit outside the office setting. As such, it is imperative to understand both patient and provider experiences to continue to adapt the technology and tailor its application. The purpose of this study is to analyze both neuro-ophthalmology physician and patient satisfaction with virtual health visits during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Across three institutions (NYU Langone Health, Indiana University Health, and Columbia University Medical Center), telemedicine surveys were administered to 159 patients. Neuro-ophthalmologists completed 157 surveys; each of these were linked to a single patient visit. Patient surveys consisted of 5 questions regarding visit preparation, satisfaction, challenges, and comfort. The physician survey included 4 questions that focused on ability to gather specific clinical information by history and examination. Results: Among 159 patients, 104 (65.4%) reported that they were satisfied with the visit, and 149 (93.7%) indicated that they were comfortable asking questions. Sixty-eight (73.9%) patients found the instructions provided before the visit easy to understand. Potential areas for improvement noted by patients included more detailed preparation instructions and better technology (phone positioning, Internet connection, and software). More than 87% (137/157) of neuro-ophthalmologists surveyed reported having performed an examination that provided enough information for medical decision-making. Some areas of the neuro-ophthalmologic examination were reported to be easy to conduct (range of eye movements, visual acuity, Amsler grids, Ishihara color plates, and pupillary examination). Other components were more difficult (saccades, red desaturation, visual fields, convergence, oscillations, ocular alignment, and smooth pursuit); some were especially challenging (vestibulo-ocular reflex [VOR], VOR suppression, and optokinetic nystagmus). Clinicians noted that virtual health visits were limited by patient preparation, inability to perform certain parts of the examination (funduscopy and pupils), and technological issues. Conclusions: Among virtual neuro-ophthalmology visits evaluated, most offer patients with appointments that satisfy their needs. Most physicians in this cohort obtained adequate clinical information for decision-making. Even better technology and instructions may help improve aspects of virtual health visits.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000001370", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3195227336", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1969747021", "title": "History and future of the European Board of Ophthalmology Diploma examination", "text": "Purpose: The European Board of Ophthalmology Diploma (EBOD) examination has evolved over the last few years, especially with the introduction of negative marking (−0.5 points) for incorrect or blank answers (0 points for don't know option), which aimed to improve the quality and reliability of the examination. Methods: In 2010, negative marking at the written part of the EBOD examination has been introduced in an attempt to improve not only the reliability of the examination as entity but also the statistical performance parameters of the individual questions. As lower pass rates and discrimination of female candidates are feared by the general public when negative marking is concerned, these parameters have been explicitly investigated. Results: Introduction of negative marking has not only lead to improved reliability of the EBOD examination (increased Cronbach's alpha value: ≤0.80 without and ≥0.90 with negative marking), but also to improved statistical performance parameters of the individual questions. The pass rate of the EBOD examination has proven to remain at the same high level as without negative marking (around 90%). Furthermore, although female candidates do seem to have different answering strategies (p < 0.01, use of don't know option), no statistically significant difference has been found between total scores of male and female candidates (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Introduction of negative marking at the written EBOD examination has proven to be beneficial, not only for the organizers (improvement of the statistical performance of the examination and its questions), but also for candidates (better discrimination with borderline candidates). These results have been obtained without evidence of lower pass rates or discrimination of female candidates. Assurance of high standard of training in ophthalmology within the European Union does not only depend on content of training but also on assessment of trainees. The strive towards harmonization of training in ophthalmology across Europe dates back to the 1980s, when a group of enthusiastic people believing in European ideals created the European University Professors in Ophthalmology (EUPO) (1987), whose goals were defined as promotion of medical education, research and patient care related to the field of ophthalmology within the European Union. EUPO supported the creation of the European Board of Ophthalmology (EBO) in 1992, following a motion of the Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes (UEMS). A few years after EBO was created, the first European Board of Ophthalmology Diploma (EBOD) examination was organized in Milan (1995). Although the structure of the oral part has been maintained up till now (Table 1), the written part has undergone some changes over the years (Table 1), going from 100 single-best-answer (SBA) questions to 260 true/false (T/F) statements. Following its first edition, the EBOD examination has been organized in Paris (1996 till present) on a yearly basis. In May 2011, the 17th edition of the EBOD examination was organized. The EBOD examination is one of several means of the EBO to help establishing common European education standards (Kirkness 2002), within the field of ophthalmology, which have become a main priority as the mutual recognition of titles of specialists in ophthalmology within the European Union, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland has become a fact (European Union (EU) 1993; European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) 1993). The EBOD examination is defined as a theoretical test designed to assess predominantly (applied) knowledge and clinical skills requisite to the delivery of a high standard of ophthalmologic care, both in hospitals and independent clinical practices. It is clear from this definition that mainly the knowledge part of the three main components of medical training (knowledge, skills and professionalism) (Bloom 1956) can be assessed by the EBOD examination. This is one of other arguments why the EBOD examination, although it has been officially recognized by several countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Switzerland), does not imply a licence to practise ophthalmology within the country of origin in case of successful outcome. The national authorities of the participating candidates remain the only competent authorities to deliver this licence to practise, for example, based on the results of the candidate at the EBOD examination (knowledge) and/or on the completion of training or any criteria as defined by each educational governance (skills and professionalism). Until 2003, only recognized specialists in ophthalmology (UEMS countries) were allowed to sit EBOD, while since 2004, residents in the final year of training have been allowed to sit the EBOD examination (or in the fourth year in countries with longer training like, for example, the UK). Ever since, a marked annual increase of interest to participate at EBOD has been observed (Fig. 1). This sudden interest necessitated the adoption of dedicated informatic tools like an optical reader system and processing software (Speedwell MultiQuest, Speedwell, Cambridge, UK) to keep the validity of the EBOD examination. Currently, over 80% of the total candidate population are residents. Schematic overview of the number of applicants at the EBOD over the past 6 years. The EBOD examination attracts candidates from all European countries (European Union, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), but over 80% of candidates still originate from Western European countries, with France and Germany accounting for about half the total number. In 2007, the Council for European Specialist Medical Assessments (CESMA) was created within the structure of the UEMS, in an attempt to harmonize the assessment procedures between the different medical specialties. Since 2009, the EBO has been very actively involved in CESMA activities. At present, the EBOD examination is the second largest European Board specialist examination (after Anaesthesiology). No decision has been taken so far about opening the EBOD examination to candidates originating from non-UEMS countries, as some medical specialties with much smaller number of candidates have already been performed. Training and education (in ophthalmology) encompasses three components: knowledge, skills and professionalism (Bloom 1956), which are inter-linked. It is clear that none of these three components of education can be considered solely as 'absolute assessment' of a candidate. Ideally, an assessment should consider these three components of education. The EBOD examination, being a theoretical assessment method, is focused mainly on (theoretical and applied) knowledge, while the aspects of practical skills and professionalism are assessed to a very limited extent. The written examination is available to candidates in English, French or German language and is composed of 52 multiple-choice questions (MCQ's: stem with five T/F statements), which cover basic science, medical or surgical topics relevant to the practice of ophthalmology (Table 1) and selected from the EBO questions bank taking into account a predefined distribution of the ten fields covered within the MCQ paper (Table 1). Furthermore, a fair distribution between easy questions (25%), moderately difficult questions (50%) and difficult questions (25%) is assured. This type of preselection explains the smaller total number of MCQ's presented to the candidates when compared to other European Board medical examinations, where typically 60 MCQs are selected (data obtained at the meetings of the Council for European Specialist Medical Assessments, CESMA, created within the structures of the UEMS). Moreover, contrary to many other European Board medical examinations (data obtained at the CESMA meetings), all candidates are allowed to sit the oral part of the EBOD examination, even if they were not successful at the written part, which allows EBO to assure representative examination results. Although analytical results of the EBOD examination have shown a good correlation between results of the written and oral part of the examination, EBO has preferred to reward the written part of the EBOD examination slightly less, compared with the oral part (eqn 1). One of the reasons behind this decision is to alleviate the problem that some candidates may not be particularly familiar with or skilled at answering MCQs. In addition, the written examination is intended mainly to assess factual knowledge. The main advantage of using the average MCQ score and the standard deviation of these scores is to maintain the pass rate of the written part of the EBOD examination unchanged over the years, even in case of (slightly) different levels of difficulty that may arise despite the very robust selection of MCQ's. All other MCQ scores (range: 1–10) can be calculated using a conversion table. Four separate viva voce discussions on four different topics (Table 1) of 15 min each are conducted by a panel of four pairs of examiners. The language for this oral part of the EBOD examination is mainly English, French and German. However, if possible, at least one examiner in each pair will be chosen to speak and understand the candidate's native tongue, which has proven to be extremely helpful in avoiding language-based misperceptions. Each of these viva Voce discussions has an equal contribution to the total candidate score (eqn 1). The viva voce discussions are composed around predefined examination topics (Table 1) and cover developmental, dystrophic, degenerative, inflammatory, infectious, toxic, traumatic, neoplastic and vascular diseases affecting the eye and its surrounding structures. Candidates are expected to be able to discuss aspects of preventive ophthalmology, medicolegal and ethical issues, and European contributions to ophthalmology. In each viva voce setting, emphasis will be placed upon data acquisition, diagnosis and treatment. This procedure of selection of international juries is beneficial for both the organizers of the EBOD examination and the candidates. The benefit for the organizers relies in the fact that international juries allow to establish common European education standards in ophthalmology (Kirkness 2002). On the other hand, the candidate experiencing examination-related stress will feel more at ease knowing that at least one of the jury members (or an interpreter ophthalmologist) will be there to help in case of language issues. During the viva voce, examination assessors circulate between panels and report any apparent discrepancies or potential thoughts on improving the process. This is aimed as an added way of ensuring fairness and of help in the on-going evolution process of the examination. As the EBOD examination became (partially) equivalent to the national examination in several European countries, and experienced recently a significant increase in participating candidates, it became of utmost importance to analyse the performance of the EBOD examination statistically. In 2008, the EBOD examination was evaluated using software and technology of a professional company specialized in the analysis of examinations (2008: Cito, Arnhem, The Netherlands). In 2009, however, Speedwell software was used for the same purpose (2009: Logotron Ltd, Chittering, UK). The choice to change to Speedwell software in 2009 was based on the fact that although Cito was routined in the assessment of all kinds of examinations, Logotron Ltd was more experienced in medical (postgraduate) assessment. In addition, the significant increase in candidates over the past few years urged EBO to adopt a more performant and reliable optical scanning technology, which was not available at Cito. The statistical analysis was performed on the results obtained with the cohort of candidates of the EBOD 2008 (n = 284) and the EBOD 2009 (n = 308) examinations. No negative marking was given for blank, incorrect or double-marked answers. The European Board of Ophthalmology (EBO) has decided to include not only the traditional statistical examination performance parameters (Cronbach's alpha value (Cronbach 1951), P-statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient) as included within commercially available examination software programs, such as, Speedwell MultiQuest (Logotron Ltd, Chittering, UK), but also to include other statistical methods (EBOD 2009 examination) such as item discrimination index, comparison of candidate scores for each item and item-response analysis (Rasch analysis or 1-parameter analysis and 3-parameter analysis) (Rasch 1960/1980) (Wright 1992). Although many candidates participated at the EBOD 2008 and EBOD 2009 examinations, the statistical performance parameters displayed in Table 2 do not reach the values considered as thumb rules by assessment companies (e.g. Cito, Arnhem, the Netherlands or Speedwell, Cambridge, UK). These findings do not imply that the MCQ's of the EBOD 2008 and 2009 examinations were badly constructed. Indeed, when looking carefully at the 70% of test items that had a poor statistical performance (mathematical validation), it turned out that these questions had clinical relevance and were in general well constructed. Clinical validation of the test items with a good statistical performance was performed by the Examination Committee and showed that items with good statistical performance parameters were clinically valuable. Indeed, none of the test items with good statistical performance parameters did raise any concern about the clinical validity of the test item. By applying the secondary statistical performance parameters as described previously, EBO was able to reduce the number of MCQs that needed verification to about 25% of test items, meaning that this secondary statistical analysis was justified in an attempt to reduce the workload of the EBO Examination Committee to verify the clinical relevance of poor-performing test items. Three-parameter item-response analysis at EBOD 2008 further showed that on average, over 30% of correct answers were estimated to result from guessing. Indeed, when applying multiple T/F items, candidates have a probability as high as 50%to answer correctly in case they do not know the answer to the test item. Although this estimation of guessing correctly may be an overestimation, it is still obvious that guessing will influence the total candidate's score, especially of the under-performing candidates, who are more likely to be able to increase their total score thanks to guessing, reducing the discriminative power of the examination as the standard deviation of total test scores will be reduced because of guessing (artificial elevation of total scores of weaker candidates). Although guessing in medicinal practice is desirable to a certain extent, it should be avoided in daily medical practice. As the performance parameters have been negatively influenced by the absence of negative marking (overestimation of P-statistics, and underestimation of Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation), it is clear that the guessing factor is over-represented at the EBOD 2008 and EBOD 2009 examinations, which justified to introduce other rating methods like negative marking. Although in the literature the fear has been expressed that negative marking might be discriminative towards female candidates (Goldik 2008), the EBO Examination Committee decided to go ahead with negative marking starting from EBOD 2010 on. The goal was to reduce the relatively high rate of guessing as experienced in the EBOD 2008 and 2009. As the written EBOD examination contains fewer MCQs compared with other European Board examinations like the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) examination (Goldik 2008), the influence of guessing may have a more important impact on the final results. The statistical analysis has been performed on the results including negative marking and obtained with the cohort of candidates of the EBOD 2010 (n = 310 of whom 168 were male and 142 were female candidates) and the EBOD 2011 (n = 331 of whom 159 were male and 172 were female candidates) examinations. The results are compared with the results obtained without negative marking as analysed for the EBOD 2008 (143 male and 141 female candidates) and EBOD 2009 (185 male and 123 female candidates) examinations. with n being the total number of options presented to the candidate. Traditionally, the 'don't know' option is not considered to be included within this total number of options (negative mark −1 for incorrect answer for a T/F item). The EBO Examination Committee has decided, however, to include the 'don't know' as a valid option within the total number of options available for the candidate (negative mark −0.5 for incorrect answer). When comparing the statistical performance parameters of the EBOD examination with and without negative marking (Table 2), it is clear that all performance parameters have improved after the introduction of negative marking. Item-response analysis (Rasch 1960/1980) (Wright 1992) of the data with negative marking also showed a significant improvement, as less than 5 items have been indicated in the EBOD 2010 and EBOD 2011 examinations to be influenced by guessing, as compared to the situation without negative marking where all T/F items were indicated to be influenced to a certain extent (on average 30%) by guessing. To overcome discrimination of female candidates with the introduction of negative marking (fear expressed by some authors in the literature) (Goldik 2008), candidates were carefully instructed at the beginning of the EBOD 2010 and EBOD 2011 written examinations. Furthermore, the negative penalties for incorrect answers at the EBOD 2010 and EBOD 2011 were less severe (−0.5) as traditionally used (−1) in multiple T/F format (eqn 3) (Guilford and Fruchter 1973), because of the inclusion of the 'don't know' option as a valid option for the candidate. Indeed, knowing when to refer a patient is part of medical professionalism. With the introduction of negative marking, the EBO Examination Committee aimed to reduce drastically the number of wild guesses. However, by implementing a less severe negative marking scheme, candidates were instructed that educated guesses might still be beneficial, despite the introduction of negative marking. Nevertheless, a difference in strategy between female and male candidates was observed, with female candidates tending to choose more often for the 'don't know' option compared with their male colleagues. This finding turned out to be statistically significant (p < 0.01). One might have expected this result intuitively, but also studies on gender biology have already indicated that men are often more willing to take risks than women (Stanton et al. 2011) (Stenstrom et al. 2011) (Roney & Von Hippel 2010) (Goudriaan et al. 2010) (Vermeersch et al. 2008a,b) (Archer 1999). Hence, identifying this difference in strategy between male and female candidates to answer the EBOD written examination is not such a novelty. What is more important is whether this difference in strategy between male and female candidates results in different total scores for the EBOD written examination or not. Therefore, both raw total scores and converted scores have been compared, none of which proved to be statistically significant. Also, without negative marking (analysis of EBOD 2009), no statistically significant difference in total scores between male and female candidates was observed. Hence, the absence of discrimination of negative marking towards female candidates is proven. Although EBO wants to firmly state that the validity of the EBOD examination as entity (written and oral examination) has never been questioned, EBO decided to introduce negative marking as from EBOD 2010 examination on in an attempt to improve the statistical performance parameters of its examination. It has become evident that introduction of negative marking at the EBOD examination was beneficial, not only for EBO (better statistical performance of EBOD) but also for the candidates (better discrimination with weak candidates). All these results have been obtained without negatively influencing the pass rate of the EBOD examination or being discriminative towards female candidates. All these efforts were justified by the wish of the EBO Board to deliver the results to the candidates as soon as possible, which is currently feasible to do in a couple of hours after having closed the examination. This procedure reduces the risk of mixing up the candidates' exams or the risk of (inadvertent) manipulation of the results.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-3768.2012.02422.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969747021", "source": "openalex"}

A telephone survey of patients revealed an attack rate of 17% among patients seen during the epidemic period. A case-control study demonstrated that development of EKC was associated with exposure to pneumotonometry and to three caregivers. After controlling for exposure to pneumo-tonometry, however, only exposure to one caregiver was significantly associated with risk of the disease. On January 19, 1988, after recognition of the outbreak, the eye clinic instituted additional infection control measures. A survey of patients seen the following week showed a substantial decrease in the attack rate (1.9%). Before these control measures were implemented, clinic personnel had followed the manufacturer's recommendations and disinfected pneumotonometer tips with 70% isopropyl alcohol, fearing that other disinfectants would corrode the instrument metal. Isopropyl alcohol, shown to have limited activity against adenovirus in vitro, also was being used to “disinfect” pneumotonometer tips between uses at six other area eye clinics polled by telephone. The results of this study demonstrate the need for changes in the design and manufacture of equipment used in the eye clinic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1086/645949", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154331415", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: In December 2023, 250 multiple-choice questions from the \"BoardVitals\" ophthalmology exam question bank were randomly selected and entered into Bard to assess the artificial intelligence chatbot's ability to comprehend, process, and answer complex scientific and clinical ophthalmic questions. A random mix of text-only and image-and-text questions were selected from 10 subsections. Each subsection included 25 questions. The percentage of correct responses was calculated per section, and an overall assessment score was determined. Results: On average, Bard answered 62.4% (156/250) of questions correctly. The worst performance was 24% (6/25) on the topic of \"Retina and Vitreous,\" and the best performance was on \"Oculoplastics,\" with a score of 84% (21/25). While the majority of questions were entered with minimal difficulty, not all questions could be processed by Bard. This was particularly an issue for questions that included human images and multiple visual files. Some vignette-style questions were also not understood by Bard and were therefore omitted. Future investigations will focus on having more questions per subsection to increase available data points. Conclusions: While Bard answered the majority of questions correctly and is capable of analyzing vast amounts of medical data, it ultimately lacks the holistic understanding and experience-informed knowledge of an ophthalmologist. An ophthalmologist's ability to synthesize diverse pieces of information and draw from clinical experience to answer complex standardized board questions is at present irreplaceable, and artificial intelligence, in its current form, can be employed as a valuable tool for supplementing clinicians' study methods.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.57348", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4393352397", "source": "openalex"}

The gold standard therapeutic approaches in managing patients with glaucoma and limiting progression include local drops, laser, and/or surgery, which are all geared at reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). Nutrients, antioxidants, vitamins, organic compounds, and micronutrients have been gaining increasing interest in the past decade as integrative IOP-independent strategies to delay or halt glaucomatous retinal ganglion cell degeneration. In our minireview, we examine the various nutrients and compounds proposed in the current literature for the management of ophthalmology diseases, especially for glaucoma. With respect to each substance considered, this minireview reports the molecular and biological characteristics, neuroprotective activities, antioxidant properties, beneficial mechanisms, and clinical studies published in the past decade in the field of general medicine. This study highlights the potential benefits of these substances in glaucoma and other ophthalmologic pathologies. Nutritional supplementation can thus be useful as integrative IOP-independent strategies in the management of glaucoma and in other ophthalmologic pathologies.

However, the current progress of research into aptamers for the treatment of eye disorders has not been well-documented. The current literature on aptamers was reviewed in this study. Aptamer-related drugs and biochemical sensors have been evaluated for several eye disorders within the past decade; S58 targeting TGF-β receptor II and pegaptanib targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are used to prevent fibrosis after glaucoma filtration surgery. Anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor aptamer has been used to diagnose glaucoma. The first approved aptamer drug (pegaptanib) has been used to inhibit angiogenesis in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), and its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical trials. Aptamers, including E10030, RBM-007, AS1411, and avacincaptad pegol, targeting other angiogenesis-related biomarkers have also been discovered and subjected to clinical trials. Aptamers, such as C promoter binding factor 1, CD44, and advanced end products in AMD and DR, targeting other signal pathway proteins have also been discovered for therapy, and biochemical sensors for early diagnosis have been developed based on aptamers targeting VEGF, connective tissue growth factor, and lipocalin 1. Aptamers used for early detection and treatment of ocular tumors were derived from other disease biomarkers, such as CD71, nucleolin, and high mobility group A. In this review, the development and application of aptamers in eye disorders in recent years are systematically discussed, which may inspire a new link between aptamers and eye disorders. The aptamer development trajectory also facilitates the discovery of the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for various eye disorders.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2092052241", "title": "Dictionary of Ophthalmology", "text": "Dictionary of Ophthalmology, Michel Millodot, Daniel M. Laby. Boston: Butterworth-Heinemann, 2002. Pages: 336. Price: $78.00. ISBN 0-7506-4797-3. When I first began my optometry training, the overwhelming sentiment was that every student MUST own a copy of The Wills Eye Manual and the Merck Manual. Unfortunately, another “must have” was left off the list: a dictionary specifically for ophthalmology and optometry. At the time, none was appropriate. With the arrival of Michel Millodot and Daniel Laby’s Dictionary of Ophthalmology, the void has been filled. This dictionary of common terms used today in optometry, ophthalmology, and vision science is extensive, but the definitions are straightforward, succinct, and easy to comprehend. The dictionary is full-sized, but lightweight and aesthetically pleasing. More than 6,000 terms are bolded in an attractive Wedgwood blue, facilitating term-finding, because they are demarcated from their respective definitions. Although this dictionary contains terminology used often by ophthalmologists, optometrists, technicians, researchers, and everyone who has some knowledge of how of the eye works, this book will be most useful to the vision neophyte, especially students of optometry, ophthalmology, or vision science. This is not to detract from the benefits that can be gained by anyone using this dictionary, because there is such an abundance of terms and topics covered that I am certain that we would be hard-pressed to discover a person from one discipline who would be familiar with them all. For example, a clinician might only have a vague impression of the instruments used in vision research, and we certainly would not expect a researcher to be intimately familiar with the spectrum of eye conditions. Anyone would be able to augment their knowledge of the eye in one capacity or another. With that said, let’s delve into Dictionary of Ophthalmology. FIGUREFigureThe contents of the dictionary are organized in a rational order. It begins with a list of abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols that are utilized within the book, which nicely correlates to conventions to which most of us are used to. Next is a list of common prefixes and suffixes and their meanings, followed by examples of such. The authors have also included a short-list of some common terms found in this dictionary and their respective Greek and Latin origins, which I found highly interesting. What follows is a descriptive list of tables and their corresponding page numbers. Indeed, the 70 tables that were interspersed throughout the dictionary are nicely arranged in a non-complicated manner, and they would have been beneficial to me when preparing for Part I of the NBEO exams. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that there were many key formulas included, and these also would have been an invaluable tool for studying. My only complaint with regard to this is that it would have been convenient if the formulas had been referenced to page numbers as well. Both the color and black and white photographs used to showcase abnormal conditions of the eye were extremely helpful, and the diagrams used to illustrate concepts were simple and excellent. The familiar adage, a picture is worth a thousand words, is appropriate here because the pictures served to enhance my appreciation for the word or condition in question. One complaint about the dictionary though, is that after adapting to its convention of locating many definitions described by the term’s noun followed by its adjective (as in Spanish), such as “pupil, Argyll Robertson” or “palsy, cerebral,” I was somewhat confused to find that the definition for “palsy, Bell’s” was actually under “Bell’s palsy.” To be fair, the terms are cross-referenced to each other and truthfully, the information that one can get out of it more than makes up for any inconvenience. One of the advantages of this dictionary is that it is in fact a dictionary. The dictionary is probably one of the earliest reference books we have ever been taught to use, and thus most everyone is familiar with its format. I can recall my mother’s well-intentioned suggestion that I read Webster’s dictionary to increase my vocabulary so as to score well on standardized tests. However, I remember more clearly my rebuff to such a recommendation, because I believed the idea to be silly and unfeasible. Never did I imagine that I would one day not only sit down and peruse through a dictionary, but would actually enjoy it as well! As I flipped through the pages of the Dictionary of Ophthalmology, I found myself drifting back to classes in optics, anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, systemic disease, and others. I have pleasantly discovered that much of what was imbibed from professors throughout the years has not been erased from memory, and this dictionary was also useful in introducing me to terms of which I was previously unaware. For example, some drug names used in the United States are favored by a different synonym in the United Kingdom. In addition, although definitions are placed with their American spellings throughout the dictionary, their British equivalents are also noted. I also found that the cross-references to other terms were helpful if I wanted to explore a subject further. Of course, I would not expect that many would actually attempt to read a dictionary, and the best thing about it is that I could obtain a definition for a term that I had never heard of before or a term that I had forgotten about quite quickly, serving as a preliminary place in which to research the topic even further. This would be advantageous for students or clinicians in a hurry to obtain a brief overview. This eye-related dictionary is an excellent reference guide packed with much information and belongs on everyone’s bookshelf. It complements the student’s and the professional’s library well. While it may supply comprehensive definitions, provide wonderful diagrams and photographs, and offer appropriate clinical advice, this dictionary cannot cover any topic of interest comprehensively. There are just too many terms to be able to elaborate within its 316 pages. Nonetheless, the dictionary serves its purpose well: to simply define.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006324-200307000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2092052241", "source": "openalex"}

We had invisible AI in our lives for decades, but several recently introduced tools have provided us with ready access to AI, and the ability to interact with and get the response from it in the language that we are accustomed to. Recently introduced ChatGPT by OpenAI[1] has caused great drama and excitement in the AI space. Other open access free or paid interactive AI tools such as Microsoft Bing AI, Google Bard AI, Perplexity AI, Jasper Chat, Chatsonic, Pi, GitHub Copilot X, Amazon Codewhisperer[2] have added to the variety. The AI floodgates are now open, the genie is out of the bottle, and life will never be the same. AI Tools – Illuminating Ophthalmology's Path to Precision \"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.\" - Stephen Hawking The marriage of medicine with AI tools has ushered in a new era of endless possibilities. The transformative impact of these technologies on patient care and research is exemplified by their ability to provide information, facilitate diagnosis, and support healthcare professionals. Ophthalmology, being an image-based specialty, AI has a predominant role to play. As we delve into this convergence, we uncover a landscape where the AI tools could seamlessly coalesce with the existing systems, augment human expertise and propel ophthalmology into uncharted territories. There are several useful AI tools that have been specifically developed for applications in ophthalmology: Fundus Image Analysis: AI algorithms can analyse fundus images to detect and diagnose diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity. These algorithms can help automate the screening process, prioritize high-risk cases, and assist ophthalmologists in providing timely and accurate diagnoses. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): AI algorithms can analyse OCT images to identify and quantify structural abnormalities, track disease progression, and assist in diagnosing conditions such as macular oedema, AMD, and glaucoma. Automated Refraction: AI-powered devices can perform automated refraction, use machine learning algorithms to analyse wavefront measurements, and provide accurate and objective results. Virtual Assistants and Chatbots: AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots can provide information, answer questions, and assist patients and healthcare professionals in various tasks. These tools can help with symptom assessment, provide educational resources, offer guidance on medication usage, and schedule appointments. Surgical Planning and Guidance: AI algorithms can analyse preoperative data and images to assist surgeons in planning ophthalmic surgeries. They can provide insights into optimal incision placement, lens selection, and other important considerations. During surgery, AI tools can provide real-time guidance, aiding surgeons in performing procedures with greater precision and accuracy. Disease Progression Prediction: AI models trained on longitudinal patient data can help predict the progression of eye diseases, such as glaucoma or AMD.

It was trained on over 570 GB of data, including web pages, books, and other sources of knowledge. It has generated tremendous interest in AI, garnered over 100 million users in less than 6 months surpassing Google+ (which took over a year to reach that milestone), and has spawned hundreds of easy-to-use applications.[3] ChatGPT is emerging as a possible game-changer. Its potential as an information resource is immense. Beyond information dissemination, ChatGPT's role in symptom assessment and triage is crucial. Here are some specific ways ChatGPT can be beneficial: Information and Education: ChatGPT can provide general information about eye anatomy, common eye conditions, diagnostic procedures, and treatment options. It can help patients and healthcare professionals understand various eye-related topics and provide educational resources. Symptom Assessment: ChatGPT can assist in evaluating symptoms and providing preliminary guidance. Users can describe their eye-related concerns, and ChatGPT can ask relevant questions to gather information and offer possible explanations or next steps. Patient Triage: In certain scenarios, ChatGPT can assist in triaging patients by asking questions about their symptoms and guiding them toward appropriate care. It can help identify urgent cases that require immediate attention and provide guidance on whether the patient should seek emergency care or schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Medication Information: ChatGPT can provide information on various eye medications, including their uses, dosages, and potential side effects. Lifestyle Recommendations: ChatGPT can offer general advice on maintaining good eye health, including recommendations for proper nutrition, eye hygiene, eye protection, and strategies for reducing eye strain from digital devices. Preoperative and Postoperative Support: ChatGPT can provide information and answer common questions related to ophthalmic surgeries, such as cataract surgery, LASIK, or retinal procedures. It can offer guidance on preoperative preparations, postoperative care, and recovery timelines. Apart from its evident potential utilities in patient care, ChatGPT can be utilized in research in ophthalmology in several valuable ways: Data Analysis and Mining: ChatGPT can assist in analysing large volumes of textual data related to ophthalmic research. Researchers can use ChatGPT to extract and summarize key information from scientific articles, clinical trial reports, electronic health records, and other relevant sources. This can help in identifying patterns, trends, and associations within the data, enabling researchers to gain insights and support their investigations. Literature Review and Knowledge Synthesis: ChatGPT can aid researchers in conducting literature reviews by providing summaries of existing research articles, identifying knowledge gaps, and suggesting potential areas for further exploration. Researchers can interact with ChatGPT to ask specific questions related to their research interests, and it can help in synthesizing relevant information from the existing literature. Hypothesis Generation and Exploration: ChatGPT can be a useful tool for brainstorming and generating new research ideas. Researchers can engage with ChatGPT to discuss their hypotheses, explore alternative explanations, and refine their research questions. ChatGPT's ability to generate diverse responses can assist in stimulating creative thinking and identifying novel perspectives in ophthalmic research. Collaboration and Peer Review: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among researchers by providing a virtual platform for exchanging ideas, discussing methodologies, and seeking feedback. Researchers can use ChatGPT to engage in scientific discussions, present their findings, and receive input from their peers. This can help improve the quality of research projects and foster a collaborative environment within the field of ophthalmology. Patient and Public Engagement: ChatGPT can be leveraged to engage with patients and the public in ophthalmic research. It can help researchers gather information on patient experiences, preferences, and perspectives through interactive conversations. ChatGPT can also provide educational resources and answer questions about ongoing research studies, informed consent, and the potential impact of research findings on patient care. Ethical Considerations and Guidance: ChatGPT can support researchers in navigating ethical considerations related to ophthalmic research. It can provide information on research ethics, data privacy, and informed consent. Researchers can interact with ChatGPT to discuss ethical dilemmas, explore different viewpoints, and seek guidance on conducting research in a responsible and ethical manner. How Smart is Smart? Testing ChatGPT \"We should take care not to make the intellect our goal; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.\" - Albert Einstein The efficacy and reliability of ChatGPT in performing several tasks related to ophthalmology are being anxiously explored. Its ability to search references, write an academic article, format operating notes and discharge summaries, provide patient information, answer curriculum-based examinations etc., have been tested.[4–14] Valentín-Bravo et al.[6] used ChatGPT to generate an abstract and a structured article, title and references on the topic silicone oil in vitreoretinal surgery. The authors concluded that despite the knowledge demonstrated ChatGPT, the scientific accuracy and reliability on specific topics is currently insufficient for the automatic generation of scientifically rigorous articles. Mihalache et al.[11] have recently tested ChatGPT's ability to answer practice questions for board certification in ophthalmology and found that it could answer about 46-58% of questions correctly - encouraging, but not good enough yet. While its ability to write robust academic articles is still rudimentary at best, the ethical aspects of using ChatGPT in academics are already being fervently questioned, and rightly so.[14] Guidelines and ethical boundaries need to be established to define the exact role of AI tools in abstract and manuscript preparation. At this point in time, it is considered inappropriate to use ChatGPT or any such AI tool to generate scientific abstracts and complete academic articles. There are tools to detect AI-generated text and extensive use of such text may a justification for manuscript rejection. A major disadvantage of ChatGPT is that it has been trained only until September 2021. However, updates are being released and it will hopefully become up-to-date. I entered into a prolonged conversation with ChatGPT on a diverse range of topics related to ophthalmology (see box). Robust information that it provides, dexterity in providing straight answers to convoluted questions, advanced language skills, and the ability to compose creative poems on mere prompts are mind-boggling. Conclusion \"These little grey cells. It is up to them.\"- Agatha Christie AI is all-pervasive and has already deeply permeated several aspects of medical care. AI tools are expected to play an increasingly significant role in revolutionizing ophthalmic care. Its potential beneficial role in improving accuracy in diagnostics, optimizing workflows, building effective patient education and counselling methodologies, establishing optimal patient triage and management pathways, improving safety and precision in surgery, and in fact, revolutionising the entire patient care ecosystem is undeniable. AI tools and intelligent automation can augment the capabilities of ophthalmologists by providing a third hand, a watchful eye, an attentive ear, a tireless brain with an unlimited storage capacity, and in all, an uncompromising ability to minimise errors and optimise patient care. Recently introduced natural language interactive AI tools such as ChatGPT have provided us with a peep window to the AI world. It is for us to explore the endless possibilities to the fullest and build synergy between the mind and the machine for the good of all. \"Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.\" - John Dewey", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1478_23", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4380685324", "source": "openalex"}

Twenty-eight children had known genetic defects. The children underwent an ophthalmological examination, including visual acuity (VA), eye motility, refraction, slit lamp examination, ophthalmoscopy and a full-field electroretinogram (ff-ERG). Seventeen children were available for follow-up over a mean time of 5.4 years (range: 0.3-14.8 years). The results of these children were compared with an age- and sex-matched reference group of healthy children (n = 119).Altogether 36/44 of the children (82%) had ophthalmological abnormalities. The most common findings were refractive errors (n = 16/25), low VA (n = 9/36), strabismus (n = 8/42), reduced eye motility (n = 8/40), optic atrophy (n = 7/41), retinal pigmentation (n = 6/40) and nystagmus (n = 6/42). Several ophthalmological manifestations appeared over time. In 5/22 children, ff-ERG showed retinal dystrophy. No significant correlation between phenotype and genotype was found. The children with LS had significantly lower VA (p < 0.0001, Mantel-Haenszel chi-square exact test), more astigmatism (p = 0.012, Fisher's exact test) and higher incidence of strabismus (p = 0.0002) compared to controls at follow-up.In this unique cohort of children with LS, the vast majority showed ophthalmological findings at diagnosis, which increased over time.

This past decade have seen several genes associated with the disease. Variants in five genes have been confirmed to play a major role. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether genes influence treatment response to ranibizumab for neovascular AMD. The hypothesis was that an individual's genetic variation will determine treatment response.The study was a two-site prospective open-label observational study of patients newly diagnosed with exudative (neovascular) AMD receiving intravitreal ranibizumab therapy. Treatment-naïve patients were enrolled at presentation and received monthly \"as needed\" therapy. Clinical data was collected monthly and DNA extracted. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina (San Diego, California) 660-Quad single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Regression analyses were performed to identify SNPs associated with treatment-response end points.Sixty-five patients were enrolled. No serious adverse events were recorded. The primary outcome measure was change in ETDRS visual acuity at 12 months. A SNP in the CFH gene was found to be associated with less improvement in visual acuity while receiving ranibizumab therapy. The C3 gene, among others, was associated with reduced thickening and improved retinal architecture. VEGFA, FLT1, and CFH were associated with requiring fewer ranibizumab injections over the 12-month study.This study is one of the first prospective pharmacogenetic study of intravitreal ranibizumab.

All applications were divided into seven subspecialties; dry eye, strabismus and amblyopia, macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and general ophthalmology. Subsequently, number of downloads, average patient rating, year of release and source of clinical information provided in the application were collected. Furthermore, in order to evaluate whether development of software responds to epidemiological demand, number of applications in each subspecialty was correlated with the prevalence of particular diseases.ResultsFifty‐six applications that met established criteria were found. The overall number of downloads was estimated at the level of 1.5-million, whereas the weighted average rating for all applications was 4.21/5. The number of applications by subspecialty did not correlate with the prevalence of particular eye disorder. The dry eye was the most frequently downloaded and best rated subspecialty.ConclusionsThe overall number of patient‐oriented applications in ophthalmology is low. Subspecialties are not equally equipped with patient‐oriented mobile solutions. Furthermore, the number of applications or downloads in each subspecialty does not correlate with the number of potential users such as patients with particular eye disorders.

The authors aimed to get insight into the time required for articles to be accepted and released online in high-impacted ophthalmology journals. Methods: Comprehensive review of all original articles published by eight ophthalmology journals during a one-year period was performed for 2020 and 2005. Time taken from submission to acceptance and the first online release of the article was abstracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 3110 articles were reviewed. In 2020, the overall median time from submission to acceptance (AT) was 119 days (IQR 83-168) and 30 days (10-71) from acceptance to the first online release of the article (OP). AT increased by 7.3% from 2005 to 2020, whereas OP reduced by 73%. Publications, which the corresponding author was affiliated with US-located institution had shorter both AT and OP in 2005 and 2020. The author’s specialty in ophthalmology had an inconclusive impact on AT and OP. Papers with multiple affiliated institutions had shorter AT and OP in both 2005 and 2020; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that increasing pressure on authors, editors, and reviewers to publish articles and journals with high impact factor (IF) significantly influenced publication times in ophthalmology journals. Inflation of research papers was associated with rising AT time. A significant decrease in OP time was potentially explained by the editor’s demand to achieve decent journal IF.

This research reveals how Aravind Eye Care System in southern India and Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology in Nepal are addressing “undone science” for avoidable blindness. They are creating the requisite local hospital and personnel infrastructure while conducting “civil society research.” They are also providing high quality modern care to low-income patients of the global south while charging reduced or no fees. This paper argues that they represent a third model in the appropriate technology movement—contextually appropriate local production of high technology. This third model focuses on socially responsible innovation for purposes of social improvement; it is rooted in nonprofit, social enterprise organizations to include the following four aspects: (1) scientific innovation or the “appropriation” of new science; (2) organizational innovation, including changes in operations management for self-sufficiency through multiple revenue streams; (3) technological innovation or the creation of new products and artifacts; and (4) an underlying ideological orientation that is based on local philosophy (and challenges hegemonic understandings of postcolonial dependency or neoliberalism).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1163/15691497-12341267", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2024378104", "source": "openalex"}

This study aims to explore the impact of the pandemic on the use of tele-ophthalmology in the Philippines. Methodology: A 30-item online survey on practices and attitudes related to tele-ophthalmology was sent to ophthalmologists and ophthalmologists-in-training all over the Philippines. Results: A total of 327 local ophthalmologists responded to the anonymous survey. Reported use of tele-ophthalmology increased from 53% to 90% ( P < 0.001) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media messaging was the most employed modality, utilized by 8 out of 10 tele-ophthalmology users. Respondents reported confidence in diagnosing gross conditions of the eye, and lack of confidence in diagnosing posterior pole conditions and orbital fractures. The majority (84%) believe that it can be adopted on a wider scale in the upcoming years. Conclusion: The pandemic catalyzed a nationwide increase in the utilization of tele-ophthalmology. The majority of respondents expressed willingness to continue incorporating tele-ophthalmology in their practice after the pandemic.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W117814564", "title": "Diagnostic Atlas of Veterinary Ophthalmology", "text": "This 2nd edition is a hardbound atlas featuring more than 700 color photographs of common ocular conditions in both small animal (mainly dogs and cats) and, to a lesser extent, large animal (mainly horses) species. The atlas is organized into 12 chapters that focus on specific anatomical structures of the eye including globe and orbit (Chapter 1), ocular adnexa (Chapters 2–5), cornea, uvea, lens, vitreous, fundus, and optic nerve. In addition, Chapter 8 covers the glaucomas and presenting clinical signs involving the aqueous humor, namely hypopyon and hyphema. The color photographs are generally of outstanding quality. In most cases, the photographs clearly highlight key ocular conditions. In rare instances, a photograph could have benefited from the use an asterisk or other demarcation to more clearly identify the abnormality for the reader. Despite the more than 700 photographs, only 2 figures are noted to contain incorrect corresponding figure legends (Figure 9.89, page 122; Figure 11.177, page 184). In addition to ocular abnormalities, there are several photographs that highlight anatomically normal ocular variants. For example, there are 8 fundic photographs that document the various color changes that occur with maturation of the tapetum lucidum in puppies. Another significant strength of this veterinary atlas is it routinely contains more than 1 photograph to depict a given ocular abnormality thereby permitting the reader to glean important information regarding variations in presenting clinical signs for each condition. For instance, in Chapter 9: Lens, there are more than 75 photographs of canine cataracts to depict the different stages of development of cataracts and/or their etiologies. Throughout the atlas, the corresponding figure legends provide breed and age details for each image with frequent comments as to whether the ocular state is common or uncommon in that given breed. Another helpful feature is that the figure legends make reference, by figure number, to other photographs that the reader should consult when dealing with an ocular condition that shares similar features with another. For example, in the case of micropapilla, the reader is referred to images of optic nerve hypoplasia. These features, in addition to 1) the many tables depicting differential diagnoses, and characteristic clinical signs and/or breeds affected with a condition, 2) the “Introduction” at the beginning of each chapter that focuses on the main presenting clinical signs for that ocular anatomic structure or condition, and 3) the concise, yet informative, sections of text individually covering relevant clinical conditions within each chapter, make this atlas a very user-friendly diagnostic tool to ocular disease in our veterinary species. In comparison to the 1st edition, A Colour Atlas of Veterinary Ophthalmology, published by Wolfe in 1990, which was, according to the author, “little more than a collection of favourite photographs,” this 2nd edition is true to its new title in that it contains text and tables, in addition to more photographs, to facilitate diagnosis. The author has definitely fulfilled his objective in that this atlas provides “a valuable pictorial resource for clinicians” with key text and tables that assist the attending veterinarian and/or veterinary student in establishing an accurate ocular diagnosis, following which, a comprehensive veterinary ophthalmology textbook could be consulted to gain detailed information regarding therapeutic options and prognosis.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W117814564", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2085386075", "title": "The history of the Ophthalmological Society of Copenhagen 1900–50", "text": "One hundred years have passed since the Danish ophthalmologists established the first Danish Ophthalmological Society in Copenhagen. The time was ripe for this. The University of Copenhagen had been established for more than 400 years (in 1479), and the development had come a long way since the royal weigher and measurer in Malmö, Henrick Smid, wrote his book on home medical advice about epidemics and diseases of the eye (Smid 1557a): … Among all epidemics and diseases, none are so obscure to them (the surgeons) as the injuries and defects of the eye/ Because they are so strangely created by God,/ many learned physicians write about them/ in such a way that their injuries and defects cannot well be scrutinized and described. Smid's Danish text, dated 1557, is as shown in Fig. 1. The Danish text from Henrick Smid (Smid 1557b) (from Norrie 1925, p. 1). With regard to the period from 1850 to 1900, I will follow to a considerable extent the Danish ophthalmologist and skilled historian Gordon Norrie (1855–1941) (Norrie 1925) (Fig. 2). Norrie had known personally many of the Danish ophthalmologists of that time. Gordon Norrie (photograph from Lottrup-Andersen 1952, p. 122). From 1900 onwards, I report abstracts from the proceedings of the Danish Ophthalmological Society in Copenhagen, and additionally from 1923, from Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica. Moreover, abstracts from the detailed and vivid portrayal of the first 50 years of the Society by Lottrup-Andersen (abbreviated Lottrup) are included. With regard to the time around 1950, I have added a few personal memories. They are, of course, characterized considerably by my personal opinion of people and events. A short review of the history of Danish ophthalmology from 1850 to the turn of the century will show how quickly the development progressed. The first practical eye speculum (ophthalmoscope) was constructed by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) in 1850 and made public in 1851 (Helmholtz 1851) (Fig. 3). The invention set off a revolution in the study of the interior of the eye. It is probably the greatest advance in the history of ophthalmology. (For details of previous attempts, see Norn, this Supplement, p. 33.) Hermann von Helmholtz' speculum 1851 (from Norn 1993, p. 404). As early as in 1852, the Danish ophthalmologist Georg Carl Heinrich Lehmann (1815–1890) gave a talk to the Royal Medical Society on the use of the eye speculum. In the same year, the first two eye clinics in Copenhagen were opened by Heinrich Lehmann and Nathan Gerson Melchior (1811–1872). One would imagine that such a brilliant and valuable invention as the eye speculum would be well received, even outside ophthalmological circles. Not so! While Danish ophthalmologists picked up the invention very rapidly, a pronounced scepticism, not to say violent resistance to the method, was aroused in the clan of physicians in Copenhagen. The surgeon, Professor Matthias Saxtorph Jr (1822–1900), mocked the use of the eye speculum in Bibliotek f. Læger in 1855 with terms such as 'rage of invention' and 'charlatanism'. Not very gentle or deliberate terms from a professor of surgery at the University of Copenhagen! The establishment of the first two eye clinics in Copenhagen also caused strong resistance, among others from Surgeon Commander Michael Djørup (1803–1876). In a pamphlet published 6 years after Helmholtz's invention, he spoke of 'the mania for eye diseases' (Norrie 1925, pp. 155–167). Such is the fate of pioneers! Melchior took the initiative in establishing the Royal Institute for the Blind in 1858. Thereby he originated the idea that the Danish State take over the education of the blind from the older private 'Royal' Institute for the Blind dating from 1811, which had been run by the 'Kjæden' order (Houmøller 1961). 'The old Institute for the Blind had been supported and protected by the Father of the Country, King Frederik the Sixth' (lecture by Melchior et al. 1857, cited in Norrie 1925, pp. 163–165). Shortly after Helmholtz's invention, the dominant figure in Danish ophthalmology for many years, Edmund Hansen (Grut) 1831–1907 (Fig. 4) took a doctor's degree in Copenhagen in 1857 with a thesis on the practical use of the eye speculum. Later he adopted his mother's name, Grut. He was of an aristocratic family and very wealthy; he had thus been able to afford long journeys abroad. Most important was a long visit to the famous ophthalmologist Albrecht von Graefe (1828–1870) in Berlin (von Graefe was married to the Danish countess Anna von Knuth). Edmund Hansen Grut (from a painting at the Rigshospital, Eye Department, Copenhagen). In 1863, Edmund Hansen (Grut) established a clinic and out-patients department for those suffering from eye diseases at Nørregade. The clinic gave consultations free of charge for poor people (Norrie 1925, p. 170). Grut became the first State-employed Assistant Professor in eye diseases, and from 1888 Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Copenhagen. The clinic moved to Havnegade, where for many years it became a Mecca where almost all Danish ophthalmologists received their training. In 1880 the clinic, which acted as a university clinic, had 19 beds, and about 100 operations for cataract were performed annually. Grut was an imposing, masterful, landowner type, intelligent and also an excellent teacher. Among his assistants were Jannik Bjerrum, Marius Tscherning and Gordon Norrie. An exciting description can be read in Norrie's book (Norrie 1925, pp. 183–189). Jannik Petersen Bjerrum (1851–1920) (Fig. 5), was born into a family of strong Danish sympathies at Skærbæk in Southern Jutland, a Danish area which, after the war in 1864 between Denmark and Germany, became German territory for 56 years (Meyer, ca. 1940). Jannik Petersen Bjerrum (from a painting at the Rigshospital, Eye Department, Copenhagen). He studied in Ribe (to the north of the frontier), and later in Copenhagen, and in that way became bilingual. Many of his scientific papers were printed in German international journals. Consequently they rapidly became known in foreign countries, unlike most Danish scientific papers. Bjerrum's studies in campimetry published in 1889 also became known rapidly in Great Britain (Bjerrum 1889). Grut's wife was English-born, and a young relation of hers visited Bjerrum's eye clinic to study campimetry. He later became the well-known ophthalmologist Berry. His young associates in Edinburgh, Sinclair and Traquair, also came to Copenhagen to study with Bjerrum, who had become world-famous as the founder of campimetry in describing, inter alia, the arcuate scotoma in glaucoma during his careful examinations of perimetry (Fig. 6). Both Traquair and Sinclair continued in the Bjerrum tradition, and both also became world-famous (Fig. 7) (Duke-Elder 1971). Traquair (1875–1954) writes in the preface to his book An Introduction to Clinical Perimetry, 1st edition: Bjerrum's arcuate scotoma (from Ehlers 1966). Harry Moss Traquair (photograph from Duke-Elder 1971, p. 12). The procedure described is essentially the method of Bjerrum, who discovered, more than 30 years ago, that he could obtain more information by using the back of his consulting-room door than he could from the ordinary perimeter. Originally directed to the study of glaucoma, the principle of Bjerrum's method has been extensively applied by Roenne, at the present time the chief exponent of quantitative perimetry, who has demonstrated its advantages in the examination of all conditions in which perimetry is useful, and who introduced the term 'quantitative' to indicate its analytic nature… (Traquair 1927). Bjerrum himself spoke very modestly about his discovery. 'I had no idea of its existence'. Traquair, Duke-Elder (1962) and Holger Ehlers (1966) mention that Bjerrum's original equipment was the brown-painted double-door between his office and his private flat. The door gave a dark background of about 2 × 2 m. Ehlers wrote: 'It was with a door like this as a background, a few pencil marks and bits of paper that he discovered and studied the arcuate scotomas. No more is needed for one who is endowed with the gift of the scientist'; and Ehlers added: When now, three-quarters of a century later, we try to evaluate the importance of the discovery of the arcuate scotoma to the ophthalmologists of those times, we must remember that they were not only without the help rendered by neurosurgery in cases of visual-field disturbances, but even with local diseases of the eye they had to do without the tonometer, slit lamp, gonioscope, etc. Insidious serous iritis, incipient tabetic atrophy, vascular diseases of the disc, and even an incipient cataract might be difficult to distinguish from incipient glaucoma. Finding a sign characteristic of the glaucomatous process, though only a small sign, was a great thing – a gift to ophthalmology (Ehlers 1966). Bjerrum had established an international school at a very high scientific level with, among others, Traquair and Sinclair, and in Denmark with Henning Rønne – a golden age for Danish ophthalmology. An annual Bjerrum lecture in Copenhagen in honour of Jannik Bjerrum has been instituted and was held for the first time in 1965 with Professor, Dr. med. Torstein Bertelsen of Bergen in Norway as guest speaker. Danish ophthalmology also flourished in other fields. No fewer than 17 ophthalmological theses saw the light of day between 1835 and 1900. Impressive, in view of the very low number of doctors treating diseases of the eye at that time. In 1900, Danish ophthalmologists found that the time had come to establish a Danish Ophthalmological Society. The initiative came from the young ophthalmologist K.K.K. Lundsgaard (1867–1931) (Fig. 8), and a notice of meeting was sent out on 5 September. The letter was signed: K.K.K. Lundsgaard, Edm. Jensen, J. Bjerrum. K.K.K. Lundsgaard (from a painting at the Rigshospital, Eye Department, Copenhagen). On 19 September, 18 ophthalmologists, all from Copenhagen, met in the room belonging to the Medical Society, kgs. Nytorv 6, mezzanine (see Norn, the Society's archives of the original steel filing cabinet, p. 24). A notion was carried unanimously to establish the Ophthalmological Society of Copenhagen (Det oftalmologiske Selskab i Kjøbenhavn). The inaugural meeting took place on 17 October 1900. In the year to come, rules etc. were to be prepared. Both Lottrup and Holger Ehlers assumed the birthday of the Society to be in 1901, but we follow here the skilled historian Gordon Norrie, who clearly gives 1900 as the year of foundation (Norrie 1925, p. ii). Professor Grut refused to accept the Presidency, pleading his advanced age (70 years), and was promptly elected an honorary member. Professor Jannik Bjerrum was elected as President, and K.K.K. Lundsgaard as Vice-President. From the very first meeting, minutes were prepared (see Norn, the Society's archives). Some very outstanding founders of the Ophthalmological Society of Denmark, Grut and Bjerrum, have already been mentioned. Early on, K.K.K. Lundsgaard demonstrated his brilliant organizing ability. The Nordic Ophthalmological Literary Ring (NOLR) was set up in 1911 on his initiative; but his greatest success was undoubtedly the establishment of Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica in 1923. Of course, Lundsgaard was elected Editor-in-Chief and in 1930 he became President of the International Association of Ophthalmologists. A Lundsgaard medal was instituted in 1931 (Fig. 9) (Norn 1980). The obverse was decorated with two owls wearing spectacles, after a painting from the 1600s by the Dutchman Adriaen Pietersz van de Venne. The symbolism is emphasized by the Dutch inscription at the top of the painting: 'Hoe dienen wy by een'['What a good match we are']. The Lundsgaard Medal 1931. Two owls wearing spectacles (from a painting byAdriaen Pietersz van de Venne). Some years later, a relief of Lundsgaard was mounted on the reverse of the medal. Among the Founder Members was the titular Professor Edmund Zeuthen Jensen (1861–1950), the first of all our Edmund-ophthalmologists (Fig. 10). His description of retino-chorioiditis juxtapapillaris with vision field defect entered history in 1908 as 'Jensen's disease'. However, 6 years later he discarded the surname Jensen. Thus Jensen and Edmund did not follow each other in attaining world-wide fame. Edmund Zeuthen Jensen (photograph from Jens Edmund). Another very forceful Founder was C.F. Heerfordt (1871–1953) (Fig. 11). He became most known internationally for his scientific paper 'Febris uveo-parotidea subchronica …' in 1909, later called Heerfordt's syndrome. The annals of the Danish Medical Association have covered him in glory as Founder of the Association of Younger Doctors. A painting of Heerfordt by Knud Erik Larsen is in the Medical-historical Museum in Copenhagen. C.F. Heerfordt (drawing by Carl Jensen in Klods Hans 1908). Heerfordt threw himself ardently into the problems of glaucoma, and adhered obstinately to his opinion that flaps in the vortex veins were the cause of haemorrhagic glaucoma. Resistance to his theories continued to increase. Worst of all were his press announcements claiming that he had found the true cause of glaucoma, illustrated by a photo of himself! It ended in disaster. At an Extraordinary General Meeting in September 1912 all members of the Ophthalmological Society present resolved that they found his theory of the cause of glaucoma of no importance. They would no longer listen to his theories. After some weeks of discussion in the Society, Chairman Lundsgaard stopped the quarrel (, pp. 1196 and 1414). From that day onwards Heerfordt never set foot in the Society; but, characteristically of his Gallic temperament, he never resigned. Admittedly, Heerfordt must have seemed exhausting and irritating, but it appears to both Holger Ehlers (1977) and to me (Andersen 1984) that it was a hard decision and reveals an amazing discord at that time among Danish ophthalmologists. I had been Heerfordt's assistant in his office for 5 years, and I valued his intelligent and strange personality, not least his far-seeing thoughts and publications about the establishment of 'The United States of the European Nations' (Andersen 1984). Denmark's first female ophthalmologist, Estrid Hein (1873–1956) (Fig. 12), was among the Founder Members of the Ophthalmological Society. She was the mother of Piet Hein, and thus a kind of grandmother to his famous 'Grooks'; but she was more than that. Besides having a private eye clinic she was one of the members of the Executive Committee of the Royal Institute for the Blind and Director of the National Society for the Prevention of Cancer. Estrid Hein (photograph from Ögonläkarmötet Stockholm, 1900). The first conference was held in Stockholm in June 1900; subsequently in Copenhagen in 1903, 1907 in Oslo, 1911 in Helsinki, 1931 in Stockholm; and since then approximately every third year until 1938. They ceased during the Second World War and were revived in 1947 in Oslo. During the early years of the Society, the number of members was about 20 and slowly increasing. About a dozen members, most of them from Copenhagen, attended the meetings. The room at Kgs. Nytorv belonging to the Medical Society could accommodate them easily. It presented no problem to demonstrate patients and instruments. (For discussion about instruments, see Norn, this Supplement, p. 31). They had a pleasant time at the meetings, followed by open Danish sandwiches. Rules for the activities of specialists or recognition as a specialist did not exist at that time. The ophthalmological speciality was established in 1918 by the National Health Service, which had been established in Denmark in 1909. Danish ophthalmological research kept the flag flying for many years at a very high international level. Henning Trappaud Rønne (1878–1947) stood out very quickly (Fig. 13). A very fine and warm personal description of Henning Rønne was given by Mogens Fledelius in 1993. Rønne's love of ophthalmology was a burning flame throughout his life. The gold medal treatise in 1904 concerned congenital colour-blindness, a subject of continuing interest for Rønne. His doctoral thesis was a superior clinical and pathological study of alcoholic intoxication amblyopia (Rønne 1910). Rønne became most renowned in the wider world for his description of the 'nasal spring' in glaucoma (Rønne 1908) and for his protracted studies of the visual tracts' architecture (see Mellemgaard, this Supplements, p. 21, Fig. 4). By updating and quantifying the campimetry, he carried the torch further. Unlike Heerfordt, Rønne resigned from the Ophthalmological Society in 1929. He had – quite naturally – felt disappointment at the election of Lundsgaard as Professor of Ophthalmology in 1925. In 1929 Chr. F. Bentzen, and not Rønne, was elected Head of the Eye Department at the Kommunehospital in Copenhagen. Rønne then resigned. A few years later Rønne was elected Professor of Ophthalmology at the Rigshospital following Lundsgaard (see Fig. 20). To his great amusement, Rønne now had to apply for readmission as a member of the Society. He had now to await the ballot of the much younger members of the Society (Fig. 14). 'Henning Rønne at top speed' (drawing by Gustav Østerberg, from Andersen 1988, p 25). Reproduced with permission from the family. Henning Rønne (from a painting at the Rigshospital, Eye Department, Copenhagen). From my student days, I recall Rønne's rather categorical demonstration of 'gentle eye examination of small children'. A deadly frightened little child lay screaming during the whole session, pinned down by the arms of the head nurse, Miss Schroll. On 9 April 1940, the ophthalmologists at the Rigshospital had the following experience: they were summoned by Professor Rønne to a meeting in the library at 11 o'clock: 'We have a serious problem to discuss': all were naturally shocked at the German occupation of Denmark that morning, but they were informed during the meeting that Rønne's problem was the crossing of the visual paths in the chiasm. Rønne ended his long and brilliant career with 'The architecture of the human optic tracts', printed in the Festschrift of the University of Copenhagen (Rønne 1942). In the course of time, eye research in the Nordic countries became more international, particularly as a result of the establishment of Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica in 1923. This was a great leap forward. The Society jumped from a pupal stage to an internationally recognized English-language Scandinavian flagship. In addition to papers, summaries of important speeches and papers from the Ophthalmological Society were delivered. Since 1932, supplements including doctoral theses and other important treatises were also published in Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica. In return, the value of the proceedings in the Danish Ophthalmological Society with their Danish-language minutes diminished, and printing ceased in 1953. In the 1920s the number of members increased steadily. This led to the dominance of talks and lectures at the meetings, which gradually attracted a valuable accession of foreigners, especially from Southern Sweden. One of the most fascinating and charming guests from the other side of the Øresund belt was Professor Fritz Ask of Lund (Fig. 15). Fritz Ask was a weighty figure, both mentally and physically. He became a very inspirational guest and friend, with his great experience and humour. Lottrup-Andersen recounts that after a session in Copenhagen he had very great difficulty in pressing Ask's enormous bulk through the door of the cab. Ask cried out: 'I feel as if I should reenter my mother's body and be born again!' (Lottrup-Andersen 1952, p. 159). Fritz Ask (drawing by O. Antonsson, Sydsvenska Dagbladet Snällposten, from Lottrup-Andersen 1952, p. 207). The most international figure in the society was Danish-born Marius Tscherning (1854–1939) (Fig. 16). He divided his eventful life between Copenhagen and Paris. Tscherning was one of Grut's many brilliant students. In 1882, he had defended a remarkable doctoral thesis in Copenhagen, 'Studies of the ethiology and power of myopia', inspired by Grut. Tscherning had emphasized the great importance of reading to the frequency and power of myopia (Tscherning 1882) – a point of view which, after many years of denunciation, has now again come to the fore. Marius Tscherning (drawing by Leo Schiøtz Christensen, from Fledelius 1993). For about 25 years, from 1884 to 1910, Tscherning had been employed first as directeur adjoint (assistant), later as Director of the Ophthalmological Laboratory at the Sorbonne, the old centre of French science. In 1901 he had succeeded Louis Émile Javal, who had recommended him for the French Legion of Honour – a great international recognition of Tscherning's research. In 1909, the Danish expatriate Marius Tscherning was elected as an honorary member of the Danish Ophthalmological Society. The following year he returned to Denmark as Professor of Ophthalmology at the brand new Rigshospital, unopposed (Fig. 17). 'Tscherning takes the great step from Paris to Copenhagen' (drawing by Lottrup-Andersen 1952, p. 208). (Reproduced with permission from the family.) Next year, the choice for the Nobel Prize lay between Tscherning and the Swede Allvar Gullstrand. Both had worked for years on new designs for spectacle lenses. According to Tscherning's memoirs (Tscherning 1940), he had sketched his designs during a discussion at an international meeting in Utrecht in 1899, where Gullstrand was also present. Tscherning later produced a box of lenses made for himself according to his own calculations by the firm Benoist et Berthiot in Paris; but Tscherning did not publish his work. In a later book, published by Firma (and cited by Tscherning, 1940), 'the principle of Gullstrand' was praised to the skies. Tscherning protested and the Zeiss firm admitted the fault, but in scarcely comprehensible language. Meanwhile, Gullstrand received the Nobel Prize in 1911, and the Zeiss factories introduced the new lenses under the name of punctual lenses, which went from strength to strength all over the world. The curved lenses gained a foothold everywhere. The firm of Zeiss had more than once declared the problem solved correctly, before they got a grip on it (Tscherning 1940). Why Zeiss, and not a French factory? Tscherning admits that Zeiss was probably the only firm which had the prestige and courage to go through with the reform. Tscherning adds: 'Zeiss received, what was undoubtedly a bargain, Gullstrand received the Nobel Prize, and I – received the satisfaction of seeing my invention accepted all over the world.' and Gullstrand was silent, and remained silent! A judgement is difficult so many years after the event. I agree only partly with Poul Kjer (1993) and Mogens Norn (1995). They feel that Tscherning should without doubt have been given the prize. In my opinion Tscherning had probably deserved the prize; and Tscherning's moving and gentle report is touching to read. Marius Tscherning continued his research into physiological optics contemporaneously with his activities as a professor (Fig. 18).

Kjølbye's many wonderful caricatures (from Lottrup-Andersen 1952, p. 204). (Reproduced with permission from the family.) Even as Professor Emeritus, Marius Tscherning continued his research in the basement under the Eye Department of the Rigshospital, later called 'Tscherning's cellar'. During my appointment as Clinical Assistant at the Eye Department of the Rigshospital at the end of the 1940s, Professor Holger Ehlers set me the task of tidying-up Tscherning's cellar and of registering all the many scientific treasures. It was a difficult job, but both Ehlers and I felt that it was worth while. Many valuable instruments saw the light of day, including Tscherning's reconstruction of the brilliant Scottish scientist and doctor Thomas Young's ophthalmometer, and the Scotsman Reid's original keratometer. Ehlers and I have often tried these instruments on ourselves. During the removal to the new Rigshospital, these instruments and others seem to have disappeared, as did a large briefcase with all my numerous notes and drawings. However, much has been kept for posterity (Norn 1995). In 1947, the ophthalmologist Erik Godtfredsen wrote a comprehensive survey of all Danish ophthalmological doctoral theses over 112 years, a total of 58 – a great number in proportion to the relatively low number of ophthalmologists at that time. The considerable number of theses within the field of physiological optics (i.e. 15) reflects clearly the inspirational influence of Tscherning. Another frequent subject – retina and the visual tracts, a total of 11 – marks the great importance of Rønne's leadership. Godtfredsen clearly draws our attention to the fact that few of the theses reflect the international reputation of Danish ophthalmology at that time (Godtfredsen 1947). This fame was due rather to others' research studies, e.g. the campimetry by Bjerrum, Tscherning's physiological optics, Edmund Jensen's retino-chorioiditis juxtapapillaris, Heerfordt's studies of febris uveo-parotidea and Rønne's 'nasal step'. In the course of time, up to the Second World War, many advances in treatment and research in international ophthalmology occurred, including in Denmark. As for severe cases of uveitis, however, the only effective treatment was still intramuscular injections of milk, not always harmless. Hospitalization and close observation were always necessary because of the risk of shock (Fig. 19). Lottrup-Andersen performs parenteral injections of milk at the Ophthalmological Department of the Rigshospital (another wonderful drawing by Kjølbye, from Lottrup-Andersen 1952, p. 207). (Reproduced with permission from the family.) Lottrup-Andersen (1877–1959) was an ophthalmologist, a draftsman, a charming after-dinner speaker and author of the comprehensive jubilee publication of the Ophthalmological Society 50 years ago (Lottrup-Andersen 1952). Bovine tuberculosis was still a scourge in Denmark. In 1933 Olaf Blegvad presented 24 cases of human tuberculosis of the eyes in Denmark, four of which turned out to be of bovine type (Blegvad 1933) (Fig. 20). Blegvad urged fighting against this disease, and with good results. In 1959, tuberculosis among cattle was officially declared extinguished in Denmark.

Sympathetic ophthalmia had become much more rare in Denmark after the First World War, but it was still a catastrophe. Salvarsan treatment was able to provide a short feeling of improvement, before the eye became blind. Operative treatment for detachment of the retina began to take shape slowly after Gonin pointed out the importance of treatment of the retinal tear. In Scandinavia, surgery was introduced in 1930 by Sven Larsson (1930); and the first operation in Denmark using this method was carried out by Hans Ulrik Møller in the same year, but without publication. In 1935, Holger Ehlers published a comprehensive paper on the use of Larsson's method in Denmark (Ehlers 1935). In the years following the Second World War, methods were modernized by Gerhard Rønne and particularly by Jens Edmund, the third generation of the Edmund (-Jensen) family. Jens Edmund became an esteemed member of the Gonin Club in 1961, and later President of the Club (1988–92). There was gradual specialization in Danish ophthalmology. Hans Ulrik Møller (1894–1954) had written a gold medal treatise and later a doctoral thesis in the field of dark adaptation, but his main contribution was in neuro-ophthalmology (Møller 1954). As Major Surgeon Commander at the Militærhospital in Copenhagen, he introduced and refined neuro-ophthalmological methods of investigation in Denmark. He was an unusually upright and fine personality, impressing all who were close to him (Fig. 20). The subspeciality of neuro-ophthalmology was carried further and fruitfully so by Børge Lawætz (1904–74) (Fig. 21).

For years, solar eclipses have caused many serious lesions of the eyes, even in 'non-sunny' Denmark. In 1912, 143 cases of scotomas of the eyes occurred after a solar eclipse. A warning from Lundsgaard, Chairman of the Ophthalmologists' Society, to Ritzau's Bureau and to the press had the effect that very few eyes were damaged at the next solar eclipse 2 years later. After a violent solar eclipse in 1945, the numerous eye injuries were summed-up by K. Knudtson (1948). Information about future solar eclipses was followed-up later in a praiseworthy manner by John. Treatment of squint in Denmark was modernized radically in the 1940s by Gerhard Rønne (1912–60), a son of Henning Rønne. In 1950, a clinic for the squint-eyed was established with Gerhard Rønne as its head (Fig. 22). The brilliant orthoptist Eva Rindziunski was responsible for daily examinations and treatment, and in addition she wrote scientific papers together with Gerhard. Over the years, this subspeciality achieved a leading position in Scandinavia (Andersen 1994). Gerhard Rønne (from , p. 71).

Measures of neuro-ophthalmologic (NO) function have the potential to serve as objective aids, but their diagnostic utility is unknown. <h3>Objective</h3> To identify NO measures that accurately differentiate athletes with and without concussion. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study was conducted among athletes with and without concussion who were aged 17 to 22 years between 2016 and 2017. Eye movements and cognitive function were measured a median of 19 days after injury among patients who had an injury meeting the study definition of concussion while playing a sport (retrospectively selected from a concussion clinic), then compared with a control group of participants without concussion (enrolled from 104 noncontact collegiate athlete volunteers without prior head injury). Data analysis was conducted from November 2019 through May 2020. <h3>Exposure</h3> Concussion. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Classification accuracy of clinically important discriminator eye-tracking (ET) metrics. Participants' eye movements were evaluated with a 12-minute ET procedure, yielding 42 metrics related to smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM), saccades, dynamic visual acuity, and reaction time. Clinically important discriminator metrics were defined as those with significantly different group differences and area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROCs) of at least 0.70. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 34 participants with concussions (mean [SD] age, 19.7 [2.4] years; 20 [63%] men) and 54 participants without concussions (mean [SD] age, 20.8 [2.2] years; 31 [57%] men) completed the study. Six ET metrics (ie, simple reaction time, discriminate reaction time, discriminate visual reaction speed, choice visual reaction speed, and reaction time on 2 measures of dynamic visual acuity 2) were found to be clinically important; all were measures of reaction time, and none were related to SPEM. Combined, these 6 metrics had an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80-0.99), a sensitivity of 77.8%, and a specificity of 92.6%. The 6 metrics remained significant on sensitivity testing. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this study, ET measures of slowed visual reaction time had high classification accuracy for concussion. Accurate, objective measures of NO function have the potential to improve concussion recognition and reduce the disability associated with underdiagnosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0599", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3134493333", "source": "openalex"}

An online questionnaire explored opinions about the ophthalmology course regarding three dimensions. Firstly, adequacy in covering essential parts of the specialty; secondly, improvements required; and thirdly, effectiveness. A score (0-21) was calculated, indicating the overall suitability of the ophthalmology course.

To emphasize the importance of preventive ophthalmologic examination and early treatment of ocular disorders. Source of data: A review of published data. Summary of the findings: Vision is one of the most important senses in the normal physical and cognitive development of children. Schoolchildren who were born preterm have impaired visual, motor and cognitive functions when compared to those of children born full term. This is more a consequence of central nervous system immaturity than of localized injuries to ocular and/ or cortical structures. The literature pinpoints retinopathy of prematurity, strabismus and refractive errors as the main ophthalmologic alterations resulting from prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is one of the main causes of preventable blindness in childhood. It is estimated that on average 562 children become blind each year in Brazil, which is a very high socioeconomic cost to result from a treatable disease. Children with visual deficiencies may be helped by programs of early visual stimulation in order to promote their environmental integration. Conclusions: The recommendation is that every preterm newborn weighing less than 1,500 g and/or with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks should be monitored until complete retinal vascularization and that the first examination should be performed between the fourth and sixth weeks of life. We recommend ophthalmologic outpatients follow-up of all preterm newborns until two years of life with examinations twice yearly, and then, annually, in order to prevent amblyopia.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2320667160", "source": "openalex"}

Methods We retrospectively analysed the medical records of patients with CRAO treated in our stroke unit between January 2016 and August 2020. Results During the observational period, 101 patients with CRAO were admitted. We observed an increase in the rate of patients primarily admitted to the stroke unit from 52.2% to 97.4%. In addition, the thrombolysis rate – with thrombolysis performed on an individual basis – rose from 0% to 14.1%, coinciding with the implementation of an in‐hospital management guideline. Almost 60% of all patients presented outside of the 4.5‐h time window for thrombolysis; by far the most common reason not to deliver intravenous thrombolysis in our cohort was a prehospital delay to presentation (58.8%), with 44.4% of patients having consulted a private‐practice ophthalmologist first. A total of 25 (32.5%) of 77 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had accompanying acute ischaemic stroke lesions on diffusion‐weighted MRI of the brain. A possible aetiology of CRAO was identified in 41.4% of patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, cross-sectional study of all hybrid visits scheduled during the year 2020 in a single academic, hospital-based eye clinic in Boston, Massachusetts. All hybrid ophthalmology telemedicine visits completed in the year 2020 by opthalmologists and optometrists were included. Data were analyzed from January to December 2020. Exposures Hybrid telemedicine clinical encounters. Main Outcomes and Measures Four outcome metrics were calculated: (1) need for subsequent procedure visit, (2) medication change, (3) nonurgent, and (4) urgent consultation with another eye clinician. Adverse outcomes were defined as irreversible vision loss and the need for additional in-person evaluation to reach a management decision. Results From April 9 to December 30, 2020, 889 patients (506 female patients [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 62.1 [14.5] years; age range, 13-98 years) completed 940 hybrid visits. The most common visit indications were glaucoma (424 visits [45.1%]) and retinal diseases (499 visits [53.1%]).

The increases in visual acuity and macular volume are encouraging and suggest that the use of BMSC as provided in SCOTS may be a viable approach to treating serpiginous choroidopathy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.191229", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2526649213", "source": "openalex"}

Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is a rapid non-invasive ophthalmic imaging technique that can image small nerve fibers in the cornea and has been utilized to show small nerve fiber loss in patients with diabetic and other neuropathies. CCM has comparable diagnostic utility to intraepidermal nerve fiber density for diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia and amyloid neuropathy and predicts the development of diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, in clinical intervention trials of patients with diabetic and sarcoid neuropathy, corneal nerve regeneration occurs early and precedes an improvement in symptoms and neurophysiology. Corneal nerve fiber loss also occurs and is associated with disease progression in multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and dementia. We conclude that corneal confocal microscopy has good diagnostic and prognostic capability and fulfills the FDA criteria as a surrogate end point for clinical trials in peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpain.2021.725363", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3194667822", "source": "openalex"}

Ocular manifestations associated with psoriasis, particularly artropathic or pustular psoriasis, usually affect men, often during exacerbations of the disease. It has been reported that eye damage tends to occur later compared with cutaneous or joint manifestations, blindness being the most disabling complication. Previous studies have focused on ophthalmic manifestations and identified several etiopathogenic mechanisms. Psoriasis may be associated with eye complications such as lesions of the eyelids, conjunctiva and others, with systemic inflammation being the main contributor. In addition, the treatment used for psoriasis may cause ocular changes. The main ophthalmic manifestations associated with psoriasis are keratoconjunctivitis sicca, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and uveitis. The treatment of uveitis, perceived as one of the most serious eye conditions, is controversial and has yet to be clearly determined. Thus, the aim of the present review was to emphasize the importance of regular eye examination for patients with psoriasis, either those receiving biological treatment or those not receiving treatment, in order to diagnose and manage the disease appropriately.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10413", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3178624959", "source": "openalex"}

Reporting gender and race and ethnicity in healthcare studies is currently recommended by National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines to ensure representativeness and generalisability; however, CT results that include this information have been limited in the past 30 years. The objective of this review is to analyse the sociodemographic disparities in ophthalmological phases III and IV CT based on publicly available data. Methods This study included phases III and IV complete ophthalmological CT available from clinicaltrials.org , and describes the country distribution, race and ethnicity description and gender, and funding characteristics. Results After a screening process, we included 654 CTs, with findings that corroborate the previous CT reviews’ findings that most ophthalmological participants are white and from high-income countries. A description of race and ethnicity is reported in 37.1% of studies but less frequently included within the most studied ophthalmological specialty area (cornea, retina, glaucoma and cataracts). The incidence of race and ethnicity reporting has improved during the past 7 years. Discussion Although NIH and FDA promote guidelines to improve generalisability in healthcare studies, the inclusion of race and ethnicity in publications and diverse participants in ophthalmological CT is still limited. Actions from the research community and related stakeholders are necessary to increase representativeness and guarantee generalisability in ophthalmological research results to optimise care and reduce related healthcare disparities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjophth-2022-001175", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4321639027", "source": "openalex"}

As diagnoses coding corresponding to the International Classification of Diseases Version 10 (ICD-10) is mandatory for billing reasons in Germany, we analyzed whether a change occurred in the diversity and number of diagnoses after the EHR introduction. The number of patients was also analyzed. Proper diagnoses coding is of the utmost importance for further data analysis or billing. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) were created by using Advanced Business Application Programming language in EHR “i.s.h.med.” Development of an EHR was conducted in close collaboration between physicians and software engineers. ICD-10 coding was implemented by using a “hit list” and a search engine for diagnoses. An observational analysis of a 6-month period prior to and after the introduction of an ophthalmological specific EHR was conducted by investigating the diversity and number of diagnoses in various ophthalmological disease categories and the number of patient consultations. During the introduction of a specific ophthalmological EHR, we observed a significant increase in the emergency department cases (323.9 vs. 359.9 cases per week), possibly related to documentation requirements. The number of scheduled outpatients didn’t change significantly (355.12 vs. 360.24 cases per week). The variety of diagnoses also changed: on average, 156.2 different diagnoses were made per week throughout our hospital before the EHR launch, compared to 186.8 different diagnoses per week thereafter (p < 0.05). Additionally, a significantly higher number of diagnoses per case and per week were observed in both emergency and subspecialty outpatient clinics (1.15 vs. 1.22 and 1.10 vs. 1.47, respectively). An optimized EHR was created for ophthalmological needs and for simplified ICD-10 coding. The implementation of digital patient recording increased the diversity of the diagnoses used per case as well as the number of diagnoses coded per case. A general limitation to date is the suboptimal precision of ICD-10 coding in ophthalmology. Correct coding is of utmost importance for future data analysis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-016-0340-1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2486450071", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2051548879", "title": "Automated Suprathreshold Static Periumetry Screening for Detecting Neuro-ophthalmologic Disease", "text": "Purpose: To devise and evaluate a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective method of detecting neuro-ophthalmologic visual field defects. Methods: One hundred fifty-nine consecutive patients were evaluated with 76-point, central 30° automated static threshold perimetry on the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer, as well as by a 76-point, central 30° suprathreshold examination with the central reference levels set at 2 or 4 dB lower than the estimated normal median central reference level adjusted for age. Six masked readers reviewed the fields. Their readings were compared with those of the other observers, as well as with the final diagnoses as determined from all available clinical information. Results: In detecting abnormality, the full-threshold 30° test had a sensitivity (percent of eyes with true field defects identified by the field test) of 93% or 99% (depending on whether borderline results were counted as a positive or negative test) and a specificity (percent of cases without true field defects appropriately identified by the field test) of 71% or 91%. In comparison, the 4-dB offset suprathreshold test had a sensitivity (averaged over all reviewers) of 79% or 87% and a specificity of 81% or 89%, whereas the 2-dB test had a sensitivity of 87% or 94% and a specificity of 73% or 85%. The mean duration of the suprathreshold tests was 3.5 ± 1.0 minute, compared with 14.8 ± 2.8 minutes for the full-threshold technique. Conclusion: The central 30°, 76-point, 2-dB offset suprathreshold automated perimetry is more rapid and nearly as effective as the full-threshold test in detecting visual field abnormalities due to neuro-ophthalmologic disease. More quantitative, full-threshold perimetric strategies should be used in all equivocal cases and to follow progression of established disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0161-6420(96)30588-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051548879", "source": "openalex"}

Ten families had a founder CRYBB1 deletion (all with bilateral central pulverulent cataract), two had the same missense mutation in CRYAB (both with bilateral juvenile cataract with marked variable expressivity), and two had different mutations in FYCO1 (both with bilateral posterior capsular abnormality). The remaining 12 families each had mutations in 12 different genes (CRYAA, CRYBA1, AKR1E2, AGK, BFSP2, CYP27A1, CYP51A1, EPHA2, GCNT2, LONP1, RNLS, WDR87) with unique phenotypes noted for CYP27A1 (bilateral juvenile fleck with anterior and/or posterior capsular cataract and later cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis), EPHA2 (bilateral anterior persistent fetal vasculature), and BFSP2 (bilateral flecklike with cloudy cortex). Potential carrier signs were documented for several families.In this recessive pediatric cataract case series most identified genes are noncrystallin. Recessive pediatric cataract phenotypes are generally nonspecific, but some notable phenotypes are distinct and associated with specific gene mutations.

Diagnosis in ophthalmology is often based on ocular examinations and imaging, alongside the clinical context. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of multimodal GPT-4 (GPT-4V) in an integrated analysis of ocular images and clinical text. Methods This retrospective study included 40 patients seen in our institution with ocular pathologies. Cases were selected by a board certified ophthalmologist, to represent various pathologies and match the level for ophthalmology residents. We provided the model with each image, without and then with the clinical context. We also asked two non-ophthalmology physicians to write diagnoses for each image, without and then with the clinical context. Answers for both GPT-4V and the non-ophthalmologists were evaluated by two board-certified ophthalmologists. Performance accuracies were calculated and compared. Results GPT-4V provided the correct diagnosis in 19/40 (47.5%) cases based on images without clinical context, and in 27/40 (67.5%) cases when clinical context was provided. Non-ophthalmologists physicians provided the correct diagnoses in 24/40 (60.0%), and 23/40 (57.5%) of cases without clinical context, and in 29/40 (72.5%) and 27/40 (67.5%) with clinical context. Conclusion GPT-4V at its current stage is not yet suitable for clinical application in ophthalmology. Nonetheless, its ability to simultaneously analyze and integrate visual and textual data, and arrive at accurate clinical diagnoses in the majority of cases, is impressive. Multimodal large language models like GPT-4V have significant potential to advance both patient care and research in ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.24.23298953", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4389042140", "source": "openalex"}

The medications discussed include antidepressants, antiepileptic medications, topical antiglaucoma medications, and chemotherapeutic/immunosuppressive agents. Most of the side effects produced by these medications affect visual sensory function; however, some produce disturbances of ocular motility and alignment. Some of these effects are related directly to drug toxicity, whereas others are related to secondary effects of the drug. The heterogeneity of the pathogenesis of side effects from these drugs explains why some of the side effects are reversible, whereas others are not.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00055735-200012000-00002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2122903359", "source": "openalex"}

Thorofare, NJ: Slack Inc., 2004. $44.95. The fifth edition of this book was released in 2001, and I reviewed it for Optometry and Vision Science at that time. This revised fifth edition has very few changes. The main updates have been in the references and improving the clarity of some sections. The manual is divided into 20 chapters covering a wide spectrum of topics in this complex field. Each chapter covers an individual topic in neuro-ophthalmology. The chapters are presented in outline format with most pertinent information being presented clearly and concisely. The format makes the information easy to follow and easy to find. In general, the information is complete, although certainly not as complete and well documented as in several of the excellent textbooks in this field. However, this is certainly to be expected because it is meant to be a review guide rather than a textbook. One strength of this guide is the excellent (simple, yet complete) diagrams found in every chapter. The figures are universally well drawn and communicate both the anatomic and clinical considerations in a thorough and easy-to-understand manner. I find them to be an excellent teaching tool for students who are having difficulty understanding certain concepts. The one chapter in which the drawings were a little bit disappointing was Chapter 1—Visual Fields. Although the figures are well-drawn schematics that are easily understood, it would be nice to include some actual automated visual field plots, because these will be more widely encountered in practice. The figures are all in black and white, including a couple of photographs, with the exception of Figure 15-1. This figure is a color diagram of a migraine aura and is printed at the very back of the book. The order of the chapters is somewhat puzzling in that it is difficult to determine the logic of the order in which topics are presented. Unlike most textbooks on the subject, it is not divided into sections on afferent and efferent disorders. Because it is a review manual, this is a minor point but still a bit confusing. Something that concerned me when I first perused this manual was the wording of some of the chapter titles. When I first saw “The Six Syndromes of the VI Nerve,” I was a little concerned that I might see syndromes named after some obscure German ophthalmologist or neurologist whose names tell us nothing about the disease process. I was happily surprised when I saw the use of anatomic names for the syndromes such as “the brainstem syndrome,” “the sub-arachnoid space syndrome,” or “the cavernous sinus syndrome.” These distinctions and descriptions are nice in that they allow the clinician or student to remember them in an anatomic context, which, once one understands the anatomy, makes it much easier to remember the signs and symptoms associated with each. Granted, in several of these sections, there are subheadings with named syndromes (such as Millard-Gubler syndrome and Foville's syndrome), but these are unavoidable given the history of neuro-ophthalmology. In general, I find this volume to be very good at what it intends to be—a review manual. It should be an excellent resource for optometry students or ophthalmology residents studying for board examinations and a good quick reference for the clinician. If one needs a thorough knowledge of neuro-ophthalmology, this is not the only book needed. However, as an adjunct to some of the excellent textbooks, this manual does its job well. Gilbert E.

Herein, we investigate the potential use of hAM and amnion-chorion membrane (ACM) in oral surgery. Based on our analysis of the literature, it appears that their applications are very poorly defined. There are two options: implantation or use as a cover material graft. The oral cavity is submitted to various mechanical and biological stimulations that impair membrane stability and maintenance. Thus, some devices have been combined with the graft to secure its positioning and protect it in this location. This current opinion paper addresses in detail suitable procedures for hAM and ACM utilization in soft and hard tissue reconstruction in the oral cavity. We address their implantation and/or use as a covering, storage format, application side, size and number, multilayer use or folding, suture or use of additional protective covers, re-application and resorption/fate. We gathered evidence on pre- and post-surgical care and evaluation tools. Finally, we integrated ophthalmological and wound healing practices into the collected information. This review aims to help practitioners and researchers better understand the application of hAM and ACM in the oral cavity, a place less easily accessible than ocular or cutaneous surfaces. Additionally, it could be a useful reference in the generation of new ideas for the development of innovative protective covering, suturing or handling devices in this specific indication.

Subsequently, a number of supranational and international organizations have been created, and these groups are beginning to communicate with each other and with national ophthalmological societies in joint planning. The international nongovernmental organizations, lay ophthalmic international organizations (e.g., International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness), and the World Health Organization have recently joined to create a proposal called Vision 2020: The Right to Sight. The International Council in partnership with Academia Ophthalmolgica Internationalis has created a parallel and complementary plan, Vision for the Future.

A fellowship-trained neuro-ophthalmologist scored each passage. Handout readability was assessed using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), which estimates years of education required to understand a text. Results: The QGLOP scores for accuracy, bias, currency, and tone were found to be 2.43, 3, 3.43, and 3.02 respectively.

If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers. Applicants spent an average (SD) of $2320.96 ($1172.86) on the application process this year, which is significantly less than 2018-2019 data.The ophthalmology residency application process was especially complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many applicants and PDs were glad that interviews were held virtually this year, they were less certain regarding future years. The virtual format led to a significantly lower financial burden for applicants and may lead some to prefer this format in the future; if a hybrid model is offered for virtual/in-person interviews, these two interview modes should be compared equally.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/08820538.2021.1906917", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3150820636", "source": "openalex"}

The substance mostly used is Dibenamine,* introduced in ophthalmology by Christensen and Swan in 1949. Dibenamine is generally given intravenously in doses of 4-5 mg. per kilogram body weight diluted in 300-500 cc. saline. Slow infusion during 60-90 minutes is necessary, since toxic effects occur more frequently when the drug is administered rapidly. After the infusion the vein is flushed with saline to prevent local phlebothrombosis. When Dibenamine is taken orally in doses of 300-400 mg. daily its hypotensive effect is either very slight and transient or absent. Moreover, gastric disturbances restrict the value of oral application. Local application of Dibenamine in the conjunctival sac is ineffective as well as irritating because, being a nitrogen mustard derivative, it causes a chemical inflammation.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2491574743", "title": "Is ophthalmology becoming a pain in the neck?", "text": "Last year, one of the issues that we highlighted in an editorial for the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology was \"physician burnout\" - a state of mental exhaustion caused by the doctor's professional life, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of accomplishment.[12] A few of the many factors that contribute toward physician burn out included unpredictable work hours, mental exhaustion, emotional fatigue, challenging patients, and workplace-related issues. Apart from the mental and emotional toll that practicing medicine may take on the physician, there is another aspect that has slowly but most certainly reached alarming levels - the physical effect that hours of medical practice has on our bodies. Various structured surveys among health-care professionals have found that many branches of medicine are physically demanding and leave a profound effect on the body. Specialties such as dentistry, orthopedics, and ophthalmology are specially hard on the body.[345] An average operating ophthalmologist shifts through many postures throughout the day – from a rather uncomfortable sitting posture at the slit lamp to a long hours spent looking into the operating microscope, sometimes for several hours; not to mention the cumulative duration spent peering through the indirect ophthalmoscope while examining the retina from all sides and angles.[6] Are we pushing ourselves to the brink without realizing it? A survey among ophthalmologists from North America revealed that a staggering 52% of the ophthalmologists gave a recent history of neck, upper body, or lower back symptoms.[7] Nearly, 62% of the ophthalmologists who responded to a national survey in the United Kingdom reported that they suffered from either back or neck pain.[8] Another survey conducted among eye care professionals in Saudi Arabia showed that neck and back pain was reported by 70% of the participants.[9] These musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are chronic disorders of the muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and joints that arise due to long-term, chronic wear and tear, and repeated stress, rendering them susceptible to injury and damage. In our attempt to save time and improve efficiency, we are sadly paying a much bigger price. Poorly designed examination rooms and outdated microscopes with mismatched operating tables and chairs are just a few of the factors that can contribute to MSDs. Simple small things such as choosing the right chair with the ideal back curvature and lower back support, selecting thick carpet padding for the floors, and adjusting the height and angulation of our computer monitors can go a long way in easing the stress on our necks and backs. One of the most common mistakes we do is adjust our bodies to the design of the machine we use when, in fact, it should be the other way around. We need to make the machines work for us – it is imperative to make sure the examiner's chair, the slit lamp position, and patient's chair height are adjusted and aligned before examining the patient. Just as patient comfort is important, the examining doctor's comfort is equally vital. Christopher Kent in this enlightening review has encapsulated that an ophthalmologist should keep in mind to remain pain-free and comfortable.[10] And finally, in the bigger scheme of things, we need to give our feedback to manufacturers and designers so that they can incorporate our suggestions and design and produce more ergonomic instruments and machines. As is always – prevention is better than cure. The key is identification of our habits and correcting our posture. A small niggling headache or neck pain can soon transform into a recurrent one and then eventually into a chronic problem. It is no surprise that one's ability to think, analyze, diagnose, and treat will be affected when he or she is in constant pain or discomfort. And finally, if you find yourself already suffering from the ill effects of a poor posture, it is important to stop self-diagnosing and self-medicating, instead seek professional help from our orthopedic and physiotherapy colleagues before it is too late. In addition, modern technology can help us in preventing work-related injuries. Smart gadgets such as ergonomic chairs and other equipment can be used to prevent these disorders. MSDs do not have to be an occupational hazard for ophthalmologists – not if we choose to avoid them!", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0301-4738.187648", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2491574743", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2304065703", "title": "The Neuro-Ophthalmology Curriculum of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS)", "text": "Some years ago, the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) recognized the need to outline a suggested neuro-ophthalmology curriculum to serve as a basis for accrediting fellowship training programs and as a guide for ophthalmology and neurology residency training programs and medical student education. In 2004, NANOS created the Curriculum Committee (Table 1), a subcommittee of the Education Committee. Members were chosen because of their previous experience with curricula at different levels (American Academy of Ophthalmology, American Academy of Neurology, American Neurologic Association, Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology, NANOS Fellowship Task Force, and NANOS Medical Student Task Force).TABLE 1: Curriculum Committee of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS)In devising the curriculum, the committee drew on curricula elaborated by national medical associations and other specialties (1-4), as well as the table of contents of textbooks (5-9). Interestingly, very few other specialties have written detailed curricula that are widely accepted and used. There are even fewer publications concerned with how to design medical curricula (10-12). The curriculum designed by The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) and the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) (4) proved to be the most useful model. Like neuro-ophthalmology, emergency room medicine is a multidisciplinary specialty requiring basic knowledge of specific disorders, management problems, and numerous procedures. The neuro-ophthalmology curriculum (Appendix) is meant as an educational plan rather than as an all-inclusive list. The core curriculum defines the minimum standards for the clinical neuro-ophthalmologist. Its content will evolve as progress is made in our specialty. It should not be limiting, because the use of this curriculum will vary depending on the neuro-ophthalmologist's primary specialty (neurology or ophthalmology). The goal of the curriculum is to outline what the neuro-ophthalmologist should know. It is meant to be the basis for what is learned in a neuro-ophthalmology fellowship. It should also help to define a basic curriculum for ophthalmology and neurology residencies. Separate learning objectives will need to be defined for fellows, residents, and medical students. Numerous curricular organizations have emphasized the need for \"weighting\" each part of the curriculum. This weighting is essential to emphasize what is truly relevant for fellows, residents, and continuing medical education program planning. In weighting this curriculum, we have relied on the experience of the Curriculum in Emergency Medicine developed by SAEM, CORD, and the Neuro-Ophthalmology/Orbit Knowledge Base Panel of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. We have labeled each topic as \"most relevant\" (mastery of the topic required), \"more relevant\" (proficiency with the topic required), and \"relevant\" (familiarity with the topic required). This curriculum has been approved by the NANOS board and is currently available on the NANOS website (www.nanosweb.org). The main debate triggered by this first version concerns ophthalmology-trained and neurology-trained neuro-ophthalmologists who had obvious difficulties agreeing on the weighting of topics (glaucoma would be \"most relevant\" for ophthalmologists, and symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome would be \"most relevant\" to neurologists). We have encouraged NANOS members to try it out and provide feedback so as to discover if this curriculum is suitable. The Neuro-Ophthalmology Virtual Educational Library (NOVEL) (weblink on NANOS website) has already started using this curriculum to help organize its collections of slides and videos. NOVEL immediately pointed out that we had left out the Tensilon test from our initial draft! Annual revisions and the addition of sub-curricula for residents and medical students are planned.

All humans have physiologic tremors that are of low amplitude and not discernible to the naked eye; they do not adversely affect the majority of the population’s daily functioning. However, during microsurgery, such tremors can be problematic. In this review, we focus on the impact of physiological tremors on ophthalmic microsurgery and offer a comparative discussion on the impact of such tremors on other surgical specialties. Methods A single investigator used the MEDLINE database (via PubMed) to search for and identify articles for inclusion in this systematic review. Ten key factors were identified as potentially having an impact on tremor amplitude: beta-blockers, muscle fatigue, robotic systems, handheld tools/micromanipulators, armrests/wrist supports, caffeine, diet, sleep deprivation, consuming alcohol, and workouts (exercise). These key terms were then searched using the advanced Boolean search tool and operators (i.e., AND, OR) available on PubMed: (*keyword*) AND (surgeon tremor OR microsurgery tremor OR hand steadiness OR simulator score). Results Ten studies attempted to quantify the baseline severity of operator physiologic tremor. Approximately 89% of studies accessing the impact of tremors on performance in regards to surgical metrics reported an improvement in performance compared to 57% of studies concluding that tremor elimination was of benefit when considering procedural outcomes.

They are an opportunity to purge, rethink priorities, and be intentional about new habits. We can make our new normal any way we want.\" - Kristin Armstrong COVID-19 has turned out to be the metaphoric Black Swan of the twenty- first century – an unexpected event of large magnitude and consequence that has completely changed the way we live.[1] It has caught the world off-guard and thrust powerful nations into utter chaos.[2] It has claimed millions of victims directly and many more to its collateral damage. An event like this, of this magnitude, has never occurred in modern history.[2] Add to it the insecure uncertainty of what we do not know about the disease, which is far greater than what we do. Yet, the panic we can do without; it is neither the remedy nor the cure for this pandemic.[2] We must not lose hope and rely on our strong resilience, existential adaptability, and deep wisdom to come out of this crisis.[2] New Normal is a term that refers to conditions following the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the aftermath of the 2008–2012 global recession, and now, the expected human behavioral changes post-COVID-19 pandemic.[3] It simply means that \"a previously unfamiliar or atypical situation will come to be standard, usual, or expected\".[3] Having known the pandemic for the last five months, it is reasonable to assume that the unwelcome guest is here to stay in some form or the other for years to come. Vaccines are at least 12-18 months away if at all, and universal vaccination is an extremely difficult, expensive, and distant reality.[4] Although we aggressively Test, Trace and Contain, with a hope to flatten the curve, slow down the pandemic and mitigate the damage, our surrendered goal is to patiently await the onset of herd immunity. Assuming an R0 estimate of 3 for SARS-CoV-2, the herd immunity threshold is approximately 67%, if the virus does not unduly mutate with time.[5] Hunkering down until it is completely safe may be a choice for a privileged few. For most of us, it is imperative that we make a cautious, calculated, and timely beginning to reopen and meet the new normal head-on or perish.[4] As we pussyfoot through the process of recalibration, reinforcement, and reopening, we have a unique opportunity to create and shape the new normal and adapt to it. This would encompass many facets of our professional life including ophthalmology practice, financial stability, training, and learning. Reopening Ophthalmology Practice: Universal Precautions, Extended Work Hours, Day Care Surgeries and Reduced Throughput are the New Normal The All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) and Indian Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO) have been providing timely guidelines to ophthalmologists to deal with COVID-19.[678910] The essence of it all is the unfailingly meticulous practice of physical distancing, hygiene, and universal precautions to protect the workforce and the patients. The central government guidelines currently allow us (except in designated containment zones) to routinely see patients and perform even non-emergency surgeries including cataracts. Specific measures to be taken at the point-of-entry, waiting room, out-patient clinic, procedure room and operation theater constitute the new normal in our ophthalmology practice.[678910] If you are a facility that admits patients for surgery, it is time to completely move over to daycare surgeries. The price that we pay to regain and maintain the patient volume would be in terms of an increased financial burden to enforce the safety norms, extended work hours and reduced throughput to maintain optimal physical distancing. Always-On Access to Care: Tele-ophthalmology is the New Normal Although the telemedicine technology has existed for over a decade, it has been sparsely used. We have come to very quickly rediscover the power of virtual care during the lockdown. This issue of IJO carries a lucid description of a gamified teleconsultation model.[111213] As we understand that specialty triage of new patients can be performed remotely and several patients with chronic ophthalmic diseases need not physically visit us for periodic evaluation and prescription refill, we can build-in the now legalized routine practice of teleophthalmology seamlessly into our existing systems. Incorporation of simple, light, robust, scalable and fast cloud-based electronic medical records (EMR) and hospital management systems integrated with teleophthalmology would provide access to medical records at any point of consultation, minimize touch-points, and yet, have complete control on clinical documentation and help us provide an accurate prescription over teleconsultation. The visionary leadership of AIOS has seized the opportunity to constitute a well-represented teleophthalmology and EMR committee, which will very soon release its recommendations and roll-out several free-to-use platforms. Virtual care at scale would release chair time in clinical practice to be used for the patients who truly benefit from it, and thus help the cause of physical distancing.[14] Staying Afloat in Troubled Times: A Lean (but not so Mean) Strategy is the New Normal Financial prudence is the key to stay afloat in troubled times.[15] Today's new normal for healthcare businesses includes dealing with workforce management, sick workers, disrupted supply chains, cash flow crunches, uncertain compliance obligations, and the mechanics of incorporating new government programs.[16] The keys to success are preparation, agility, accurate data collection, and a willingness to harvest good ideas.[16] Cost containment without impacting the quality of care, recovery of financial dues, work-efficiency, remodeling, and multi-tasking of the workforce and deferring needless expenses are some of the sound strategies for financial prudence.[16] It may be, however, counter-productive to aggressively furlough or terminate essential employees and cut back much on their remuneration, unless that remains the only option for an organization to survive. The economic challenges are very real, and these actions may be unavoidable for some organizations.[16] However, cutting costs only to preserve profits may serve to sink us further into recession.[16] Pre-crisis profit targets have been overtaken by events that none of us could have reasonably anticipated, and, understandably, we will miss those targets.[16] It is commendable that several charitable non-governmental organizations have not resorted to pruning employee remuneration and are volitionally concentrating on retaining talented employees. This may be a wise managerial strategy in the long-term, for a grateful employee is often a loyal employee, and the troubled times logically yield a higher gratefulness quotient. Optimal financial prudence with a heart may be the new mantra to stay afloat and thrive again. Ophthalmology Training: Online Teaching and Assessment is the New Normal It is estimated that the training of about 80% of ophthalmology residents is adversely affected by the lockdown during the pandemic.[1718] Even when we open-up, it may not be safe enough to conduct physical lectures and bedside teaching in larger groups. As we have already discovered, online teaching can be a gratifying experience and can considerably fill in for lost learning opportunities. As the opportunity-driven enthusiasm of the organizers of the me-too webinars' wanes, it is time to roll out robust, standardized, well-curated, curriculum-based, interactive, year-long online teaching modules by skillful teachers. The online avatar of the popular annual postgraduate education program iFocus is all set to debut in the next few weeks. The AIOS Ophthalmic Education, Training, and Evaluation Committee envisages the production of high-quality online teaching modules with the incorporation of standard assessment tools. Ophthalmology Professional Leaning: Physical Conferences Morphing into an Immersive Online Experience is the New Normal Physical ophthalmology professional conferences are neither safe nor feasible under the circumstances. Uncertainty prevails as to when it would be safe again for large groups to gather, learn, browse through ophthalmic products, and socially interact. Several prominent physical meetings have transformed into online versions – World Ophthalmology Congress is the first such that we will witness in June 2020. Technologically, it is feasible to create an immersive and engaging virtual conference environment with several simultaneous session halls and a walk-through trade exhibition with an option to buy online. This may be the way to go until it is safe to meet again. A hybrid version with an optimal combination of physical and virtual meetings may develop over time. Reboot to Ophthalmology 2.0 VUCA is an acronym – first used in 1987, to describe Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity of general situations[19] and it fits perfectly with the way the world is today, thoroughly overwhelmed by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The concept of VUCA naturally progresses to a smart leadership response - VUCA-2.0, incorporating Vision, Understanding, Courage, and Adaptability, which may show us a way out of this crisis, alive and kicking.[20] Let us wish each other a successful rebooting to Ophthalmology 2.0. See you on the other side. \"Humankind is now facing a global crisis. Perhaps the biggest crisis of our generation. The decisions people and governments take in the next few weeks will probably shape the world for years to come. They will shape not just our healthcare systems but also our economy, politics, and culture. We must act quickly and decisively. We should also take into account the long-term consequences of our actions. When choosing between alternatives, we should ask ourselves not only how to overcome the immediate threat, but also what kind of world we will inhabit once the storm passes. Yes, the storm will pass, humankind will survive, most of us will still be alive — but we will inhabit a different world.\" - Yuval Noah Harari", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1649_20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3029347111", "source": "openalex"}

We reviewed demographic data, herpesvirus diagnoses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, VA, RD, and the use of systemic and intravitreal antiviral therapy. Outcome measures included VA improvement by 2 or more lines, severe visual loss, VA ≤20/200, and RD.We studied 29 eyes of 24 patients, treated from 1987 through 2009. Mean age was 42.6 years and mean follow-up was 44.0 months. Twelve patients (14 eyes) were treated with combined systemic and intravitreal antiviral therapy and 12 patients (15 eyes) with systemic therapy alone. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients receiving combination intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy were more likely to have VA improved by 2 lines or greater (P=.006). Patients receiving combination therapy also showed a decreased incidence of progression to severe visual loss (0.13/patient-years [PY]) compared to patients receiving systemic therapy alone (0.54/PY, P=.02) and had decreased incidence of RD (0.29/PY vs 0.74/PY, P=.03).Combination oral and intravitreal antiviral therapy may improve visual and functional outcomes in patients with ARN.

In industrialised countries, the cure rate is about 95%. We present the results of a prospective study on the management of Rb in the paediatric oncology unit of Gabriel Touré Teaching Hospital and African Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology, from November 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015. Procedure The aims of this prospective study were to evaluate the treatment of localised Rb, ocular prosthesis after enucleation, conservative management for bilateral Rb as well as survival rates in all patients. Patients with early stage Rb at diagnosis were included. The treatment was performed according to the retinoblastoma treatment guidelines of the French‐African Paediatric Oncology Group. Results Eighty‐eight patients were included in the study. Sex ratio was 1:1 (M = 44, F = 44). Median age at diagnosis was 3 years (range: 2 months–5 years). Unilateral intraocular Rb was predominant (n = 50; 56.8%). Conservative treatments were performed on nine eyes in nine patients. Overall survival and event‐free survival of the entire cohort at the end of 4 years were 73% (95% CI 60.8–81.2%) and 59% (95% CI 47.9–69.5%), respectively, with a median follow‐up of 3.7 years (0.1–5.6 years). In conclusion, early enucleation in early stage of Rb can improve outcomes in resource‐limited countries. Delayed enucleation and refusal of adherence to treatment are still major concerns and remain a barrier to improving overall patient survival.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.27101", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2801338452", "source": "openalex"}

Responses were tabulated and evaluated for associations using comparative statistics. <b>Results</b> Ninety-one first-year residents responded. Fifty-five identified the transition to ophthalmologic training as more stressful than internship. Independent preparation (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and doing an ophthalmology rotation during internship (<i>p</i> = 0.04) significantly reduced stress, and those doing a transitional PGY-1 year were significantly more likely to do either (<i>p</i> < 0.01).

We studied children ages 5 to 19 years hospitalized in 2005 in 11 states, encompassing 38% of the U.S. pediatric population. Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, we identified admissions of children with EM, SJS, or TEN and the presence of concurrent ophthalmologic disease, analyzed patient and hospitalization characteristics, and generated age‐ and sex‐adjusted national estimates. We identified 460 children admitted with EM, SJS, or TEN, corresponding to 1,229 U.S. hospitalizations in 2005. Of the children with EM, SJS, or TEN, 60 (13.0%) had ophthalmologic disease, primarily (90.0%) disorders of the conjunctiva. Children with the highest proportions of ophthalmologic disease included those with mycoplasma pneumonia (26.7%), herpes simplex virus (15.6%), upper respiratory infection (13.9%), and lower respiratory infection (13.7%). Individuals with EM, SJS, or TEN and ophthalmologic disease were more likely than those without ophthalmologic disease to receive intensive care unit care (28.3% vs 17.0%, p = 0.03) and to be admitted to a children's hospital (63.3% vs 48.8%, p = 0.03).

However, increasing use of immune-based therapies, including the widely used class of agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, has exposed a discrete group of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Many of these are driven by the same immunologic mechanisms responsible for the drugs' therapeutic effects, namely blockade of inhibitory mechanisms that suppress the immune system and protect body tissues from an unconstrained acute or chronic immune response. Skin, gut, endocrine, lung and musculoskeletal irAEs are relatively common, whereas cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, neurologic and ophthalmologic irAEs occur much less frequently. The majority of irAEs are mild to moderate in severity; however, serious and occasionally life-threatening irAEs are reported in the literature, and treatment-related deaths occur in up to 2% of patients, varying by ICI. Immunotherapy-related irAEs typically have a delayed onset and prolonged duration compared to adverse events from chemotherapy, and effective management depends on early recognition and prompt intervention with immune suppression and/or immunomodulatory strategies. There is an urgent need for multidisciplinary guidance reflecting broad-based perspectives on how to recognize, report and manage organ-specific toxicities until evidence-based data are available to inform clinical decision-making.

In recent years, advances in molecular genetics have begun to provide new insight into the characterization of these clinical features and the genetic basis of the syndrome. Materials and methods: We included 37 articles that were identified through an electronic search in PubMed and through the reference lists of previously conducted reviews. Studies of 30 or more patients were used to report frequencies of common and less common findings. Genotype–phenotype studies were used to provide additional information when available. Results: Ocular anomalies are present in most patients with CdLS. Common findings include long eyelashes, synophrys, hirsutism of the eyebrows, peripapillary pigment ring, and myopia. Less common findings include hyperopia, ptosis, blepharitis, short palpebral fissure length, down-slanting palpebral fissures, mild microcornea, strabismus, nystagmus, and optic nerve abnormalities. Conclusions: This review provides a comprehensive summary of the ophthalmologic findings in CdLS. Mutations in certain genes may be associated with specific ocular abnormalities, although future genotype studies are needed to further characterize these relationships.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13816810.2019.1571617", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2913574746", "source": "openalex"}

Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is a group of inherited autoinflammatory disorders caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene resulting in the overproduction of interleukin 1β. NLRP3 mutations cause a broad clinical phenotype of CAPS. The aims of the study were to evaluate clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of a 5-generation family with CAPS focusing in detail on ocular symptoms. Methods. In a retrospective observational cohort study, consecutive family members were screened for the presence of the NLRP3 mutation. Patients underwent standardized clinical, laboratory, and ophthalmological assessments. The genotype-specific risk of ophthalmological findings and other organ symptoms was determined. Results. Twenty-nine patients were clinically affected. The A439V mutation encoded by exon 3 of the NLRP3 gene was found in 15 of 37 family members (41%). The most common clinical features were musculoskeletal symptoms, headaches, and ophthalmological symptoms. The mutation-positive patients were characterized by more frequent skin rashes, ocular symptoms, arthralgia, arthritis, and severe Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) Disease Activity Score. Rosacea was diagnosed in 8 patients. Conclusion. The NLRP3 mutation A439V is associated with a heterogeneous clinical spectrum of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome/MWS-overlap syndrome.

The purpose of this study was to assess the incorporation of synchronous ophthalmology telemedicine visits in a tertiary university-based ophthalmology clinic for low-income and uninsured patients in the COVID-19 era. Methods: The records of 18 patients who were due for an in-person visit in the medically underserved patient clinic at our institute were reviewed. Patients considered high risk of ocular morbidity progression were approved to proceed with an in-person visit. Patients with non-urgent visit indications were attempted to be contacted by telephone to be offered a telemedicine telephone visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. Results: Clinical triage by an attending ophthalmologist determined that 17 patients (94.4%, n = 18) had visit indications appropriate for evaluation by telemedicine. Six patients (35.3%, n = 17) were successfully contacted and offered a telemedicine visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. All 6 patients accepted, scheduled, and completed a telemedicine visit. Eleven patients (64.7%, n = 17) were not able to be successfully contacted to offer and schedule either a telemedicine visit or a postponed in-person office visit. Patients who were not able to be successfully contacted were on average younger in age and more likely to be female, Hispanic/Latino, from Latin America, with a preferred language of Spanish.

Under a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) channel, patient prerecorded data can be safely transferred via the Internet. With encrypted videoconference and white-board, the system not only supports hospital-to-clinic consultation, but also supplies hospital-to-hospital joint discussion. Based on Directshow technology (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), video cameras connected to the computer by firewire can be captured and controlled to sample video data. By using TWAIN technology, the system automatically identifies networked still cameras (on fundus and slitlamp devices) and retrieves images. All the images are stored in a selected format (such as JPEG, DICOM, BMP). Besides offline-transferring prerecorded data, the system also supplies online sampling of patient data (real-time capturing from remote places). The system was deployed at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore and Ang Mo Kio, Singapore, where 100 patients were enrolled in the system for examination.

Also included were improvements they would like to see in the undergraduate teaching of ophthalmology and whether they support the view that interns should have mandatory clinical rotation in other surgical subspecialties like Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology. Seventy-six interns who graduated from seven Nigerian medical schools participated in the study. Average duration of their undergraduate posting in Ophthalmology was 4 weeks. (SD = 3.327). Fifty (67.6%) considered Ophthalmology as an interesting and important specialty, 6 (8.1%) regarded it as a boring specialty, while 18 (24.3%) considered it as just one specialty in their curriculum. Only 5 (6.6%) of the respondents chose Ophthalmology as first choice career while 16 (21%), 14 (18.4%), 13 (17.1%) and 10 (13.2%) chose Surgery, Paediatrics, Community Health and Obstetrics and Gynaecology respectively. 78% of the respondent suggested that interns should have clinical rotation in surgical subspecialties such as Ophthalmology. Other suggestions offered included the need to increase the duration of undergraduate Ophthalmology posting, provision of audiovisual aids and more equipment like Ophthalmoscope for teaching. The interns considered Ophthalmology posting as an important and interesting specialty even though only a few chose it as their future career.

Over the last ten years a number of studies have shown that ocular symptoms are the form of discomfort most frequently experienced by subjects who work at VDT. The symptoms as a whole characterize a complex syndrome named \"asthenopia\" and have been seen as a consequence of prolonged, fixed and closely oriented vision. In our study we have evaluated data derived from a standardized questionnaire (a series of questions elaborated and promoted by the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene). It was administered to a group of 191 workers who utilise VDT for more than 20 hours each week. We also took into consideration the results of ophthalmologic medical examinations performed on this particular group of workers. Prevalence of occupational asthenopia we found to be lower in this group than in the case of other reported investigations, though it proved to be higher in the case of female subjects. According to the Literature, symptoms intensity is related to the duration of weekly VDT use, there being no significant association with the number of years spent working at VDT. Our results show that prevalence of asthenopia was not significantly influenced by refractive alterations and this unexpected outcome might be explained by taking into account the small-size group of subjects affected by hypermetropic defects. It is well known that these are the most important factors in conditioning asthenopia. Our finding indicates the need for further research, which should include a larger group of VDT workers with refractive alterations and furthermore take into consideration environmental variables such as climate and illumination, since these are co-aetiological factors, known or suspected, of occupational asthenopia.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W163103237", "source": "openalex"}

This paper reviews recent advances and challenges in applying AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to major eye diseases. In diabetic retinopathy, AI algorithms analyze retinal images to accurately identify lesions, which helps clinicians in ophthalmology practice. Systems like IDx-DR (IDx Technologies Inc, USA) are FDA-approved for autonomous detection of referable diabetic retinopathy. For glaucoma, deep learning models assess optic nerve head morphology in fundus photographs to detect damage. In age-related macular degeneration, AI can quantify drusen and diagnose disease severity from both color fundus and optical coherence tomography images. AI has also been used in screening for retinopathy of prematurity, keratoconus, and dry eye disease. Beyond screening, AI can aid treatment decisions by forecasting disease progression and anti-VEGF response. However, potential limitations such as the quality and diversity of training data, lack of rigorous clinical validation, and challenges in regulatory approval and clinician trust must be addressed for the widespread adoption of AI. Two other significant hurdles include the integration of AI into existing clinical workflows and ensuring transparency in AI decision-making processes. With continued research to address these limitations, AI promises to enable earlier diagnosis, optimized resource allocation, personalized treatment, and improved patient outcomes. Besides, synergistic human-AI systems could set a new standard for evidence-based, precise ophthalmic care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.18502/jovr.v19i3.15893", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4402865623", "source": "openalex"}

Applications were deemed unverifiable if there was no record of the publication by any of these means or if substantial discrepancies existed, such as incorrect authorship, incorrect journal, or a meaningful discrepancy in title or length (full-length article vs abstract). <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Inability to locate publication with search, incorrect author position, applicant not listed as an author, article being an abstract and not a published paper, substantial title discrepancy suggesting an alternative project, and incorrect journal. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 322 applicants offered interviews during the 6-year study period, 22 (6.8%) had 24 unverifiable publications. Two hundred thirty-nine of these applicants (74.2%) reported at least 1 qualifying publication; of this group, 22 (9.2%) had an unverifiable publication. The applications with unverifiable publications were evenly distributed across the years of the study (range, 2-6 per cycle; Pearson χ<sup>2</sup><sub>5</sub> = 3.65;<i>P</i> = .60). Two applicants had 2 unverifiable publications each. Two of the 22 applicants (9.1%) with unverifiable publications were graduates of medical schools outside the United States. Among the unverifiable publications, the most common reason was inability to locate the publication (13 [54%]). Additional issues included abstract rather than full-length publication (5 [20.8%]), incorrect author position (4 [16.7%]), applicant not listed as an author on the publication (1 [4.2%]), and substantial title discrepancy (1 [4.2%]). One listed publication had an incorrect author position and incorrect journal (1 [4.2%]). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Unverifiable publications among ophthalmology residency applicants is a persistent problem. Possible strategies to modify the review process include asking applicants to provide copies of their full-length works or the relevant PMCID (PubMed Central reference number) or DOI (digital object identifier) for their publications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2018.0846", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2802045932", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2111115741", "title": "Some Applications of Radioactive Isotopes in Ophthalmology", "text": "The early attempts to use radiant energy in the treatment of eye disease form a dark and calamitous chapter in the history of radiotherapy. The unhappy consequences of such therapy, aided by a great deal of primitive and unsound experimental work, served to retard for a generation its development and applications to ophthalmology. Today, however, the radiotherapist approaching the special problems of ocular disease is sustained by the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the physical nature and properties of the agents used and by their dramatic increase in variety and number. These remarkable advances in the field of physics would be of little value had no reliable knowledge of the effects of radiation on the eye under clinical and experimental conditions also been simultaneously acquired. Such knowledge, withal incomplete and occasionally uncertain, permits the newer physical agents to be used without the risks of repeating the technical errors and encountering the ocular disasters which hitherto have helped surround radiotherapy with an impenetrable barrier of fear and distrust. In the past 12 years at the Royal Marsden Hospital, chiefly as a result of its fortunate association with Moorfields Eye Hospital, there has been excellent opportunity to study the applications of radiotherapy to ophthalmology. In the first half of this period the oldest, the sturdiest, and the most trusty of all isotopes, namely radium, was alone available and exclusively used. As the newer artificially produced radioactive substances became available, so certain of them have been chosen for use in eye work.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1259/0007-1285-29-337-1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2111115741", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2636956416", "title": "Supervision and autonomy of ophthalmology residents in the outpatient Clinic in the United States: a survey of ACGME-accredited programs", "text": "The development and demonstration of incremental trainee autonomy is required by the ACGME. However, there is scant published research concerning autonomy of ophthalmology residents in the outpatient clinic setting. This study explored the landscape of resident ophthalmology outpatient clinics in the United States.A link to an online survey using the QualtricsTM platform was emailed to the program directors of all 115 ACGME-accredited ophthalmology programs in the United States. Survey questions explored whether resident training programs hosted a continuity clinic where residents would see their own patients, and if so, the degree of faculty supervision provided therein. Metrics such as size of the resident program, number of faculty and clinic setting were also recorded. Correlations between the degree of faculty supervision and other metrics were explored.The response rate was 94%; 69% of respondents indicated that their trainees hosted continuity clinics. Of those programs, 30% required a faculty member to see each patient treated by a resident, while 42% expected the faculty member to at least discuss (if not see) each patient. All programs expected some degree of faculty interaction based upon circumstances such as the level of training of the resident or complexity of the clinical situation. 67% of programs that tracked the contribution of the clinic to resident surgical caseloads reported that these clinics provided more than half of the resident surgical volumes. More ¾ of resident clinics were located in urban settings. The degree of faculty supervision did not correlate to any of the other metrics evaluated.The majority of ophthalmology resident training programs in the United States host a continuity clinic located in an urban environment where residents follow their own patients. Furthermore, most of these clinics require supervising faculty to review both the patients seen and the medical documentation created by the resident encounters. The different degrees of faculty supervision outlined by this survey might provide a useful guide presuming they can be correlated with validated metrics of educational quality. Finally, this study could provide an adjunctive resource to current international efforts to standardize ophthalmic residency education.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-017-0941-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2636956416", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2005796217", "title": "Use of tissue adhesives in ophthalmology", "text": "Tissue adhesives can be divided into synthetic adhesives (e.g., cyanoacrylate derivatives) and biologic adhesives (e.g., fibrin-based adhesives). Cyanoacrylate derivatives are compounds with very high tensile strength that rapidly polymerize on contact with basic substances such as water or blood to form a strong bond. Because they are synthetic and nonbiodegradable, they are usually used on an external surface and may induce an inflammatory foreign body reaction, including neovascularization and tissue necrosis. Fibrin-based adhesives, by contrast, have a lower tensile strength and slower polymerization, but, being biologic and biodegradable, they may be used under a superficial covering layer (e.g., conjunctiva, amniotic membrane) and induce minimal inflammation. These adhesives have been used in ophthalmology to treat various ocular conditions. In the present article, we have made an attempt to include most of the studies performed in ophthalmology with the tissue adhesives. Retina Retinal detachment Hartnett et al. (Retina 1998;18(2):125-9) reported the experience with cyanoacrylate glue in posterior retinal breaks associated with retinal detachments in four consecutive pediatric patients who underwent vitreoretinal surgery for retinal detachment. In three of the four patients, successful retinal reattachment with visual function was achieved by vitreoretinal surgery and cyanoacrylate glue placed on the apposed edges of posterior retinal breaks or used to plug a break (postoperative follow-up was 1.5-2 years). In two successful cases, the glue was applied onto the break while the retina was detached, which resulted in closure of the retinal breaks and reattachment of the retina. Sheta et al. (Am J Ophthalmol. 1986;102(6):717–22) evaluated the use of trans-vitreal cyanoacrylate retinopexy during vitreous surgery in the treatment of experimental rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in rabbit eyes. The chorioretinal adhesions produced with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive were compared with those produced by trans-scleral retinal cryopexy and were found to be more rapid in onset as well as stronger. An exaggerated tissue response adjacent to the cyanoacrylate site suggested a potential toxic chemical or thermal reaction, or both, to the tissue adhesive. Ricci et al. (Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 2001;79(5):506-8) performed an experimental sutureless scleral buckling using a tissue adhesive glue to fixate a silicone band to the sclera. An encircling band of silicone, which is generally anchored to the sclera itself, was sutured in 36 rabbit eyes to three small silastic patches that had been glued to the sclera, at the level of the equator, using octyl 2-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. The band was tightened to produce buckling of the sclera and its ends were glued together using the same adhesive. Examination of the eyes from 15 days to 6 months after surgery revealed that the buckle was stable, with no signs of slippage, in 33 eyes. In the remaining 3 (one examined after 15 days, 2 examined after 45 days), one of the three support patches had detached but there was still no evidence of slippage. Macular hole Tilanus et al. (Int Ophthalmol. 1994-1995;18(6):355-8) used, in addition to vitrectomy and gas tamponade, a tissue glue to stimulate adhesion of the elevated cuff of neurosensory retina surrounding a full-thickness macular hole in 15 eyes of 13 patients, with stage 3 and 4 macular holes. All of the 13 uncomplicated cases showed complete closure of the macular hole. In one case the visual acuity decreased one line in spite of a funduscopically closed hole, and in two cases visual acuity remained the same despite closure. Increased visual acuity was seen in ten cases (76%), eight of which improved more than two lines. Conjunctival closure following pars plana vitrectomy Mentens et al. (Am J Ophthalmol. 2007;144(1):128-31) successfully used fibrin glue in conjunctival closure following 20 gauge pars plana vitrectomy and reported a shorter duration of conjunctival congestion (p=0.0471), and discomfort of the eye (p=0.0376). Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) as tissue glue Smiddy et al. (Arch Ophthalmol. 1989;107(4):577-80) studied transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) for a possible role as a bioactive substance for inducing localized chorioretinal wound healing along the edge of a retinal tear. The edges of the retinal tear treated with TGF-beta were adherent to the underlying Bruch′s membrane via localized fibrous tissue without apparent effects elsewhere suggesting that TGF-beta may have a potential role as an alternative means for inducing a chorioretinal adhesion in the treatment of retinal tears. Cornea Amniotic Membrane Patches Kitagawa et al. (Am J Ophthalmol. 2009 May 22) reported use of hyperdry amniotic membrane (AM) patches using a tissue adhesive for corneal perforations and bleb leaks. Five eyes of 5 patients (glaucoma bleb leaks, 2 eyes; corneal perforations, 3 eyes) were treated with a single-layer patch of dried AM using a biological tissue adhesive. The tissue adhesive was applied to the epithelial side of the dried membrane cut into desired size and shape and then was positioned to cover the conjunctival bleb leak site or corneal perforation lesion using forceps. A therapeutic hydrogel contact lens was placed as a bandage. Bleb leaks or corneal perforations were repaired successfully within 21 days in all 5 cases. There were no remarkable adverse effects, and there was no recurrence of bleb leak or corneal perforation. Fibrin glue (FG)-assisted augmented amniotic membrane transplantation Kim et al. (Cornea 2009;28(2):170-6) evaluated and reported the efficacy of fibrin glue (FG)-assisted augmented amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in 10 patients with large noninfectious corneal perforations more than 2 mm in diameter. A 5- or 7 layered \"augmented amniotic membrane\" was constructed by applying FG to each sheet of AM to repair the corneal perforation. The augmented AM was designed 0.5 mm larger than the diameter of the perforation and was transplanted onto the perforation site with 10-0 nylon suture. If needed, additional overlay AM was sutured on top. The integrity of the eyeball was maintained in all the patients after the procedure and had well-formed deep anterior chambers and 90% of patients showed complete epithelialization over the AM. The mean reepithelialization time was 14.9±4.9 days (range, 10-24 days). No eye showed evidence of infection or recurrent corneal melting during the follow-up period. Corneal Perforations Weiss et al. (Ophthalmology1983;90(6):610-5) reported that eighty patients with either corneal perforation or impending perforation were treated with the application of tissue adhesive and it remained in place on the average of 50 days. Forty-four percent of these cases healed with the application of glue alone. Complications occurred in nine patients (11%). Two developed marked increase in intraocular pressure which was controlled with antiglaucoma medications and seven developed corneal infiltrates. Five of the infiltrates were culture-proven bacterial infections occurring on an average of 73 days after gluing. Sharma et al. (Ophthalmology 2003;110(2):291-8) compared the efficacy of fibrin glue (Group 1; n=19) and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue (Group 2; n=22) in corneal perforations. Fifteen (79%) eyes had successful healing of corneal perforation in group 1, compared with 19 (86%) eyes in group 2 (P > 0.05) at 3 months' follow-up. Corneal perforation healed within 6 weeks in 12 (63%) eyes in group 1 and 7 (31.8%) eyes in group 2 (P < 0.05). Reapplication of glue was required in six (31.5%) eyes in group 1 and seven (31.4%) eyes in group 2 during the first 3 months of follow-up. The mean number of applications per eye was 1.37 in group 1 and 1.36 in group 2. An increase in deep corneal vascularization was observed in 2 (10.5%) eyes in group 1 and 10 (45.5%) eyes in group 2 (P < 0.05). Giant papillary conjunctivitis occurred in one (5%) eye in group 1 and eight (36.4%) eyes in group 2 (P < 0.05). They concluded that both tissue adhesives are effective in the closure of corneal perforations up to 3 mm in diameter. Fibrin glue provides faster healing and induces significantly less corneal vascularization, but it requires a significantly longer time for adhesive plug formation. Siatiri et al. (Cornea2008;27(9):988-91) used FG and soft contact lens to seal corneal perforations of 0.6-3 mm (mean = 1.88 mm). The etiologies of corneal perforation were post-infectious keratitis in 11 and noninfectious in 7. Fifteen (83.3%) eyes had successful healing of corneal perforation after 3 months. All the patients who failed had corneal perforation larger than 2 mm in diameter. The success rate was higher in corneal perforation of ≤ 2 mm in diameter. No case developed giant papillary conjunctivitis or secondary glaucoma. It provided fast healing with low rate of corneal vascularization. Pterygium Uy et al. (Ophthalmology2005;112(4):667-71) compared the efficacy and safety of fibrin glue and suturing for attaching conjunctival autografts among 22 patients undergoing pterygium excision. A superior conjunctival autograft was harvested and transferred onto bare sclera after pterygium excision. Fibrin glue was used to attach the autograft in 11 eyes and 10-0 nylon suture was used to attach the autograft in 11 eyes. The patients were followed up for 2 months. All conjunctival autografts in both groups were successfully attached and were intact after 2 months. The average operating time for the fibrin glue group was significantly shorter (P<0.001). Postoperative symptoms were fewer for the fibrin glue group than the suture group. Marticorena et al. (Cornea2006;25(1):34-6) evaluated the efficiency and safety of using a fibrin adhesive to avoid the need for sutures during conjunctival autograft surgery for primary pterygium in 20 eyes. The time of surgery was 15 to 20 minutes. During the postoperative course, none of the patients felt pain, and only 25% had mild sensation of the presence of a foreign body. In 90% of the patients, the conjunctival autograft was fixed (mean follow-up: 26.05±3.15 weeks) with no case of recurrence of pterygium. Bahar et al. (Cornea2006;25(10):1168-72) compared the short-term results of conjunctival closure in pterygium surgery using fibrin adhesive versus Vicryl (polyglactin) sutures in 65 eyes. Surgery consisted of the bare sclera technique combined with intraoperative mitomycin C. The average operative time was 16 minutes (range, 14-16 minutes) in the fibrin glue group and 20 minutes (range, 20–29 minutes) in the Vicryl suture group (P < 0.05). Significantly less pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation, irritation, epiphora, itching, local hyperemia, conjunctival chemosis, and dry eye were noted in the subjects treated with glue (P < 0.05) and no complication was noted during the 3-week follow-up. Bahar et al. (Curr Eye Res. 2007;32(5):399-405) compared the long-term results of conjunctival closure with fibrin adhesive (n = 42) or Vicryl sutures (n = 39) in 81 eyes with primary nasal pterygium and followed up for 1 year. Surgery in all patients consisted of the bare sclera technique combined with intraoperative administration of mitomycin C 0.02%. There were no complications during follow-up period in the glue-treated patients; one patient in the suture group had a medically treatable corneal dellen. At the end of follow-up, recurrent pterygium developed in 11.9% eyes of the fibrin-glue group and in 7.7% eyes of the Vicryl-suture group (p < 0.05). Jain et al. (Cornea2008;27(1):94-9) reported the use of fibrin glue for attaching the human amniotic membrane graft with a tuck-in technique after primary pterygium excision in 12 eyes. The bare sclera was covered with an oversized human amniotic membrane graft by using fibrin glue for graft adherence. The edges of the graft were tucked underneath the adjacent free margin of conjunctiva on 3 sides. The amniotic membrane graft adhered successfully in 11 patients. Average surgical time was 15.5 minutes (range, 13-21 minutes). The postoperative period was generally comfortable. Epithelialization of the graft was rapid, occurring within 7 days in 11 eyes. In 1 patient, the graft was found dislodged partially on the first postoperative day. Eleven eyes showed no recurrence at the end of 1-year follow-up. Karalezli et al. (Br J Ophthalmol.2008;92(9):1206-10) compared the use of fibrin glue versus sutures for fixating conjunctival autografts in 50 patients undergoing pterygium excision. In the fibrin glue group (n=25), the mean operation time was 15.7 ± 2.4 min (range 12-18 min) and in the suture group (n=25) it was 32.5 ± 6.7 min (range 25-40 min) (p<0.001). The intensity of the postoperative pain, foreign-body sensation, irritation and epiphora were significantly lower in the fibrin glue group than in the suture group (p<0.001). The intensity of itchy sensation at the first two postoperative visits was lower among patients in the fibrin glue group (five patients, 20%) than in the suture group (12 patients, 48%) (p<0.05). Two patients in the fibrin glue group had partial graft dehiscence; these grafts were successfully reattached with fibrin glue. At the end of follow-up, pterygium recurrence was observed in one eye (4%) in the fibrin glue group and in three eyes (12%) in the suture group (p<0.05). Benyamini et al. (Cornea2008;27(8):911-5) compared two surgical approaches to conjunctival flap placement during pterygium surgery using a biologic adhesive: single rotational flap (group A, 19 eyes) and double sliding flaps (group B, 15 eyes). The patients were followed for 24 weeks. In group A, 1 (5.3%) flap was lost because of ischemia, whereas all the others remained in position and became fully integrated. In group B, 4 (26%) flaps did not retain their primary position. Srinivasan et al. (Br J Ophthalmol.2009;93(2):215-8) compared the degree of conjunctival autograft inflammation, subconjunctival haemorrhage (SCH) and graft stability following the use of sutures or FG during pterygium surgery in 40 eyes. The degree of inflammation was significantly less with FG than with sutures at 1 month (p = 0.019) and 3 months (p = 0.001) postoperatively. No significant difference was found for inflammation at 1 week postoperatively. Conjunctival grafts secured with FG were as stable as those secured with sutures. No significant difference was found in degree of postoperative SCH between the groups. Wound closure after cataract surgery Mester et al. (J Cataract Refract Surg.1993;19(5):616-9) described astigmatism after phacoemulsification with posterior chamber lens implantation in small incision technique with fibrin adhesive for wound closure. They conducted a comparative study of 385 consecutive patients; 167 received only fibrin glue for wound closure and 218 had the single-stitch procedure. No complication was observed in either group. Surgically induced astigmatism was smaller in the fibrin group. Grewing et al. (Ophthalmic Surg. 1994;25(7):446-8) evaluated the efficacy of using a modified wound-closure technique in cataract surgery to reduce preexisting against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism. Seventy-seven eyes received a radial 10-0 nylon suture in the axis of the preexisting ATR cylinder, combined with an application of fibrin glue to stabilize the wound. A control group of 76 patients with comparable preoperative ATR astigmatism was operated on in the same manner, but only fibrin glue and no suture was used for wound closure. The mean induced astigmatism in these two groups differed by 0.42 diopters (P < 0.05). In the cases with preoperative astigmatism greater than 1.00 D, the difference between the two groups was 0.73 (P < 0.05). Glued IOL Agarwal et al. (J Cataract Refract Surg.2008;34(9):1433-8) reported a new surgical technique that uses biological glue to implant a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) in eyes with a deficient or absent posterior capsule. Two partial-thickness limbal-based scleral flaps were made 180 degrees apart diagonally, and the haptics of the PC IOL were externalized to place them beneath the flaps. Fibrin glue was used to attach the haptics to the scleral bed, beneath the flap. This simple method of PC IOL implantation requires no specially designed haptics. It provides good flap closure and IOL centration. Nair et al. (Eye Contact Lens2009;35(4):215-7) reported a patient of retinitis pigmentosa with spontaneous bilateral anterior in-the-bag subluxation of PCIOL who was managed by IOL explantation followed by fibrin-glue-assisted sutureless PCIOL implantation. Two partial thickness limbal-based scleral flaps were created about 1.5 mm from the limbus under which sclerotomies were made. Intraocular lens explantation along with capsular bag was performed through the corneo-scleral tunnel incision. Single-piece rigid polymethylmethacrylate 6.5-mm optic IOL was introduced through the limbal wound with a McPherson forceps, both the IOL haptics were externalized under the scleral flap. The haptic ends were tucked in the scleral tunnel made with the 26G needle. Scleral flaps and the conjunctiva were closed with the fibrin glue. Preoperative best corrected visual acuity was 20/80 in the right and 20/120 in the left eye. Patient gained a best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 in both the eyes, with a bilateral stable PCIOL and clear cornea. For epithelial ingrowth after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) enhancement Narvaez et al. (Cornea2006;25(9):1115-7) reported a case of clinically significant post- LASIK epithelial ingrowth successfully treated with a combined technique of mechanical debridement, flap suturing, and fibrin glue application. No recurrence was found during a 15-month follow-up period. No adverse effects were seen with this approach. Harvesting keratolimbal allografts from corneoscleral buttons Lim et al. (Br J Ophthalmol.2008;92(11):1550-1) used cyanoacrylate glue to fix the two halves of donor rim on a sterile rubber block (the under surface of the donor punch) after cutting the donor tissue for penetrating keratoplasty for limbal stem cell dissection. This composite provided stability to the donor rim allowing lamellar dissection of the limbal tissue without damaging the limbal epithelium. Band shaped keratopathy (BSK) Esquenazi et al. (Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging2008;39(5):418-21) reported a case of recurrent BSK in which they removed the calcified lesion surgically and then performed an 8-mm, 100-micron trephination and created a 360 degrees lamellar peripheral corneal dissection pocket. After covering the denuded corneal surface, the edges of the amniotic membrane were introduced into the pocket and secured using fibrin sealant. Additional amniotic membrane was glued to the nasal and temporal corneal areas and a collagen shield was applied. There was complete wound healing in 10 days and a stable ocular surface was restored without pain or inflammation. Antibacterial analysis of Ethyl-cyanoacrylate de Almeida Manzano et al. (Cornea2006;25(3):350-1) analyzed the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth and the plates were incubated for 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar and analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited. Keratoplasty Lamellar keratoplasty Duarte et al. (Cornea 2007;26(9):1127-8) reported a case where fibrin glue was applied with a modified approach to secure the graft to the host bed in lamellar keratoplasty. The glue components were applied separately: the fibrin component on the stromal bed and thrombin component on the stromal side of the lamellar graft. Postoperatively, best-corrected visual acuity 4 months after surgery was 20/30. The graft remained clear and well positioned at 9 months follow up after surgery. They concluded that components of the glue can be applied separately in a lamellar keratoplasty, allowing more time to position the graft on the stromal bed. Kaufman et al. (Ophthalmology2003;110(11):2168-72) determined whether a fibrin adhesive can facilitate the performance of sutureless lamellar keratoplasty and attachment of AM to bare sclera. Six patients were studied, 5 of whom underwent lamellar keratoplasty and 1 received an amniotic patch. In 5 patients, the epithelium was removed from the corneal surface, a free cap, 200μ thick, was cut with a microkeratome, and FG was applied to the stromal bed. A 200μ thick, microkeratome-cut lamellar graft was placed in the stromal bed without sutures, and a bandage soft contact lens was applied. The lens was left in place for 1 week and then removed. In 1 patient, the adhesive was applied to bare sclera for attachment of AM after removal of a conjunctival melanosis. All patients were followed up for 3 months after surgery. All 5 lamellar grafts healed and remained clear; the AM graft also adhered well to the bare sclera. Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty Narendran et al. (Cont Lens Anterior Eye 2007;30(3):207-9) described a case where Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK) was performed using overlay sutures and fibrin glue alone, without direct suture to the corneal button. All securing sutures were removed 4 weeks after the surgery. Six months post surgery, the graft was clear and the patient rehabilitated by wearing acceptable astigmatic spectacle correction. Squint surgery Biedner et al. (Ophthalmic Surg Lasers 1996;27(11):967) described six patients undergoing bilateral symmetric strabismus surgery; for each subject, incisions were closed with Vicryl in one eye and glue in the other. The conjunctival closure with the Vicryl suture resulted in increased discomfort and inflammation during the early postoperative period compared with fibrin glue; this difference disappeared after 14 days. Glaucoma Bleb leakage Asrani et al. (Ophthalmology1996;103(2):294-8) evaluated autologous fibrin tissue glue (AFTG) in the treatment of bleb leaks. Successful healing of the leaks was obtained in 9 of the 12 episodes in which AFTG was used. However, there were no statistically significant differences between AFTG and the other treatment modalities. Grewing et al (Ophthalmic Surg Lasers1997;28(2):124-7) described two patients with hypotony that occurred after trabeculectomy in one case and after combined cataract and glaucoma surgery in another case. Temporary tamponade of the scleral flap was achieved by subconjunctival injection of fibrin sealant. After the fibrin sealant was applied, the choroidal detachment resolved and intraocular pressure increased to normal. Fibrin glue-assisted glaucoma drainage device surgery Kahook et al. (Br J Ophthalmol. 2006;90(12):1486-9) described the use of FG as a suture substitute for portions of glaucoma drainage device (GDD) surgery and compared with traditional suture material. No significant difference was observed in IOP levels at any time point between the two groups. Conjunctival inflammation was more pronounced in the suture group (p=0.002). The mean time of surgery was significantly less for the glue-assisted group (p<0.001). Valimaki (Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 2006;84(3):372-4) reported the use of fibrin glue to prevent a leak of aqueous around the tube in the immediate postoperative period after glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) surgery in 42 eyes. Fibrin glue was used over the scleral flap intraoperatively in every eye with peritubular leakage. All 11 eyes maintained an intraocular pressure (IOP) of ≥16 mmHg in the immediate postoperative phase. No complication or Seidel-positive aqueous leak was observed during the follow-up period. Occuloplasty Glue blepharorrhaphy Sonmez et al.

Eyelid skin grafts Shorr et al.

No complication was encountered. The postoperative course and results were identical to the skin grafts closed with suture alone. Mucous membrane graft Watts et al. (Ophthalmic Surg. 1992;23(10):689-90) reported using FG in place of sutures to place a full-thickness mucosal graft into a defect created in a scarred fornix of an ophthalmic socket. They concluded that this technique minimizes tissue trauma and aids hemostasis and healing. Gallemore et al. (Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg.1999;15(3):210-2) described a technique to secure a mucous membrane graft to a custom conformer during reconstruction of the conjunctival fornices and socket. Cyanoacrylate-based tissue glue was used instead of sutures to secure the mucous membrane graft to the conformer. The adhesion between the graft and the conformer weakened over time, permitting easy removal of the conformer from the socket 6 to 12 weeks postoperatively. No complication was encountered in any of the six patients in whom this technique was used.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0301-4738.55059", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005796217", "source": "openalex"}

While retinal findings are common in TSC and important in establishing the diagnosis, TSC also has many potential neuro-ophthalmology manifestations. The neuro-ophthalmology manifestations of TSC can have a significant impact on visual function and are sometimes a sign of serious neurological disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the neuro-ophthalmological manifestations of TSC. These manifestations include optic nerve hamartomas, elevated intracranial pressure, cranial nerve palsies, cortical visual impairment, visual field deficits, and ocular toxicity from vigabatrin treatment of infantile spasms. It is important to be aware of potential neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in these patients in order to detect signs of vision- or life-threatening disease and to optimize visual function and quality-of-life.

After birth or during childhood, children with UCS have a high risk to present an aniso-astigmatism and a strabismus. The aim of this study was to characterize clinical ophthalmologic findings associated with UCS in a paediatric cohort.This retrospective study included children admitted in our unit between 2015 and 2021, with isolated UCS treated in our institution and complete ophthalmological assessment comprising visual assessment, refractive status and oculomotor examination. Children with associated craniofacial disorders were excluded.A total of 28 children met the inclusion criteria. Median age was 62 [13-192] months with a large proportion of girls (86%) and 71% of right-sided UCS. The mean best corrected visual acuity was 0.07 (±0.13) LogMAR, including 10 (36%) children with an amblyopia or history of amblyopia. Astigmatism was significantly higher on the contralateral side of the UCS than on the ipsilateral side, with a refractive cylinder error of 0.97 (±1.06) vs 0.56 (±0.68) diopters, respectively (p = 0.03). Strabismus was observed in 20 patients (71%) with a main pattern of esotropia with a vertical component. A pseudo-superior oblique palsy was found in 13 children (65%) with a median cyclodeviation of 8.7° [-5,4°-20.6°].Children with UCS experience a high rate of various visual manifestations.

Our aim was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological evaluation and abnormal ophthalmological findings, and investigate whether demographic and tumor-related characteristics are associated with abnormal ophthalmological findings in children presenting with a primary brain tumor. Methods: Medical records of all 90 children diagnosed with a primary brain tumor between June 2018 and May 2019 and treated at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, a tertiary referral center in the Netherlands, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate regression analysis was used to investigate associations between demographic, tumor-related and clinical characteristics, and abnormal ophthalmological findings. Results: Sixty children (34 male [56.7%]; median [range] age, 9.3 [0–16.9] years) underwent ophthalmological evaluation within 6 weeks before or after diagnosis, 11 children (5 male [45.5%]; median [range] age, 5.7 [0.1–17.2] years) were seen more than 6 weeks before or after diagnosis, and 19 children (7 male [36.8%]; median [range] age, 7.2 [1.9–16.6] years) did not receive ophthalmological evaluation within at least 6 months from diagnosis. A total of 19 children (21.1%) presented with visual symptoms as first sign leading to the diagnosis of a brain tumor. Children who presented with visual symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 22.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.90–103.60) and/or hydrocephalus (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.38–9.36) at diagnosis were more often seen for ophthalmological evaluation. The most common abnormal ophthalmological findings were eye movement disorders (66.0%), papilledema (44.1%), and visual field defects (58.1%). Eye movement disorders occurred more frequently in patients with an infratentorial tumor (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.03–21.65). The risk of papilledema was associated with older age (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05–1.34), hydrocephalus (OR, 9.63; 95% CI, 2.68–34.61), and infratentorial (OR, 9.11; 95% CI, 1.77–46.78) and supratentorial (OR, 13.13; 95% CI, 1.92–89.52) tumors. Conclusions: In this study, most children with a primary brain tumor underwent ophthalmological evaluation around diagnosis, 21% of the children were not evaluated. The high prevalence of abnormal ophthalmological findings stresses the importance of early standardized ophthalmological evaluation to detect visual impairment and provide timely treatment to potentially prevent permanent visual loss.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000001421", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4225420135", "source": "openalex"}

Objective: The objective of this work is to systematize available evidence in the literature on different syndromes that may cause congenital heart diseases associated with ocular changes, focusing on the types of anatomical and functional changes. Method: A systematic search was performed on Medline electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Lilacs) of articles published until January 2016. Eligibility criteria were case reports or review articles that evaluated the association of ophthalmic and cardiac abnormalities in genetic syndrome patients younger than 18 years. Results: The most frequent genetic syndromes were: Down Syndrome, Velo-cardio-facial / DiGeorge Syndrome, Charge Syndrome and Noonan Syndrome. The most associated cardiac malformations with ocular findings were interatrial communication (77.4%), interventricular communication (51.6%), patent ductus arteriosus (35.4%), pulmonary artery stenosis (25.8%) and tetralogy of Fallot (22.5%).

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms are commonly found throughout the genome and account for the majority of interindividual genetic variation. To date, genome-wide association studies have led to the discovery of thousands of disease-associated loci, including across dozens of ophthalmic diseases and traits. However, compared with the clinical utility of identifying rare Mendelian variants, the translation of these results to clinical practice has so far been limited because such variants are found commonly in the population, and individually account for a very small risk. Recently, combining large numbers of these genetic variants into polygenic risk scores (PRS) has shown clinically meaningful risk prediction across several common diseases. PRS have the potential to translate the discovery of common risk variants into individualized disease risk prediction, prognostication, and may enable targeted treatments. In this context, we review the clinical utility of PRS in three common, genetically complex ophthalmic conditions: primary open angle glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and myopia.

Topical parameters for inclusion of sources were diagnosis and management of nonstrabismic binocular vision disorders, diagnosis and management of nonpresbyopic ocular accommodation disorders, and procedures for examining such conditions. These topical parameters were chosen because they are areas in which the diagnostic procedures and treatment options available to members of the two professions are not delineated by their respective scopes of practice.The most frequently cited journals in the optometric publications were optometry journals (63% of citations in the optometry textbooks and 58% in the optometry journal articles). The most frequently cited journals in the ophthalmology publications were ophthalmology journals (79% of citations in the ophthalmology textbooks and 49% in the ophthalmology journal articles). Each discipline also cited a greater variety of journals from within its own field than was cited by the other discipline. The journal with the highest total number of citations was Optometry and Vision Science (280) followed by Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics (73), American Journal of Ophthalmology (68), Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (62), and Optometry (61).Optometry and ophthalmology sources show more citations to materials from their own discipline than from their fellow discipline in the area of nonstrabismic binocular vision disorders and nonpresbyopic accommodative disorders. Reasons may include lack of awareness of the literature of the other discipline, bias toward the literature of one's own discipline, or bias against the literature of another discipline. It is also likely that the diagnostic and management strategies of the two professions are significantly different, although scope of practice would not constrain the range of strategies for the conditions chosen as the topical matter for consideration in this study.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4361218031", "title": "Tackling the challenge of needless surgical waste in ophthalmology", "text": "In a survey of North American cataract surgeons conducted by the Ophthalmic Instrument Cleaning and Sterilization (OICS) Task Force and published in 2020, 93% felt that operating room (OR) waste was excessive and should be reduced.1 In this issue, a new ESCRS survey shows a similar consensus within Europe (Chang et al., page 341).2 This begs the question: if more than 1500 ophthalmic surgeons from 2 major continents are nearly unanimous in this opinion, why do we continue to waste so much and how can we surmount this problem? Can a root cause analysis of this complex predicament suggest strategies to pursue? A Need for Education Changing long-established behavior and practices requires us to understand the importance and urgency of doing so. In these 2 surveys of ophthalmologists' attitudes toward OR waste, 43% of North American and 32% of European cataract surgeons said that they were completely unaware of the environmental impact of the healthcare system and of surgical waste.1,2 A 2019 report from Health Care Without Harm estimated that the healthcare sector is responsible for 4.4% of all global greenhouse gas emissions; 71% of these emissions come from the manufacture, use, and disposal of healthcare supplies.3 If the global healthcare sector was a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter in the world.4 The healthcare system accounts for nearly 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, where it is the second largest contributor to landfills after the food industry.5,6 ORs account for a major share of the total emissions and waste from the healthcare sector.7 Amid the pandemic of the century, the World Health Organization declared in 2021 that climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity.8 Poorer countries and communities will disproportionately bear the burden of poor air quality and food and water shortages.9 Climate change also compromises eye health.10 According to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), the climate crisis will disrupt eyecare delivery and inequitably increase many eye diseases, such as blinding infections, in the most vulnerable populations.11 Although ophthalmologists are specialists, we are also physicians who should be concerned and alarmed by these forecasts. In 2021, the National Academy of Medicine launched the Action Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Care Sector.12 That same year, IAPB declared a climate emergency and called on our profession to take action.11 Because our specialty has the highest procedural volumes, ophthalmology has a compelling opportunity and obligation to lead efforts within medicine to make our essential services more sustainable.13 Simple and immediate steps to reduce waste, such as eliminating infrequently used custom-pack items or recycling paper and plastic packaging, might be implemented if more ophthalmologists and nurses understood the detrimental impact of healthcare's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.7,14 Infection Control Guidelines: Recommendations or Requirements? Organizations that accredit and license surgical facilities are charged with safeguarding patients from healthcare-associated complications and infections. Universal OR infection control recommendations are typically developed by guidelines committees within organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses (AORN) in the United States. Many scientifically proven recommendations should be mandatory requirements. Others, based on the opinions of experts without peer-reviewed studies, might better serve as guidance or suggestions. Regulatory and licensing bodies, however, may decide to mandate and enforce these recommendations that are more eminence than evidence based. In 2015, AORN recommended wearing bouffant head covers and long-sleeved surgical jackets in the OR, and The Joint Commission subsequently began enforcing these AORN recommendations as compulsory requirements. However, a study of more than 34 000 inpatient surgeries at the University of Alabama found that these regulations, which cost more than $300,000 annually to comply with, did not lower the rate of surgical site infection.15 Expert opinions are subject to bias, and in this case, the assumption of greater safety was contradicted by the evidence. Another issue is that universal infection control guidelines are applied to all surgeries by default. However, it stands to reason that some measures (eg, many environmental infection control guidelines) required for orthopedic or thoracic surgery would be unnecessary for ophthalmic procedures, which are relatively clean. In the United States, compulsory guidelines to prevent airborne microbial cross-contamination include disinfecting the OR countertops between cataract surgeries and discarding multi-dose vials of injectable drugs after a single use in the OR. However, multiple studies prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic concluded that the risk for cross-contamination from aerosolized pathogens during phacoemulsification is exceedingly remote.16–21 This underscores the need for more research to ascertain which universal infection control policies do or do not lower the endophthalmitis risk. The widely accepted use of short-cycle instrument sterilizers for cataract surgery is another example of why we need infection control guidelines that are specific to ophthalmology. In 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ruled that immediate use steam sterilization, the replacement term for flash sterilization, was not acceptable for routine surgical instrument sterilization.22 In response, the OICS task force, comprised of representatives from ASCRS, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), and the Outpatient Ophthalmic Surgery Society (OOSS), was established to develop specialty-specific guidelines for the cleaning and sterilization of ophthalmic surgical instruments.23 A study conducted by the task force determined that short-cycle instrument sterilization and unwrapped settings were appropriate for sequential same-day ophthalmic cases when performed in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug (FDA)-approved sterilizers.24 As a result of discussions with the OICS task force, the CMS continues to allow short-cycle sterilization for ophthalmic instruments.25 Because tissue contamination of cataract surgical instruments is usually insignificant, the guidelines also discouraged routine use of enzymatic cleaners because of the unique risk for toxic anterior segment syndrome posed by introducing microscopic detergent residue into the anterior chamber.23 Surgical Manufacturing Industry Most ophthalmologists want manufacturers to offer more reusable options for surgical supplies, drugs, devices, and instruments.1,2 Most are also willing to reuse single-use ophthalmic devices reprocessed by third parties, although this is rarely an option at present. Survey respondents most frequently cited profit motive and liability protection as factors driving the surgical manufacturing industry toward single-use products. Another commonly cited problem was the lack of environmental considerations in product design and packaging. The largest surgical manufacturers in ophthalmology have heeded these concerns and committed to reducing product emissions and waste. Some are targeting carbon neutrality across their global operations. Governmental directives, such as the European Union (EU) taxonomy regulations, are accelerating corporate prioritization of environmental goals. On the other hand, onerous and costly regulatory approval processes often impede the ability of manufacturers to mitigate carbon emissions through improved surgical product design and packaging. For example, simply reducing the amount of plastic packaging may require a manufacturer to revalidate the safety and efficacy of the medical device following this change. Meanwhile, the new EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) policy has introduced stricter requirements and is forcing manufacturers to recertify many previously approved devices. Increasingly stringent certification requirements may hamper or imperil responsible corporate efforts to decrease surgical waste and emissions. Regulatory Enforcement of Device Manufacturers' Instructions for Use Regulatory agencies, such as the EU MDR and the FDA, require manufacturers of medical instruments and devices to provide detailed instructions on how to clean, disinfect, and/or sterilize these items. These instructions for use (IFU) also specify whether an item can be reprocessed and reused. These recommendations are not always based on scientific evidence. Because manufacturers may be required to revalidate the safety and efficacy of a product that has been reprocessed, it is generally much easier to obtain commercial approval for a single-use indication. Specifying single use may also reduce product liability. As an example, some companies label their titanium phacoemulsification tips single use, whereas others allow multiple uses. In a study performed at the Moran Eye Center (Salt Lake City, Utah), we could not identify any significant ultrastructural differences between brand new tips and single-use tips that were used multiple times in a testing model.26 This is consistent with the absence of any clinical evidence that reusing phacoemulsification tips is unsafe. The 2009 U.S. Recovery Act funded increased ambulatory surgery center (ASC) oversight and inspections by the CMS. That same year, the CMS issued a new set of ASC Conditions for Coverage, including many compulsory infection control measures.27 CMS surveyors were instructed to \"Determine whether the ASC re-uses devices marketed for single use, and if so, does it send them to an FDA-approved vendor for reprocessing?\" The new guidelines specified that only devices approved by the FDA for reprocessing could be reused and that this must be done by an FDA-approved reprocessor. These changes effectively eliminated any physician or facility discretion to reuse any products labeled single use. Most cataract surgeons want device and supply manufacturers to allow more discretion to reuse products in their IFU.1,2 Without specifying single use, manufacturers could limit their liability with a disclaimer that the safety of reprocessing and reusing the product has not been established. Regulatory agencies should not require or mandate single use unless deemed necessary by the manufacturer. By strictly enforcing every single-use label, the CMS puts the onus on manufacturers to validate reprocessing through the FDA and precludes physicians from using their judgment while considering other scientific evidence, such as the phacoemulsification tip study. Affording surgical facilities greater discretion regarding device reuse within their instrument processing policies and procedures would significantly reduce unnecessary waste. Another unnecessary and wasteful practice is the inclusion of printed IFU with every device (Figure 1). Despite standardized usage, virtually every IOL, ophthalmic viscosurgical device, and medication package contains a printed IFU in multiple languages. The size of the intraocular lens (IOL) box is often determined by the size of the paper IFU booklet. What prevents companies from providing this same information digitally, such as with a QR code that could be scanned by any mobile device even during a power outage? Incredibly, there are more than 60 countries that currently do not accept eIFU for medical devices. Many are smaller low- to middle-income countries, but the list also includes South Africa, Russia, and China. For globally marketed products, providing eIFU might therefore require 2 production lines to package a product, both with and without a paper IFU.Figure 1.: Manufacturers' Instructions for Use pamphlets printed in multiple languages are an example of waste. On right, the instructions for a monofocal IOL; on left, instructions for the IOL cartridge.Liability Because endophthalmitis is a potentially blinding complication, medicolegal concerns undoubtedly influence decision-making in ophthalmic ORs. As mentioned, liability also affects whether manufacturers allow reuse in their IFU, even if there is no evidence that reprocessing the device several times is unsafe. It has been estimated that defensive medicine costs approximately $46 billion annually in the United States.28 To that we must add the incalculable environmental impact of unnecessarily discarding most products after a single use. Although physician surveys are not scientific, they are relevant to considerations of what practices violate community standards. For example, in the 2 OR waste surveys, 48% of Europeans and 32% of North Americans were reusing intraocular antibiotic solutions on multiple patients; another 39% and 63%, respectively, were not but were willing to consider reuse.1,2 What Should We Do? Ophthalmologists must collectively implore the surgical manufacturing industry to provide us with more reusable products and devices. In the 2 OR waste surveys, 8 to 10 times as many surgeons would prefer a reusable over a disposable instrument of equal cost.1,2 Research and development should be directed toward more environmentally friendly product design and packaging. For example, pairing preloaded IOL cartridges with reusable injectors would generate less plastic waste than current single-use, preloaded IOL insertion systems. Professional societies should advocate for reducing regulatory obstacles that either dissuade or impede manufacturers' efforts to reduce the environmental impact of their products. Regulatory agencies such as the EU MDR and the U.S. FDA should both encourage and ease the requirements for validating reprocessing of devices. An immediate and meaningful reduction in unnecessary medical waste would result if regulatory agencies stopped enforcing every manufacturer's single-use recommendation as a compulsory requirement, unless disallowing reuse was based on well-established evidence. Commensurate with off-label prescribing, surgeons should have reasonable discretion to reuse appropriate products under the auspices of their surgical facility's policies and procedures. It is an irrational regulatory paradox to permit off-label intraocular injection of a topical antibiotic solution and intrascleral haptic fixation of an IOL but prohibit reusing a phacoemulsification tip. Nor should every CDC or AORN infection control recommendation be enforced as a mandatory requirement, especially considering the wide variation in procedure types. Prior to 2009, ASCs in the United States were given much greater latitude to responsibly develop infection control policies that were appropriate for their individual setting and mix of procedures. As was done with the OICS task force instrument processing guidelines, ophthalmic societies should collaborate to develop evidence-based, specialty-specific infection control guidelines for ophthalmic surgery where appropriate.23 Without these, universal across-the-board guidelines that are unnecessary or inappropriate for ophthalmic surgery may be enforced by default.25 In 2022, the ASCRS, AAO, OOSS, and the American Glaucoma Society released a multisociety position paper on reducing unnecessary topical drug waste at surgical facilities.29 The OICS task force researched the relevant literature and the policies of multiple regulatory and accreditation agencies in the United States. The resulting position paper recommended that multidose bottles of topical drugs could be used on multiple ophthalmic surgical patients until the expiration date. Furthermore, the OICS Task Force convinced the CMS to clarify for its surveyors that, unlike injectable medications, multidose eyedrop bottles do not need to be discarded after 28 days; if not contaminated, they can be used until the date of expiration.30 In both the North American and European OR waste surveys, most respondents wanted their medical societies to advocate for more sustainable delivery of eyecare.1,2 EyeSustain was created to fulfill that aspiration and to centralize resources and information on sustainability for our entire profession. With both a website (www.eyesustain.org) and an app, EyeSustain is a global coalition of ophthalmic societies and their members, who are committed to advancing the sustainability of eyecare through research, education, advocacy, and collaboration with industry and with other medical specialties. EyeSustain has prioritized reducing unnecessary surgical waste because of its considerable economic and environmental impact and the increased risk for supply chain shortages. The AAO has recently joined ASCRS and ESCRS as cosponsors of EyeSustain. Numerous other global organizations have joined EyeSustain as member societies, including the American Society of Retina Specialists and EURETINA (European Society of Retina Specialists), who have agreed to codevelop a section on sustainability in retinal care. Every member society has pledged to incorporate sustainability into its educational programs, to establish a committee on sustainability, and to designate representatives to a global EyeSustain council that will share and disseminate new information, publications, position papers, and innovative ideas across an international network. What can ophthalmologists and surgical facilities do right now? The EyeSustain website offers several recommendations, which individual surgical facilities can formally pledge to pursue. In addition to using multidose bottles for topical drugs, centers should consider eliminating the whole-body drape and not changing patients into hospital gowns for ophthalmic surgery. Regularly reviewing custom surgical packs may identify infrequently used items to eliminate. Reusable instrument or device options, such as diamond blade keratomes, should be considered. Recycling strategies should be implemented where feasible.14 In one large ophthalmic center, switching from water-based to alcohol-based hand scrub for surgical prep was calculated to save more than 61 000 L of water and more than $280,000 annually per operating room.31 Finally, staff education and appointing a nurse and/or physician sustainability officer can motivate a team approach to safely reducing unnecessary waste.7 Small initial steps can make an immediate impact and spur greater progress in the future. Evidence and Opportunity A reason for optimism is that we already have a compelling waste reduction blueprint to guide our research and advocacy efforts. In a special issue on planetary health published by the Royal College of Surgeons of England, we wrote about frugal innovation for global surgery.32 The premise was that low- to middle-income countries can teach us about more efficient and sustainable use of resources. Without the luxury of allowing needless waste, low-resource healthcare settings, such as India's Aravind Eye Care System (AECS), have long optimized value-based care out of necessity. To provide 60% of its services and surgery to an indigent population, every AECS hospital routinely reuses surgical gowns, gloves, irrigation bottles, phaco cassettes and irrigation-aspiration tubing, cannulas, metal blades, and both topical and intraocular drugs.33 They do not change patients into hospital gowns and simultaneously prepare and operate on multiple patients within the same OR. As a result, the carbon emissions generated by one phacoemulsification at AECS is approximately 1/20 of that generated by one phacoemulsification in the United Kingdom.34 Because each of these practices (other than topical drug reuse) is a forbidden infection control violation in the United States, one would expect their postoperative endophthalmitis (POE) rate to be much higher than ours. In fact, it is not. Using their electronic data registry, we reported that the POE rate in 2 million consecutive cataract surgeries at AECS from 2011 to 2018 was 0.04%.35 Half of this population did not receive intracameral (IC) antibiotics. The AAO Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry reported an identical 0.04% POE rate in 8.5 million consecutive cataract surgeries during an overlapping period from 2013 to 2017.36 Approximately half of American surgeons would have been using IC antibiotics in 2014.37 Routine IC moxifloxacin prophylaxis further lowered the POE rate at AECS to 0.01% in 335 000 consecutive phacoemulsification procedures.35 Big data analytics allow us to compare the rate of rare complications associated with different policies and practices. In a subsequent study, we found no improvement in the POE rate at AECS after they temporarily adopted new infection control measures on resuming surgery following the national COVID-19 moratorium on elective eye surgery in 2020.38 The new measures enacted to prevent viral cross-contamination were changing patients into hospital gowns, operating on one patient at a time in the OR, changing gloves after every case, and cleaning OR counters and floors between patients. This and the other studies of potential COVID-19 transmission during phacoemulsification provide persuasive evidence that cataract surgery is a relatively clean procedure with a low risk for microbial cross-contamination.16–21 This would explain why strict enforcement of compulsory bans on reusing most ophthalmic surgical supplies and devices failed to produce a measurable benefit, while generating massive amounts of waste.35,36 These registry studies do not scientifically establish that reusing ophthalmic surgical products is always safe and should be routinely adopted. However, these data challenge and contradict the extremely costly assumption that rigorously enforcing single-use mandates and proscribing physician discretion is making ophthalmic surgery safer. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency that oversees the CMS, recently proclaimed its commitment to protecting those most vulnerable to illness caused by climate change.39 This noble mission should prompt a willingness by the CMS to reconsider numerous mandated infection control policies that, without proven benefit, unnecessarily increase carbon emissions. With finite resources, global policy-makers must prioritize value-based medicine to maximally enhance public health. Instead, excessive and onerous regulations continue to escalate needless resource waste to unsustainable and detrimental levels worldwide. Due to their staggering economic and environmental impact, overzealous and unproven infection control practices and regulations in ophthalmic surgery will ultimately do more harm than good to the overall health of our society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000001175", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4361218031", "source": "openalex"}

Current literature shows a lack of diversity within ophthalmology. Thus, we aimed to develop a longitudinal mentorship program between first year ophthalmology residents (PGY2s) and first year medical students (M1s) coming from minority communities underrepresented in medicine (URM) to provide early exposure to the field. Methods M1 members of URM organizations were recruited and paired with PGY2 ophthalmology residents in a mentorship program between 2017 and 2019. All participants were surveyed twice annually. Results All 2017 M1s stated increased interest in ophthalmology, felt “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the program, and completed all requirements. At the year-end, the mean educational value of the program for 2017 M1s was rated 4.33/5, and interest in ophthalmology 4.67/5. Quality of the clinical experiences for 2017 PGY2s 3.5/5, and the overall effectiveness of the program 3.5/5. At the year-end, the average educational value of the program for 2018 M1s was 4.4/5, and interest in ophthalmology 4.0/5. Quality of the clinical experiences for 2018 PGY2s was 3.1/5, and the overall effectiveness of the program was 3.4/5. Conclusion Our “pipeline” program represents an ongoing effort to increase URM interest in ophthalmology. Continued assessment to identify areas for growth and improvement can optimize the program to aid other programs in initiating efforts to tackle this important issue.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3402074", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3000361038", "source": "openalex"}

Due to experimental studies it was proved that ultrasound of different power, intensity and exposure causes thermal, mechanical and biological effect on the eye tissue. Thermal effect caused by ultrasonic energy absorption by biological tissues, which is converted from acoustic energy into thermal energy. The mechanical effect is determined by the amplitude of ultrasonic pressure acting on the eye structures during the examination. For the safety of ultrasound scanning, such concepts as thermal (TI) and mechanical (MI) indices have been introduced, which allows to control the level of acoustic impact on tissues. Ultrasound diagnosis in ophthalmology went a long way from one-dimensional echography (A-mode) to the complex scanning in real time, which allows to visualize different structural elements of the eye. Ultrasound eye examination is non-invasive and highly informative and thereby one of the main instrumental diagnosis methods in ophthalmology. Combination of images in gray scale, highly sensitive color and energy Doppler, 3D and sonoelastography to date greatly increased the diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative assessment the eye and orbit in normal and pathological conditions. Therefore general ultrasonic diagnostic systems are widely used in clinical practice, with obligatory correction of TI and MI values. Recommendations of the international professional organizations such as Food and Drug Adminisration (FDA) and American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM))are widely used for the ultrasonic examination of eye pathology, according to which the lowest levels of exposure and intensity of the output acoustic signal (TI and MI) should be set to get a high-quality image. There are still a lot of clinical and experimental studies to determine the optimal modes of ultrasound eye and orbit examination. However, the safety of ultrasound and its effect on eye structures are still need to be studied.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.18008/1816-5095-2018-4-447-454", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2910915665", "source": "openalex"}

There is a global agreement in the scientific community that calorie restriction (CR) can actually extend the life span of various kinds of animals so that this has become a real intervention in aging. In addition to the CR theory, the free radical theory is another important hypothesis, which is believed to be involved in aging.

In this paper, these two important aging theories, CR and free radical aging, are reviewed, and it is discussed how to apply these theories to the prevention and treatment of eye diseases. Finally, we share the preliminary results of our animal study on dry eye, and I report my personal experience as a dry eye patient, which has been alleviated by the &lt;i&gt;antiaging approach&lt;/i&gt;.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000316594", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2040956691", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3193855509", "title": "Ocular Imaging Standardization for Artificial Intelligence Applications in Ophthalmology: the Joint Position Statement and Recommendations From the Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology and the Asia-Pacific Ocular Imaging Society", "text": "This Joint Position Statement is supported by Asia Cornea Society, Asia Dry Eye Society, Asia-Pacific Glaucoma Society, Asia-Pacific Society of Ocular Oncology and Pathology, Asia-Pacific Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Asia-Pacific Strabismus and Paediatric Ophthalmology Society, Asia-Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society, and Asia-Pacific Vitreo-retina Society. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recently published a statement on the recommendation for standardization of images in ophthalmology that has been supported and endorsed by a few ophthalmology societies globally, including the Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology (APAO).1 The Asia-Pacific region, consisting of both developed and developing countries, is the home to 60% of the world's population, accounting for up to 4.3 billion.2 Given the aging population and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, there is a pressing need for digital transformation in health care.3 In ophthalmology, the standardization of ocular imaging can facilitate the push for artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and big data analytics to enhance patients' care and experience for global eye health.4–6 The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard for communication and management of medical imaging information that is widely adopted by different medical specialties for data storage, exchange, and transmission.7 It is an imaging standard that was developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and is currently managed by the Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance division in NEMA. Broadly speaking, the DICOM has various application areas, including 1) network image management; 2) network image interpretation management; 3) network print management; 4) imaging procedure management; and 5) offline storage media management.7 In radiology, DICOM standard, implemented in different radiological imaging modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, etc,8 has enabled the digital transformation of the workflow and sharing of radiological images in the large consortium for AI and machine learning. In ophthalmology, the ocular imaging consists of many different modalities that capture the anterior and posterior segment imaging, ranging from ultrasound, color fundus photos, optical coherence tomography (OCT) for macula and optic nerve, keratometers and autorefractors, optical biometry devices, visual field perimetry testing equipment, cornea topography, and widefield ophthalmology photography. Given the low compliance of ophthalmic imaging modalities, the hospital systems, the imaging device companies, and the Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) need to apply the DICOM standard for all the ocular imaging based on the AAO recommendation. The PACS is a modality of imaging technology that helps image transmission from the site of image acquisition to multiple physically disparate locations. It consists of a combination of an image acquisition device, storage device/server, transmission network, display stations, camera, and integration with the hospital information system. The American Academy of Ophthalmology Recommendations as a Reference For the ophthalmic imaging device manufacturers, it is important to comply with the AAO standards, including:1 Ophthalmic photography devices (DICOM Supplement 91) Optical coherence tomography for anterior and posterior segment (glaucoma and retina) (DICOM Supplement 110) Visual field perimetry testing equipment (DICOM Supplement 146) Optic nerve head topography and retinal thickness mapping devices (DICOM Supplement 152) Corneal topography equipment (DICOM Supplement 168) Widefield ophthalmology photography devices (DICOM Supplement 173) Optical coherence tomography angiography (DICOM Supplement 197) Key measurements in encapsulated PDF (DICOM Correction Proposal 1811) In the recent position statement, the 2 AAO recommendations are:1 1. Provide machine-readable, discrete data for user-selected reports of ophthalmic imaging or functional testing 2. Use of lossless compression for pixel or voxel data to encode the same raw data as used by manufacturers Recommendations From the APAO and the Asia-Pacific Ocular Imaging Society (APOIS) on AI Applications in Ophthalmology 1. Comply and support the AAO recommendations on ocular image standardization 2. Ensure the data privacy and patients' confidentiality for data and image deidentification during the research and development phase, approved by the institutional research ethics committee 3. Generate robust ground truth for specific use cases and ensure no overlaps between the training, validation, and testing datasets 4. Report the AI algorithm performance using the international reporting standards (eg, CONSORT-AI, SPIRIT-AI, STARD, etc) 9,10 based on the intended use clinical environment 5. Refer to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation on AI and machine learning software as a medical device action plan on tailored regulatory framework, good machine learning practice, patient-centered approach with transparency, regulatory science methods related to algorithm bias and robustness and real-world performance,11 tailoring that to specific country regulatory and clinical needs within the Asia-Pacific region 6. Consider health economics and cost-effectiveness in low-resource and resource-rich settings for AI implementation 7. Future directions in adversarial attack,12 blockchain,13,14 and federated learning15 domains to improve AI transparency and cybersecurity To ensure interoperability between imaging devices and electronic health records, the image standardization is one of the first steps that are critical to facilitate seamless communication and comprehension between the parties. With the advent of deep learning, this could potentially create a powerful imaging database and multiple robust AI algorithms that could be generalized to many parts of the world. For the Asia-Pacific region, the standard of ophthalmic care varies widely among the different countries. To improve the outcome and cost-effectiveness of global eyecare, the standardization of the image using DICOM standard could potentially create a win-win situation between many stakeholders, including patients, service providers (eg, ophthalmologists, optometrists, etc), and manufacturers. In resource-constraint low-to-middle income countries, this becomes even more relevant where more financial and manpower resources can be redirected toward early screening to reduce the incidence of blindness. Following image standardization, more effort could focus on having an agnostic platform to deidentify and share data more effectively between different countries. For AI algorithms development, testing, and deployment, there is also increasing research interest in the areas of federated learning, blockchain technology, and continuous AI learning using different platforms. In Chinese saying, the crisis is called \"Wei-Ji\" – \"Wei\" signifies danger and \"Ji\" signifies opportunity. In other words, the opportunity will always follow danger. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has catalyzed the need to digitally transform in medical care and the regulators, funders, patients, clinicians, and government are becoming more receptive to the use of AI and digital solutions. To push for AI applications in ophthalmology, image standardization is merely the start. To democratize AI, there are still many areas that require further work, including the development of reporting standards, regulatory and ethical guidelines. The APAO will continue to support the use of AI and digital innovation, powered by image standardization, with the aim to create more innovative solutions for screening, diagnosis, treatment stratification, and disease surveillance to reduce the incidence of blindness in the Asia-Pacific region.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/apo.0000000000000421", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3193855509", "source": "openalex"}

Conjunctival swabs were collected to perform direct fluorescent assay (DFA) and viral culture. Diagnosis was made according to clinical evidence and/or detection of the virus. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 statistical software.Infection was introduced to our unit after a laser photocoagulation procedure of a 28-week gestational infant and circulated rapidly within the unit due to direct transmission through contaminated medical equipment, fomites and hands of nursery staff members. Neither the patients, nor the nursery staff members developed systemic symptoms. While DFA tests were positive in seven infants, culture positivity could be demonstrated in only three infants. Contact and droplet precautions were implemented with the recommendation of the infection control team.

Data were collected on April 29 and 30, 2020.Investigators placed telephone calls to each ophthalmology practice office. Responses to 3 clinical scenarios-refraction request, cataract evaluation, and symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment-were compared regionally and between private and university centers.The primary measure was time to next appointment for each of the 3 scenarios. Secondary measures included use of telemedicine and advertisement of COVID-19 precautions.Of the 40 private practices, 2 (5%) were closed, 24 (60%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 14 (35%) remained open to all patients. Of the 20 university centers, 2 (10%) were closed, 17 (85%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 1 (5%) remained open to all patients. There were no differences for any telemedicine metric.

The macula accumulates drusen with loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors. Abnormal subretinal neovascularization is absent. There is no effective drug therapy for dry AMD and a large proportion of patients progress to legal blindness from macular atrophy. The Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study (SCOTS) was conducted to assess the effect of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) on dry AMD and other retinal and optic nerve diseases. Methods: Thirty-two eyes were treated with BMSC per the protocols in SCOTS. Provision of BMSCs in Arm 1 was via retrobulbar (RB), sub-tenons (ST) and intravenous (IV); Arm 2 via intravitreal, RB, ST and IV; Arm 3 via subretinal and IV. Patient age averaged 78 years old and ranged from 69 to 90. Visual acuity preoperatively ranged from counting fingers to 20/50-2 with an average preoperative LogMAR of 1.125. Results: Following treatment, 20 of 32 (63%) of eyes experienced improvement in visual acuity averaging 27.6% on LogMAR and ranging from 2.5% to 44.6%. The mean improvement in LogMAR was 0.963 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.42. The visual acuity remained stable in 34% of treated eyes.

These published guidelines are based on evidence taken from the literature and published trials of therapies, and consensus opinion of a representative expert panel with an interest in this condition, convened by the Emirates Society of Ophthalmology. The aim is to provide evidence-based, clinical guidance for the best management of different aspects of DME, with a special focus on vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Treatment should be initiated in patients with best-corrected visual acuity 20/30 or worse, and/or features of DME as seen on optical coherence tomography (OCT) with central retinal thickness (CRT) of at least 300 μm or in symptomatic patients with vision better than 20/25, and/or CRT less than 300 μm where there are OCT features consistent with center-involving macular edema. The treatment of DME is effective irrespective of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, and treatment must not be denied or delayed in order to optimize systemic parameters. All ophthalmic treatment options should be discussed with the patient for better compliance and expectations. Non-center-involving DME can be initially observed until progression toward the center is documented. Macular laser no longer has a primary role in center-involving DME, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy should be considered as first-line treatment for all patients, unless contraindicated.

Although the most common ocular symptom is that of iridocyclitis, the presence of retinovascular lesions, especially necrotizing retinitis, is well known but often obscured by the severity of the anterior reaction, which precludes a good view of the retina. While Behçet's disease is characterized by spontaneous remissions and relapses, no external factors have been found to explain the length of remissions.

Despite the large number of studies that have investigated SM induced ocular injuries, few of those studies have also focused on the psychological health status of victims. This study has evaluated the most prominent influences on the psychological health status of patients with severe SM induced ocular injuries. Methods This descriptive study was conducted on 149 Iranian war veterans with severe SM induced eye injuries. The psychological health status of all patients was assessed using the Iranian standardized Symptom Check List 90-Revised (SCL90-R) questionnaire. The results of patients' Global Severity Index (GSI) were compared with the optimal cut-off point of 0.4 that has previously been calculated for GSI in Iranian community. The Mann-Whitney U test, T tests and effect sizes (using Cohen's d) were employed as statistical methods. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results The mean age of patients was 44.86 (SD = 8.7) and mean duration of disease was 21.58 (SD = 1.20) years. Rate of exposure was once in 99 (66.4%) cases. The mean GSI (1.46) of the study group was higher compared to standardized cut off point (0.4) of the Iranian community. The results of this study showed that the mean of total GSI score was higher in participants with lower educational levels (effect size = 0.507), unemployment (effect size = 0.464) and having more than 3 children (effect size = 0.62). Among the participants, 87 (58.4%) cases had a positive psychological history for hospitalization or receiving outpatient cares previously and 62 (41.6%) cases had a negative psychological history. In addition, the mean of GSI in participants with negative psychological history was lower than those with positive psychological history (Mean Change Difference = -0.621 with SD = 0.120). There was a significant difference between positive and negative psychological history with respect to GSI (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion The study showed that severe ophthalmologic complications in chemical survivors are accompanied with destructive effects on psychological health status. Appropriate management may improve psychological health status in these patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7525-10-36", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164687892", "source": "openalex"}

This review aims to highlight several recent developments in these models over the past year and their ophthalmic implications. Recent findings Artificial intelligence models with a diverse range of applications in ophthalmology have been reported in the literature over the past year. Many of these systems have reported high performance in detection, classification, prognostication, and/or monitoring of retinal, glaucomatous, anterior segment, and other ocular pathologies. Summary Over the past year, developments in AI have been made that have implications affecting ophthalmic surgical training and refractive outcomes after cataract surgery, therapeutic monitoring of disease, disease classification, and prognostication.

METHODS: We searched databases Web of Science and PubMed between March 15 and July 21, 2022. Relevant and accessible articles and abstracts published after 2006 and in English only were included. RESULTS: Simulation-based cataract surgery is associated with better outcomes in the operating room and faster surgeries. Construct validity has been established across different procedures and levels in simulation-based cataract surgery and simulation-based vitreoretinal surgery. Other simulation-based procedures indicate promising results but in general lack evidence-based validity. DISCUSSION: This narrative review highlights and evaluates the current and relevant literature of modern educational simulation-based tools to train ophthalmology residents in different fundamental skills like simulation-based ophthalmoscopy and complex surgical procedures like simulation-based cataract surgery and vitreoretinal surgery. Some studies attempt to develop simulators for the use in education of ophthalmology residents. Other studies strive to establish validity of the respective procedures or modern education tools and some studies investigate the effect of simulation-based training. The most validated modern educational simulation-based tool is the Eyesi Surgical Simulator (VRmagic, Germany). However, other modern educational simulation-based tools have also been evaluated, including the HelpMeSee Eye Surgery Simulator (HelpMeSee Inc., New York, USA) and the MicroVisTouch Surgical Simulator (ImmersiveTouch, USA). CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training has already been established for residents in ophthalmology to benefit the most from skill-demanding procedures resulting in better learning and better patient handling. Future studies should aim to validate more simulation-based procedures for the teaching of ophthalmology residents so that the evidence is kept at a high standard.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-022-00559-y", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4292860046", "source": "openalex"}

Antiinflammatory agents (steroids and cyclosporine A), hormonal therapy, antibiotics, nerve growth factors, essential fatty acids are used as treatment options of DED. Current therapies attempt to reduce the ocular discomfort by producing lubrication and stimulating gland/nerve(s) associated with tear production, without providing a permanent cure for dry eye. Nanocarrier systems show a great promise to revolutionize drug delivery in DED, offering many advantages such as site specific and sustained delivery of therapeutic agents. This review presents an overview, pathophysiology, prevalence and etiology of DED, with an emphasis on preclinical and clinical studies involving the use of nanocarrier systems in treating DED. Lay Summary: Lay Summary: Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease associated with tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation. There are several review articles that summarize DED, disease symptoms, causes and treatment approaches. Nanocarrier systems show a great promise to revolutionize drug delivery in DED, offering many advantages such as site specific and sustained delivery of therapeutic agents. Very few review articles summarize the findings on the use of nanotherapeutics in DED.

The condition is treatable in early stages, but it often progresses asymptomatic and undetected. Once the symptoms become noticeable, damage in the retina might already be permanent, thus many countries have implemented retinal imaging screening programmes for their diabetic population. However, existing screening programmes are not reaching all patients, and Diabetic Retinopathy stands as a leading cause of preventable blindness in the active population. We contend that the existing technological infrastructures and clinical processes may be hindering the coverage of Diabetic Retinopathy screening programmes. This paper presents EyeFundusScopeNEO, a Tele-Ophthalmology system based on a screening information system and a mobile fundus camera, which shall support opportunistic and planned screening in primary care, using cameras that are handheld, non-invasive, avoid drug-induced pupil dilation, are usable by clinicians who are not specialised in Ophthalmology, and that cost a fraction of existing table-top fundus cameras.

Receipt of services for Medicaid-enrolled children was assessed by using a linked data set that included files from vital records, death certificates, Medicaid, Chronic Rehabilitative Services, and the Early Intervention Program. We assessed the receipt of hearing rehabilitation by 6 months of age for children with nonconductive hearing loss and routine ophthalmologic examination between ages of 1 and 2 years for all children with very low birth weight. Multivariate logistic regression was restricted to ophthalmologic examinations because of sample size.Among children with very low birth weight with nonconductive hearing loss, 20% received hearing rehabilitation by 6 months of age. Twenty-three percent of children with very low birth weight received an ophthalmologic examination between the ages of 1 and 2 years. Limiting our analysis to children < 1000 g or extending the measurement period to 7 months (hearing) and age 3 years (vision) did not substantially increase the percentage of children receiving the services. The receipt of an ophthalmologic examination was associated positively with Medicaid enrollment by the time of hospital discharge and birth in a level-3 hospital and negatively associated with higher birth weight, an Apgar score of > or = 7, and black maternal race. Among children born at < 1000 g, all of whom were eligible for the Early Intervention Program, the receipt of an ophthalmologic examination was positively associated with program enrollment.There is a shortfall in the provision of critical services for children with very low birth weight.

Larger and longer-term studies are needed to establish safety and efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial involving 2341 patients at high risk for cardiovascular events who had LDL cholesterol levels of 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) or more and were receiving treatment with statins at the maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose associated with an acceptable side-effect profile), with or without other lipid-lowering therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive alirocumab (150 mg) or placebo as a 1-ml subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 78 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage change in calculated LDL cholesterol level from baseline to week 24. RESULTS: At week 24, the difference between the alirocumab and placebo groups in the mean percentage change from baseline in calculated LDL cholesterol level was -62 percentage points (P<0.001); the treatment effect remained consistent over a period of 78 weeks. The alirocumab group, as compared with the placebo group, had higher rates of injection-site reactions (5.9% vs. 4.2%), myalgia (5.4% vs. 2.9%), neurocognitive events (1.2% vs. 0.5%), and ophthalmologic events (2.9% vs. 1.9%). In a post hoc analysis, the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) was lower with alirocumab than with placebo (1.7% vs. 3.3%; hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.90; nominal P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 78 weeks, alirocumab, when added to statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose, significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels. In a post hoc analysis, there was evidence of a reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events with alirocumab.

Setting: Academic medical center. Design: Large-scale retrospective consecutive case series. Methods: All cataract surgery cases performed by resident physicians as primary surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2015, were reviewed. Data were abstracted from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs and operative time measurements. A linear mixed-methods analysis was conducted to model changes in residents' cataract surgery operative times as a function of sequential case number, with resident identity included as a random effect in the model to normalize between-resident variability. Results: A total of 2096 cases were analyzed. A marked progressive decrease in operative time was noted for resident cases 1 to 39 (mean change −0.17 minutes per additional case, 95% CI, −0.21 to −0.12; P &lt; .001). A modest, steady reduction in operative time was subsequently noted for case numbers 40 to 149 (mean change −0.05 minutes per additional case, 95% CI, −0.07 to −0.04; P &lt; .001). No statistically significant improvement was found in operative times beyond the 150th case. Conclusions: Residents derived educational benefit from performing a greater number of cataract procedures than current minimum requirements.

We also explored the possible barriers and solutions to promoting POS in India. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 20 items, with a 5-point Likert scale, was provided to all postgraduate residents of Ophthalmology in the year 2013–2014. Semistructured interview of a selected panel of experts was carried out to understand the challenges, barriers, and opportunities for developing POS subspecialty in India. The data collected were coded and statistically analyzed using standard methods for quantitative and qualitative data. Results: Out of 81 residents, 69 responded (85.2%). The mean age of the respondents was 27.5 ± 1.23 years. Forty eight (69.0%) residents reported that there was no structured surgical teaching and systematic periodic posting in this subspecialty during their residency program. Residents who stated difficulty to understand the subject were 59%. Pursuing POS as a career choice was indicated by 21.0%. Major attracting attributes of POS fellowship were intellectual stimulation (69.7%) and independent operative skills (57.5%). Dissuading factors were difficulty to handle children (54.5%) and stress factor (48.4%). Expert views were grouped under four domains, such as doctor–patient ratio, infrastructure, training opportunities, utilization, and accessibility to POS services.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2803553987", "title": "Steps to standardize ophthalmology residency programs in India", "text": "Specialty medical training worldwide has evolved from an unstructured apprenticeship of unlimited duration to the modern, time-bound, curriculum-based and competency-driven model, with certification of the trainee and accreditation of the trainer.[123] Advanced medical training in India has been traditionally apprenticeship-based and the changeover to the contemporary system has been unenthusiastic, slow, patchy, and mostly incomplete.[45678910111213] Residency training programs in our country have an immense and untapped potential – clinical material is vast, teachers are experienced, and students are the best among their fraternity.[4] However, there is a striking disparity in the standard of infrastructure, quality of faculty, system of training, and mode of evaluation among the residency programs, which necessarily affects the final output.[45678910111213] A judicious investment of resources and efforts in standardizing the residency programs and a system-based approach will likely yield very rich dividends and positively affect the overall quality of health care in the country.[4] Structural and Functional Alterations Standardization of ophthalmology residency programs would involve structural and functional alterations. Adequate infrastructure, diagnostic and surgical equipment, facilities for patient care, substantial volume of patients, trained faculty, and creation of a teaching environment are the basic structural prerequisites that each training facility must systemically invest on. Logical steps in functional alterations include (1) adaptation of standard common curriculum, (2) incorporation of competency-based learning, (3) structured, objective and standardized formative and summative assessment, (4) certification of the trainee, and (5) accreditation of the training facility.[14] While provision of optimal structural support is a local issue that can be resolved at the level of the individual organization or the respective state government, functional alterations are systemic in nature and involve regulatory authorities such as the Universities, Medical Universities, Medical Council of India (MCI) (or National Medical Commission in its new form), and union and state governments. It will need focused advocacy on the part of the professional organizations (All India Ophthalmological Society [AIOS] and Indian Medical Association) to hustle through some of the reforms. Since the reforms essentially involve all the medical specialties, broad collaboration, ground level coordination, and a concerted effort may be required. The logical and systematic evolution of the residency training in the United States to what it is today shows us the path.[1516] Standard Common Curriculum Adaptation of common national curriculum is the basic need and the first logical step in standardizing ophthalmology residency in India. We have made substantial progress in this regard.[1718] The AIOS National Curriculum is a modification of the International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) curriculum and is a collaborative and a consensus-driven effort.[19] It is being presented in its near-final structure in this issue of Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.[17] Broad components of the curriculum include (1) basic medical sciences, (2) clinical ophthalmology, (3) optics and refraction, (4) ophthalmic super-specialties, (5) ophthalmic pathological/microbiological/biochemical sciences, (6) community ophthalmology, (7) research methodology, (8) medical ethics and professionalism, and (9) management skills.[17] Each of these has specific inherent basic, standard, and advanced goals to be achieved in postgraduate year 1, 2, and 3, respectively.[17] Practical competencies in diagnostic tests, investigation procedures, and surgical procedures are clearly listed and a minimum desired number for optimal training is prescribed.[17] Standard curriculum across the residency programs would set a common minimal training agenda that the trainers and trainees can refer to. It would further drive standardization of evaluation and certification. Obtaining regulatory approval for nation-wide implementation of the standard curriculum may be a time-consuming process. While this formal process is on, it may be good if the individual institutions and universities start implementing the new curriculum at local and regional levels.[4] Competency-Based Learning Residents and faculty have a major role to play in having their training transformed into a wholistic experience incorporating the six Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies – patient care and procedural skills, medical knowledge, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills [Table 1].[3] Each of the components of competency-based learning may be customized for India and implemented in a staged manner.Table 1: Six Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies for ophthalmology residency programsAssessment Structured, objective and standardized formative and summative assessment of the trainee is an integral part of residency training. A 360° assessment should encompass personal attributes, didactic knowledge, clinical skills, surgical skills and academic performance, and embody the six components of competency-based learning. The ACGME-American Board of Ophthalmology (ABO) Milestones project is an effort in this direction.[202122] Milestones include knowledge, skills, attitudes, and other attributes for each of the ACGME competencies organized in a developmental framework from less to more advanced [Table 2].[202122] These are descriptors and targets for resident performance as the resident progresses from entry into residency toward completion. For each reporting period, review will involve selecting one of the numbered milestones that best describes the resident's current performance level.[202122] Milestones describing patient interviewing (history-taking) skills, gonioscopy, strabismus surgery, and interpersonal skills are shown in [Tables 3-6] just as examples.[2122] A complete compilation of milestones is available online for immediate use.[2122]Table 2: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-American Board of Ophthalmology milestones for semi-annual formative assessment based on six components of competency-based learningTable 3: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-American Board of Ophthalmology milestones - patient care and procedural skills, PC 1 – patient interviewTable 4: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-American Board of Ophthalmology milestones – patient care and procedural skills, patient examination, PC 2 – specific skills (gonioscopy)Table 5: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-American Board of Ophthalmology milestones – patient care and procedural skills, operating room surgery, PC 7 – specific procedures (strabismus)Table 6: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-American Board of Ophthalmology milestones – interpersonal and communication skills, ICS 2 – communicate effectively with physicians, other health professionals, and health-related agencies – comprehensive, timely, and legible medical records; consultation requests; care transitions; conflict managementA general interpretation of levels for the ophthalmology milestones is as follows:[202122] Level 1: Demonstrates milestones expected of a resident who has had some education in ophthalmology Level 2: The resident is advancing and demonstrating additional milestones Level 3: The resident continues to advance and is demonstrating additional milestones; the resident consistently demonstrates most milestones targeted for residency Level 4: The resident has advanced so that he or she now substantially demonstrates the milestones targeted for residency. This level is designed as the graduation target Level 5: The resident has advanced beyond performance targets set for residency and is demonstrating \"aspirational\" goals which might describe the performance of someone who has been in practice for several years. It is expected that only a few exceptional residents will reach this level. Assessment tools used to evaluate the milestones include 360° global evaluation, Ophthalmic Clinical Evaluation Exercise, chart audit/review, chart-stimulated recall, Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), focused skills assessment, simulation, oral/written examination, portfolio, case logs, outcome and assessment information set, Global Rating Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery, surgical skills assessment, Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric (OSCAR), video review, On-call assessment tool, and Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool. A recommended starter toolbox is as follows:[14] Patient care – OSCE and patient surveys Medical knowledge – written and oral examinations Practice-based learning – record review, chart audit, and portfolios Interpersonal skills – OSCE, direct observation, and patient surveys Professionalism – OSCE and 360° global ratings System-based practice – 360° global ratings Surgery – OSCAR, OSCE, video review, and portfolio. The AIOS National Curriculum lists out the assessment strategy, scoring pattern, and timelines in detail.[17] As we further evolve, we may have to streamline to integrate the objectives of competency-based learning into the formative assessment strategy. The steps involved may be as follows: Without reinventing the wheel, we may simply customize the milestones and the incumbent assessment tools to Indian residents and build this into our residency programs. Comprehensive formative assessment is ideally performed during and after each clinical rotation The OSCAR is a standardized, internationally-valid tool to teach and assess an ophthalmologist's competence in performing surgery.[23] This behavioral and skill-based rubric allows the evaluator to objectively assess the resident's competence in performing a specific procedure.[23] OSCAR rubrics are available currently for extracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification, pediatric cataract surgery, small incision cataract surgery, strabismus, lateral tarsal strip surgery, trabeculectomy, and vitrectomy.[23] These may be used for in-program evaluation of surgical skills An annual centralized online Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) designed to measure the ophthalmic knowledge of residents relative to their peers using a set of standardized multiple-choice questions may be evolved by the AIOS. Short of it, OKAP International is already offered by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and is readily available to interested residency programs[24] It is strongly recommended that each resident maintains a logbook (portfolio) to help track individual progress. Royal College of Ophthalmology's e-Portfolio is an eminent effort in systematizing and modernizing the portfolio.[25] It may be suitably customized to support the attributes of the AIOS National Curriculum Structure for an exit examination at the end of residency is very well laid out in the AIOS National Curriculum.[17] It would be ideal to have a single national exit examination so that the quality can be benchmarked. Certification Certification, incorporating profession-driven standards and requirements, is granted to those who meet a series of accredited medical training requirements in ophthalmology and complete an intensive evaluation process. The basic requirements for certification are that there should be a formal certification authority (such as the ABO) and a well-defined process.[26] It would take organized efforts to build in the concept and process of certification and time-bound recertification into the Indian medical education system. Currently, the ICO examinations provide a method of individual certification.[27] The examinations promote the excellence of eye care worldwide by encouraging individuals to acquire and maintain the highest standard of practice of ophthalmology and are the only worldwide medical-specialty examinations.[27] Hundreds of residents from India voluntarily participate in the ICO examinations every year. Certification currently remains an aspirational goal in India. At best, we could move toward an informal and a voluntary certification process spearheaded by AIOS. We could perhaps explore the prospects of initiating a common Indian National Certification Examination based on the attributes of AIOS National Curriculum, and thereafter engage in positive advocacy to enthuse the regulatory authorities to formally implement it. Ophthalmology has been the first mover for certification in the United States in 1916, and it can be the trendsetter in India as well, albeit well over a century later. Accreditation Robust accreditation of the training programs is the most important missing link in standardizing medical subspecialty training in India. Accreditation is broadly used to understand the \"Quality Status\" of an institution. Accreditation status indicates that the training facility meets the standards of quality as set by the accreditation authority in areas of educational processes and outcomes, curriculum, teaching/training, learning, evaluation, faculty, research, infrastructure, learning resources, organizational governance, financial health, etc. The MCI and proposed National Medical Commission are supposed to be the accreditation authorities in India. Despite MCI inspections over the years, there is no evident standardization of ophthalmic training facilities (both structure and function) in India. ACGME has already moved toward the Next Accreditation System (NAS) in the United States.[28] Under the NAS, ACGME will accredit US residency programs and systematically track steady resident progress in the common and specialty-specific competency-based milestones.[28] It is understandably a well thought-out and an integrated system of competency-based learning, assessment using milestones, and that, feeding to accreditation.[28] The ICO has worked to provide tools to establish accreditation systems in countries where the concept does not exist or is at best rudimentary.[27] It has developed \"ICO International Guidelines for Accreditation of Ophthalmology Training Programs\" and \"ICO Accreditation Self-assessment Template.\"[2930] These are two powerful tools that can be offered for voluntary use in India. AIOS may indulge in strong and strategic advocacy to help incorporate the system of accreditation in its true form and spirit into the functions of the proposed National Medical Commission. Energetic and enthusiastic incorporation of the national curriculum for training, competency-based learning, robust formative and summative assessment, common certification of the trainees, and rigorous accreditation of the training programs are much needed to standardize ophthalmic training in India and take it to the next level. Voluntary adaptation of the national curriculum perhaps may be the all-important first catalytic step in this predictably long, but a potentially a rewarding journey.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_832_18", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2803553987", "source": "openalex"}

This non-randomised study attempts to quantify the educational gains, and relative efficacy of video and written pre-learning materials, in ophthalmology undergraduate teaching. Methods Ninety-eight final year medical students were contacted prior to their three-day ophthalmology placements at a British tertiary ophthalmology unit. All participants were sent welcome packs prior to arrival requesting they undertake 90 min of work focusing on a list of specified ophthalmic conditions. One cohort ( N = 33) were sent written materials, another ( N = 32) was provided with video materials and a third cohort ( N = 33 ) were not sent any materials. On arrival participants completed a simple knowledge test, a questionnaire estimating the time they spent preparing for the placement and a self-reported knowledge score. The teaching on placement was the same for all cohorts. At the conclusion of each placement participants completed a challenging knowledge test, a clinical skills test and repeated self-reported knowledge scores. Results Eighty seven percent of students receiving specified materials claimed to complete pre-placement work compared to 70% of those receiving learning outcomes alone ( p = 0.05). Students receiving learning materials scored higher in the post-placement tests of knowledge ( p &lt; 0.001), 74.8% (72.4–77.2%) vs 63.6% (95%CI 59.3–67.9%) and skills ( p = 0.04), 86.9% (83.9–89.9%) vs 81.3% (77.2–85.4%).

Materials and methods : Rhesus monkeys treated with TBI photon doses up to 8.5Gy and proton doses up to 7.5Gy were studied at intervals up to 25 years post-irradiation. They were compared with control groups with a similar age distribution. Cataract formation and ocular fundus lesions were scored according to a standardized protocol.

Significant cataract induction was observed for photondoses of 8 and 8.5Gy and beyond 20 years after proton irradiation. The severity of the lesions represents significant impairment of vision and would require cataract surgery if similar results occurred in human bone marrow transplant patients. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a normal pattern of retinal vessels in 13 out of 14 animals (93%) from the irradiated group and in eight out of nine animals (89%) from the control group. No additional lesions apart from age-related degenerative changes could be demonstrated. Histological evaluation revealed no radiation-associated vasculopathy.

We, like others, 3-5 initially made the logical assumption that patients with CF who have rapid deterioration of FEV1% would have an increased risk of death. It has been hypothesized that the subset of patients with the most rapid decline in FEV1% would gain a survival benefit from lung transplantation. We created theoretical survival models based on this hypothesis that suggested that we might be able to identify appropriate transplantation candidates several years before the optimal moment for transplantation. This would decrease the number of patients who die while on a waiting list, and optimize the use of donated organs. Unfortunately, none of these models are valid because we also found that the rate of decline in FEV1 %i s not a significant predictor of survival. 6 In our previous work, univariate logistic regression analysis showed that rate of decline of FEV1% predicted was not a significant predictor of survival. 6 We now report that, despite the lack of significance, we included the rate of decline of FEV1% predicted in further multivariate analyses because of its clinical appeal. This variable, whether calculated by linear regression or by linear mixed-effects analysis, again was not statistically significant and was excluded in stepwise analysis of variance when FEV1% was also included in candidate models. Because we were initially skeptical of this result, we attempted to use the linear mixed effects model of FEV1% rate of change to predict future FEV1%. We identified 12477 patients in the CF Foundation Patient Registry with 2 to 5 years of pulmonary function data from 1987 through 1992. We generated linear mixed-effects models of the rate of change of FEV1% for each patient and predicted the change in FEV1% for 1993 through 1997. The FIGURE shows the complete inability of the FEV1% rate of change to make that prediction. Because the rate of FEV1% decline was not predictive of survival or even of future FEV1%, as shown here, it was not included in our evaluation of the survival effects of lung transplantation. Based on this additional analysis, we conclude that the rate of decline in FEV1% is not helpful in the selection of patients with CF for lung transplantation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.12.1523", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1580646864", "source": "openalex"}

Fifty percent of all respondents had no debt and 14.7% had more than $300,000 in debt. Forty-four (43.1%) rated the quality of pediatric ophthalmology teaching in their residency program as \"excellent,\" 37 (36.3%) did not enjoy performing clinical ophthalmologic examinations on children, 83 (81.4%) had a clinical role model in pediatric ophthalmology, 29 (28.4%) believed pediatric ophthalmology is a prestigious subspecialty, 47 (46.1%) reported that economic factors influenced their post-residency decisions, 60 (58.8%) believed a hybrid fellowship combining adult cataract surgery and pediatric ophthalmology would be a popular fellowship, and 58 (56.9%) had a first-year (PGY-2) residency rotation of at least 1 month in pediatric ophthalmology. Enjoying the ophthalmologic examination of children most strongly predicted whether a resident would pursue a pediatric ophthalmology fellowship (Phi = 0.482).The desire to work with children overwhelmingly superseded other factors influencing a resident's decision to pursue a pediatric ophthalmology fellowship. Improving economic issues may be one of several factors that increase the attractiveness of the pediatric ophthalmology subspecialty. There is a dilemma in encouraging more residents to pursue pediatric ophthalmology in the setting of fewer technological advances consistent with lower perceived prestige.

The first soft contact lens had been recently approved for general use, and there were glowing reports about its successful application in previously contact lens-intolerant patients. By that stage of my training, I had already decided on a career as a pediatric ophthalmologist. So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the section of the program devoted to strabismus. The moderator of those lectures began with an acknowledgment of the great advances that had been made in other areas of ophthalmology, and continued with, Actually, we are not doing anything differently in the treatment of strabismus than we were 50 years ago.

The aims of the study were to investigate the advanced nursing practice and the skill‐mix of nurses working in ophthalmology. Background. The expansion of new nursing roles in the United Kingdom in the past decade is set against the background of a nursing shortage. The plan to modernize the National Health Service and improve the efficiency and delivery of healthcare services as well as to reduce junior doctors’ hours contributes towards a profusion of new and more specialized and advanced nursing roles in various areas of nursing including ophthalmology. Design. A self‐reporting quantitative questionnaire was employed. The study used comparative and descriptive statistical tests. Method. The questionnaires were distributed to all ophthalmic hospitals and units in the United Kingdom. Hospital and unit managers were responsible for completing the questionnaires. Results. Out of a total 181 questionnaires 117 were returned. There is a downward trend in the total number of nurses working in ophthalmology. The results demonstrate more nurses working at an advanced level. However, there is a general confusion regarding role interpretation at the advanced level of practice, evident through the wide range of job titles being used. There was inconsistency in the qualifications expected of these nurses. Conclusion. Whilst there are more nurses working at an advanced level this is set against an ageing workforce and an overall decline in the number of nurses in ophthalmology. There is inconsistency in job titles, grades, roles and qualifications for nurses who work at an advanced or higher level of practice. The Agenda for Change with its new structure for grading jobs in the United Kingdom may offer protection and consistency in job titles, pay and qualifications for National Health Service nurse specialists. The Nursing and Midwifery Council needs to provide clear guidelines to the practitioners on educational and professional requirements, to protect patients and nurses. Relevance to clinical practice. The findings indicate that there is a need for better regulations for nurses working at advanced nursing practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2005.01455.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139113861", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Approximately 1,000 pediatric ophthalmology surgeons were invited to complete an anonymous 10-question survey. Respondents were divided into two groups: those who performed or attempted wrong-site surgery (wrong-site surgery group) and those who had never performed a wrong-site surgery (intended surgical site group). The risk factors (ie, marking procedure, years in practice, surgical experience, adherence to the Universal Protocol time-out, and operating room factors) were compared between groups. Results: Of the 156 respondents, 56.4% never performed, 9% attempted, and 34.6% performed a wrong-site surgery. The use of any procedure to mark the eye decreased the likelihood of a wrong-site surgery by 61% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39; P = .069). A lower likelihood of error occurred when a single individual led the time-out and multiple individuals participated in checking the accuracy of the time-out. Surgeons in practice for less than 15 years had a lower likelihood of performing a wrong-site surgery (OR = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.19 to 0.72; P = .003). Factors not significantly associated with wrong-site surgeries were the number of surgeries performed per year (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.35 to 1.24; P = .20) and the number of operating rooms used. Conclusions: In concordance with previous reports of other surgical specialties, self-reported error in pediatric ophthalmology is not uncommon. This study highlighted important practices that can be easily adopted by surgeons to decrease the likelihood of wrong-site surgeries. First, marking the surgical site must be part of the preoperative preparation. Second, a single designated individual should lead the time-out and the surgeon should be directly involved in all steps of the time-out process. Third, surgeons who have been in practice for more than 15 years may require additional safeguards to ensure that the correct surgery is performed and to monitor their complacency.

Objective To assess the trends and characteristics in research payments reported from industry to ophthalmologists from 2014 to 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers of Medicare &amp;amp;amp; Medicaid Services’ Open Payments database (OPD), which contains public records of payments between industry and physicians, to identify all ophthalmologists who received industry payments for research purposes between 2014 and 2020. Industry funding was compared with public research funding by the National Eye Institute. Main Outcomes and Measures The value and distribution of payments, sponsoring manufacturers, and research products were assessed. Changes in aggregate and per individual-level funding were characterized using formal trend analysis. Results From 2014 to 2020, 2102 ophthalmologists were reported to have received $825 417 233 in industry research payments. Industry funding increased 203% from $62 924 525 in 2014 to $190 714 508 in 2020 ( P = .01). Comparatively, total National Eye Institute research funding during the same period was $5 003 407 764 and increased 6.6% from $701 313 262 in 2014 to $747 929 556 in 2020 ( P = .04). The share of all medical research funding from industry directed specifically toward ophthalmology research increased from 1.2% in 2014 to 3.2% in 2020 ( P = .04). The distribution of industry payments was skewed, with the top 15 of 108 manufacturers accounting for 93.9% of funding. The top 10% of ophthalmologists (210) were reported to have received 65.7% of all research dollars ($542 299 121). The highest funded research products were anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents, glaucoma treatments, and intraocular lenses. Conclusions and Relevance Although unequal in distribution, industry-funded research in ophthalmology is extensive and increasing in scope. Industry funding for research is less than that of public funding; however, industry funding increased faster between 2014 and 2020.

AM technology permits the fabrication of physical object based on the 3D CAD model through layer by layer manufacturing method. AM use Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and 3D scanning images and these data are converted into surface tessellation language (STL) file for fabrication. The applications of AM in ophthalmology includes diagnosis and treatment planning, customized prosthesis, implants, surgical practice/simulation, pre-operative surgical planning, fabrication of assistive tools, surgical tools, and instruments. In this article, development of AM technology in ophthalmology and its potential applications is reviewed. The aim of this study is nurturing an awareness of the engineers and ophthalmologists to enhance the ophthalmic devices and instruments. Here some of the 3D printed case examples of functional prototype and concept prototypes are carried out to understand the capabilities of this technology. This research paper explores the possibility of AM technology that can be successfully executed in the ophthalmology field for developing innovative products. This novel technique is used toward improving the quality of treatment and surgical skills by customization and pre-operative treatment planning which are more promising factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/09544119211028069", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3176740195", "source": "openalex"}

This review surveys the current telemedicine landscape and discusses associated limitations and opportunities. Recent findings Logistic considerations and regulatory changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic have spurred a proliferation of tele-neuro-ophthalmic practice. One significant benefit of telemedicine is increased access to the limited number of neuro-ophthalmologists in the country. Certain elements of the neuro-ophthalmic examination can be ascertained during a video visit or through the use of mobile applications. However, data quality can be limited and more direct evaluation of the fundus currently requires the implementation of imaging techniques, such as fundus photography and/or optical coherence tomography. For cases that require it, a ‘hybrid’ model can be adopted in which patients physically present to designated locations for testing and subsequently participate in televisit with the physician to discuss the assessment and plan. Summary Telemedicine provides an alternate pathway for patients to access the limited resource of neuro-ophthalmic care, and it will likely persist beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. It has some limitations currently but continued progress in technologic, legal, and reimbursement strategies will hopefully facilitate further adoption.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000800", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3194481719", "source": "openalex"}

By analyzing this population dataset, the study illustrates the disease landscape of emergency eye care services. The five-year, one-million-person NHIRD sub-dataset for 2008 through 2012 was used to explore emergency visits and ophthalmology specialty visits and to analyze the associated demographics and diagnosis codes based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Diagnoses were categorized into three groups: urgent, non-urgent, and intermediate. A total of 2454 emergency eye care visits were identified. The mean age of the patients who made these visits was 34.6 years old, and their sex ratio was 1.36 men to women. The percentages of urgent, non-urgent, and intermediate eye care visits in this study were 48.2%, 30.9%, and 20.9%, respectively. The leading diagnoses in the urgent category were corneal abrasions, foreign bodies in the eyes, eye burns, and blunt eye injuries. The leading diagnoses for the non-urgent visits were conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhages, trichiasis, and dry eye disease. Those for the intermediate category were superficial punctate keratitis, corneal opacity and degeneration, and lid, orbital, and lacrimal drainage infections. The urgent visit category accounted for nearly half of all the visits identified in this study. Compared to outpatient department visitors, the emergency ophthalmology service patients were younger and more predominantly male. These results were consistent with those of previous reports. Low copays have made emergency ophthalmology services highly accessible in Taiwan. However, future policies can be designed to more effectively allocate resources to urgent cases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74815-1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3092701644", "source": "openalex"}

Methods We undertook a cross‐sectional study of board members and chairs of ICO and WCO member organisations using a desk‐based assessment of member organisation websites during February and March 2020. Gender and ethnicity of board members and chairs were collected using a combination of validated algorithmic software and manual assessment, based on names and photographs where available. Gender proportions were calculated across Global Burden of Disease super‐regions, and gender and ethnicity proportions in the high‐income regions of Australasia, North America and Western Europe. Results Globally, approximately one in three board members were women for both ICO (34%) and WCO (35%) members, and one in three ICO (32%) and one in five WCO (22%) chairpersons were women. Women held at least 50% of posts in only three of the 26 (12%) leadership structures assessed; these were based in Latin America and the Caribbean (59% of WCO board positions held by women, and 56% of WCO chairs), and Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania (55% of ICO chairs). In the Eurocentric high‐income regions, white men held more than half of all board (56%) and chair (58%) positions and white women held a further quarter of positions (26% of board and 27% of chair positions). Ethnic minority women held the fewest number of board (6%) and chair (7%) positions. Conclusions Improvements in gender parity are needed in member organisations of the WCO and ICO across all world regions. In high‐income regions, efforts to address inequity at the intersection of gender and ethnicity are also needed. Potential strategies to enable inclusive leadership must be centred on structurally enabled diversity and inclusion goals to support the professional progression of women, and people from ethnic minorities in global optometry and ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12793", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3134523414", "source": "openalex"}

The tool enables management to alter the number of patients in various patient groups and to see the consequences in terms of key performance indicators. In our case study, we focused on the bottleneck: the operating room. First, we performed a literature review to identify all factors that influence an operating room's utilization rate. Next, we decided which factors were relevant to our study. For these relevant factors, two quantitative methods were applied to quantify the impact of an individual factor: regression analysis and computer simulation. Finally, the average duration of an operation, the number of cancellations due to overrun of previous surgeries, and the waiting time target for elective patients all turned out to have significant impact. Accordingly, for the case study, the interactive tool was shown to offer management quantitative decision support to act proactively to expected alterations in patient-mix. Hence, management can anticipate the future situation, and either alter the expected patient-mix or expand capacity to ensure that the key performance indicators will be met in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-011-9168-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133834455", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of our study was to review the current indications, side-effects and updates on the clinical use of botulinum toxin- A (Btx-A) in the field of ophthalmology. Methods: A literature search using the keywords “Botulinum Toxin”, “Botulinum Toxin A”, “Botox” and “Ophthalmology” was performed using Pubmed. Articles describing the use of botulinum toxin A were selected and reviewed. Results: The uses of Btx-A in ophthalmology can be broadly classified into four categories: eyelid, strabismus, cosmetic and others. In the eyelid, it can be used to treat blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, apraxia of lid opening or induce ptosis in lid retraction and exposure keratopathy. In strabismus management, it can be injected into overacting muscles to realign the eyes. For cosmesis, it can be used to relax facial muscles to reduce wrinkles while other indications include treatment of chronic dry eye, lacrimal hypersecretion and pain relief in acute angle closure attack. Complications of the injection include local effects like ecchymosis, pain or infection and spillover effects like ptosis, diplopia, lagophthalmos, mid facial weakness and dry eyes. Conclusion: The clinical application of botulinum toxin A in ophthalmology is extensive. When considering its application in clinical practice, one should be mindful of the indications, risks and benefits of the procedure.

In all, 54 (55.7%) and 43 (44.3%) patients were treated with PegIFNα 2a and PegIFNα 2b, respectively. Ophthalmologic examination was performed before therapy (baseline), at 3 and 6 months (3T and 6T, respectively) of therapy, and 3 months after the end of therapy (3ET). All patients underwent the baseline and 3T examination, 95.9% and 90.7% of patients underwent 6T and 3ET examination, respectively. Overall, 30.9% of patients developed retinopathy, as defined by the presence of cotton wool spots and/or retinal hemorrhages. Variables significantly associated with retinopathy during treatment were age (P = 0.004), metabolic syndrome (P = 0.05), hypertension (P < 0.0001), cryoglobulinemia (P = 0.05), and preexisting intraocular lesions at baseline (P = 0.01).

The objective was to assess the incremental cost effectiveness of paediatric eye examinations carried out in an outpatient sedation unit compared with GA. <h3>Methods</h3> An episode of care cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. Model inputs were based on a retrospective cross-over cohort of Canadian children aged &lt;7 years who had both an examination under sedation (EUS) and examination under anaesthesia (EUA) within an 8-month period. Costs ($CAN), adverse events and number of successful procedures were modelled in a decision analysis with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. <h3>Results</h3> The mean cost per patient was $406 (95% CI $401 to $411) for EUS and $1135 (95% CI $1125 to $1145) for EUA. The mean number of successful procedures per patient was 1.39 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.42) for EUS and 2.06 (95% CI 2.02 to 2.11) for EUA.

Methods In this prospective observational, cohort‐based, cross‐sectional study, eight patients treated with the MEK inhibitor pimasertib received a complete ophthalmic examination. This included Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study best‐corrected visual acuity, visual field testing, colour vision testing, slit‐lamp examination, applanation tonometry, indirect ophthalmoscopy, digital colour fundus photography and optical coherence tomography ( OCT ). In selected cases, fluorescein angiography was performed. Results Serous subretinal fluid ( SRF ) developed in all patients, within a time frame of 9–27 days after the start of treatment. The fovea was involved in six of eight patients (75%). None of the patients with foveal SRF [excluding a patient who developed a bilateral retinal vein occlusion ( RVO )] experienced visual symptoms. Subretinal fluid ( SRF ) decreased or resolved in all patients, despite continuation of study medication in six of eight patients (75%). Complaints in the CM patient (13%) consisted of experiencing a dark fleck in the inferior part of the visual field of the right eye 1 week after the start of treatment, due to an RVO . Subsequent intravitreal bevacizumab treatment resulted in functional and anatomical improvement. Conclusion Patients with metastatic CM who are treated with the MEK inhibitor pimasertib are at high risk of development of ocular adverse events including serous retinopathy and possibly RVO , stressing the need of adequate ophthalmological follow‐up including OCT during administration of pimasertib, despite the fact that SRF generally does not lead to ophthalmological complaints.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.13677", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2783937102", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty-four CHC patients were prospectively evaluated (18 patients with 180 microg/week of peg-IFN-alpha2a plus 800mg/day of RBV and 16 with 1.5 microg/kg/week of peg-IFN-alpha2b plus 800-1,200mg/day of RBV).

Thirteen patients (38.2%) developed VOSE, eight (23.5%) featured subconjunctival haemorrhage, and five (14.7%) had evidence of retinopathy - all were unrelated to age, sex, genotype, the type of antiviral schedule used and response to therapy. At the end of treatment, the VOSE group had significantly higher serum VEGF levels than the group of patients without detectable side effects (median 281 [range 106-386] vs 117 [83-225] pg/ml, P=0.05).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2034623906", "title": "Refractive surgery experience for the ophthalmology resident: An update", "text": "The issue of practical resident experience in refractive surgery remains a complex challenge to ophthalmology training programs and trainees alike. Despite the large numbers of refractive surgery procedures being performed by ophthalmologists across the world, approximately half of United States ophthalmology programs graduate their residents without any primary surgeon experience in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or surface ablation procedures. Challenges to the enthusiastic adoption of resident refractive surgery programs have been pointed to in excellent articles by Aaron and Aaberg,1 Alió,2 and Randleman and Stulting.3 They include patient reluctance to accept a lower level of surgeon experience for an elective self-pay procedure, fear of training one's competition amidst a finite pool of refractive surgery candidates, concerns of patient risk, and a belief by some that refractive surgery should be the domain of subspecialty-trained cornea and refractive surgery specialists.1 At the same time, two thirds of recent U.S. ophthalmology residency graduates have expressed a need for additional training in subspecialty surgery, including refractive surgery,4 and most residents see the opportunity to gain exposure to and perform refractive surgery, regardless of their future practice patterns, as a positive (and, for some, a requisite) feature of a training program. In this issue (pages 1629–1632), Kwon et al. report the results of a 2005–2006 postal mail survey sent to residency directors, chairpersons, and refractive surgery directors of U.S. ophthalmology residency training programs that provides a snapshot of resident refractive surgery experience among residents training between 2003 and 2006. Consumers of survey data should consider a number of questions when interpreting results; among them, who was asked (faculty versus residents, subspecialty-trained cornea/refractive surgeons versus comprehensive ophthalmologists), how were the questions and answer choices phrased, and were programs that do not offer primary surgeon refractive surgery experience less likely to return a survey and thus lead to overestimation of the surgical experience across all programs? Even in light of the limitations, a comparison of the current survey and one performed by Aaron and Aaberg circa 20001 is irresistible and suggests some progress in the adoption of formal refractive surgery experience in U.S. ophthalmology residency programs. In the earlier survey, which achieved a 77% response rate, only 26% of programs claimed that residents were performing supervised LASIK cases as primary surgeon.1 The current study, with a 64% response rate, indicates that this number has effectively doubled. Another 3 years have passed since data collection for the most recent survey, and it is possible that today's numbers are higher yet. While 16% of respondents in the earlier study stated that formal LASIK training should not be a part of residency education,1 only 11% took a similar stance in the later study. Nine percent of programs in the current study indicated no resident exposure to any LASIK procedures, whether as primary surgeon or observer. The majority of programs offer marked discounts to patients undergoing surgery with a resident. The essential question underlying such surveys is this: Is refractive surgery experience fundamental to the education of the ophthalmologist? The answer, which has been reinforced by a multitude of educational initiatives by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the International Society of Refractive Surgery, and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, is an unequivocal “yes.” The goal of the residency-based refractive surgery experience should not be to produce technically skilled refractive surgeons, however. This is the aim of subspecialty training programs and concerted clinical practice after residency and could occur only at the expense of other important objectives during residency. Ophthalmology programs should offer residents significant exposure to and some practical surgical experience with refractive surgery but supported by strong didactic programs, significant clinical time devoted to the nuances of surgical decision-making and management of operative and postoperative complications, and thoughtful wet-lab experiences modeled to replicate critical procedural steps5 that allow residents to hone technical skills and confidence in advance of patient contact. Using survey results as a tool for establishing a residency review committee requirement for all ophthalmology programs seems a perilous proposition, and one that does not reflect the greater need for comprehensive refractive surgery education programs. The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery and the Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery support the goal of comprehensive education by providing free subscriptions to ophthalmology residents, with the goal of providing ready access to the field's clinical and scientific dialogue and encouraging residents to participate. It is encouraging that residency programs are, without undue external pressure, responding in earnest to the expressed desire of residents to become more involved with this exciting field.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2009.06.013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2034623906", "source": "openalex"}

ISBN 978-0-19-853037-4; $55.00. Scope: This is a reference for practicing ophthalmologists and residents in training. It aims to be somewhat comprehensive yet portable. The first 2 chapters on examination and test interpretation are really more applicable for those early in their practice of ophthalmology. The second major section of the book addresses the more common diagnoses associated with different sections of the eye, orbit, and central nervous system. There are small discussions of the diagnoses within each of these entities. The last section of the book is essentially an appendix with some miscellaneous information. Strengths: The authors accomplish the goal to produce a book that can be referenced easily throughout the day, during consults, patient encounters, and rounds yet be comprehensive. There are helpful hints in the examination and test interpretation sections. The diagnosis section hits most important topics. The references to evidence are beneficial. This manual is superior to many other eye manuals in that it has more than just treatment options. Weaknesses: As with most reference books, there is never enough information. Some of the anatomy and physiology text seemed out of place except in a reference for beginning residents, which just adds volume to an already voluminous book. The appendix and miscellaneous section also had information that is misplaced in a reference text. Recommended Audience: This book is aimed more to residents than to seasoned clinicians, especially the beginning chapters and anatomy discussions. However, it does have valuable information for those in practice. Critical Appraisal: This reference is useful especially for residents and provides a little more information than the traditional eye manuals. Laura D.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2054949895", "title": "The neurological and ophthalmological manifestations of SPG4-related hereditary spastic paraplegia", "text": "Dear Sirs, The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by progressive corticospinal tract degeneration and the development of lower limb spasticity [1, 2]. Autosomal-dominant HSP is the most commonly inherited form of the disease and in this group, SPG4 mutations account for ~40 % of cases [1]. The SPG4 gene codes for spastin, a critical neuronal protein that maintains organelle axonal transport by severing and rearranging the microtubule network [3, 4]. Dysfunctional mutant proteins or insufficient quantities of the wild-type protein inhibit this dynamic shuttling process resulting in axonal swelling and progressive retrograde degeneration that preferentially affects the long corticospinal axons [3, 4]. There is mounting evidence that the microtubule and mitochondrial networks are intrinsically linked at the cellular level [5]. This intriguing association has recently been highlighted by the clinical observation that autosomal-dominant optic atrophy (DOA)—a classical mitochondrial optic neuropathy caused by pathogenic OPA1 mutations—can result in complicated neurological phenotypes (DOA+) with features indistinguishable from HSP [6]. Furthermore, subclinical corticospinal tract dysfunction also seems to be a prevalent feature among OPA1 mutation carriers presenting with isolated visual failure, suggesting a wider disease spectrum than originally considered [7]. Interestingly, these overlapping genotype-phenotype manifestations have been reported previously in families with a rarer, autosomal-recessive form of HSP caused by pathogenic SPG7 mutations, in which bilateral optic atrophy was a prominent feature segregating with spastic paraplegia [8–10]. Given the emerging disease mechanisms linking corticospinal tract dysfunction with optic nerve degeneration, the aim of this study was to determine the neurological and ophthalmological manifestations of SPG4-related HSP, looking specifically for evidence of clinical or subclinical optic neuropathy among affected patients. The overall neurological disability, including cognitive function, was also evaluated to provide a comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease in this group of patients. A comprehensive neurological (GP, RH, PFC) and ophthalmological (PYWM) assessment (Supplementary Method) was carried out on ten white patients from the North of England harbouring confirmed pathogenic SPG4 mutations (Table 1). A broad spectrum of neurological disability was observed among affected patients with scores ranging from one to nine on the modified EDSS scale (Table 2). Importantly, four patients had abnormal MOCA scores of less than 26 points. Seven patients performed poorly on the memory component of the MOCA test protocol and one patient had abnormal visuospatial/executive performance. The association between SPG4 mutations and progressive cognitive decline remains controversial [11–13] and our study of a well-characterised patient cohort provides further evidence favouring a true causal link. Two of the patients with abnormal MOCA scores were younger than the age of 30 years, clearly highlighting the need for clinical vigilance to detect early signs of cognitive impairment and to provide adequate level of support, especially to carers. Table 1 Molecular genetic and ophthalmological features of the SPG4 patient cohort Table 2 Neurological and cognitive features of the SPG4 patient cohort Except for one patient who had bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts, all patients had best-corrected visual acuities of 20/20 bilaterally (Table 1). The ophthalmological examination was normal with full colour discrimination and no detectable optic disc or retinal abnormalities. Visual fields, RNFL thickness measurements and visual electrophysiology were within the normal range for the entire HSP patient cohort. Three patients had abnormal eye movements with horizontal square wave jerks and saccadic smooth pursuits. No significant ptosis or limitation of eye movements was noted on orthoptic assessment. Based on our comprehensive clinical and electrophysiological evaluation, visual loss secondary to optic nerve or retinal degeneration is unlikely to be a major phenotypic manifestation of SPG4-related disease. Affected patients and at-risk family members can therefore be reassured that unlike other genetically-determined forms of HSP [6–10], SPG4 mutations are not associated with the development of significant ophthalmological complications, in particular visual failure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-012-6780-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054949895", "source": "openalex"}

Patients' age at onset varied from 17 to 51 years old, with the average being 31.2 +/- 4.2 years. Observation period were 6 months to15 years, and average 5.4 +/- 1.4 years. In visual symptoms, retrobulbar optic neuritis was observed in 33 eyes of 26 patients. On the first attack of retrobulbar optic neuritis, 25 eyes showed a corrected visual acuity of less than 0.1. After corticosteroid therapy, a corrected visual acuity improved more than 1.0 in 17 eyes. Optic atrophy was observed in 22 eyes and color blindness in 16 eyes. On the second attack of retrobulbar optic neuritis on the same eyes, 6 of 9 eyes showed a corrected visual acuity of less than 0.1 after corticosteroid therapy. Optic atrophy and color blindness were confirmed in all eyes. Homonymous hemianopia was detected in 2 female patients and completely resolved after corticosteroid therapy. On the other hand, ocular motor symptoms were observed in 29 patients. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia was detected in 18 patients, nystagmus in 5, abducens nerve palsy in 5, skew deviation in 5, one-and-a-half syndrome in 2, gaze palsy in 2 and ocular myoclonus in 1. In all except one patient with primary position downbeat nystagmus, ocular myoclonus and bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, these symptoms improved completely within 8 weeks after corticosteroid therapy.

Objective To systematically review the experiences of females in ophthalmology (FiO) from training through practice in high-income countries (HICs). Evidence Review A systematic review of English-language studies, published between January 1990 and May 2022, relating to FiO in HICs was performed. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase electronic databases were searched, as well as the Journal of Academic Ophthalmology as it was not indexed in the searched databases. Studies were organized by theme at each career stage, starting in medical school when an interest in ophthalmology is expressed, and extending up to retirement. Findings A total of 91 studies, 87 cross-sectional and 4 cohort, were included. In medical school, mentorship and recruitment of female students into ophthalmology was influenced by sex bias, with fewer females identifying with ophthalmologist mentors and gender stereotypes perpetuated in reference letters written by both male and female referees. In residency, females had unequal learning opportunities, with lower surgical case volumes than male trainees and fewer females pursued fellowships in lucrative subspecialties. In practice, female ophthalmologists had lower incomes, less academic success, and poorer representation in leadership roles. Female ophthalmologists had a greater scholarly impact factor than their male counterparts, but this was only after approximately 30 years of publication experience. Pervasive throughout all stages of training and practice was the experience of greater sexual harassment among females from both patients and colleagues. Despite these disparities, some studies found that females reported equal overall career satisfaction rating with males in ophthalmology, whereas others suggested higher burnout rates. Conclusions and Relevance Ophthalmology is approaching sex parity, however, the increase in the proportion of females in ophthalmology had not translated to an increase in female representation in leadership positions. Sex disparities persisted across many domains including recruitment, training, practice patterns, academic productivity, and income.

Study design: A cross sectional study in which 17 patients with Behçet’s disease and 13 healthy controls were included. Patients and methods: The patients were divided into two groups: those with and without end stage ocular involvement. Neurotological status was evaluated with audiological tests (pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, short increment sensitivity index, tone decay, and evoked response audiometry), and Dix-Halpike positional testing. Results: The positional test was normal. The audiological test results of the patients with and without end stage ocular involvement were not significantly different (p&amp;gt;0.05). A sloping audiogram with bilateral symmetric and mild sensorineural hearing loss was the main audiogram obtained. There was no relationship between the presence or absence of the end stage ocular involvement and the otological parameters studied excluding I–III interval on evoked response audiometry (p&amp;gt;0.05). Conclusion: Although the main underlying pathogenetic factor in Behçet’s disease is the autoimmune vasculitis, the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurological and ocular damage may be different.

HDlive silhouette and HDlive flow are new applications of threedimensional (3D) ultrasound technology. The algorism of HDlive silhouette creates a gradient at organ boundaries where an abrupt change of the acoustic impedance exists within tissues. HDlive silhouette and flow can be called as ‘see-through fashion’. The advantages of this ‘see-through fashion’ imaging are comprehensive orientation and persuasive localization of inner structure as well as of fetal angiostructure inside the morphological structure. Picture of the month demonstrates the fetal eye at 19 weeks of gestation. The lens, vitreous body and hyaloid artery inside the vitreous humor are well demonstrated. The hyaloid artery is retrogressing during pregnancy and no remnant hyaloid artery is visible in most of mature neonates. Therefore, hyaloid artery can be observed in only young fetuses and immature neonates. HDlive silhouette and flow has enabled us to depict fetal eye and ocular vascularity three-dimensionally. This new technology has a great potential to open a new field of ‘fetal 3D sono-ophthalmology’, which has been never invented by conventional ultrasound technology. How to cite this article Pooh RK.

Intraocular Pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in analyzing retinal fundus images, a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique widely used in glaucoma diagnosis. By learning from large datasets of annotated images, CNN can identify subtle changes in the optic nerve head and retinal structures indicative of glaucoma. This enables early and precise glaucoma diagnosis, empowering clinicians to implement timely interventions. CNNs excel in analyzing complex medical images, detecting subtle changes indicative of glaucoma with high precision. Another valuable diagnostic tool for glaucoma evaluation, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina. CNN can effectively analyze OCT scans and extract meaningful features, facilitating the identification of structural abnormalities associated with glaucoma. Visual field testing, performed using devices like the Humphrey Field Analyzer, is crucial for assessing functional vision loss in glaucoma. The integration of CNN with retinal fundus images, OCT scans, visual field testing, and IOP measurements represents a transformative approach to glaucoma detection. These advanced technologies have the potential to revolutionize ophthalmology by enabling early detection, personalized management, and improved patient outcomes. CNNs facilitate remote expert opinions and enhance treatment monitoring. Overcoming challenges such as data scarcity and interpretability can optimize CNN utilization in glaucoma diagnosis. Measuring retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as a diagnostic marker proves valuable. CNN implementation reduces healthcare costs and improves access to quality eye care. Future research should focus on optimizing architectures and incorporating novel biomarkers. CNN integration in glaucoma detection revolutionizes ophthalmology, improving patient outcomes and access to care. This review paves the way for innovative CNN-based glaucoma detection methods.

BRSET comprises 65.1% Canon CR2 and 34.9% Nikon NF5050 images. 61.8% of the patients are female, and the average age is 57.6 years. Diabetic retinopathy affected 15.8% of patients, across a spectrum of disease severity. Anatomically, 20.2% showed abnormal optic discs, 4.9% abnormal blood vessels, and 28.8% abnormal macula. Models were trained on BRSET in three prediction tasks: \"diabetes diagnosis\"; \"sex classification\"; and \"diabetic retinopathy diagnosis\". BRSET is the first multilabel ophthalmological dataset in Brazil and Latin America. It provides an opportunity for investigating model biases by evaluating performance across demographic groups. The model performance of three prediction tasks demonstrates the value of the dataset for external validation and for teaching medical computer vision to learners in Latin America using locally relevant data sources.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.23.24301660", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4391171934", "source": "openalex"}

Identified risk factors were posterior capsular rupture, uveitis/synechiae, glaucoma, corneal pathology, diabetes mellitus, previous vitrectomy surgery and anti-VEGF therapy. Endophthalmitis was recorded in 308 (0.02%) eyes (1 351 415 operations performed on 920 286 patients) between April 2010-March 2021. Identified risk factors were posterior capsular rupture, uveitis/synechiae, glaucoma, corneal pathology, diabetes mellitus, previous vitrectomy surgery and anti-VEGF therapy. One of the most feared complications following cataract surgery is endophthalmitis, with sight-threatening intraocular inflammation(1Relhan N, Forster RK, Flynn HW. Endophthalmitis: Then and Now. American Journal of Ophthalmology: Elsevier Inc.; 2018. p. xx-xxvii.Google Scholar). Given the rarity of endophthalmitis, it is difficult for individual eye centres to conduct meaningful audit of cataract surgical infection rates, unless they are operating at very high volume or experienced a massive outbreak. Therefore, there is a great need for collaborative registries to study real-world post-operative infection rates. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists' National Ophthalmology Database (RCOphth NOD) is well positioned to enable large-scale analysis of the incidence of, and risk factors for, post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis within the United Kingdom. National audit registries of this nature are exempt from ethical committee approvals, and the study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors for endophthalmitis following phacoemulsification surgery. This will aid ophthalmic surgeons discussing risks with patients, allow surgeons to consider strategies to reduce these risks, and serve as a baseline for benchmarking. Included in this study were eligible patients who underwent cataract surgery in traditional National Health Service (NHS) centres submitting data to the RCOphth NOD between 1st April 2010 and 31st March 2021. Endophthalmitis was defined if any of the following occurred within 42 days of cataract surgery: post-operative complication record of endophthalmitis, post-operative diagnosis of endophthalmitis, post-cataract vitreous biopsy or anterior chamber tap. Fixed effects logistic regression was used to identify potential risk factors (full methods in online supplemental material available at www.aaojournal.org). Within the study period, 1 351 415 eligible operations were performed on 920 286 patients from 76 centres by 3 570 surgeons. Endophthalmitis was recorded in 308 (0.02%) eyes, with no cases from any of the 2 315 immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of endophthalmitis based on the grade of operating surgeon. The post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis rate ranges from 0.015 to 0.035% from year 2010 to 2020, Figure 1, Panel A. Of the 308 patients who developed endophthalmitis, 171 (55.5%) were female and the median age was 76.9 years (IQR: 68.8 to 84.0 years). Identified risk factors were posterior capsular rupture (OR: 7.111; 95% CI: 4.890 to 10.341), uveitis / posterior synechiae (OR: 4.315; 95% CI: 2.467 to 7.549), previous vitrectomy surgery (OR: 2.879; 95% CI: 1.802 to 4.600), previous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (OR: 2.230; 95% CI: 1.411 to 3.523), glaucoma (OR: 2.114; 95% CI: 1.591 to 2.810), corneal pathology (OR: 2.113; 95% CI: 1.307 to 3.417) and diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.450; 95% CI: 1.114 to 1.886). Figure 1, Panel B. Using the risk factor model, the lowest probability of post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis is 0.015% for a patient without diabetes mellitus who has not had anti-VEGF therapy with none of the ocular conditions and where PCR is avoided during surgery. This risk increases to 0.108% if PCR occurs. The highest risk eyes are from patients with diabetes mellitus, previous anti-VEGF therapy, uveitis/posterior synechiae, previous vitrectomy, glaucoma, or corneal pathology, where the probability of endophthalmitis is 2.645% when PCR is avoided and 16.139% when PCR occurs. Previous published incidence rates for post-cataract endophthalmitis from recent series range from 0.1 to 0.5 per 1 000 cases2Pershing S, Lum F, Hsu S, Kelly S, Chiang MF, Rich WL, et al.

Previous small scale studies identified potential risk factors for developing post-procedural endophthalmitis which include history of ocular surface disease, diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised status and older age(1Relhan N, Forster RK, Flynn HW. Endophthalmitis: Then and Now. American Journal of Ophthalmology: Elsevier Inc.; 2018. p. xx-xxvii.Google Scholar). One of the main sources of contamination in cataract surgery is thought to be the commensal microbiota on the periocular skin and lid margin. The microbiology spectrum predominantly implicated in post-operative endophthalmitis cases is similar to those found on those sites. The microbial load on the ocular surface is influenced by age, chronic use of topical medications, such as anti-glaucoma medications or steroids, systemic disease (i.e. diabetes mellitus) and ocular surface disease. Dysregulation of the host immune responses and increased susceptibility to microbial invasion either as a direct consequence of the pre-existing ocular pathology or a result of treatment with long-term topical medication use may predispose patients to increased risk of post-cataract endophthalmitis. Posterior capsular rupture during cataract surgery is a significant risk factor for endophthalmitis. Once there is a breach to the posterior capsule, extra procedures and instrumentation (such as anterior vitrectomy) would be required, along with increased surgical time, which could increase the risk of introducing micro-organisms into the eye. It has also been suggested that incomplete or less efficient elimination of bacteria in the vitreous cavity following posterior capsular rupture could be a contributing factor(5Rahmani S. Eliott D. Postoperative Endophthalmitis: A Review of Risk Factors, Prophylaxis, Incidence, Microbiology, Treatment, and Outcomes.Seminars in Ophthalmology. 2018; 33: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This study is limited by the potentially heavy influence of the small event and outcome rates in a large sample. Additionally, the use of electronic medical records (EMR) is not standardized across NHS sites, hence, data such as the use of prophylactic antibiotics intraoperatively or indication for AC tap (i.e. for treatment of high IOP in the absence of endophthalmitis) is not fully captured on the EMR systems. We are unable to link microbiology data to distinguish between non-infectious (toxic anterior segment syndrome/uveitis) and infectious cause. The general consensus is that patients who undergo cataract surgery in the private sector are less complex than ones undertaken in the NHS setting. Although the RCOphth NOD database does not have the same rigour as data validation in prospective clinical trials, the very large sample size required to evaluate rare outcomes, such as endophthalmitis, will be prohibitively costly to undertake in future clinical trial settings(6Gower E.W. Lindsley K. Tulenko S.E. Nanji A.A. Leyngold I. Mcdonnell P.J. Perioperative antibiotics for prevention of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. 2017; Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, observational data such as that provided by the RCOphth NOD database will be depended upon to guide future policy and practice. In summary, our study demonstrates the utility of large-scale clinical databases for risk factor analysis of rare but highly important, sight-threatening surgical complications. Given the rarity of post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis, national benchmarks of incidence and risk-stratified surveillance of endophthalmitis outbreaks are warranted. Further development of national prospective surveillance networks to actively monitor post-cataract endophthalmitis cases in real-time, along with their microbiology and anti-microbial resistance data, would facilitate minimization of the infection rate, enable prompt identification of potential outbreaks and guide response measures.

To examine financial and clinical work productivity outcomes associated with the use of the electronic health record (EHR). Methods. 191,360 billable clinical encounters were analyzed for 12 clinical providers over a 9-year study period during which an EHR was implemented. Main outcome measures were clinical revenues collected per provider and secondary outcomes were charge capture, patient visit coding levels, transcription costs, patient visit volume per provider, digital drawing, and digital imaging volume. Results. The difference in inflation adjusted net clinical revenue per provider per year did not change significantly in the period after EHR implementation (mean = $404,198; SD = $17,912) than before (mean = $411,420; SD = $39,366) (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.746</mml:mn></mml:math>). Charge capture, the proportion of higher- and lower-level visit codes for new and established patients, and patient visits per provider remained stable. A total savings of $188,951 in transcription costs occurred over a 4-year time period post-EHR implementation. The rate of drawing the ophthalmic exam in the EHR was low (mean = 2.28%; SD = 0.05%) for all providers. Conclusions. This study did not show a clear financial gain after EHR implementation in an academic ophthalmology practice.

However, these services are highly underutilized in ophthalmology practices. A quality improvement study was performed to investigate barriers to LVR services for patients at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) between 2010 and 2020. Low vision was defined as the best corrected visual acuity of 20/70 or worse in the better-seeing eye or a visual field less than 20 degrees. Potential subjects were screened (n = 577) from the electronic medical record using International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes for legal blindness, impaired vision, and low vision.

Patients who received LVR referrals to attend at least one LVR service visit from the eligible subjects were contacted for participation in phone interviews regarding their LVR experience. Practicing eye care providers (ECPs) at UTMB completed a questionnaire to capture their referral patterns. Of the eligible subjects, 64% were referred to LVR services by ECPs. Reported patient barriers included mental health issues (76%), denial of need for low-vision aid (71%), poor physical health (67%), lack of transportation (57.1%), and lack of referrals (36%).

Tolerance analysis allows for predicting the performance of a system setup of real manufactured parts and for an estimation of the yield with respect to evaluation figures, such as performance requirements, systems specification or cost demands. Currently, optical freeform optics is gaining importance in optical systems design. The performance of freeform optics often strongly depends on the manufacturing accuracy of the surfaces. For this reason, a tolerance analysis with respect to the fabrication accuracy is of crucial importance. The characterization of form tolerances caused by the manufacturing process is based on the definition of straightness, flatness, roundness, and cylindricity. In case of freeform components, however, it is often impossible to define a form deviation by means of this standard classification. Hence, prediction of the impact of manufacturing tolerances on the optical performance is not possible by means of a conventional tolerance analysis. To carry out a tolerance analysis of the optical subsystem, including freeform optics, metrology data of the fabricated surfaces have to be integrated into the optical model. The focus of this article is on design for manufacturability of freeform optics with integrated alignment structures and on tolerance analysis of the optical subsystem based on the measured surface data of manufactured optical freeform components with respect to assembly and manufacturing tolerances. This approach will be reported here using an ophthalmological system as an example.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2060643", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2052771128", "source": "openalex"}

Blood vessels have been extracted from the original and stego image and it has been established from experimental results that the features remains unaltered. Texture features also has been analyzed and experimental results indicates that the variation in the texture features is minimal and do not affect the medical information. The correlation of the features extracted is above 0.99 indicating the insertion of the digital pattern did not cause any loss of medical information in the image.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2015.7296372", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1898529089", "source": "openalex"}

Large language models (LLMs), a type of foundation model, are capable of language comprehension and the ability to generate human-like text. Researchers and developers have been tuning LLMs to optimise their performance in specific tasks, such as medical challenge problems. Until recently, tuning required technical programming expertise, but the release of custom generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) by OpenAI has allowed users to tune their own GPTs with natural language. This has the potential to democratise access to high-quality bespoke LLMs globally. In this review, we provide an overview of LLMs, how they are tuned and how custom GPTs work. We provide three use cases of custom GPTs in ophthalmology to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools. First, we present 'EyeTeacher', an educational aid that generates questions from clinical guidelines to facilitate learning. Second, we built 'EyeAssistant', a clinical support tool that is tuned with clinical guidelines to respond to various physician queries. Lastly, we design 'The GPT for GA', which offers clinicians a comprehensive summary of emerging management strategies for geographic atrophy by analysing peer-reviewed documents. The review underscores the significance of custom instructions and information retrieval in tuning GPTs for specific tasks in ophthalmology. We also discuss the evaluation of LLM responses and address critical aspects such as privacy and accountability in their clinical application.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4313546203", "title": "Technology and Innovation in Global Ophthalmology: The Past, the Potential, and a Path Forward", "text": "Introduction The World Health Organization estimates that at least 2.2 billion people suffer from visual impairment globally.1 Nearly half of these cases are preventable or undertreated. Limitations in the accessibility and quality of vision care remain significant drivers of this burden of disease. These issues are important in every community regardless of socioeconomic status but disproportionately affect individuals in low-income and middle-income countries. \"Accessibility\" in this context refers to the ability of a person in need to contact, either virtually or in person, an appropriate care provider capable of diagnosing and managing the underlying etiology of their visual impairment. A number of barriers can limit accessibility, including the cost of receiving care, the physical distance between patient and provider and lack of feasible transportation to traverse this distance, communication limitations, including language and cultural barriers between provider and patient, lack of individual agency or a sense of not being a participant in one's care, and an inadequate number of qualified providers relative to the burden of illness in the population. \"Quality\" of care refers to the amount of benefits patients receive once they make contact with an appropriate eye care provider. Primary barriers to high-quality care include a lack of infrastructural support, limited provider education, and inadequate availability of effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Herein we provide a broad overview of historic successes in the quest to improve the accessibility and quality of eye care globally (\"the past\"), opportunities for integrating recent technological advances such as AI (\"the potential\"), and \"a path forward\" to successfully develop and implement these innovations in a responsible and impactful manner. The Past The global eye care community has a rich history of innovating care delivery models to address unmet needs in vision health. For example, despite effective treatment, cataract remains the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Efforts to reduce the cost of performing cataract surgery resulted in the development of a novel surgical approach, manual small incision cataract surgery, which achieves comparable outcomes to state-of-the-art phacoemulsification cataract surgery at a fraction of the cost.2,3 Novel care delivery systems have enabled large-scale implementation of this surgical technique in areas of high need. For example, the Aravind Eye Care System in India and Tilganga Eye Centre in Nepal have been remarkably successful in delivering high-volume, high-quality cataract surgery to regions with very high disease burdens.4,5 The combination of cost-saving surgical techniques and community outreach allows institutions such as these to achieve sufficient surgical volume to benefit from economies of scale. Care delivery models founded on these principles have been replicated in geographically diverse environments with similar success.6 Another major barrier to accessible care is the physical distance between patients and care providers possessing the skills, knowledge, capacity, and infrastructure to provide needed eye care. Several approaches have been employed to close this distance gap. Surgical outreach camps can bring providers and supplies to populations in need, while educating and supplying local providers may provide a more sustainable alternative to reduce regional accessibility gaps. For example, organizations like ORBIS and Seva have successfully trained and equipped 10s of 1000s of eye care professionals globally.7 Teleophthalmology bridges the distance gap by virtually connecting patients and providers and has been shown to improve accessibility to eye care, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.8 This concept can be implemented in a number of ways, for example, by providing live consultation with a remote expert for real-time diagnostic and therapeutic guidance, delayed remote expert review of imaging for large-scale screening interventions, or using virtual language interpreter services to ameliorate language and (to some extent) cultural barriers between provider and patient. Moreover, teleophthalmology, by extension, includes the concept of tele-education. This refers to the development of web-based platforms that provide standardized training tools to build providers' knowledge base and enhance diagnostic competency and clinical management. Most current programs consist of self-paced training, preparing local clinicians and technologists with the ability to (at minimum) triage treatment-requiring cases without the need to rely on remote providers.9 The successes of the global ophthalmology community to date emphasize that overcoming the barriers to accessible, high-quality eye care for all can be achieved using a framework that adapts existing approaches (or develops de novo health care models) with an emphasis on scalability, sustainability, cultural competency, and stimulating patients' individual agency and sense of empowerment. The Potential While many of the above interventions have been remarkably impactful, recent technological advances have resulted in significant enthusiasm for potential novel approaches to address global vision issues.10 Computer processing power continues to grow at an exponential rate (ie, Moore's law has proven prescient), and cloud computing, coupled with the ubiquity of internet-connected devices, has enabled information processing capabilities not previously achievable.11 Simultaneously, the quantity of health data continues to increase, both in structured formats (eg, electronic health records, clinical data registries such as the IRIS registry, and claims databases) and unstructured formats (eg, medical imaging, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, wearable health devices, etc.). The past decade has also seen methodologic revolutions in artificial intelligence (particularly the advent of deep learning), big data analytics, and informatics, suggesting the opportunity to adapt these new methodologies to the ever-expanding corpus of health data to improve eye care accessibility, quality, and our scientific understanding of eye diseases. Improving Global Eye Care Accessibility and Quality Nowhere is the potential impact of advancing technology on global vision health more apparent than in the concept of large-scale automated image-based screening for eye diseases. The burden of many major global causes of blindness far exceeds the capacity of traditional telemedicine approaches with remote expert interpretation for secondary prevention. The application of artificial intelligence extends the concept of telemedicine beyond connecting patients to care providers, allowing the potential for massive scalability through assistive diagnosis or autonomous screening. There are now 2 FDA-approved devices for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy, and similar success may be achievable for other major global causes of preventable or treatable blindness, including glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity.12–15 Narrowing the population of patients requiring in-person evaluation and management with an expert care provider would allow much more effective utilization of limited health care resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical informatics may also provide benefits for tertiary prevention purposes. For example, clinical decision support systems have long been leveraged to reduce prescribing errors.16 Similar point-of-care systems capable of machine learning may leverage the quantity of data contained in electronic health records to enable more accurate risk stratification of patients with eye diseases, quantitatively monitor therapeutic response, and/or provide supplemental information to guide treatment decisions. In addition, advances in bioinformatics have enabled the massive amount of information encoded in genetic samples to be processed and meaningfully interpreted, which may provide novel risk modeling and diagnostic capabilities. As an example of the latter, deep sequencing methods have shown potential for accurate, hypothesis-free identification of ocular infections, with a much broader diagnostic range than traditional primer-based techniques such as PCR.17 Finally, artificial intelligence may also be utilized to address language barriers between the provider and the patient. Automated interpretation of speech and language has demonstrated remarkable progress in recent years, with some models capable of accurate interpretation between 100s of languages (eg, Google Translate). This may provide a similar scalability benefit compared with traditional in-person or remote human interpretation between the provider and patient, although the accurate interpretation of medical speech remains a challenge for modern AI models.18 Improving Scientific Understanding of Eye Disease Technology, in addition, provides opportunities to gain insight into disease characteristics, including epidemiology, genetic factors, clinical presentation, and response to treatment, which can inform the revision of what is considered \"state-of-the-art\" eye care. Structured data in clinical registries such as the IRIS registry, analyzed using tools and best practices within the framework of clinical informatics and big data analytics, provide opportunities to gain knowledge of diseases that would not be feasible with traditional epidemiologic methods.19 Similarly, leveraging the massive amount of unstructured data available on the internet can provide an opportunity to conduct large-scale epidemiologic surveillance of various diseases (eg, determining temporal and geographic patterns in the epidemiology of infectious conjunctivitis by analyzing Google search trends).20 A Path Forward While the pace of innovation in this field is exciting, several significant barriers remain before tangible benefits can be obtained from many of these applications of artificial intelligence and information technology to global eye health. Most modern deep learning models require large amounts of accurately labeled training data to achieve high performance, but \"FAIR\" (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), machine-learning-ready medical data are scarce.21 For example, computer vision (the AI sub-field dedicated to image interpretation) is the primary area of enthusiasm for applications of AI to ophthalmology due to the importance of image-based diagnosis in our field. However, ocular images are often stored on local devices in proprietary file formats, with variable adherence to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standards. This makes the collation of datasets from multiple devices and/or institutions highly problematic. As the American Academy of Ophthalmology recently suggested, stricter standardization of ocular image file formats and adherence to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standards could significantly reduce the scarcity of FAIR imaging data for machine learning applications.22 The \"Bridge2AI\" program recently implemented by the National Institutes of Health similarly emphasizes the importance of generating large-scale, privacy-preserving FAIR data to advance the applications of AI and big data in medicine.23 Even after sufficient data has been accumulated and an AI model has been successfully trained and evaluated, there remain significant barriers to implementing such models in the health care setting and achieving benefits to patients. There is a striking discordance between a large number of AI publications in ophthalmology journals and the relatively low number of systems in deployment.24 This phenomenon is not isolated to ophthalmology but rather is known generally as the \"implementation gap\" of machine learning in health care.25 There are several reasons for this gap, including a lack of reimbursement models for these devices, ethical concerns, including demonstrable bias in AI algorithms currently in deployment, and patient and provider hesitancy towards the adoption of AI models in clinical care. Overcoming these obstacles ought to be our goal and will require a partnership between multiple stakeholders, including computer and data scientists, clinicians, investors, health systems, and the public. Conclusions The potential exists for recent technological advances to transform the way ophthalmic care is delivered around the world and reduce preventable blindness. To bring these technologies to patients, we need to: (1) Learn from prior successes in global ophthalmology by focusing on community engagement, building sustainable infrastructure, and optimizing care delivery models; (2) Fund research to support the development of FAIR datasets that accurately represent diverse populations and reduce the machine learning implementation gap; and (3) Foster active collaboration among all stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, public health experts, machine learning engineers, informaticists, data scientists, and implementation scientists. The low-hanging fruit in blindness prevention has always been the implementation of existing knowledge. Although there are many high-tech innovations in ophthalmic imaging, constantly evolving surgical techniques, and new drugs, the most impactful interventions in the next few decades may be in the realm of implementation science, solving barriers such as data infrastructure, adapting care models to local contexts, and creating scalable and sustainable revenue models for technological innovations.26 The global vision community has a long history of overcoming barriers to in providing high-quality eye care to the medically underserved. We are optimistic the enthusiasm of this community will achieve similar success in navigating these novel technological innovations and look forward to increasing the accessibility and quality of eye care available to patients in need.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/iio.0000000000000450", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4313546203", "source": "openalex"}

In real-world settings, training centers face challenges in trying to create balanced residency programs, with cases encountered by residents not always being fairly distributed among them. In recent years, there has been a tremendous advancement in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms with human expert guidance for medical imaging segmentation, classification, and prediction. In this paper, we turned our attention from training machines to letting them train us and developed an AI framework for personalised case-based ophthalmology residency training. The framework is built on two components: (1) a deep learning (DL) model and (2) an expert-system-powered case allocation algorithm. The DL model is trained on publicly available datasets by means of contrastive learning and can classify retinal diseases from color fundus photographs (CFPs). Patients visiting the retina clinic will have a CFP performed and afterward, the image will be interpreted by the DL model, which will give a presumptive diagnosis. This diagnosis is then passed to a case allocation algorithm which selects the resident who would most benefit from the specific case, based on their case history and performance. At the end of each case, the attending expert physician assesses the resident’s performance based on standardised examination files, and the results are immediately updated in their portfolio.

A retrospective analysis of rectal chloral hydrate for computer-assisted tomographic (CT) examinations on 20 pediatric patients revealed that after a single application, sedation was sufficient in only 4 cases. In 14 cases, additional doses and/or drugs were required. Altogether, 6 examinations were canceled because of insufficient sedation. Therefore, the safety and effectiveness of oral chloral hydrate (60-100 mg/kg) was studied prospectively in 32 pediatric ophthalmologic examinations of 20 patients. The unpalatable taste of chloral hydrate may result in inconsistent intake, but all intended examinations and manipulations could be carried out with only minimal side effects. Oral chloral hydrate seems to be safe and effective for painless pediatric examinations and may be more reliable than rectal chloral hydrate.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W61163379", "source": "openalex"}

The completion process can be used to reconstruct interrupted curves by considering their local consistency. An explicit scheme with finite-difference approximation is used to construct the three-dimensional (3-D) completion kernel, where we choose the Gamma distribution for time integration. To process structures in , the orientation score framework is exploited to lift the 2-D curvilinear segments into the 3-D space. The propagation and reconnection of interrupted segments are achieved by convolving the completion kernel with orientation scores via iterative group convolutions. To overcome the problem of incorrect skeletonization of 2-D structures at junctions, a 3-D segment-wise thinning technique is proposed to process each segment separately in orientation scores.Validations on 4 datasets with different image modalities show that our method achieves an average success rate of in reconnecting gaps of sizes from to , including challenging junction structures.The reconnection approach can be a useful and reliable technique for bridging complex curvilinear interruptions.The presented method is a critical work to obtain more complete curvilinear structures in ophthalmologic images.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3046369560", "title": "Impact of COVID-19 on Ophthalmology and Future Practice of Medicine", "text": "The World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a world pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 27, 2020, 213 countries were affected with >5.5 million infected and >0.35 million deaths worldwide. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is around 6.36%, trailing that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (9.6%) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (34.4%).1 Nonetheless, with a mean basic reproduction number (R0) estimated to be approximately 2.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.15 – 4.77),2 it has higher infectivity and transmissibility than both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (R0 = 0.95) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (R0 = 0.91).1 The impacts of COVID-19 on the general population and health care system worldwide should not be neglected given the virus's capability to generate a large number of cases in the context of a pandemic. Breazzano et al3 reported that ophthalmology was among the specialties with the highest proportion of residents with confirmed COVID-19 across all residency programs in New York. Concerns for the possible increased risk of infection in ophthalmic practice require extra precautionary measures. Droplets, close contact, and aerosols are the most common routes of COVID-19 transmission.4 Ophthalmologists are at heightened risk of infection due to exposure to viral particles through these routes in routine face-to-face ophthalmic clinical examination by slit lamp or direct ophthalmoscope during which they are in close proximity to patients. Although uncertainties prevail, we believe we could win the battle against COVID-19 by taking reference from the valuable experiences derived from SARS and the current COVID-19 outbreaks in the protection of both patients and co-workers in ophthalmic practices.5,6 COVID-19 has as much impact on other disciplines of medicine as on ophthalmology. In a time of pandemic, we tend to maintain social distancing and avoid crowded areas and clustering, especially clinics or hospitals, to avoid the risk of infection. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the emergence of fifth-generation (5G) mobile network, smartphone-based apps, telemedicine, and online consultations would likely gain popularity as a modality of innovative and supplementary medical service.7–12 Physical face-to-face contact can be minimized by virtue of these technologies resulting in less risk of infection. COVID-19 could be the spark to facilitate the integration of online medical services into routine medical practices. Some institutions around the world, including those in the Asia-Pacific regions such as China and Hong Kong, are actively implementing and refining their online platforms to maintain clinical services while the pandemic ensues. Governments and institutions may take advantage of their advanced technologies and the demand for medical services at safe distances during this period to turn the challenges brought by COVID-19 into opportunities. Despite the relentless efforts of scientists and physicians, there is currently no definitive cure for COVID-19. A multitude of vaccine candidates is in the development pipeline worldwide, with some in the phases of animal and human trials. However, experts still expect at least 12 to 18 months before an effective vaccine is ready. Until then, effective implementation of public health interventions remains indispensable to mitigate the outbreak, flatten the peak of the epidemic, and prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed by rapid surges of cases. Deep Knowledge Group, a consortium of commercial and nonprofit organizations based in various major cities around the globe, evaluated 130 qualitative and quantitative parametric variables grouped under 6 broad and top-level categories (quarantine efficacy, government efficiency of risk management, monitoring and detection, healthcare readiness, regional resiliency, and emergency preparedness). An interesting observation was made from their COVID-19 regional safety assessment: 6 countries in the Asia-Pacific region (Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) were ranked among the top 10 regions with the highest COVID-19 Safety Ranking.13 China, the initial epicenter of the outbreak, and some of the geographically adjacent regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore were also among the entire list of the top 20 regions with the highest safety ranking. On the other hand a survey jointly conducted by Toluna and Blackbox Research in Singapore measured the sentiments of citizens from 23 countries toward their governments’ responses to COVID-19 across 4 main indicators (corporate leadership, national political leadership, media, and community), wherein China tops the index score with the most respondents satisfying with its COVID-19 crisis response.14 These results are likely due to strict and aggressive measures most governments in the Asia-Pacific regions have adopted in response to the pandemic. These included strict quarantine and isolation to the scale of a cordon sanitaire, social distancing, liberal laboratory testing, advocation of personal hygiene practice such as hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and mass masking.15 The synergistic effect of these nonpharmaceutical interventions contributed to Hong Kong's success in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and could be adopted in other nations across the world.16 To achieve maximal efficacy of curbing the outbreak, citizens’ understanding and willingness to abide by the policies issued by relevant authorities is also critical until effective treatments and vaccines become readily available so that their normal lives could resume. Some governments have considered adopting the herd immunity strategy by allowing enough people to be infected and eventually develop immunity against the virus, so that it will eventually stop spreading throughout the population. We have reservations regarding herd immunity as a mitigation strategy. The threshold for achieving herd immunity varies and is determined by several variables including the R0. The current estimated R0 of SARS-CoV-2 to be around 2, at least 60% of the population would need to be infected and have protective immunity for such strategy to work.1,17 Considering a population of 66.65 million in the UK, nearly 40 million Brits need to be infected. With a CFR of around 6.36%, this would result in approximately 2.54 million deaths. The seemingly low CFR of SARS-CoV-2 is magnified into enormous impacts if the coronavirus outbreak is allowed to propagate unchecked. Furthermore, should there be an underestimation of the current R0 or mutations in the process of uncurbed spread, the threshold to achieve herd immunity and CFR could be higher. The resulting outcome would be beyond imagination. In this hard-fought battle between humanity and the coronavirus that is yet to be triumphed, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to all frontline health care workers around the globe who sacrificed their personal interests or even lives to fight against COVID-19. Their professionalism, perseverance, compassion, and courage deserve our utmost respect. Their act of valor also reminds us of the history of the “1665 plague outbreak,” which took the lives of >70% of villagers in the Eyam village, England.18 As the disease spread, William Mompesson, the rector of the village, in conjunction with a clergyman, made the courageous and resolute decision to quarantine the entire village. Although the plague finally claimed the lives of many villagers, including Mompesson's wife, the quarantine successfully averted the spread of the plague to the entire England. As William Shakespeare said, “Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.” With goodness, we are destined to find the key to achieve the ultimate victory!", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/apo.0000000000000305", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3046369560", "source": "openalex"}

The responses were graded by appropriate subspecialists as appropriate, inappropriate, or unreliable in 2 grading contexts. The first grading context was if the information was presented on a patient information site. The second was an LLM-generated draft response to patient queries sent by the electronic medical record (EMR). Appropriate was defined as accurate and specific enough to serve as a surrogate for physician-approved information. Main outcome measure was percentage of appropriate responses per subspecialty.ResultsFor patient information site-related questions, the LLM provided an overall average of 79% appropriate responses. Variable rates of average appropriateness were observed across ophthalmic subspecialties for patient information site information ranging from 56% to 100%: cataract or refractive (92%), cornea (56%), glaucoma (72%), neuro-ophthalmology (67%), oculoplastic or orbital surgery (80%), ocular oncology (100%), pediatrics (89%), vitreoretinal diseases (86%), and uveitis (65%).

In the case of the ophthalmology sector, however, the purchase of contact lenses and prescription glasses requires professional examination by a trained eye specialist. This peculiarity of the sector affects the shift toward omnichannel. This paper is novel in that it addresses a research gap by studying the distribution channels for regulated products and services such as health products that required a closer professional service. This paper addresses the transformation of companies toward an omnichannel model using a common scientific forecasting method (i.e., the Delphi method) to identify trends and problems. In this scenario of high complexity and uncertainty where there is insufficient relevant quantitative information for decision making, the Delphi method is applied to ensure a consensual decision-making process. Consensus was reached by a panel of 11 experts on the Spanish ophthalmology sector after three rounds of questioning. The final set of indicators involve 19 different criteria grouped into four categories (1) current situation of the distribution channel, (2) changes in distribution channels, (3) trends and near future of the distribution channel, and (4) consequences and adaptations for supply chain agents. The results from each round of consultation were then analyzed by means of statistical analysis with SPSS and discussed for each category. The results confirm that traditional intermediaries face difficulties to avoid being squeezed out of the sector because of shortening distribution channels and the entry of new online intermediaries with service integration models. We identify future scenarios and define actions that different agents can take to enhance their competitiveness in the short and long term. The arrival of omnichannel distribution is inevitable in the ophthalmology sector, entailing a major transformation from a rigid traditional distribution model to a more complex and flexible model following the entry of new online intermediaries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01142", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3033950537", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike hexamethonium and pentolinium, guanethidine has no ganglion-blocking action. It also has no peripheral sympathicolytic effect, since the sensitivity of the receptors to sympathicomimetic substances is not decreased but is, on the contrary, increased. Guanethidine inhibits the release of levarterenol somewhere between the ganglion and the receptor (Fig. 1).

Animals —7 healthy adult horses with clinically normal eyes as evaluated prior to each treatment. Procedures —6 horses were used for assessment of each antimicrobial, and 1 eye of each horse was treated with topically administered 0.3% ciprofloxacin or 0.5% moxifloxacin (n = 6 eyes/drug) every 4 hours for 7 doses. Anterior chamber paracentesis was performed 1 hour after the final dose was administered, and blood samples were collected at 24 (immediately after the final dose), 24.25, 24.5, and 25 hours (time of aqueous humor [AH] collection). Plasma and AH concentrations of ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin were determined by use of high-performance liquid chromatography. Results —Mean ± SD AH concentrations of ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin were 0.009 ± 0.008 μg/mL and 0.071 ± 0.029 μg/mL, respectively. The AH moxifloxacin concentrations were significantly greater than those of ciprofloxacin. Mean ± SD plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were less than the lower limit of quantification. Moxifloxacin was detected in the plasma of all horses at all sample collection times, with a peak value of 0.015 μg/mL at 24 and 24.25 hours, decreasing to &lt; 0.004 μg/mL at 25 hours. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance —Moxifloxacin was better able to penetrate healthy equine corneas and reach measurable AH concentrations than was ciprofloxacin, suggesting moxifloxacin might be of greater value in the treatment of deep corneal or intraocular bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. Topical administration of moxifloxacin also resulted in detectable plasma concentrations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.71.5.564", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2131977697", "source": "openalex"}

The current landscape of equity in ophthalmic care has yet to be thoroughly investigated and is important to ensure inclusivity and patient-centered care.To perform a scoping review of the literature pertaining to health care inequities in the field of ophthalmology.A comprehensive database search using MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Ovid Embase was done in July 2022. English-language articles published from 2016 to 2021 were included and encompassed all article types except commentaries or correspondence. The search modeled the National Institutes of Health list of designated US health inequity populations, which includes income, education level, occupational status, rural and underresourced area, sex and gender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) identity, and race and ethnicity. A total of 8170 abstracts and titles were screened by 2 independent investigators, and 189 studies were assessed in full text for eligibility. For inclusion, articles needed to be an ophthalmic study discussing health inequities. In a masked, duplicate fashion, 2 independent investigators screened 75 full-text studies for data extraction using a pilot-tested form. Data extraction included general publication characteristics and health inequity data based on the National Institutes of Health's defined inequity groups.A total of 75 publications were included. Notable inequities were found among Black and Hispanic patients associated with negative ophthalmic outcomes and mixed associations regarding sex or gender. Overall, lower-income patients were more likely to have vision impairment, use eye care services less, and have lower adherence to eye examinations. No articles within our sample examined LGBTQ inequities among ophthalmology patients since the 2016 National Institutes of Health classification of sexual and gender minority populations. Substantial research gaps were observed within the ophthalmic literature pertaining to the LGBTQ community, race and ethnicity, and rural and underresourced areas.This scoping review found substantial findings associated with the LGBTQ community, race and ethnicity, and the role of telemedicine in rural and underresourced areas.

These technologies have been applied in diagnosis, prognosis, surgical operations, and patient-specific care in ophthalmology. It is thus both timely and pertinent to assess the existing landscape, recent advances, and trajectory of trends of AI, AI-enabled robots, and chatbots in ophthalmology. Recent findings Some recent developments have integrated AI enabled robotics with diagnosis, and surgical procedures in ophthalmology. More recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in augmenting research capabilities and diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. These developments may portend a new era of doctor-patient-machine collaboration. Summary Ophthalmology is undergoing a revolutionary change in research, clinical practice, and surgical interventions. Ophthalmic AI-enabled robotics and chatbot technologies based on LLMs are converging to create a new era of digital ophthalmology.

The number of potential contact lens candidates has been greatly expanded by the introduction of both spin-cast and lathe-cut lenses composed of a variety of individual hydrophilic polymers. Myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, aphakia and moderate astigmatism can be corrected with a reasonable degree of success with the present lenses. Even in keratoconus hydrophilic lenses offer a nonsurgical alternative, especially when combined with spectacle overcorrection. The introduction of hydrophilic bandages in the treatment of corneal disease has been an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium of the ophthalmologist. When properly applied, these lenses can provide subjective relief of pain while serving to protect the damaged cornea from the traumatic action of the lids and desiccating effects of the atmosphere. The hydrophilic material is permeable to many topically instilled medications and tends to prolong the contact time of the drugs with the corneal surface. Proper fitting of the bandage lenses can eliminate superficial corneal irregularities and, thus, improve the visual acuity while treatment progresses. Medical indications for the use of this therapy include bullous keratopathy, dry eye syndromes, chemical burns, exposure keratitis, and neurotropic keratitis. A number of recurrent erosions and ulcerations have also responded to this form of therapy. Surgical indications include lacerations, postoperative lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty, and keratectomies. One of the most promising applications concerns their use in the postoperative management of alkaline burns. Best results have been obtained by constant wear of the bandage lens, with topical administration of steroids, antibiotics, and saline solution (hypotonic or hypertonic) as indicated. The possible deleterious effects of standard ocular medication containing preservatives has been overstated. Patients receiving medications without preservatives must be placed on prophylactic antibiotics to avoid secondary infection. In many cases, the therapeutic efficacy is closely related to the diameter and curvature of the bandage lens as well as the inherent physical properties of the polymers. With meticulous fitting and close observation complications have been minimal. In many instances the results have been dramatic, but even if unsuccessful the method provides a safe and relatively simple nonsurgical alternative in the treatment of severe corneal disease. Just as with older modalities, the ultimate success or failure depends upon the intrinsic nature of the disease process as well as reasonable therapeutic application based on a knowledge of the mechanics involved.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2407313338", "source": "openalex"}

One patient population that may suffer from poor outcomes during the pandemic are those with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Many practices are performing some form of tele-ophthalmology services for their patients, and guidance is needed on how to maintain continuity of care amongst patients with AMD using tele-ophthalmology.A literature search was conducted, ending 1 August 2020, to identify AMD outcomes and telecare management strategies that could be used during the COVID-19 pandemic.237 total articles were retrieved, 56 of which were included for analysis. Four American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control web resources were also included.Risk-stratification models have been developed that let providers readily screen existing patients for their future risk of neovascular AMD (nAMD). When used with at-home monitoring devices to detect nAMD, providers may be able to determine who should be contacted via tele-ophthalmology for screening. Telemedicine triage can be used for new complaints of vision loss to determine who should be referred to a retinal specialist for management of suspected nAMD. To increase access and provider flexibility, smartphone fundus photography images sent to a centralized tele-ophthalmology service can aid in the detection of nAMD. Considerations should also be made for COVID-19 transmission, and tele-ophthalmology can be used to screen patients for the presence of COVID-19 prior to in-person office visits.

Results: The results showed that most patients with ocular disease simultaneously have one or more psychiatric symptoms. We also found a prevalence of eye-related side effects in patients who use psychiatric drugs. At the same time, we observed that some ophthalmology methods of diagnostics can be used as diagnostic tools in psychiatry. Conclusions: Most studies showed a significant relation between psychiatry and ophthalmology, such as eye symptoms and diseases following long-term use of psychotropics as well as psychiatric symptoms and syndromes in patients with eye disorders.

We aimed to describe the visual and oculomotor features of thalamic infarction and to delineate clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of the oculomotor deficits from an ophthalmologic point of view. Methods: Clinical and neuroimaging data of all participants were retrospectively reviewed. Among the 12,755 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke, who were registered in our Stroke Data Bank between January 2009 and December 2018, 342 were found to have acute thalamic infarcts on MRI, from whom we identified the patients exhibiting neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations including visual, oculomotor, pupillary, and eyelid anomalies. Results: Forty (11.7%) of the 342 patients with thalamic infarction demonstrated neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations, consisting of vertical gaze palsy (n = 19), skew deviation with an invariable hypotropia of the contralesional eye (n = 18), third nerve palsy (n = 11), pseudoabducens palsy (n = 9), visual field defects (n = 7), and other anomalies such as isolated ptosis and miosis (n = 7). Paramedian infarct was the most predominant lesion of neuro-ophthalmologic significance, accounting for 84.8% (n = 28) of all patients sharing the oculomotor features. Although most of the patients with oculomotor abnormalities rapidly improved without sequelae, 6 (18.2%) patients showed permanent oculomotor deficits. Common clinical features of patients with permanent oculomotor deficits included the following: no improvement within 3 months, combined upgaze and downgaze palsy, and the involvement of the paramedian tegmentum of the rostral midbrain. Conclusions: Thalamic infarction, especially in paramedian territory, can cause a wide variety of neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations, including vertical gaze palsy, skew deviation, and third nerve palsy. Although most oculomotor abnormalities resolve spontaneously within a few months, some may persist for years when the deficits remain unimproved for more than 3 months after stroke.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000864", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2994657763", "source": "openalex"}

PPP can be defined as a more or less permanent cooperation between public and private actors, through which the joint products or services are developed and in which the risks, costs and profits are shared. The Finnish eye care services system is heterogeneous with several different providers and can be regarded as sub-optimal in terms of overall resource use. What is more, the public sector is suffering from a shortage of ophthalmologists, which further decreases its possibilities to meet the present needs. As ophthalmology has traditionally been a medical specialty with a substantial private sector involvement in service provision, PPP could be a feasible policy to be used in the field. We thus ask the following research question: Is there, and to what extent, an open window of opportunity for PPP? In addition to the previously published literature, the research data consisted of 17 thematic interviews with public and private experts in the field of ophthalmology. The analysis was conducted in two stages. First, a literature-based content analysis was used to explore the prerequisites for PPP. Second, Kingdon's (1995) multiple streams theory was used to study the opening of the window of opportunity for PPP. Public and private parties reported similar problems in the current situation but defined them differently. Also, there is no consensus on policy alternatives. Public opinion seems to be somewhat uncertain as to the attitudes towards private service providers. The analysis thus showed that although there are prerequisites for PPP, the time has not yet come for a Public-Private Partnership. Should the window open fully, the emergence of policy entrepreneurs and an opportunity for a win-win situation between public and private organizations are required.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-4505-7-24", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1997081117", "source": "openalex"}

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a malignant neoplasm caused by the proliferation of poorly differenciated precursors of the lymphoid cells, which are known as blast cells. Blast cells replace the normal elements of the bone marrow, decreasing the production of normal blood cells and, therefore, causing anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. They can also infiltrate other organs, such as liver, spleen, lymph nodes or, less frequently, central nervous system. (Florensa et al, 2006; Ribera & Ortega, 2003; Sharma et al, 2004) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of leukemia in children, although it is also seen in adult patients. If blood test results are abnormal or the doctor suspects leukemia despite normal cell counts, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are the next steps. Treatment is based on chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. (Ribera & Ortega, 2003; Ortega, 2006; Ribera, 2006) The dominant clinical feature of these diseases is usually bone marrow failure caused by accumulation of blast cells although any organ can be infiltrated. Furthermore, signs and symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be secondary to the toxicity of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, graft versus host reaction following bone marrow transplantation, or infections due to immunosuppression. They can include fever, weakness, fatigue, breathlessness, opportunistic infections, weight loss, anorexia, easy bruising and bleeding, thrombosis, edema of the lower limbs and the abdomen, swollen liver or spleen, lymphadenopathy, or bone pain. (Florensa et al, 2006; Ribera & Ortega, 2003; Ortega, 2006) Ophthalmological signs in patients suffering from leukemia were first described as “leukemic retinopathy” by Liebreich in 1863. (Campos-Campos et al, 2004; Guyer et al, 1989) Reports of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with visual symptoms as the initial sign of the disease are rare (Kim et al, 2010). However, ocular changes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia are common. They have been reported to occur in up to 90% of patients with this disease (Kincaid & Green, 1983; Mesa, 2003).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5772/28012", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1568009592", "source": "openalex"}

We evaluated the impact of the training by (a) self-assessment of empathy quotient by residents using Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE scale) before and 6 weeks after ESM training and (b) nonparticipant observation (NPO) by trained faculty in real-life settings over the next 4 months. A peer-validated, self-designed checklist was used for NPO. The change in score was analyzed using Student's paired t-test. The faculty observed the use of empathy in real-life patient encounters of the trainees over the next 6 months. In addition, secondary qualitative data were collected and analyzed to assess the impact of the module on other stakeholders such as the role-playing undergraduate students and core faculty.Pretraining assessment revealed that concept of empathy during patient communication was understood by only 10% students. PostESM training, the self-rated mean empathy score, on JSE, significantly increased from 95.9 to 106.7 (of a maximum of 140). This was also confirmed by a significant improvement in externally rated empathy and soft skills scores (from 29.3 to 39.1; of a maximum of 55) using the NPO tool. Focus group discussion was done on the continued display of empathy by the trainees in real-life situation over 6 months of observation by the faculty. The group agreed that there was a gradual attrition of initial gain in empathy behavior over the observation period of 6 months. The spillover benefits of the training process were observed among the role-playing undergraduates as well. A thematic analysis of their reflections on the process revealed a substantial change with an improved understanding of effective communication.There is a definite scope for introducing empathetic communication in medical training. Empathetic communication can be improved by effective training in a contextual manner with a need for regular reinforcement.

Microtiter (96 wells) plate method was used to screen biofilm formation by ELISA reader at 570 nm. Out of 319 study participants with an external eye infection, the prevalence of bacterial pathogens was 46.1%. The predominant bacterial isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) (27.7%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.7%). Among Gram-negative groups, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.8%) was the leading isolate. Increased antimicrobial resistance was observed for tetracycline (64%), erythromycin (66.7%), and penicillin (77.1%).

Microfluidic spinning fiber have been attracting attention recently due to their various advantages, but their mechanical strength has unfortunately not been a subject of concentrated research, and this lack of research has severely limited their applications. In the current work, we showed the mechanical properties of microfibers can be tuned easily and provided a mathematical explanation for how the microfluidic spinning method intrinsically controls the mechanical properties of a microfluidic spinning fiber. But we were also able to adjust the mechanical properties of such fibers in various other ways, including by using biomolecules to coat the fiber or mixing the biomolecules with the primary component of the fiber and by using a customized twisting machine to change the number of single microfiber strands forming the fiber. We used the bundle fiber as an ophthalmology suture that resulted in a porcine eye with a smoother post-operative surface than did a nylon suture.

Although the potential importance of diet and nutrition in these conditions is strongly supported by data from observational studies, evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the benefit of nutritional supplementation is generally lacking. However, there is high quality evidence to support the use of an Age-Related Eye-Disease Study (AREDS) supplement containing antioxidants (β-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E) and zinc to slow progression in those at moderate to high risk of developing advanced AMD. Recent data from the AREDS2 trial provided data to suggest that β-carotene could be replaced with lutein and zeaxanthin on the basis of improved safety without compromising efficacy.

Results: The ISR is a powerful and conserved signaling pathway that allows for cells to respond to a diverse array of both intracellular and extracellular stressors. The pathway is classically responsible for coordination of the cellular response to amino acid starvation, ultraviolet light, heme dysregulation, viral infection, and unfolded protein. Under normal circumstances, it is considered pro-survival and a necessary mechanism through which protein translation is controlled. However, in cases of severe or prolonged stress the pathway can promote apoptosis, and loss of normal cellular phenotype. The activation of this pathway culminates in the global inhibition of cap-dependent protein translation and the canonical expression of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Conclusion:The eye is uniquely exposed to ISR responsive stressors due to its environmental exposure and relative isolation from the circulatory system which are necessary for its function. We will discuss how this pathway is critical for the proper function of the tissue, its role in development, as well as how targeting of the pathway could alleviate key aspects of diverse ophthalmic diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2020.1867748", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3121160436", "source": "openalex"}

The secondary outcomes were prespecified baseline variables hypothesized to be associated with follow-up. The intervention began September 4, 2019. Follow-up rates were compared between the preintervention (n = 37) and postintervention (n = 34) groups. The hypothesis was formulated before data collection.Among the 71 patients, 50 (70.4%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 51.9 (12.4) years. A total of 28 patients (39.4%) were referred for free eyeglasses, 14 (19.7%) to the county hospital for advanced care, and 7 (9.9%) to both. Of those referred, the difference in follow-up from the postintervention to preintervention groups was 53.8% (95% CI, 39.8%-67.9%; P < .001). Compared with patients who did not follow up, those who did had a mean difference of 59 more days at the shelter (95% CI, 39-80 days; P = .003). Among patients with a visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better-seeing eye, the mean difference between those who did not follow up and those who did was 61% (95% CI, 44%-78%; P = .003).

The most common findings were visual disturbance, diplopia, red eyes, photophobia, facial palsy with palpebral diastasis, strabismus and sixth nerve palsy. The number of symptoms and findings was correlated with immunoglobulin G (IgG)/IgM in CSF ( r = 0.6, p = 0.009/0.016; Spearman's correlation). All subjects improved, except one with initially fulminant papilloedema, who still suffered from optic disc atrophy and affected visual fields at the last follow‐up. Conclusion The majority of patients diagnosed with neuroborreliosis had ophthalmological symptoms and/or findings. Facial palsy with palpebral diastasis was a common finding. Onset of diplopia and/or sixth nerve affection may be a first sign of neuroborreliosis. Number of ophthalmological findings was correlated with the CSF antibody titre. Ticks are becoming more widespread and abundant, resulting in a higher incidence of neuroborreliosis. Hence, the knowledge of ophthalmological symptoms and findings is of great importance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.13884", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2888874360", "source": "openalex"}

This project sought to determine the role of a national undergraduate ophthalmology prize examination (Duke–Elder examination) in the selection of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. This would also serve as a quality assurance exercise for the assessment, in which the ultimate aim is to encourage trainees into ophthalmology. A retrospective analysis of the top 20 ranked candidates in the Duke–Elder examination from 1989 to 2005 (except 1995) was carried out to determine which of them subsequently entered the ophthalmic training and General Medical Council Specialist Registers. Out of the top 20 candidates in the exam, 29.5% went into specialist training in ophthalmology. Some appeared in the top 20 more than once, with 56% of them going into ophthalmic training, but they had a similar median time to enter training as those who appeared in the top 20 once. There was no significant evidence to suggest that the overall median ranking scores between the UK medical schools differed (P=0.23; Kruskal–Wallis test). However, there was a marked difference in frequency of top 20 candidates from each medical school, which could not be explained by the size of the medical school alone. It is difficult to conclude from these findings the importance that the Duke–Elder examination has in the selection of trainees into ophthalmology. The role of cognitive factors in selection into postgraduate medical/surgical training is discussed, along with the potential academic criteria, which may influence interview scores.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/eye.2011.114", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973908277", "source": "openalex"}

Objective The study aimed to determine the impact of away rotations on the ophthalmology residency selection process and to provide recommendations to faculty for counseling fourth-year medical students as they prepare for the ophthalmology match. Methods A survey was sent in June 2020 to program directors (PDs), medical student educators (MSEs), and residents at 119 accredited ophthalmology residency programs via the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology e-mail listserv. The 43 PDs and 38 MSEs who responded were asked questions about their views regarding away rotations and visiting students during the residency selection process. The 83 resident respondents were asked about their interview and match success after completing away rotations. Categorical variables were analyzed by Chi-square test. Results The majority of PDs and MSEs typically recommend that fourth-year medical students complete away rotations ( p = 0.022 and p = 0.194, respectively). The majority believe that an away rotation will increase the chance of the applicant matching with the host institution ( p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). The vast majority of PDs were more likely to offer an interview to a visiting student compared with another equally qualified applicant ( p < 0.001). However, only one-third of PDs were typically more likely to rank an away rotator higher on their rank list ( p = 0.047). Two-thirds of residents completed at least one away rotation in medical school (mean = 1.7 rotations). The majority received interview invitations from at least some of their host institutions ( p < 0.001). Approximately one-fifth ultimately matched at a host residency program ( p < 0.001).

Top 20 programs also had more followers compared with others on Facebook (4,363 vs. 696, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) and Twitter (3,673 vs. 355, respectively, p = 0.007) but not on Instagram (1,156 vs. 1,687, respectively, p = 0.71). Among 498 residency applicants to Bascom Palmer Eye Institute from the 2019 to 2020 cycle, 159 (31.9%) responded to a survey regarding their use of social media during the application process. In total, 54 (34%) responded that they used social media to evaluate residency programs. Conclusion Departments of top 20 ophthalmology residency had both a greater presence and following on social media compared with other departments. While Facebook was the most used platform by ophthalmology departments, applicants most commonly used Instagram. As applicants come to use these social media resources more frequently, ophthalmology residency programs may increasingly benefit from maintaining an active social media page.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714682", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3083854825", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1992891407", "title": "A Comparison of Examination Equipment Used During Common Clinical Ophthalmologic Tasks", "text": "OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONS Ophthalmologists and other eye-care physicians frequently use clinical examination equipment that restricts access to patients and requires the adoption of sustained, non-neutral working postures of the neck and shoulders. The use of ergonomic principles in the design of examination equipment could help reduce these physical demands, which may be partly responsible for the high prevalence of neck and shoulder pain among ophthalmologists. This study compared the effects of a set of this alternative “ergonomic” equipment to a set of conventional equipment on measures of neck and shoulder muscle activity and upper arm posture during simulations of common clinical ophthalmologic tasks. Results suggested that some aspects of the alternative equipment may help reduce exposures to sustained, non-neutral working postures of the neck and shoulder among ophthalmologists. Ophthalmologists and other eye-care physicians may consider implementing similar alternative equipment interventions into their practices.TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: Ophthalmologists report a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly of the neck and shoulders. Improving the design of equipment used in the clinical environment may reduce exposures to physical risk factors (e.g., sustained muscular exertions and non-neutral postures) associated with neck and shoulder pain among ophthalmologists. Purpose: This study compares estimates of neck and shoulder muscle activity and upper arm posture during use of conventional and alternative examination equipment common in clinical ophthalmologic practice. Methods: Fifteen ophthalmologists performed one mock clinical examination using conventional equipment and one mock clinical examination using alternative equipment with the potential to reduce exposure to sustained muscular exertions and non-neutral upper arm postures. The alternative equipment included a slit lamp biomicroscope with inclined viewing oculars, adjustable elbow supports, and a wider tabletop with more room for supporting the arms in comparison to the conventional slit lamp biomicroscope. A wireless binocular indirect ophthalmoscope was also evaluated that had a more even weight distribution than the conventional design. Measurements of upper trapezius and anterior deltoid muscle activity, upper arm posture, and perceived usability were used to compare the conventional and alternative equipment. Results: In comparison to the conventional slit lamp biomicroscope, the alternative slit lamp biomicroscope led to (i) 12% to 13% reductions in upper trapezius muscle activity levels, (ii) a 9% reduction in left anterior deltoid muscle activity levels, and (iii) a 15% reduction in the percentage of work time spent with the left upper arm elevated in positions greater than 60º. In addition, participants rated the comfort and adjustability of both the alternative slit lamp biomicroscope and binocular indirect ophthalmoscope more favorably than the conventional equipment. Conclusions: The results suggest that the alternative slit lamp biomicroscope may help to reduce overall muscular demands and non-neutral postures of the neck and shoulder region among ophthalmologists.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21577323.2014.964812", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992891407", "source": "openalex"}

So far, several scholars have proposed using different citation time windows for evaluating journals. However, there is no confirmation whether a longer citation time window would be better. How did the journal evaluation effects of 3IF, 4IF, and 6IF comparing with 2IF and 5IF? In order to understand these questions, we made a comparative study of impact factors with different citation time windows with the peer-reviewed scores of ophthalmologic journals indexed by Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database. Methods The peer-reviewed scores of 28 ophthalmologic journals were obtained through a self-designed survey questionnaire. Impact factors with different citation time windows (including 2IF, 3IF, 4IF, 5IF, and 6IF) of 28 ophthalmologic journals were computed and compared in accordance with each impact factor’s definition and formula, using the citation analysis function of the Web of Science (WoS) database. An analysis of the correlation between impact factors with different citation time windows and peer-reviewed scores was carried out. Results Although impact factor values with different citation time windows were different, there was a high level of correlation between them when it came to evaluating journals. In the current study, for ophthalmologic journals’ impact factors with different time windows in 2013, 3IF and 4IF seemed the ideal ranges for comparison, when assessed in relation to peer-reviewed scores. In addition, the 3-year and 4-year windows were quite consistent with the cited peak age of documents published by ophthalmologic journals. Research Limitations Our study is based on ophthalmology journals and we only analyze the impact factors with different citation time window in 2013, so it has yet to be ascertained whether other disciplines (especially those with a later cited peak) or other years would follow the same or similar patterns. Originality/ Value We designed the survey questionnaire ourselves, specifically to assess the real influence of journals. We used peer-reviewed scores to judge the journal evaluation effect of impact factors with different citation time windows. The main purpose of this study was to help researchers better understand the role of impact factors with different citation time windows in journal evaluation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135583", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1861673140", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Fifteen structured questions were sent online to all ophthalmologists registered with the All India Ophthalmological Society. The questionnaire was divided into three main categories of prophylaxis – preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. A web-based anonymous survey was conducted, and a unique response link allowed completing the survey only once. We compared the results with a similar 2014 survey among the members of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ASCRS). Results: The response was received from 30.2% (n = 4292/14,170) ophthalmologists. The results were as follows: all respondents do not prepare the eye with 5% povidone-iodine (83% of them use povidone iodine), majority (90%) use topical antibiotic both pre- and post-operatively, 46% use subconjunctival antibiotic at the end of surgery, and 40% use intracameral antibiotic (46% of them in high-risk patients only). Moxifloxacin was the preferred antibiotic for topical and intracameral use. Comparison with the 2014 ASCRS survey results showed a similarity in decision for pre- and post-operative antibiotics and intracameral antibiotic but dissimilarity in the choice of intracameral antibiotic and decision for subconjunctival antibiotic. Conclusion: The antibiotic prophylaxis practice by the Indian ophthalmologists is not too dissimilar from the practice in North American Ophthalmologists (ASCRS) though all ophthalmologists in India must be nudged to preoperative preparation of the eye with povidone-iodine and discontinue the practice of postoperative subconjunctival and systemic antibiotic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1336_17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2804880585", "source": "openalex"}

Biased conclusions from randomised controlled trials may lead to inappropriate management recommendations. This systematic review investigates the prevalence of bias risk in randomised controlled trials published in high-impact ophthalmology journals and ophthalmology trials from general medical journals. Using Ovid MEDLINE, randomised controlled trials in the top 10 high-impact ophthalmology journals in 2015 were systematically identified and critically appraised for the prevalence of bias risk. Included randomised controlled trials were assessed in all domains of bias as defined by the Cochrane Collaboration. In addition, the prevalence of conflict of interest and industry sponsorship was investigated. A comparison with ophthalmology articles from high-impact general medical journals was performed. Of the 259 records that were screened from ophthalmology-specific journals, 119 trials met all inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. In total, 29.4% of domains had an unclear risk, 13.8% had a high risk and 56.8% had a low risk of bias.

The importance of experience in marketing grew, as the concept itself is very personal and difficult to measure. Experience turns out to be complicated but once placed in a context it gets significant features. As the health care competitive environment increases, marketers are looking for new and effective methods of engaging consumers by using experiential marketing strategies. Moreover, little is known about the consumers' perceptions related to ophthalmologic services. Aim. The objective of this paper was to measure the consumer's perception of experiential marketing in the Romanian private ophthalmologic services by using structural equation modeling. Materials and Methods. The Experiential Marketing model consisted of the following components: Sense Experience, Feel Experience, Think Experience, Act Experience and Relate Experience as well as the consequences of applying Experiential Marketing in the form of willingness to purchase a service, generating word-of-mouth communication and building consumer loyalty. The sampling method was non-probabilistic, using the snowball technique and the sample was made up of 190 people who wore eyeglasses for more than 3 years. The instrument for data collection was a self-administered questionnaire, which consisted of 2 parts: the first section contained several demographic questions and the second section encompassed closed end questions related to the perception of private ophthalmologic services from an experiential marketing perspective. All the second section questions were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 with Strongly Disagree to 5 to Strongly Agree. The data analysis was conducted in SPSS and the structural equation modeling was performed in WarpPLS version 6.0. Findings. There were 71.05% respondents, who appreciated the application of experiential marketing in private ophthalmologic services, followed by 18.95%, who were confused. The demographic profile of respondents encompassed the following features: females with the ages between 36 and 45, from the rural area and with a middle level of education, their private ophthalmologic consultation frequency was at every 3 months and they also declared having a stable physician. Going further with the analysis, 89.63% of the respondents admitted they were willing to buy a private ophthalmologic service based on the experiential marketing application strategies. The design of a model containing both the constituent elements of the experimental marketing and its consequences in ophthalmologic services was conducted by modeling with structural equations in WarpPLS version 6.0 software. Thus, the validity of the model was assessed with the Cronbach's alpha coefficients, Composite reliability values, as well as with the Average Variance Extracted coefficients, and the fitness of the model was determined by using the ARS, APC, and AVIF values, respectively. According to the beta coefficients and levels of statistical significance (p<0.05), some hypotheses have been rejected or negative relationships have been established between dependent and independent variables. Conclusions. Sense experience had a negative impact on WOM and consumer loyalty, Think Experience had a negative influence on the WOM, Relate Experience had a negative impact on consumer Loyalty, as well as Relate Experience had a negative impact on willingness to purchase an ophthalmologic service. In contrast, the following positive relationships were established: Feel Experience established a positive relationship with WOM and consumer loyalty, Think Experience presented a positive impact both on consumer loyalty and on willingness to purchase an ophthalmologic service, Act Experience presented a positive impact on WOM and willingness to purchase and last, willingness to purchase an ophthalmologic service presented a positive influence on consumer loyalty and WOM.

Methods Patients aged ≥40 years with hyperopia ≥1 D were consecutively recruited in a community general ophthalmology clinic. Detailed darkroom gonioscopy was done, and primary angle closure was diagnosed if there was iridotrabecular apposition >180 degrees not secondary to an identifiable ocular disorder. Biometric parameters were measured and compared between the eyes with and without angle closure. Results Eighty-four eyes from 84 patients (aged 61.3±8.9 y) were enrolled. There were 52 female (62%) and 32 male. Fourteen patients (16.7%) were diagnosed with angle closure. A statistically significant difference was observed between the eyes with and without angle closure in mean axial length (22.07±0.72 vs. 22.61±0.97, P=0.028), anterior chamber depth (ACD) (2.45±0.33 vs. 2.89±0.32, P<0.001), and lens thickness (4.97±0.3 vs. 4.62±0.4, P=0.002). Degree of hyperopia was marginally significant (3.13±2.3 vs. 2.45±1.5, P=0.09). In a logistic regression model, only ACD remained statistically significantly different (P=0.016). We tested the ability of ACD to distinguish eyes with angle closure. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.824; using a cutoff ACD value of 2.65 mm, sensitivity was 0.786 with a specificity of 0.812.

Failure or delay in diagnosis was responsible for 35% of claims and 63% of patient indemnification. Allegations of failure to diagnose most commonly concerned retinal detachment. While an identical number of claims were closed with payment because of errors in treatment, the indemnity for these claims was less by a factor of nearly half. The greatest number of claims alleging negligent treatment involved complications of cataract surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3928/1542-8877-19861001-15", "url": "https://openalex.org/W182003461", "source": "openalex"}

To arouse ophthalmologists’ awareness in patient safety by reviewing sentinel events in Ophthalmology submitted to a web-based incident reporting system involving all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Methods . Sentinel events in Ophthalmology reported from November 2007 to October 2014 were identified and classified into different categories for further presentation and analysis. Key contributing factors attributing to the occurrence of the incidents were described. Suggestions aiming to prevent future occurrence of similar events were made. Relevant literature and case law were discussed. Results . Twelve sentinel events were included in this observational case series. They were classified into 4 main categories, namely “wrong eye” (5 cases, 41%), “wrong prescription” (3 cases, 25%), “wrong patient and surgery” (2 cases, 17%), and “retained surgical items” (2 cases, 17%). The key contributing factor leading to the occurrence of the incidents was largely human error. Increased staff awareness and proper time-out procedures were recommended to help prevent occurrence of these errors. Conclusion . Sentinel events in Ophthalmology do occur. Many of these incidents were attributed to human error. Surgeon’s awareness and willingness to prevent occurrence of sentinel events are warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/454096", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031115556", "source": "openalex"}

The main mechanism for maintenance of the normal head position is the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Torticollis is a clinical sign associated with a variety of disorders including neurological, musculoskeletal, inflammatory, otolaryngological, postural, and traumatic. It is most commonly benign and self limited. Complete resolution is expected with treatment.Evaluation of the patient with head tilt should include a detailed history and physical exam, particularly neurological exam. Investigations follow findings on the physical exam; cervical spine films are commonly needed. Additional radiographic investigation including an MRI may be needed in selected cases.In cases where a cause has not been found, followup is necessary.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/0065955x.1995.11982045", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2795497775", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, topical blockade of IL-1 and TNF-alpha, alone or in combination, was compared to conventional corticosteroid anti-inflammatory therapy in suppressing infiltration of the cornea by antigen-presenting Langerhans cells (LCs) and in promoting corneal transplant survival in a mouse model of keratoplasty.Study drugs included topical 2% IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), 1.5% soluble TNF-alpha receptor (sTNFR), and 1% prednisolone phosphate (Pred), all formulated in hyaluronic acid vehicle. Fifty eyes of BALB/c mice were used for LC studies where the numbers of LCs were determined 1 week after electrocautery to the corneal surface or transplantation of C57BL/6 corneas. Additionally, 65 BALB/c mice received corneal allografts and were randomized to receive one of the following for 8 weeks: (1) IL-1Ra, (2) sTNFR, (3) Pred, (4) combined IL-1Ra and Pred, or (5) vehicle alone.Mean suppression of LC infiltration after electrocautery or transplantation was 67% and 71%, respectively, for IL-1Ra, 40% and 62% for sTNFR, 70% and 72% for sTNFR+IL-1Ra, and 77% and 78% for Pred alone. Rejection rates were 15% for IL-1Ra (P = .01), 38% for sTNFR (P = .1), 17% for Pred (P = .02), and 7% for combined IL-1Ra+Pred (P = .002) as compared to 69% for the vehicle-treated group. IL-1Ra and Pred, but not sTNFR, significantly inhibited post-transplantation neovascularization.Topical IL-1Ra and prednisolone are comparable in their capacity to promote graft survival. sTNFR therapy, though effective, has much lower efficacy as compared to IL-1Ra or Pred. Combination IL-1Ra and steroid therapy offers only minimal added efficacy over either agent used alone.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119350323", "source": "openalex"}
