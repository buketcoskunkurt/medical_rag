A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning.In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged ≥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions.Age-standardized prevalence for those aged ≥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5%-7% in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5%), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2%-4%). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58% of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63% in 2030 and 71% in 2050.The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2999310245", "title": "Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support (WHO EQUIP): developing a competent global workforce", "text": "Globally, the vast majority of people with mental health conditions do not receive effective care. Among people living with depression, only 1 in 5 persons in high-income countries and 1 in 27 in lower-middle income countries receive minimally adequate treatment1. There is a dearth of health workers trained in mental health care, with only one trained provider per 10,000 people in most countries2. One key action to improve access to mental health care is to expand psychological and psychosocial support services delivered by diverse cadres across settings3. There is now good evidence that persons who are not specialists in mental health can effectively deliver psychological interventions, but they must be adequately trained and supervised4. Non-specialist providers include primary care workers, community workers, psychosocial workers, teachers, family members and peers. However, unlike licensed professionals for whom there are professional associations to assure standards, there are usually no systems or mechanisms in place that check whether non-specialist providers have sufficient training and supervision to achieve minimum competency to effectively and safely deliver interventions. This raises the question: how can governments and the general population be assured that non-specialists provide quality care? One way to address this challenge is to establish competency-based training approaches and competency assessment measures that governments, non-governmental organizations and other institutions can use to benchmark skills for safe and effective care. Competency measures can be used to determine who is or is not competent as well as to tailor supervision and supplementary training to address gaps in skills. Having competency targets in mind can also inform training duration and content that may need to vary across sites or cadres. Competency-based training approaches have already demonstrated success in diverse areas of health care in low resource settings, including surgery and obstetric care5, 6. To facilitate competency-based training in psychosocial support, psychological treatments, and foundational helping skills, the World Health Organization (WHO) is developing the Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support (EQUIP) platform (https://www.who.int/mental_health/emergencies/equip/en/). The EQUIP platform aligns with WHO's work on universal health coverage, that is establishing competency frameworks across fields of health care. EQUIP will be an online resource to help program managers and trainers utilize competency assessments to evaluate trainings and to feedback those competency results to support trainee development and modify curricula. The full suite will comprise tutorials on implementing competency assessments, including how to achieve interrater reliability with global rating standards and how to use role plays to assess competency. It will include guidance for trainers on delivering competency-based training programs, and for implementation and adaptation of psychological interventions. In addition, the EQUIP platform will offer training modules on common factors that can be selected based on competency assessment outcomes. Common factors are general elements of psychosocial support and psychological care – such as communication skills, empathy, collaboration, and helper-client alliance – that are vital ingredients for any intervention to be effective7. Contents of the EQUIP platform have been informed by a theory of change workshop attended by mental health and psychosocial service stakeholders with different practice experiences from diverse global settings. The EQUIP team has reviewed manuals and training materials for interventions delivered by non-specialists with effectiveness demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. This has led to the identification of competencies for both common factors and specific classes of psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive, interpersonal, problem solving, behavioral and trauma-focused techniques). EQUIP will encompass a competency evaluation tool, the Enhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic Factors (ENACT), that has been developed for role-play based assessment of mental health and psychosocial support skills for non-specialist and specialist providers across cultures, context and types of interventions8, 9. In addition, a suite of competency assessment tools based on ENACT is being developed and tested. Below we briefly outline who, how, where and when EQUIP can be used. Who can use EQUIP? EQUIP is intended for trainers, supervisors and project managers implementing psychosocial support and psychological interventions. How can EQUIP be used? EQUIP can be used to improve implementation plans, competency assessments of trainees, and training and supervision curricula in common factors to accompany manualized interventions. Competency assessments may also be used to aid selection of trainees and to guide institutional certification after achieving minimum skill targets. Where can EQUIP be used? EQUIP will be an online platform of resources with offline formats. When can EQUIP be used? To refine the platform and its materials, EQUIP is being developed using a human-centered design approach to enhance usability and engagement, and piloted in multiple countries. After piloting, materials will be available in English, Arabic and Spanish. Ultimately, EQUIP is intended to be a resource that will undergo iterative transformation based on feedback from the global practitioner community. Addressing mental health and psychosocial needs requires radical growth in the global workforce to ensure safe and effective delivery of psychosocial support and evidence-based psychological interventions. The EQUIP platform will make competency-based training and assessment resources widely available and adaptable to the contexts and needs of local organizations and practitioners.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20704", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2999310245", "source": "openalex"}

The journal has, to a large extent, lived up to this pledge in its 5 years of existence—by May, 2018, it had published 637 papers that referenced the world's most economically disadvantaged region, Africa. With regard to the topics on which the journal has pledged to focus, however, there is a lacuna in its coverage of Africa. Most of its key topics of focus have received strong attention. A search of the journal's online database on April 25, 2018, combining key Lancet Global Health research topics with the word \"Africa\" found 191 papers that allude to maternal health in Africa. Infectious diseases have been covered greatly with HIV or AIDs mentioned in 252 papers, malaria in 165 papers, and tuberculosis in 114 papers. Health systems in Africa have been referred to in 346 papers, and health policy in 282 papers. In the area of mental health, another of the journal's key topics, The Lancet Global Health has been much less prolific. Only 21 articles have alluded to depression in Africa, only seven to anxiety, six to suicide, four to addiction, one to psychosis, and none to schizophrenia. A search for \"mental health disorders\" in Africa produces just 16 items. This weakness reflects a dearth of research into mental health problems in the region.

The scarcity of research mirrors the weakness of mental health services on the continent and the blind eye turned to the problem by many Africans and their governments. Worldwide, 24% of countries that reported to the WHO's 2014 Mental Health Atlas survey did not have or had not implemented standalone mental health policies; in Africa, this proportion rose to 46%. The region has 1·4 mental health workers per 100 000 people, compared with a global average of 9·0 per 100 000, and also performs relatively poorly with regard to the number of psychiatrists, the number of hospital beds for patients with mental illness, and the coverage of outpatient facilities. Partly as a consequence, the proportion of Africans who receive treatment for mental health problems is extremely low. While the global annual rate of visits to mental health outpatient facilities is 1051 per 100 000 population, in Africa the rate is 14 per 100 000.2WHOMental Health Atlas 2014.

Additionally, it can assist policy makers by devoting more space in its pages to research that assesses the prevalence of and risk factors for mental health disorders; the effectiveness—and cost-effectiveness—of prevention and treatment interventions; and the role of policy and health systems in responding to the challenge.

The World Health Organization (WHO) have recently produced guidelines on the management of physical health conditions in SMD. This paper presents the evidence which led to the recommendations for tobacco cessation and management of substance use disorders in SMD. Scoping reviews informed 2 PICO (Population Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions relating to tobacco cessation and management of substance use disorders in SMD. Systematic searches led to the identification of systematic reviews with relevant evidence to address these questions. Retrieved evidence was assessed using GRADE methodology, informing the development of guidelines. One thousand four hundred thirty-four records were identified through systematic searches for SMD and tobacco cessation, of which 4 reviews were included in GRADE tables and 18 reviews in narrative synthesis. For SMD and substance use disorders, 4268 records were identified, of which 4 studies from reviews were included in GRADE tables and 16 studies in narrative synthesis. People with SMD who use tobacco should be offered combined pharmacological (Varenicline, Bupropion or Nicotine Replacement Therapy) and non-pharmacological interventions such as tailored directive and supportive behavioural interventions. For people with SMD and substance use disorders (drug and/or alcohol), interventions should be considered in accordance with WHO mhGAP guidelines. Prescribers should note potential drug-drug interactions. Recommendation were conditional and based on low/very low certainty of evidence with a scarcity of evidence from low- and middle-income settings. These guidelines mark an important step towards addressing premature mortality in people with SMD.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2394663365", "title": "WHO/WONCA report –<i>Integrating Mental Health in Primary Care: A Global Perspective</i>", "text": "At the WONCA Asia Pacific annual conference in Melbourne, October 2008, WONCA President Chris Van Weel introduced what he called a ‘historic moment’. Four years in gestation and involving input from 12 countries in four continents, the joint WHO/WONCA report Integrating Mental Health in Primary Care – A Global Perspective was finally being launched. The 800 free copies were snapped up by delegates before the end of morning coffee (and disappointed latecomers were told they could download a pdf of the full report from www.who.int/mental_health/policy/en). Dr Michelle Funk, co-ordinator of Mental Health Services at WHO Geneva, introduced the report by reading the story of Juan, a 43-year-old man from a South American country who had developed schizophrenia in his mid-20s. Juan described how his life disintegrated soon after his diagnosis, with the loss of his job,a failed marriage, loss of contact with his children, and returning to live with his elderly mother who did her best under difficult circumstances. Juan received many years of hospital-based ‘treatment’, which typically took him away from his home and family and included numerous inpatient episodes which, despite ‘nice’ staff, he experienced as traumatic. He was sometimes made to receive treatment he didn't want or understand, and went hungry because the food in hospital was inadequate. When discharged, Juan often missed his outpatient appointments (and hence his injections) because he could not afford the bus fare to the city. But the story had a relatively happy ending: Juan now receives his regular medication in a community based clinic three blocks from his home, from a nurse he knows and likes. He feels understood and supported, and looks forward to his fortnightly visits to the clinic. He's currently well, but if he develops problems, he will be able to see a psychiatric nurse at a community outreach clinic without the need for a trip to hospital. Juan's story illustrates the problems faced the world over by mental health service users: a confusing, frightening and often lifelong illness experience; loss of productivity; stigma and social exclusion; difficulties in accessing services; fragmented care provision oriented mainly to treating exacerbations and controlling behaviour; occasional human rights abuses; and limited advocacy. Mental health problems account for 13% of the global burden of disease, but the gap between need and provision of care is high. Around 80% of people with severe mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries, and 40% in high-in-come countries, had received no treatment in the previous 12 months. The 224-page report offers detailed examples of best practice in integrated care from 12 countries. These examples show that, even though current provision of mental health services in primary care is still globally far from ideal, integration between primary, secondary and voluntary-sector care can be achieved in a range of settings and socio-economic contexts. The advantages of an integrated approach, in which patients' first point of contact is their primary health care team, include: reduced stigma for mental health patients and their families greatly improved access to care more holistic management of co-morbidities including HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and tuberculosis improved prevention and early detection of mental health disorders better treatment and follow-up of mental disorders, not least because of reduced losses to follow-up lower patient-borne costs (e.g. transport to hospital and loss of productivity in relatives who spend time accompanying the patient) easier communication with healthcare providers improved social integration protection of human rights and avoidance of institutionalisation improved overall capacity of the healthcare system to deal with mental health problems. The report recommends training primary care workers to help them better identify and respond to patients with mental disorders. But it also points out that the effects of training are nearly always short-lived if staff do not practice newly learnt skills and receive specialist supervision over time. Systems of supervision and ongoing support for primary care workers are strongly recommended in addition to initial training. The report recognises that in order for its recommendations to be effective, the overall workload of primary care staff must be addressed. In many countries, such staff are overburdened with work as they are expected to deliver multiple programmes with limited resources and backup. There may be a need to increase the numbers of primary health care staff if they are to take on the additional burden of mental health work and deliver potential in this area. As with all complex challenges in health and social care, there is no simple or universal formula for providing an effective and efficient integrated mental health service. But ten principles set out in the report provide some high-level guidance for countries seeking to achieve this goal. These range from clear and coherent national-level policy direction and adequate resource allocation through to grass-roots involvement and capacity building at local level.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17571472.2009.11493254", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2394663365", "source": "openalex"}

Risk factors for many common mental disorders are heavily associated with social inequalities, whereby the greater the inequality the higher the inequality in risk. The poor and disadvantaged suffer disproportionately, but those in the middle of the social gradient are also affected. It is of major importance that action is taken to improve the conditions of everyday life, beginning before birth and progressing into early childhood, older childhood and adolescence, during family building and working ages, and through to older age. Action throughout these life stages would provide opportunities for both improving population mental health, and for reducing risk of those mental disorders that are associated with social inequalities. As mental disorders are fundamentally linked to a number of other physical health conditions, these actions would also reduce inequalities in physical health and improve health overall. Action needs to be universal: across the whole of society and proportionate to need.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2105368343", "title": "Bridging the mental health research gap in low‐ and middle‐income countries", "text": "Research can and should play a substantial role in improving the mental health situation in low- and middle-income countries (in the following: non-rich countries), where the gap between burden of mental disorders and mental health resources is the largest (1, 2). Research-generated information is essential to determine mental health needs, to propose cost-effective and culturally appropriate interventions of an individual or collective nature, to monitor the process of their implementation, to evaluate the progress made, and to explore the obstacles that prevent recommended strategies from being implemented. The difference between the research information that is needed to plan the best possible services in a given setting and what is currently available can be called the research gap. All available indications are pointing towards the fact that the research gap is particularly large in the non-rich countries. It is known that mental health research publications from non-rich countries constitute a small proportion of the total research output on mental health from the world (3-5). This finding is in consonance with health literature in general (6-8) and in biomedical publications the gap between countries with low and high level of publications is widening (9). These latter findings, specially, serve as a grim reminder that inattention to inequalities will prove a severe handicap in the long run as skill and technological advantage have a self-reinforcing character. Not only is very limited research conducted in non-rich countries but the subject matter often does not answer population needs, e.g. if one follows the criterion of burden of disorders to decide on the priority for research, mental and emotional disorders as a whole (10) and affective disorders, self-inflicted injuries and mental retardation, specifically, are under-researched topics (11). In addition, new knowledge, when it exists, is seldom applied partly because of the fact that some excellent examples of research do not come to attention of policy makers and planners because of poor dissemination opportunities (12). The problems in conducting mental health research in low- and middle-income countries have been discussed by many authors (4, 12-15). A definite barrier is the low priority accorded to mental health in general and mental health research in particular. Equally important are limitations imposed by resources (e.g. funding, facilities, support staff), research capacity (e.g. trained researchers, technical support, peer network, co-operative endeavours, migration of researchers), and research environment (e.g. research culture, availability of time, incentives, bureaucracy, isolation from networks). Preferably, the research policy for a country could be developed in harmony with all other components of the national mental health policy and strategies, as research should provide to most components with the necessary scientific inputs, and with the baseline and evaluation data they require (16, 17). Research should also safeguard ethical principles in its origin (why has the research been done?), formulation (were consumers and other relevant stakeholders involved?), purpose (how the information will advance the state of mental health of the population?), target (whom will it serve?), and operation (how the rights of the individuals, families and communities will be preserved?) (16). Kleinman and Han (18) suggest that non-rich countries should focus on practical and cost-effective research methods and intervention-oriented research that can be employed across many areas rather than prioritizing research according to topics. They argue for the development of population laboratories that integrate epidemiological, clinical, social science, and biomedical research through interdisciplinary research teams and international collaborations. This type of research not only brings to light the mental health burden locally and its underlying social, economic, and political constraints, but it also enables the design and implementation of relevant policies. Patel (19) suggests that Health Systems Research model that emphasizes action-oriented research, planned in close collaboration with a number of stakeholders, and disseminated in a variety of formats targeted to different user groups should be utilized in non-rich countries. Towards reducing the research gap in non-rich countries, World Health Organization has launched an initiative called 'Research for Change' (11). The initiative is supported by a broad group of stakeholders including representatives of national research institutes and research councils, international research organizations, funding agencies and donors, editors of scientific journals, policy advisors and programme planners from non-rich and rich countries. Supporting scientific publications from non-rich countries is one of the strategies of the Research for Change initiative. Publications from these countries can obviously draw attention to mental health issues that are more specific to them. But, in addition, they can inform policy making on local, regional, national and international levels; mental health reform and practice, education and research in the field of mental health that could benefit non-rich and high-income countries alike, e.g. research in primary care settings in non-rich countries, could be very useful to rich countries with under-served populations. It should also be noted that publication activity is aimed at not only generating specific information and knowledge but also in further development of research training and skills that serves as an intangible capital. Perhaps more is gained from the publication process through the investment in education of researchers, improved research techniques and membership of professional networks in comparison with the actual knowledge generated in countries where research is still in its infancy. Furthermore, improvement in research and publication capacity stimulates demand for basic research knowledge as well as resources, techniques and data. Capacity strengthening in non-rich countries also indirectly benefits rich countries in terms of creating opportunities for collaborative research. The integration of researchers/authors into an international network also enhances critical abilities of researchers from non-rich countries and tends to correct ethnocentric biases and national focus. It is not being suggested that journals should lower their standards to publish more studies from non-rich countries; on the contrary, it is vital that publication standards remain high. Instead, researchers from these countries may be assisted to achieve the requisite standards in their research and its presentation. Journals could give priority to research coming from countries that have a limited research base, for example, by letting a higher percentage of papers from these countries pass through the initial screening to the full review process. Researchers can be helped to improve their submissions through careful assessment and detailed recommendations for revision and manuscripts can be further polished through technical support (e.g. language editing). Capacity building is key to changes in the long term. This could be done through mentoring, personal encouragement, courses and research collaboration. Support for editorial boards and reviewers of journals in non-rich countries could be provided in relation to journal management, editorial procedures, peer review and setting professional standards. This could be achieved through mentorship, twinning arrangements and training workshops. The example of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica serves as a case in point for some of the issues discussed above. It has carried a number of editorials discussing the theme of international psychiatric research (17, 20, 21) and in particular research in relation to non-rich countries (12). The journal also has the highest representation of non-rich country papers (16%), a proportion that was three times the average of other leading psychiatry journals (4). Acta also has a very low regionalization index (5) and it draws publications from all regions of the world (4, 22). This has been achieved through proactive and author-sensitive policies, e.g. extra rounds of editing for papers from non-rich countries, organizing courses on planning and designing psychiatric research projects and participating in international multicentre studies on an equal basis (23). Having a proactive policy for research publications from these countries has not in any way lowered the standards as suggested by the two-fold rise in the impact factor of the Journal over the last decade (23). While the initiatives of a particular journal contribute to reducing the research gap and deserve to be acknowledged, the need is for a broad-based and consensus-driven international initiative to make a real, substantial and sustained difference. Towards this aim, WHO recently (November 2003) organized a meeting entitled 'Mental Health Research in Developing Countries: Role of Scientific Journals' in Geneva with editors of top international and selected national journals to exchange ideas and explore ways in which editors can take this agenda forward. A fair degree of agreement emerged in the meeting and the participants issued a joint statement and a catalogue of ideas to galvanize action by individual journals and editorial and international organizations. The statement can be accessed from WHO website (http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/final_joint_statement.pdf) and is also reproduced in this issue of the Journal (24). Individual journals are independent (as they should be) and differ enormously on their vision, objectives and preferences. The adoption of a uniform action plan by all journals is neither practical nor desirable. Hence, the Joint Statement (24) does not tell individual journals/editors what they should do. However, it does articulate a shared vision of the urgent needs, leaving specific action and timelines to the discretion and enthusiasm of the signatory editors and organizations. We believe that the Joint Statement is a landmark achievement in collaboration by editors publishing mental health research and this initiative has the potential to contribute to bridging the mental health research gap in low- and middle-income countries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00348.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105368343", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2313237740", "title": "Depression, Guilt and Emotional Depth", "text": "Abstract It is generally maintained that emotions consist of intentional states and /or bodily feelings. This paper offers a phenomenological analysis of guilt in severe depression, in order to illustrate how such conceptions fail to adequately accommodate a way in which some emotional experiences are said to be deeper than others. Many emotions are intentional states. However, I propose that the deepest emotions are not intentional but pre-intentional, meaning that they determine which kinds of intentional state are possible. I go on to suggest that pre-intentional emotions are at the same time feelings. In so doing, I reject the distinction that is often made between bodily feelings and the world-oriented aspects of emotion. Notes 1. Cataldi (Citation1993) and Pugmire (Citation2005) similarly suggest that not enough attention has been paid to the topic of emotional depth. 2. In fact, the entire phenomenological tradition acknowledges this aspect of experience (see, for example, Husserl, Citation1973; Heidegger, Citation1962; Merleau-Ponty, Citation1962). 3. Several philosophers have recently argued that emotions involve perceiving things to be significant. See, for example, de Sousa (Citation1990, Ch. 7), Deonna (Citation2006) and Goldie (Citation2007). 4. I adopt a phenomenological conception of intentionality throughout, treating it as a directedness that is integral to experience. In recent years, intentionality has been reinvented by some philosophers as a non-phenomenological relation of \"aboutness\". There is no philosophical disagreement here; it is just a terminological matter. I am using the term in its traditional sense and they are using it to talk about something else. 5. See also Strasser (Citation1977, Ch. 7) for a distinction between \"pre-intentional\" and \"intentional\" feelings. Accepting this distinction does not require rejecting the view that intentionality is the \"mark of the mental\". The pre-intentional can be construed as part of the structure of intentionality. 6. See, for example, Stocker and Hegeman (Citation1996, p. 285) for the claim that guilt involves attribution of responsibility whereas shame need not. 7. There are also more mundane cases of irrational guilt. For example, Elster (Citation1999, p. 151) says that he feels guilty when friends travel a long distance to see him and it rains throughout their stay. 8. See Stocker (Citation2007) for a comprehensive discussion of the various criteria that have been proposed for distinguishing guilt from shame. He concludes that they all fail but retains the view that shame and guilt are importantly different, maintaining that the relevant criteria have yet to be found. 9. See Ratcliffe (Citation2008, Ch. 1) for a survey of recent accounts of emotion that appeal to intentional states, bodily feelings or a combination of the two. 10. I do not wish to suggest that this kind of guilt occurs in every diagnosed case of melancholia or that it is specific to melancholia. All my argument requires is that this kind of experience does sometimes occur in depression. 11. See also Fuchs (Citation2003) for a good discussion of the experience of guilt in depression. 12. However, see Radden (Citation2009, Ch. 9) for the view that the prominence of guilt symptoms is historically and culturally variable. 13. There is the methodological concern that most such narratives are written after an episode of depression rather than during it. Hence testimony may be unreliable. However, many accounts incorporate letters or other writings that were composed while depressed. One might also worry that people with depression have cognitive impairments that make self-reports unreliable. However, the fact that descriptions offered during an episode of depression and following recovery are generally consistent counts against this objection too. 14. The term \"anhedonia\" is often used to refer to this. However, happiness encompasses more than just hedonic pleasure. 15. Although I accept that descriptions of depression are influenced by social and cultural factors, I very much doubt that the themes discussed here are just artefacts of a common literary heritage. In any case, they are certainly not exclusive to accounts by professional writers. Others report much the same thing. For example: \"It was like being inside a very, very thick balloon and no matter how hard I pushed out, the momentum of the skin of the balloon would just push me back in. So I couldn't touch anybody, I couldn't touch anything. And I know in my head I loved my husband and kids but I couldn't feel anything at all. My emotions were completely dead. And I was just very frightened. It was the most frightening, terrifying experience, and it looked like it was an unending one.\" (Interview with a fifty-year-old woman on: healthtalkonline.org/mental_health/Depression, accessed 23/10/2008.) 16. See Wyllie (Citation2005) for a good survey of work on the phenomenological psychopathology of time. 17. This transformation can be interpreted in terms of what Heidegger calls \"thrown projection\" (geworfener Entwurf) (1962, §31, p. 188). According to Heidegger, we are thrown into the world, meaning that we find ourselves in a place that is not of our own making, where things present themselves as significant to us in a range of ways. Inextricable from this is the way in which we project ourselves towards some of the significant possibilities that the world offers, understanding both ourselves and the things around us in terms of possibilities that we seek to actualise. Depression, one might say, is a transformation in the structure of thrown projection, where various kinds of possibility are removed from the world into which one is thrown, along with the possibility of purposively pursuing anything at all. Passively waiting for some threat to be realised replaces the usual orientation towards future possibilities. See, for example, Tellenbach (Citation1980) for an account of severe depression that draws on Heidegger. 18. Given that deep guilt involves a loss of future possibilities, it is closely associated with a sense of deadness or of impending death (Fuchs, Citation2003). To be confronted with an irrevocable past and a future that consists only of an all-encompassing threat is characterised by many as the unpleasant feeling of being about to die. For instance, Solomon (Citation2001, p. 28) says that \"what is happening to you in depression is horrible, but it seems to be very much wrapped up in what is about to happen to you. Amongst other things, you feel you are about to die\" (Solomon, Citation2001, p. 28). Kaysen (Citation2001, p. 43) similarly describes depression as \"a foretaste of death. It's a trip to the country of nothingness.\" Others report feeling as though they had died or even believed that they were dead: \"I was certain, quite certain, that I was already dead. The actual dying part, the withering away of my physical body, was a mere formality\" (Wurtzel, Citation1996, p. 19). 19. My position here is consistent with the more general view that \"autobiographically past-directed emotions\" consist of current emotional responses to remembered events rather than remembered emotions (Debus, Citation2007). One remembers one's past activities through the deep guilt, and therefore cannot summon past emotions that are incompatible with guilt. 20. One could define guilt in such a way as to exclude what I call deep guilt. But deep guilt is often referred to by people as a form of guilt, and is structurally similar to shallow guilt. So I continue to call it guilt. But denying its status as guilt would not affect my central argument: it is still a deep emotional state and therefore serves to illustrate my account of what gives an emotion its depth. 21. See also Fuchs (Citation2001) for the view that a sense of irrevocable guilt is bound up with changes in the structure of temporal experience. 22. Fuchs (Citation2003, p. 239) describes the predicament as follows: \"The melancholic is so identified with his guilt that he is guilty per se; this corresponds to an archaic, undifferentiated self-perception. He feels like being the center of a 'guilt-world', in which everything becomes a sign of his omission. There is no forgiveness, no remorse or reparation in the future; being guilty comprises his total being.\" 23. The situation is analogous in some respects to the oft-cited example of the congenitally blind person's conception of the colour red. Seeing red is not part of her life, among her possibilities. 24. I conceive of emotional depth phenomenologically, and it is not a causal notion. What a person takes to be impossible is in fact possible, and apredicament that seems irrevocable can be altered. The depth of an emotional state is not an indicator of its degree of susceptibility to various kinds of causal influence. 25. The irrevocability of deep guilt is different from the certainty that might be associated with shallower guilt. In the latter case, one can entertain the possibility of one's not being guilty—one just knows that one is guilty. But, in the former case, one cannot entertain the possibility of any such alternative and so the sense of certainty arises in a different way. 26. Heidegger (Citation1962, Division Two, II) claims that guilt is an unavoidable correlate of our freedom. A being that directs itself towards the possible will inevitably fail to actualise certain possibilities; we are never all that we could be. What he calls the \"call of conscience\" reveals our guilt to us—our having failed to realise possibilities that are now lost. Heidegger's \"guilt\" does not correspond to any of the kinds of guilt I discuss here. It is the structure of experience that is presupposed by the possibility of feeling guilt about something. What I have called \"deep guilt\" is an alteration of that structure. 27. There is much controversy over whether depression should be a medical or a moral concern (see, for example, Graham, Citation1990; Martin, Citation1999).

Overcoming the stigma around self-harm and suicide in young people, in LMICs in particular, will not be straightforward. Stigma reduction strategies from HICs are not easily transferrable to LMICs. One example is the National Alliance on Mental Illness' campaign to end discrimination that was launched in the USA, which aimed to educate the public, facilitate treatment-seeking, and reduce stigma by promoting neurobiological bases of mental illnesses, such as alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, and depression. The campaign had little effect on social tolerance towards those with mental illness, but it increased the likelihood of support for treatment from people around those facing mental health issues.7Pescosolido BA Martin JK Long JS Medina TR Phelan JC Link BG \"A disease like any other\"?

Self-stigmatisation influences all interactions with caregivers and family members, as well as peers, health workers, and the health service system beyond. Self-stigma can be explored through an assessment of beliefs about self-harm, the affective responses it elicits (eg, anger or shame), and a young person's capacity to discuss these. A similar strategy can be adopted with caregivers and family members, after obtaining consent from the mental health service user. Incorporating peer support workers (ie, people with a lived experience of self-harm) in mental health services can prove useful in LMICs, in particular, where resources are sparse but social networks are strong.8Vally Z Abrahams L The effectiveness of peer-delivered services in the management of mental health conditions: a meta-analysis of studies from low- and middle-income countries.Int J Adv Couns. 2016; 38: 330-344Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar Peer support workers can be integrated into mental health service teams, co-designing service delivery models and sharing their own experiences to facilitate the provision of non-judgmental and non-discriminatory services.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2123857309", "title": "Suicide, suicide attempts and pesticides: a major hidden public health problem", "text": "In addition to its specific focus on self-directed violence, the paper by Eddleston et al. in this issue of the Bulletin highlights how intersectoral collaboration can be crucial to furthering the cause of public health. (1) With nearly 900 000 deaths from suicide every year, worldwide, (2) suicide takes more lives than homicides and wars combined; it is commonly acknowledged that this figure is an underestimation and that the real magnitude can barely be guessed. Added to these deaths are the many non-fatal suicide attempts, some of which are addressed by Eddleston et al. In the absence of national registries or reliable hospital-based systems for recording suicide attempts, a large-scale study was conducted by the WHO Regional Office for Europe to estimate the number of suicide attempts in several European cities of various sizes. (3) The findings were compared with corresponding national rates for completed suicides, and showed suicide attempt rates to be 10-40 times higher than rates for completed suicides. Projecting these figures to the global total of completed suicides would give the mind-boggling worldwide estimate of between 9-36 million suicide attempts every year. Whatever the real numbers, self-directed violence clearly constitutes a major public health challenge that health planners, policy-makers and practitioners simply cannot afford to ignore. Imprecision in recording efforts does not only affect the figures for suicide. For every real case of suicide that is misrecorded as something else (e.g. accident, stroke or cardiac arrest), another mortality category will be unduly inflated, thus distorting the entire system of mortality records. Individual studies on the reliability of suicide mortality recording have indicated that numbers of deaths may be underestimated by 30-200%. (W4) Reliable information on suicide mortality and suicide attempts is therefore not only useful for better planning and delivery of suicide prevention programmes, but will also help to provide a clearer picture of the mortality attributable to other causes, particularly those indicated above. Perhaps even less well understood is the specific link between suicide and pesticides, which is significant in rural areas generally and in Asian countries in particular. It is estimated that in the last 10 years between 60-90% of suicides in China, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Trinidad and Tobago were by pesticide ingestion. (W5) This led Gunnell & Eddleston to estimate that there are as many as 300 000 deaths each year from intentional pesticide poisoning in those parts of the world. (W6) More recently, WHO has received reports of a growing number of suicides due to pesticide ingestion in many other Asian countries and in Central and South American countries (e.g. Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Nicaragua and Paraguay). This may well mean that the global number of suicide deaths is considerably higher than currently estimated, and clearly makes pesticide ingestion the most common method of suicide on a worldwide basis. This new information provides clear indications of directions for action. …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.06.030668", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123857309", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2131520243", "title": "Against Happiness: A Critical Appraisal of the Use of Measures of Happiness for Evaluating Progress in Development", "text": "AbstractThe idea that measures of happiness, or subjective well-being, should be used as the sole (or dominant) measure of country progress has gained considerable support. This paper traces the origins of the approach in the works of eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century utilitarians, whose thinking ultimately provided the foundations for income as the measure of progress, equating income and utility. In contrast, the recent approach of neo-utilitarians intends to replace income as the objective by measures of happiness derived from surveys. This paper assesses happiness as the objective of development and a measure of progress, contrasting it with human rights and capabilities approaches and the promotion of justice, which each also challenge the income measure. The paper considers problems with the happiness approach arising from difficulties in measurement, people's tendency to adapt to their circumstances, and its inability to capture the well-being of future generations, while also providing a weak basis for distributional judgements. The author argues that human progress involves promoting human fulfilment or flourishing (including meeting agency goals), securing a just distribution, and ensuring that this is sustained over generations. Cross-country surveys of human well-being can go nowhere near to measuring this extensive array of objectives.Keywords: CapabilitiesHuman developmentWell-beingMeasurementHuman rightsInequality AcknowledgementsI am grateful for comments from participants at the annual meeting of the Human Development and Capability Association for comments, especially David Crocker; and to participants at a seminar in Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, UK.About the AuthorFrances Stewart is Emeritus Professor of Development Economics at the University of Oxford, UK.

Precursors include hedonists such as Aristippus and Epicurus.2. In 1731, Gay argued that: \"happiness, private happiness, is the proper or ultimate end of all our actions … \".3. According to Pigou: \"it is evident that any transference of income from a relatively rich man to a relatively poor man of similar temperament, since it enables more intense wants, to be satisfied at the expense of less intense wants, must increase the aggregate sum of satisfaction. The old 'law of diminishing utility' thus leads securely to the proposition: Any cause which increases the absolute share of real income in the hands of the poor, provided that it does not lead to a contraction in the size of the national dividend from any point of view, will, in general, increase economic welfare\" (Citation1932, Part 1, Chapter VIII, para. 3).4.

The US Constitution, of course, famously includes the rights to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness', but it is notable that the right is to the pursuit of happiness, not to happiness as such, and its achievement would be measured by people's freedoms rather than their levels of happiness.7. See Stewart (Citation2013), for a summary of some views on distributional justice.8. Helliwell and Wang (Citation2013) also find that income per capita and life expectancy at birth are significantly positively related to levels of happiness; they also find a positive relationship with country levels of social support, freedom to make life choices and generosity, and a negative one with perceptions of corruption with a cross-country regression of 149 countries for 2012.9. About one-half of the variation in happiness across individuals is due to genetics (Lykken and Tellegen Citation1996).10.

The World Health Organization describes mental health as “a long neglected problem” and has established an action plan for 2013-2020 (http://www.who.int/mental_health/action_plan_2013/en/). One way to combat mental illness is through bibliotherapy, which is the use of written materials including fiction, nonfiction, and poetry to support emotional and psychiatric healing.Bibliotherapy has been in existence since ancient times, but began in earnest in the United States in the 1850’s during the “Great Awakening.” At that time, mental illness began to be seen as a medical condition rather than a supernatural phenomenon. Since then, due to the changing nature of our institutions, interest in bibliotherapy waned until the 1950’s when there was a slight resurgence in its practice. However, in the last 20 years, bibliotherapy has gained a stronghold in the United Kingdom. To relieve the stress of an overcrowded mental health system, public policy in the UK has supported the use of bibliotherapy in a variety of its institutions. There are many ways to conduct bibliotherapy, but studies show that when the process is interactive, such as in a support group setting, the results are better. Also, bibliotherapy can be conducted by many sorts of professionals, including doctors, therapists, social workers, teachers, and librarians. Studies also show that when the bibliotherapists are trained in the best practices of bibliotherapy, results improve. Bibliotherapy is an effective, low-cost alternative for people in need of therapeutic assistance. The UK model should be studied and implemented in the United States and in other nations to help solve the mental health crisis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5430/irhe.v2n2p67", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2621542987", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3000215690", "title": "Defining pathological social withdrawal: proposed diagnostic criteria for hikikomori", "text": "In the late 1990s, a severe and prolonged form of social withdrawal typically observed among adolescents and youth transitioning to adulthood entered the collective national consciousness in Japan. Called \"hikikomori\" , it has shifted in recent years from being viewed as a typical Japanese problem to an issue that may have global health implications1. This shift has been driven by increasing evidence of hikikomori in epidemiologic studies, clinical case series and media reports from around the world2. As attention to hikikomori grows across cultures and countries, so does the importance of establishing a clear and consistent definition of the disorder. About a decade ago, preliminary diagnostic criteria3 and a semi-structured diagnostic interview4 were developed. Over the last decade, we and others in this emerging field of research have gained a wider breadth of experience in evaluating, treating and following up a series of individuals with hikikomori, as well as their family members, in Japan and beyond. This has led to an evolution in our biopsychosocial understanding of the disorder4, 5, and an acute awareness of the limitations of its earlier definitions. We believe it is time now to provide an updated proposal of diagnostic criteria for hikikomori, which is presented here. Hikikomori is a form of pathological social withdrawal or social isolation whose essential feature is physical isolation in one's home. The person must meet the following criteria: a) marked social isolation in one's home; b) duration of continuous social isolation of at least 6 months; c) significant functional impairment or distress associated with the social isolation. Individuals who occasionally leave their home (2-3 days/week), rarely leave their home (1 day/week or less), or rarely leave a single room may be characterized as mild, moderate or severe, respectively. Individuals who leave their home frequently (4 or more days/week), by definition, do not meet criteria for hikikomori. The estimated continuous duration of social withdrawal should be noted. Individuals with a duration of at least 3 (but not 6) months of social isolation should be classified as pre-hikikomori. The age at onset is typically during adolescence or early adulthood. However, onset after the third decade of life is not rare, and homemakers and elderly who meet the above criteria can also receive the diagnosis. Four aspects of this revised definition of hikikomori bear emphasis. First, the behavior of staying confined to home – the physical aspect of withdrawing and remaining socially isolated – remains hikikomori's central and defining feature. However, the definition adds clarification as to what frequency of going outside home still qualifies as \"marked social isolation in one's home\" . Second, the requirement for avoidance of social situations and relationships has been removed. In our interviews assessing individuals for hikikomori5, they commonly report having few meaningful social relationships and little social interaction, but deny avoiding social interaction. Many clinicians often wonder about what distinguishes hikikomori from social anxiety disorder, and this lack of avoidance is one of the primary differences. Third, distress or functional impairment should be carefully evaluated. While impairment in the individual's functioning is vital to hikikomori being a pathological condition, subjective distress may not be present. Our in-depth clinical interviews with people with hikikomori4 have revealed that many actually feel content in their social withdrawal, particularly in the earlier phase of the condition. Patients frequently describe a sense of relief at being able to escape from the painful realities of life outside the boundaries of their home. However, as the duration of social withdrawal gets longer, most people with hikikomori begin endorsing distress, such as feelings of loneliness4. Fourth, we have removed other psychiatric disorders as an exclusion criterion for hikikomori. It is clear that this disorder tends to co-occur with other conditions6, 7. In our view, the frequency of co-occurring conditions increases the importance of addressing social withdrawal as a health issue. It is possible that hikikomori (pathological social withdrawal) co-occurs with a variety of psychiatric disorders as a contributor to psychopathology, similarly to how catatonia and panic attacks are now listed as specifiers to several mental disorder diagnoses. With advances in digital and communication technologies that provide alternatives to in-person social interaction, hikikomori may become an increasingly relevant concern. We hope that these simplified diagnostic criteria may help standardize evaluation and encourage cross-cultural comparison of hikikomori.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20705", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3000215690", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed at reviewing studies exploring dysfunctional cognitive processes, and their neuroanatomical basis, in suicidal behaviour, and to develop a neurocognitive working model. Methods. A literature search was conducted. Results. Several limitations were found. The main reported neuropsychological findings are a higher attention to specific negative emotional stimuli, impaired decision-making, lower problem-solving abilities, reduced verbal fluency, and possible reduced non-specific attention and reversal learning in suicide attempters. Neuroimaging studies mainly showed the involvement of ventrolateral orbital, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala. In addition, alterations in white matter connections are suggested. Conclusions. These studies support the concept of alterations in suicidal behaviour distinct from those of comorbid disorders. We propose that a series of neurocognitive dysfunctions, some with trait-like characteristics, may facilitate the development of a suicidal crisis during stressful circumstances: (1) an altered modulation of value attribution, (2) an inadequate regulation of emotional and cognitive responses, and (3) a facilitation of acts in an emotional context. This preliminary model may represent a framework for the design of future studies on the pathophysiology, prediction and prevention of these complex human behaviours.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/15622975.2011.556200", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115054317", "source": "openalex"}

A specific related indicator is the suicide mortality rate. Globally, mental health conditions are among the leading causes of disability and death for adolescents aged 10–19 [[1]World Health OrganizationGlobal health estimates for 2019. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2020https://www.who.int/data/global-health-estimatesDate accessed: November 30, 2020Google Scholar].

Depression in adolescence.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1056-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar]; therefore, addressing mental health problems during the adolescent period can have positive lifelong impacts. Addressing adolescent mental health starts with good data on the prevalence of mental health conditions as well as risk and protective factors. These data are essential for informing the design and implementation of appropriate policies and programs and allocation of resources to support adolescents. Yet, data on adolescent mental health remain sparse, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where available data coverage represents about 2% of the adolescents living in these settings [[3]Erskine H.E. Baxter A.J. Patton G. et al.The global coverage of prevalence data for mental disorders in children and adolescents.Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci. 2017; 26: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar]. This is especially striking because nearly 90% of the world's 1.2 billion adolescents live in LMICs [[4]United Nations Population DivisionWorld population prospects [Internet].https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Interpolated/Date: 2019Google Scholar]. The challenges inherent to measuring mental health are exacerbated in LMICs, as lack of investment has led to lack of resources and standardized validated tools for measuring mental health in these settings. Understanding the global burden of adolescent mental ill health is even more pressing as the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. Massive school closures have meant the loss of social support networks and peer contacts for millions of adolescents. Lockdown measures to reduce the spread of the virus are also associated with increased risk of exposure to domestic violence and online exploitation or bullying, which can exacerbate or trigger mental health conditions [[5]Cowie H. Myers C.A. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of children and young people.Child Soc. 2021; 35: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar]. Adolescents who were already out of school before the onset of the pandemic have faced increased economic insecurity and fewer job opportunities [[6]International Labour OrganizationYouth & COVID-19: Impacts on jobs, education, rights and mental well-being.https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_753026.pdfDate: 2020Date accessed: February 10, 2021Google Scholar]. At the same time, adolescents' access to mental health services and support have been disrupted in many countries [[7]Fegert J.M. Vitiello B. Plener P.L. Clemens V.

To address the global lack of data on adolescent mental health, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in collaboration with the World Health Organization and other key institutional and academic partners, is leading the development of a suite of tools for Measurement of Mental Health Among Adolescents at the Population Level (MMAP) [[8]UNICEFMeasurement of mental health among adolescents at the population level (MMAP) 2020 [updated December 2020].https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/mental-health/mmap/Date accessed: December 1, 2020Google Scholar]. The principal goal of the MMAP is to enable monitoring of adolescent mental health conditions across countries through a rigorous approach. The MMAP validation process has encompassed assessing scales such as the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale [[9]Chorpita B.F. Yim L. Moffitt C. et al.Assessment of symptoms of DSM-IV anxiety and depression in children: A revised child anxiety and depression scale.Behav Res Ther. 2000; 38: 835-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar] and tools from the Patient Health Questionnaire set [[10]Kroenke K.

Brief item sets on functioning, suicidality, mental health care, and connectedness have been developed and tested by UNICEF based on common approaches to population-level measurement in these domains. In addition, the MMAP toolkit will include a vignette-based tool for proactive case detection of mental health symptoms called the Community Case Detection Tool that enables community gatekeepers to promote in detection and helpseeking of adolescents who may benefit from care or support [[11]Jordans M.J.

For RCADS: https://www.childfirst.ucla.edu/resources/, for PHQ: https://www.phqscreeners.com/, for CCDT https://www.warchildholland.org/intervention-ccdt/). The MMAP methodological approach to tool development involves a series of steps (Figure 1) and includes clinical validation of measures of depression, anxiety, functional limitations due to mental health problems, and suicidality. Cross-cultural applicability and adaptation to local realities, including integration of adolescents' voices and diverse experiences, have been formative in the development of the MMAP toolkit and guidelines for its use. Another key step in the MMAP process has involved engagement of country partners, such as national and regional governments, local health authorities, and academic institutions, who are key to its adoption and sustained use across settings. An initial MMAP clinical validation was concluded in Belize in 2020. Similar validation efforts are proceeding in settings in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia during 2021. The MMAP initiative will result in a set of metrics and tools that will enable the following:•Collection of comparable data on adolescent mental health through representative national surveys. These data can be used for global monitoring, prioritization of policies and programs, and allocation of resources for adolescent mental health.•Collection of equity-sensitive data that can be stratified to ensure measurement of the most vulnerable populations.•Monitoring and evaluation of adolescent mental health programs implemented at local and national levels, and among special population groups including adolescents on the move, pregnant or parenting adolescents.•Assessment of risk and protective factors for adolescents' mental health. The MMAP toolkit will also be included as a monitoring resource for the UNICEF and WHO jointly developed Helping Adolescents Thrive program for promotion of mental health and prevention of mental health conditions [[12]van den Broek Myrthe et al.Accuracy of a proactive case detection tool for internalizing and externalizing problems among children and adolescents.J Adolesc Health. 2021; (In this issue)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.03.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar].

Using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial design we assessed botulinum toxin injection to the glabellar region as an adjunctive treatment of major depression. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to a verum (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 15) or placebo (saline, n = 15) group. The primary end point was change in the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale six weeks after treatment compared to baseline. The verum and the placebo groups did not differ significantly in any of the collected baseline characteristics. Throughout the sixteen-week follow-up period there was a significant improvement in depressive symptoms in the verum group compared to the placebo group as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F(6,168) = 5.76, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.17). Six weeks after a single treatment scores of onabotulinumtoxinA recipients were reduced on average by 47.1% and by 9.2% in placebo-treated participants (F(1,28) = 12.30, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.31, d = 1.28). The effect size was even larger at the end of the study (d = 1.80). Treatment-dependent clinical improvement was also reflected in the Beck Depression Inventory, and in the Clinical Global Impressions Scale. This study shows that a single treatment of the glabellar region with botulinum toxin may shortly accomplish a strong and sustained alleviation of depression in patients, who did not improve sufficiently on previous medication.

In 2019, around 55 million people were affected by dementia, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. Dementia leads to increased costs for governments, communities, families and individuals. Dementia is overwhelming for the family and caregivers of the person with dementia, who are the cornerstone of care and support systems throughout the world. To assist countries in addressing the global burden of dementia, the World Health Organisation (WHO) developed the Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025. It proposes actions to be taken by governments, civil society, and other global and regional partners across seven action areas, one of which is dementia risk reduction. This paper is based on WHO Guidelines on risk reduction of cognitive decline and dementia and presents recommendations on evidence-based, multisectoral interventions for reducing dementia risks, considerations for their implementation and policy actions. These global evidence-informed recommendations were developed by WHO, following a rigorous guideline development methodology and involved a panel of academicians and clinicians with multidisciplinary expertise and representing geographical diversity. The recommendations are considered under three broad headings: lifestyle and behaviour interventions, interventions for physical health conditions and specific interventions. By supporting health and social care professionals, particularly by improving their capacity to provide gender and culturally appropriate interventions to the general population, the risk of developing dementia can be potentially reduced, or its progression delayed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.765584", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4205237380", "source": "openalex"}

Although completed suicide in ADHD has been assessed in a previous meta‐analysis, other domains of suicidal behaviour such as attempts and ideation have been documented only in individual studies. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the relationship between attention‐deficit and suicidality. Method: Electronic and manual literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO, using a range of search terms around suicidality, attention‐deficit and hyperactivity. Results: Twenty five papers were identified describing a relationship between ADHD and suicide. ADHD occurred more frequently in suicidal groups than controls, with most differences being statistically significant. The direction of results was consistent, with only one sample showing equivocal findings and one showing a reverse pattern. Attempts and ideation were more common in prediagnosed ADHD samples than controls. Three studies showed significant results only for men.

Mental health at the workplace has become a concern due to the costs of depression, anxiety, burnout, and even suicide, which is high among police officers. To ameliorate occupational health, it is therefore crucial to identify stress and burnout levels on a regular basis. However, the instruments frequently used to measure stress have not valorized the specificity of policing tasks. This study aims to: (i) conduct a literature review to identify questionnaires used to assess occupational stress and burnout among police officers; (ii) analyze the psychometric characteristics of a Portuguese version of Operational Police Stress Questionnaire (PSQ-Op); and, using the PSQ-Op and other questionnaires, (iii) to identify operational stress, burnout, and distress levels among Portuguese police officers. The literature review identified 108 studies which use a multiplicity of questionnaires to measure burnout or occupational stress among police officers, but few studies use specific police stress questionnaires. Sample sizes were mostly below 500 participants and studies were mainly developed in the last decade in the USA and Brazil, but also in another 24 countries, showing the extent of the interest in this topic. This study applied to 2057 police officers from the National Portuguese Police, a force policing urban centers, and used the PSQ-Op, as well the Spanish Burnout Inventory and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. The results show that the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of PSQ-Op are adequate. Factorial analysis revealed two dimensions defined as social and work issues, which were associated with measures of distress and burnout. Fit indices suggested a second-order solution called operational police stress. Overall, and considering the scale range of each questionnaire, the results showed moderate values of operational stress, distress, and burnout. However, considering their cut-off points, 85% of the sample presented high operational stress levels, 11% critical values for burnout, and 28% high distress levels, with 55% of the sample at risk of a psychological disorder. These results reinforce the need to prevent stress and to invest in police officers' occupational health.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00587", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3021438609", "source": "openalex"}

With increasing awareness of the health-economic burden of the disease (see http://www.who.int/mental_health/aboutMH.html), especially phase III drug research boomed during the last decade. But there are still many areas in basic research of this disorder which appear as a white spot. Only recently have we gained more insight into the connections between the immune system and mood disorders, and few data exist so far on the influence of a disturbed circadian rhythm. Additionally, the concept of the disease broadened and became more complex, and consequently we need new instruments for an adequate description of the course of illness. Finally, besides searching for new drug formulas, it may be wise to (re)discover established medications for this disorder. The 2nd Symposium on Bipolar Disorder of the Stanley Foundation Centers of Munich and Freiburg, which took place in Freiburg on November 17 and 18, 2000, tried to focus especially on these topics. Supported by a grant from Glaxo-Wellcome, it was possible to bring together distinguished scientists and clinicians actively involved in bipolar research. Similar to the proceedings of the 1st Symposium in Munich in 1999, outstanding presentations and case histories were chosen by the scientific committee and compiled for this supplement of Neuropsychobiology. We hope that the reader will share our enthusiasm for bipolar research and that the present supplement will be as inspiring to the readers as the symposium was for the participants.

Recent findings In Mexico and elsewhere studies have emerged on the risk of suicidal behaviour among those with substance use disorders that are not affected by treatment selection bias or by psychiatric comorbidity. In developed and developing groups of nations, alcohol use disorders were associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of ideation (range 2.0–2.5) and attempt (2.6–3.7), whereas drug use disorders were associated with increased risk of ideation (2.3–3.0) and attempt (2.0–4.0). Follow-up studies of general population samples reported an OR for drug use disorders from 1.9 to 3.7 for ideation, and an OR of 3.0 for attempt. Alcohol dependence increased suicide ideation with an OR of 1.5. Those drinking alcohol prior to the suicide attempt had ORs in the range of 6.2–9.6. This increase may have a dose–response relationship. We found no studies providing risk estimates for drug use prior to a suicide attempt. Summary Current evidence points to a causal role of alcohol and drug use disorders exerting a distal effect on suicidal behaviour. Evidence for the proximal role of alcohol and drug use, as triggers of suicidal behaviour, are still very limited in number, analytical techniques and scope of substances other than alcohol.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0b013e3283386322", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039373216", "source": "openalex"}

Those in the control group received unstructured usual care, enhanced with mhGAP-IG-based training of providers in recognition of depression and basic psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression. In both groups, similar proportions of patients showed remission of depression (defined as a score of ≤6 on the nine-item patient health questionnaire) at 12 months (425 [76%] of 562 in the intervention group vs 366 [77%] of 473 in the control group; adjusted odds ratio 1·0 [95% CI 0·70–1·40]). These findings provide further evidence that task-shifted interventions for depression delivered by lay health workers are effective, irrespective of the adopted model (manualised mhGAP-IG plus problem-solving therapy or unstructured mhGAP-IG enhanced usual care). Both models are equally pragmatic and potentially useful components of primary mental health care in resource-poor settings where lay health workers constitute a high proportion of care providers. However, Gureje and colleagues' observation that the intervention group saw less frequent prescription of antidepressants compared with the control group (13% vs 32%), despite similar outcomes,8Gureje O Oladeji BD Montgomery AA et al.Effect of a stepped-care intervention delivered by lay health workers on major depressive disorder among primary care patients in Nigeria (STEPCARE): a cluster-randomised controlled trial.Lancet Glob Health. 2019; (published online May 13. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30148-2.)Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar raises an important issue. In the intervention group, the highly structured nature of the intervention, with the incorporation of problem-solving therapy, might have reduced the propensity of providers to prescribe antidepressants. It could be inferred that, although the mhGAP-IG training emphasises the use of both psychological and pharmacological interventions, in an unstructured intervention environment, lay health workers might have relied heavily on antidepressant medications. Critics of globalised mental health service packages such as the mhGAP-IG have raised such concerns—ie, that, in highly burdened primary-care settings in LMICs, health workers might unwittingly adopt the quick-fix allure of medications over the more culturally appropriate but time-consuming psychological intervention.9Fernando S Globalization of psychiatry—a barrier to mental health development.Int Rev Psychiatry. 2014; 26: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar The training in problem-solving therapy and the manualisation of the intervention protocol might have reduced this tendency in the intervention group. Therefore, incorporation of and availability of skills in an evidence-based, culturally appropriate, and intensive psychological treatment could potentially reduce the need for and prescription of antidepressants in primary-care settings without compromising effectiveness. This will be an important consideration for Nigeria and other LMICs when scaling-up task-shifted models of care for depression among subpopulations such as adolescents and pregnant women, where antidepressant use might be unsafe. The future direction of research on intervention models for the depression treatment gap in LMICs is being shaped. Gureje and colleagues' findings must be confirmed in other countries with similar a primary-care landscape to that of Nigeria, and among special populations such as men, adolescents, and pregnant or post-partum women who are yet to be captured in previous studies. Such studies should be sufficiently powered to understand outcomes within the context of moderating and mediating factors. Furthermore, because the currently available studies are treatment-focused, there is a need to explore whether non-physician health workers in routine primary care can reliably assess and detect depression with little or no supervision by physicians. Finally, future implementation studies should assess the critical minimum qualification and cognate experience of lay health workers that yield the best outcomes in different domains. This research will provide some evidence for the standardisation of stepped-care for depression in LMICs that have wide disparities in the quality of human resources in primary-care settings. We declare no competing interests. Effect of a stepped-care intervention delivered by lay health workers on major depressive disorder among primary care patients in Nigeria (STEPCARE): a cluster-randomised controlled trialFor patients with moderate to severe depression receiving care from non-physician primary health-care workers in Nigeria, a stepped-care, problem-solving intervention combined with enhanced usual care is similarly effective to enhanced usual care alone. Enhancing usual care with mhGAP-IG might provide simple and affordable approach to scaling up depression care in sub-Saharan Africa.

The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics and capacity of mental health services for children and adolescents in 42 LAMICs. Methods: The World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS), a 155-indicator instrument developed to assess key components of mental health service systems, was used to describe mental health services in 13 low, 24 lower-middle, and 5 upper-middle-income countries. Child and adolescent service indicators used in the analysis were drawn from Domains 2 (mental health services), 4 (human resources), and 5 (links with other sectors) of the WHO-AIMS instrument. Results: The median one-year treated prevalence for children and adolescents is 159 per 100,000 population compared to a treated prevalence of 664 per 100,000 for the adult population. Children and adolescents make up 12% of the patient population in mental health outpatient facilities and less than 6% in all other types of mental health facilities. Less than 1% of beds in inpatient facilities are reserved for children and adolescents. Training provided for mental health professionals on child and adolescent mental health is minimal, with less than 1% receiving refresher training.

However, other mechanisms such as ischemia, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, neurotrophin loss, inflammation/glial activation, and vascular dysregulation are not addressed. Because stress is a key risk factor affecting these mechanisms, we evaluated whether mindfulness-based stress reduction can lower IOP and normalize typical stress biomarkers.In a prospective, randomized trial 90 POAG patients (180 eyes; age above 45 y) were assigned to a waitlist control or mindfulness meditation group which practiced daily for 21 days. We measured IOP (primary endpoint), quality of life (QOL), stress-related serum biomarkers [cortisol, β-endorphins, IL6, TNF-α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reactive oxygen species (ROS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC)], and whole genome expression.Between-group comparisons revealed significantly lowered IOP in meditators (OD: 18.8 to 12.7, OS 19.0 to 13.1 mm Hg) which correlated with significantly lowered stress-biomarker levels including cortisol (497.3 to 392.3 ng/mL), IL6 (2.8 to 1.5 ng/mL), TNF-α (57.1 to 45.4 pg/mL), ROS (1625 to 987 RLU/min/104 neutrophils), and elevated β-endorphins (38.4 to 52.7 pg/mL), BDNF (56.1 to 83.9 ng/mL), and TAC (5.9 to 9.3) (all P<0.001).

The failure of depression to be in the spotlight for successful treatment options is inherent in the complexity of the disease(s), flawed clinical diagnosis, overgeneralization of the illness, inadequate and biased clinical trial design, restrictive and biased inclusion/exclusion criteria, lack of approved/robust biomarkers, expensive imaging technology along with few advances in neurobiological hypotheses in decades. Clinical trial studies summitted to the regulatory agencies (FDA/EMA) for approval, have continually failed to show significant differences between active and placebo. For decades, we have acknowledged this failure, despite vigorous debated by all stakeholders to provide adequate answers to this escalating problem, with only a few new antidepressants approved in the last 20 years with equivocal efficacy, little improvement in side effects or onset of efficacy. It is also clear that funding and initiatives for mental illness lags far behind other life-treating diseases. Thus, it is no surprise we have not achieved much success in the last 50 years in treating depression, but we are accountable for the many failures and suboptimal treatment. This review will therefore critically address where we have failed and how future advances in medical science offers a glimmer of light for the patient and aid our future understanding of the neurobiology and pathophysiology of the disease, enabling transformative therapies for the treatment of depressive disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.472", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2943320709", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical depression is a common, under-recognized, yet treatable condition that, if comorbid with TB, is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, community TB transmission, and drug resistance. Depression may increase risk of TB reactivation, contribute to disease progression, and/or inhibit the physiological response to anti-tuberculosis treatment because of poverty, undernutrition, immunosuppression, and/or negative coping behaviors, including substance abuse. Tuberculous infection and/or disease reactivation may precipitate depression as a result of the inflammatory response and/or dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Clinical depression may also be triggered by TB-related stigma, exacerbating other underlying social vulnerabilities, and/or may be attributed to the side effects of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Depression may negatively impact health behaviors such as diet, health care seeking, medication adherence, and/or treatment completion, posing a significant challenge for global TB elimination. As several of the core symptoms of TB and depression overlap, depression often goes unrecognized in individuals with active TB, or is dismissed as a normative reaction to situational stress. We used evidence to reframe TB and depression comorbidity as the 'TB-depression syndemic', and identified critical research gaps to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The World Health Organization's Global End TB Strategy calls for integrated patient-centered care and prevention linked to social protection and innovative research.

The main target of action of OP compounds is the central and peripheral nervous system, although it has also been postulated that these compounds in both acute and chronic intoxication, disturb the redox processes and thus induce oxidative stress. The excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes damage to all vital macromolecules including lipids, proteins, and DNA. This study was aimed to investigate the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of CPF, MPT, and MLT when given singly or in combination. The DNA damage was measured by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay and expressed as DNA damage index. The results showed that both acute and chronic exposure with CPF, MPT, and MLT, caused significantly marked DNA damage in rat tissues namely, liver, brain, kidney, and spleen, when measured 24 hour posttreatment. It was also observed that MPT caused highest level of DNA damage and brain was maximally affected by these OP compounds. When these pesticides were given in mixture, the damage was not the sum of damage caused by individual pesticide, confirming that these pesticides do not potentiate the toxicity of each other. When the DNA damage was measured 48 and 72 hour posttreatment, the damage was partially repaired.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2912973075", "title": "Onchocerciasis associated epilepsy—A question of causality", "text": "Recently there have been many studies reporting the detection of a high prevalence of epilepsy in areas that are hyperendemic for onchocerciasis. In many of these studies, including the manuscript by Mukendi and colleagues in this issue of International Journal of Infectious Diseases a positive association between past or current infection with onchocerciasis has been found. However, not all studies have found such an association. An earlier meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant association (Druet-Cabanac et al., 2004Druet-Cabanac M. Boussinesq M. Dongmo L. Farnarier G. Bouteille B. Preux P.M. Review of epidemiological studies searching for a relationship between onchocerciasis and epilepsy.Neuroepidemiology. 2004; 23: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recent meta-analyses have generally affirmed the association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy (Kaiser et al., 2013Kaiser C. Pion S.D. Boussinesq M. Case-control studies on the relationship between onchocerciasis and epilepsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013; 7e2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Pion et al., 2009Pion S.D.

Meredith S.E. et al.Epilepsy in onchocerciasis endemic areas: systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2009; 3: e461Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but only after pooling data from heterogeneous studies that have used varying methodologies to diagnosis both exposure and outcome. In some cases, including this current study and one of the previously published meta-analyses (Kaiser et al., 2013Kaiser C. Pion S.D. Boussinesq M. Case-control studies on the relationship between onchocerciasis and epilepsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013; 7e2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the association weakens or disappears when controlling for potential confounders which suggests that confounders may explain part or all of the association. One recent retrospective case-control study found a dose response between a single measurement of microfilarial density in the skin and the development of epilepsy over a period of follow-up of up to 26 years (Chesnais et al., 2018Chesnais C.B. Nana-Djeunga H.C. Njamnshi A.K. Lenou-Nanga C.G. Boulle C. Bissek A.Z. et al.The temporal relationship between onchocerciasis and epilepsy: a population-based cohort study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2018; 18: 1278-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the numbers were small, no information about potential confounders was available, and there was potential for misclassification of the outcome as the diagnosis of epilepsy was not confirmed by a neurologist. Although retrospective case-control studies cannot establish causality and no pathophysiologic mechanism has been described which explains how onchocerciasis causes epilepsy, the finding of a potential dose response will keep the debate about causality alive. Why are confounders important? A confounder is a factor that is associated both with the exposure of interest and the outcome, but that has a causal relationship for the outcome (Rothman and Greenland, 1998Rothman K.J. Greenland S. Modern epidemiology.2nd ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, 1998Google Scholar). Thus if a confounder explains part or all of an association, it would be more appropriate to target the confounder alone, if there is no causal role for the exposure of interest, or both the confounder and the exposure of interest, if both play a causal role. There are many other causal factors that could be confounding the association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy which could be common in areas that are typically missed by national health programmes due to lack of funds, instability of the area due to conflict, or remoteness of the area. These known causal factors associated with symptomatic seizures include malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities, birth trauma, head trauma, parasitic infections (e.g. neurocysticercosis, cerebral malaria, and toxocariasis) and other infections (e.g. viral and bacterial meningitis and encephalitis), toxins (e.g. heavy metals and hypoglycin in akee fruit), and genetic disorders. Chief among these, and germane to the issue of epilepsy in areas that are hyperendemic for onchocerciasis, are infectious etiologies and head trauma, both very prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and major causes of symptomatic seizures (Ba-Diop et al., 2014Ba-Diop A. Marin B. Druet-Cabanac M. Ngoungou E.B. Newton C.R. Preux P.M. Epidemiology, causes, and treatment of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa.Lancet Neurol. 2014; 13: 1029-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Bruns and Hauser, 2003Bruns Jr., J.

Epidemiology and aetiology of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa.Lancet Neurol. 2005; 4: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we know little about the distribution of the factors as well. However, these are often not measured (or cannot be measured) in studies of the association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy in hyperendemic areas or assumptions about their distribution are made based on the limited data currently available. The distribution of focal exposures, such as toxins or infectious agents, really cannot be assumed to be true across large areas. The lack of an association in one site in Cameroon between a positive serological test for neurocysticercosis and epilepsy (Elliott et al., 2013Elliott I. Jerome A. Angwafor S.A. Smith M.L. Takougang I. Noh J. et al.Epilepsy and cysticercosis in Northwest Cameroon: a serological study.Seizure. 2013; 22: 283-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) cannot necessarily be extrapolated to an area in the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly when cysticercosis is a known cause of epilepsy and studies in Africa have consistently affirmed that relationship (Quet et al., 2010Quet F. Guerchet M. Pion S.D. Ngoungou E.B. Nicoletti A. Preux P.M. Meta-analysis of the association between cysticercosis and epilepsy in Africa.Epilepsia. 2010; 51: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In focal studies, like the one in this journal, a thorough exploration of confounders is needed. The authors did control for a limited number of potential risk factors for epilepsy (e.g. birth trauma) in a multivariate analysis that failed to find an association between Ov16 positivity (a marker for onchocerciasis) and epilepsy. None of the known causal factors evaluated were found to have an association either. The factors that were associated epilepsy were ivermectin use and body weight. Nonetheless, this study is important. It has identified an area where the onchocerciasis programme is failing to convince enough of the population to take ivermectin to stop the transmission of onchocerciasis. Survey determined coverage of ivermectin treatment was only 55%, which is below the minimally effective target for interruption of transmission (WHO, 2018WHO Progress report on the elimination of human onchocerciasis, 2017-2018.Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2018; 93: 633-643Google Scholar). Eight percent of children between the ages of 7 and 10 years had detectable antibodies to Ov16. This clearly demonstrates that active transmission is ongoing. This is an important observation and merits efforts to improve the situation. There are tools available that can be used to rapidly evaluate population adherence to ivermectin MDA and to search for root causes that need to be addressed. They can currently be found on the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) Support Center website (https://www.ntdsupport.org/resources/supervisors-coverage-tool and https://www.ntdsupport.org/resources/coverage-survey-builder-coverage-evaluations, accessed 16 January 2019). The study also identified a population that does not have access to the WHO-recommended package of care for epilepsy (https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/mhGAP/en/, accessed 16 January 2019). Less than 10% of people with epilepsy were taking medications to control seizures and more than 40% of people with epilepsy reported never having received such medications. A sound response to the problem with epilepsy in these underserved areas is not insurmountable. Countries have committed to strengthening their systems for epilepsy management in accordance with World Health Assembly resolution 68.20. There are low cost, efficacious treatments available for epilepsy whatever the etiology. A focused approach by ministries of health or supporting partners could help mitigate the problem of symptomatic seizures and have significant positive impact of the lives of the affected people. A better understanding of the distribution and determinants of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa might allow for more targeted prevention and treatment strategies, but developing this knowledge should not prevent scale-up of currently available treatment modalities. Neither improving treatment of onchocerciasis nor improving management of seizures requires additional studies or tools; those tools already exist.

New data, reported in The Lancet,1Matthews FE Arthur A Barnes LE et al.on behalf of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing CollaborationA two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.Lancet. 2013; (published online July 16.)http://dx.doi.org/S10140-6736(13)61570-6PubMed Google Scholar suggest that the prevalence of dementia in the UK in 2011 was significantly lower than would have been expected based on the estimated prevalence in 1991. For CFAS I, data were taken from three geographical areas—Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham—to generate an estimate of the prevalence of dementia in the UK in 1991. This was based on a randomly selected sample of 7635 people aged 65 years and older interviewed in these areas, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed for dementia. An algorithmic diagnostic approach was used so that the resulting estimate, which was standardised to the 1991 population structure, could be compared with future results. For CFAS II, investigators used an identical diagnostic method to estimate the prevalence of dementia in the UK in 2011. On the basis of the age and sex specific prevalence estimates from CFAS I, 664 000 individuals were estimated to have dementia in 1991. After applying the effects of population ageing to this estimate, the number of people with dementia was projected to be 884 000 in 2011. However, extrapolation of the results of CFAS II suggests that the number of people with dementia in 2011 was 670 000, a decrease in prevalence from 8·3% in 1991 to 6·5% in 2011 (OR for CFAS I vs CFAS II 0·7; 95% CI 0·6–0·9). Importantly, the study's greatest strengths are in its relative estimates of changes between phases rather than its absolute estimates of numbers. As with any research criteria, the diagnostic system used in this study has limitations, as acknowledged by the authors. The low response rate (56% vs 80% for the first phase) for the second phase might also be a source of error. Even with the adjustments and modelling made, it remains entirely possible that there is a substantial response bias, which might have a substantive effect on the prevalence estimates.However, these data do suggest that things that the population has done have decreased the age-specific incidence of dementia, and therefore the number of people with dementia is lower than it would have been without our making these changes. The adage asserted in England's National Dementia Strategy2Department of HealthLiving well with dementia: a national dementia strategy.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-well-with-dementia-a-national-dementia-strategyDate: 2009Google Scholar that \"what's good for your heart is good for your head\" therefore seems to be supported by the new evidence presented. It is plausible that changes in health behaviour and provision, including smoking cessation and improved management of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, have prevented or delayed the onset of dementia at a population level. The next questions must be: how much further can we go in pursuit of this preventive agenda? How many more cases can be prevented? What do we need to do to have the greatest effect? These questions need empirical investigation followed by purposeful strategy formulation and implementation.A powerful message from these data1Matthews FE Arthur A Barnes LE et al.on behalf of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing CollaborationA two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.Lancet. 2013; (published online July 16.)http://dx.doi.org/S10140-6736(13)61570-6PubMed Google Scholar is that what we as individuals and services do matters in terms of dementia. The CFAS data point to substantial added value from existing healthy lifestyle messages. They suggest that lifestyle changes—eg, in diet, exercise, and smoking—might reduce the risk of dementia and promote more general health and wellbeing. This notion should be incorporated into health promotion messaging. Inclusion of the potential benefit of dementia prevention in communications could drive greater adoption of healthy lifestyles with resulting benefits for individuals and society.This is a message of empowerment, but it comes with a warning. As with all investments, in this investment in health, positive past performance does not always predict future gains. Thus, a need exists for caution in prediction of the future numbers with dementia. If positive changes in health behaviour can decrease prevalence of dementia, then negative lifestyle choices might promote, rather than prevent, dementia. The cohorts of people who have been developing dementia in the past 30 years lived through periods of austerity during which diet was often controlled and this might have protected them in the balance of risk. This was not the case for present cohorts entering the period of risk for dementia (ie, those aged >60 years). It is plausible that the present epidemic of morbid obesity, with consequent cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and diabetes, might act to increase the proportion of people with dementia in future cohorts.What these data do not mean is that dementia should be any less of a priority. Even with the changes described by Fiona Matthews and colleagues,1Matthews FE Arthur A Barnes LE et al.on behalf of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing CollaborationA two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.Lancet. 2013; (published online July 16.)http://dx.doi.org/S10140-6736(13)61570-6PubMed Google Scholar dementia remains very common, very expensive, and profoundly negative in its effects on people with the disorder and their families.2Department of HealthLiving well with dementia: a national dementia strategy.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-well-with-dementia-a-national-dementia-strategyDate: 2009Google Scholar Even with a small decrease in incidence and prevalence, population ageing will still double the numbers with dementia worldwide in the next generation.3Alzheimer's Disease InternationalWorld Alzheimer report 2009.http://www.alz.co.uk/research/files/WorldAlzheimerReport.pdfGoogle Scholar Dementia remains one of the greatest challenges faced by health-care and social-care systems worldwide, in low-income and middle-income countries as well as in more developed economies.4World Health OrganizationAlzheimer's Disease InternationalDementia: a public health priority.http://www.who.int/mental_health/publications/dementia_report_2012/en/Date: 2012Google Scholar Dementia is one of the very few health disorders that in itself has a macroeconomic effect,5Banerjee S The macroeconomics of dementia—will the world economy get Alzheimer's disease?.Arch Med Res. 2012; 43: 705-709Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar driven by the contribution of dementia to long-term care costs, with at least three quarters of people in care homes now having dementia, as shown by the CFAS estimates,1Matthews FE Arthur A Barnes LE et al.on behalf of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing CollaborationA two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.Lancet. 2013; (published online July 16.)http://dx.doi.org/S10140-6736(13)61570-6PubMed Google Scholar and by people with dementia being over-represented in general hospital and emergency populations.

Those with dementia are generally an old and frail population with multimorbidity; data from the Scottish School of Primary Care7Barnett K Mercer S Norbury M Watt G Wyke S Guthrie B The epidemiology of multimorbidity in a large cross-sectional dataset: implications for health care, research and medical education.Lancet. 2012; 380: 37-43Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar suggest that only 17% of people with dementia have no other long-term disorder. If we can get services right for dementia, then we will be a long way towards getting them right for all individuals with complex and long-term disorders. The CFAS results suggest that prevention is possible and that we can have agency in this most complex of disorders. These findings should spur us on, to go further and faster in secondary and tertiary prevention as well as primary prevention in dementia, for the benefit of all. This study shows that we can all make a difference.I declare that I have no conflicts of interest. The findings of the Cognitive Functioning and Ageing Study (CFAS) I and II are unequivocally good news. New data, reported in The Lancet,1Matthews FE Arthur A Barnes LE et al.on behalf of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing CollaborationA two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.Lancet. 2013; (published online July 16.)http://dx.doi.org/S10140-6736(13)61570-6PubMed Google Scholar suggest that the prevalence of dementia in the UK in 2011 was significantly lower than would have been expected based on the estimated prevalence in 1991. For CFAS I, data were taken from three geographical areas—Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham—to generate an estimate of the prevalence of dementia in the UK in 1991. This was based on a randomly selected sample of 7635 people aged 65 years and older interviewed in these areas, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed for dementia. An algorithmic diagnostic approach was used so that the resulting estimate, which was standardised to the 1991 population structure, could be compared with future results. For CFAS II, investigators used an identical diagnostic method to estimate the prevalence of dementia in the UK in 2011. On the basis of the age and sex specific prevalence estimates from CFAS I, 664 000 individuals were estimated to have dementia in 1991. After applying the effects of population ageing to this estimate, the number of people with dementia was projected to be 884 000 in 2011. However, extrapolation of the results of CFAS II suggests that the number of people with dementia in 2011 was 670 000, a decrease in prevalence from 8·3% in 1991 to 6·5% in 2011 (OR for CFAS I vs CFAS II 0·7; 95% CI 0·6–0·9). Importantly, the study's greatest strengths are in its relative estimates of changes between phases rather than its absolute estimates of numbers. As with any research criteria, the diagnostic system used in this study has limitations, as acknowledged by the authors. The low response rate (56% vs 80% for the first phase) for the second phase might also be a source of error. Even with the adjustments and modelling made, it remains entirely possible that there is a substantial response bias, which might have a substantive effect on the prevalence estimates. However, these data do suggest that things that the population has done have decreased the age-specific incidence of dementia, and therefore the number of people with dementia is lower than it would have been without our making these changes. The adage asserted in England's National Dementia Strategy2Department of HealthLiving well with dementia: a national dementia strategy.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-well-with-dementia-a-national-dementia-strategyDate: 2009Google Scholar that \"what's good for your heart is good for your head\" therefore seems to be supported by the new evidence presented. It is plausible that changes in health behaviour and provision, including smoking cessation and improved management of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, have prevented or delayed the onset of dementia at a population level. The next questions must be: how much further can we go in pursuit of this preventive agenda? How many more cases can be prevented? What do we need to do to have the greatest effect? These questions need empirical investigation followed by purposeful strategy formulation and implementation. A powerful message from these data1Matthews FE Arthur A Barnes LE et al.on behalf of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing CollaborationA two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.Lancet. 2013; (published online July 16.)http://dx.doi.org/S10140-6736(13)61570-6PubMed Google Scholar is that what we as individuals and services do matters in terms of dementia. The CFAS data point to substantial added value from existing healthy lifestyle messages. They suggest that lifestyle changes—eg, in diet, exercise, and smoking—might reduce the risk of dementia and promote more general health and wellbeing. This notion should be incorporated into health promotion messaging. Inclusion of the potential benefit of dementia prevention in communications could drive greater adoption of healthy lifestyles with resulting benefits for individuals and society. This is a message of empowerment, but it comes with a warning. As with all investments, in this investment in health, positive past performance does not always predict future gains. Thus, a need exists for caution in prediction of the future numbers with dementia. If positive changes in health behaviour can decrease prevalence of dementia, then negative lifestyle choices might promote, rather than prevent, dementia. The cohorts of people who have been developing dementia in the past 30 years lived through periods of austerity during which diet was often controlled and this might have protected them in the balance of risk. This was not the case for present cohorts entering the period of risk for dementia (ie, those aged >60 years). It is plausible that the present epidemic of morbid obesity, with consequent cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and diabetes, might act to increase the proportion of people with dementia in future cohorts. What these data do not mean is that dementia should be any less of a priority.

Many public health programs, including successful ones, fail at taking into consideration the context and vulnerabilities of the target population to whom they're aiming their interventions. One clear example is how vaccines for childhood diseases have been unable to reach vulnerable children due to structural and social factors (World Health Organization, 2011World Health Organization Social determinants approaches to public health: From concept to practice.https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44492/9789241564137_eng.pdf;jsessionid=9E237B04BAA8789CC47CF4E82269086E?sequence=1Date: 2011Google Scholar). These factors are known as social determinants of health. Social determinants of health can be defined as the physical and social environments, political and economic structures, and access to health care services. When social determinant of health factors are not addressed, those populations most disadvantaged are disproportionally affected by illness and ultimately poorer health outcomes as compared to the larger population (Palmer et al., 2019Palmer R.C.

Social determinants of health: Future directions for health disparities research.American Journal of Public Health. 2019; : S70-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With the intention of reaching health equity, the World Health Organization, 2019World Health Organization Maternal mental health.https://www.who.int/mental_health/maternal-child/maternal_mental_health/en/Date: 2019Google Scholar has issued recommendations to address social determinants of health and close the equity gap. These recommendations include addressing inequitable power distribution, resources and money, quantifying and understanding the problem, assessing the impact of the interventions implemented and improving daily conditions. From a social determinants of health approach, interventions need to target the root causes that block pathways to equitable health distribution and result in health inequities, perpetuating the equity gap. As discussed in this paper, social determinants of health and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) play an important role in the health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. The WHO has dedicated taskforces to address social determinants of health globally (World Health Organization, 2019World Health Organization Maternal mental health.https://www.who.int/mental_health/maternal-child/maternal_mental_health/en/Date: 2019Google Scholar). The United States also has over time accumulated a body of evidence on health inequities within its population. Equity in care for women during pregnancy varies drastically across racial and socioeconomic status due to ongoing systemic racism and other social injustices that impact women. In the US, infant mortality disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Black populations who experience over twice the rate of non-Hispanic whites (11.4 versus 4.9 per 1000 live births) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Infant mortality.https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htmDate: 2019, March 27Google Scholar). In addition, minority women as a whole experience unacceptably poor maternal health outcomes three to four times higher than White women, including disproportionately higher rates of death related to pregnancy or childbirth (National Partnership for Women and Families, 2018National Partnership for Women and Families Black Women's maternal health: A multifaceted approach to addressing persistent and dire health disparities.http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/health/reports/black-womens-maternal-health.htmlDate: 2018 AprilGoogle Scholar). At a local level, sociodemographic characteristics including rates of poverty, lack of prenatal care, and smoking, affect maternal and birth outcomes and have been shown to be higher in certain wards within the District of Columbia (District of Columbia Department of Health, 2018District of Columbia Department of Health Perinatal health and infant mortality report.https://dchealth.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/doh/service_content/attachments/DC%20Health%20Perinatal%20Health%20%26%20Infant%20Mortality%20Report_FINAL.PDFDate: 2018Google Scholar). Additionally, women who live in poverty, are immigrants, live with extreme stress, experience conflict situations, and have low social supports are at a higher risk of experiencing perinatal depression (World Health Organization, 2019World Health Organization Maternal mental health.https://www.who.int/mental_health/maternal-child/maternal_mental_health/en/Date: 2019Google Scholar). In recent months, US news reports have chronicled facts which illustrate that minority populations and underserved communities are significantly impacted by the coronavirus, the lack of resources and economic hardships. The coronavirus pandemic has brought forth chronic systemic issues of racism that have plagued the US for generations, with an overrepresentation of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths among Black populations and minorities nationally (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority groups.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.htmlDate: 2020Google Scholar; Garcia-Navarro, 2020Garcia-Navarro L.

Infection statistics in the District of Columbia demonstrate stark differences in rates of COVID-19 infection and related deaths. Infection rates are heavily focused on communities with lower average income and higher rates of Black and Latinx populations and in parallel, death rates among Black individuals represent 75% (361 of 479 deaths) of the total deaths, while they constitute only 46% of the District population (District of Columbia, 2020District of Columbia Corona virus data.https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-dataDate: 2020 June 10Google Scholar; United States Census, 2020United States Census Quick facts District of Columbia.https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/DCDate: 2020Google Scholar). The economic downfall resulting from the pandemic and a never before seen demand to stay-at-home has unveiled higher rates of mental health concerns, life disruptions, as well as violence in the home. Not only putting lives at risk, these effects are also detrimentally affecting our society's capacity to serve as positive role models and to foster healthy environments in which to grow our children. Research links the effects of social isolation and loneliness to poor mental and physical health. Parents, and especially low-income parents, are disproportionately worried about the infection, and disproportionately likely to feel \"disrupted by the outbreak\" (Hamel et al., 2020Hamel L. Lopes L. Muñana C. Kates J. Michaud J. Brodie M.

We have also seen the increase in domestic violence cases and considerable evidence points to the fact that domestic violence and child abuse often co-occur in nearly 30% of cases, experts believe the quarantine has high probability for increasing the rates of violence children are experiencing in the home (Bosman, 2020Bosman J.

According to the most recent Public Dashboard published by Child Family Services Agency (CFSA) in the Washington DC, 36% of the number of children served by CFSA are between 0 and 5 years of age, and the two groups with the highest incident of reports are African American and Latinx families (Child and Family Services Agency, 2020Child and Family Services Agency CFSA Public Dashboard.https://cfsadashboard.dc.gov/page/demographics-children-served-their-homeDate: 2020, May 14Google Scholar). The top family issues resulting in maltreatment reports for 0- to 5 year age group include substance abuse, inadequate resources/unstable living situation, domestic violence and abandonment (Child and Family Services Agency, 2019Child and Family Services Agency FY2021 needs assessment.https://cfsadashboard.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/cfsadashboard/publication/attachments/Final_for_posting_FY21%20NA_.pdfDate: 2019, October 1Google Scholar). The body of evidence is abundantly clear that social determinants of health and exposure to chronic stress have an impact on the body and overall health. However, risk is not destiny. Research also tells us that protective factors and resiliency within individuals, families and communities, prevent and ameliorate the effects of social determinants of health. They allow us to respond to adversity in an adaptive and functional way. Promoting protective factors and fostering resiliency is an effective strategy to address health disparities (Palmer et al., 2019Palmer R.C. Ismond D. Rodriguez E.J. Kaufman J.S. Social determinants of health: Future directions for health disparities research.American Journal of Public Health. 2019; : S70-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To this end, our federally qualified health care organization used this evidence base to develop and utilize the strategy of home visiting to foster resiliency among vulnerable individuals and families. Home visiting is an essential preventative social service model that builds on the families' own strengths and supports them to navigate circumstances and stressors contributing to health inequities in underserved communities. Home visitors provide services that improve health care access and education to participants; they collaborate with families to assist in navigating health and social systems and give dedicated attention that may be more problematic to obtain in the traditional health system (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaborating with community health workers to enhance the coordination of care and advance health equity.https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dch/pdfs/dch-chw-issue-brief.pdfDate: 2014Google Scholar). Nurses and clinically trained technicians are also direct-care providers in some home visiting models, including Nurse Family Partnership, supporting individuals with health education, counseling, and medical services outside of the clinic system. While there is no nationally recognized definition for home visiting, the District of Columbia Home Visiting Council has developed a definition to better represent the services and position home visiting specific to the spectrum of social and health services in our geographic region. This definition will be published in their upcoming Annual Report with an excerpt below.Home visiting is a service delivery strategy that serves as a prevention and early intervention support for expecting parents and families of young children from before birth until entry into kindergarten. In these voluntary programs, trained home visitors and participant family members regularly meet in the home or another comfortable setting designated by the family.A key characteristic of these programs is that each implements a model for addressing specific maternal, family, and child outcomes through education, counseling, coaching, and other services. Home visitors also provide families with connections to community-based services and resources relevant to their goals.District of Columbia Home Visiting Council, 2020aDistrict of Columbia Home Visiting Council 2019 annual report of the District of Columbia Home Visiting Council.https://www.dchomevisiting.org/uploads/1/1/9/0/119003017/2019_home_visiting_council_annual_report.pdfDate: 2020, JulyGoogle Scholar Moreover, home visiting programs are designed to support families who are overburdened. Individuals and families currently managing the health and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are impacted greatly by the detriments of the health inequities that affect them. The specific tools, practices, and theories that guide home visiting programs are established to address extreme social challenges and therefore home visiting programs are well-positioned to support families in these extraordinarily difficult times. Today, home visitors are the lifelines to many families. Home visiting program models vary based on factors such as target audience, outcomes measured, duration and frequency of home visits, and evidence available on the practice. Our organization, Mary's Center, currently offers four home visiting models supporting our organization's mission which is to embrace all communities and provide high-quality healthcare, education, and social services in order to build better futures. Mary's Center Home Visiting Department's mission is to engage families through different phases of perinatal and early childhood years, involving all members of the family through programming and resources. Healthy Families America (HFA) and Parents as Teachers (PAT) are evidence-based national models (Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness, 2018Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness Healthy Families America (HFA).Publisher Name: U.S. Department of Health & Human Serviceshttps://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/effectiveness/Healthy%20Families%20America%20%28HFA%29%C2%AE/In%20BriefDate: 2018, SeptemberGoogle Scholar, Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness, 2019Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness Parents as Teachers (PAT).Publisher Name: U.S. Department of Health & Human Serviceshttps://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/effectiveness/Parents%20as%20Teachers%20%28PAT%29%C2%AE/Model%20OverviewDate: 2019 OctoberGoogle Scholar). HFA provides intensive home visitation services to overburdened families at risk for child abuse and neglect and supports them to ultimately prevent abuse and neglect (Healthy Families America (HFA), 2015Healthy Families America (HFA) http://www.healthyfamiliesamerica.org/Date: 2015Google Scholar). PAT is based on a theory that influencing parenting knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and family well-being affects the child's developmental trajectory, with an intentional focus on school readiness (Parents As Teachers, 2017Parents As Teachers http://parentsasteachers.org/Date: 2017Google Scholar). The Father Child Attachment program is specifically designed to work with fathers in order to promote positive father involvement and work towards strengthening the father-child relationship. Lastly, Healthy Start is a national initiative designed to improve maternal and infant health outcomes and reduce racial and ethnic differences in adverse perinatal outcomes and infant deaths. While eligibility criteria differ between programs, all four serve to engage families who live throughout the metropolitan Washington DC area, including Prince George's County in lower Maryland. While each program is built and implemented differently, national research on home visiting strategies show that programs are instrumental in supporting families in their ability to process and navigate social and health challenges. US Health and Human Services departments have supported the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness Programs (HomVEE) since 2009, a team conducting thorough and transparent reviews of home visiting research literature and outcomes. Positive health outcomes unveiled through HOMVEE and locally-hosted evaluations include the frequency of child visits for preventative care, improved school readiness, improved family economic self-sufficiency, and positive parental attitudes about their ability and competency as parents (District of Columbia Home Visiting Council, 2020aDistrict of Columbia Home Visiting Council 2019 annual report of the District of Columbia Home Visiting Council.https://www.dchomevisiting.org/uploads/1/1/9/0/119003017/2019_home_visiting_council_annual_report.pdfDate: 2020, JulyGoogle Scholar, District of Columbia Home Visiting Council, 2020bDistrict of Columbia Home Visiting Council About home visiting.https://www.dchomevisiting.org/about-home-visiting.htmlDate: 2020Google Scholar; Office of Planning Research and Evaluation (OPRE), 2019Office of Planning Research & Evaluation (OPRE) Home visiting evidence of effectiveness review: Executive summary.

In addition, cost savings from home visiting programs are manifested in lower rates of emergency room visits for children, reduced involvement in government systems such as Child Protective Services, as well as benefits to society encompassed in maternal and child health outcomes. Studies have found a return on investment of $1.80 to $5.70 for every dollar spent on home visiting (National Home Visiting Resource Center, 2020National Home Visiting Resource Center Home Visiting Primer.https://www.nhvrc.org/wp-content/uploads/NHVRC_Primer_FINAL.pdfDate: 2020Google Scholar; The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2014The Pew Charitable Trusts Q & A: The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2014/02/21/the-maternal-infant-and-early-childhood-home-visiting-programDate: 2014, February 21Google Scholar; Nurse Family Partnership, 2017Nurse Family Partnership Nurse-family partnership: Outcomes, costs and return on investment in the U.S..https://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Miller-State-Specific-Fact-Sheet_US_20170405.pdfDate: 2017Google Scholar; Zaveri et al., 2014Zaveri H.

Success within the parameters of home visiting has been quantified, revealing effectiveness on meeting health and social needs for families, women, and children. However, home visiting as a strategy looks differently for every family. To quantify what success looks like when each strategy is tailored to the needs of the family can miss the mark on how home visiting inevitably shows up and impacts a community as a whole. Home visiting's real success may be more difficult to measure in areas such as employment, or learning and practicing a different, less punitive strategy to parenting. Strategies applied in home visiting programs support participants and their families in developing tools and accessing resources to garner growth, confidence and self-sufficiency. Resources are not only those tangible and observable ones, such as a stress-management course for young parents or transportation to a health appointment, but also intangible, personal tools to support participants in becoming their best selves. Some of these practices and resources with impact on health equities are described below. Standardized screenings are an integral part of home visiting that facilitate the early and regular identification of risk factors negatively affecting the health and livelihood of our participants. Screenings serve to monitor health and social risk factors for all participants, invite opportunities for discussion and allow for exploration of sensitive and difficult experiences, and identify risk situations warranting referral for further follow up. While screenings are often dictated by funders, those applied in Mary's Center programs include evidence-based tools to monitor depression and perinatal mood disorders, intimate partner violence, adverse childhood experiences, substance abuse, and child development milestones. Family Goal Planning is a tool used to facilitate participant and home visitor working together to develop goals and break those goals into meaningful and manageable steps/objectives. When facing chronic social hardship, trauma, and challenge, it is difficult for one to think beyond survival, losing the ability to consider the future and possibly damaging one's feelings of self-worth and perceived or actual threats to family functioning. The process of breaking larger goals into small steps assists parents in developing problem-solving skills, increases the individual's sense of power over their situation, and supports adult brain development. The skills parents build in the process of outlining and achieving self-identified successes changes the way parents view the world, increases their self-efficacy, enhances internal motivation and builds protective factors. A strength-based approach is another practice integrated into Mary's Center home visiting programs which draws attention to a participant's strengths and abilities rather than the problems, deficits, and pathologies they may be facing (Saleebey, 2006Saleebey D. The strengths perspective in social work practice.4th ed. Pearson Education, 2006Google Scholar). In strength-based practice, the participant is supported to identify and build upon these positive traits and work towards positive change. With individuals who have been raised in communities of hardship and limited social and emotional support, this change in perspective and attention to personal strengths elicits a shift towards a more positive mind-set, optimism and confidence, ultimately contributing to healthier and more positive behaviors. Trauma-informed care is applied in home visiting to support participants in understanding the effects of trauma on their minds and bodies, as well as identify triggers, physical manifestations of stress, and methods of self-regulation and self-care. Utilizing a trauma-informed lens in home visiting allows for the creation of a safer and more trusting environment where participants can explore emotions and past experiences without judgement or expectations. Home visitors form connections, support participants in recognizing and naming emotions, help people improve their self-agency, and create consistent and clear boundaries (Gates, 2020Gates G. Trauma informed care and communication with children. Trauma Informed Care Training at Mary's Center, Washington, DC2020, AprilGoogle Scholar). Application of this approach with adults has been shown to help them to build positive attachments with children, create a safe environment and nurture relationships with their children (Cairone et al., 2017Cairone K. Rudick S. McAuley E. Home visiting issues and insights creating a trauma-informed home visiting program.Publisher Name: Health Resources and Services Administrationhttps://mchb.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/mchb/MaternalChildHealthInitiatives/HomeVisiting/Creating_a_Trauma_Informed_Home_Visiting_Program_Issue_Brief_January_2017.pdfDate: 2017, JanuaryGoogle Scholar). An essential part of home visiting is flexibility. Prior to the pandemic, staff would hold visits where families were physically located; whether it be in the home or a doctors' office waiting room. Using the Facilitating Attuned Interactions Approach, this presence is not only felt physically but also expressed emotionally (Erikson Institute, 2018Erikson Institute Facilitating attuned interactions (FAN Approach).https://education.illinoisstate.edu/csep/b3/2018_conference_materials/Plenary%20-%20MTSS%20FAN%20training%20handout.pdfDate: 2018Google Scholar). Home visitors tailor their support according to the needs of the participants and are consistently present adjusting to what may be most beneficial at the time. For example, a parent may be seeking a listening ear to express frustration with accessing health services, while a moment later, he/she may be seeking assistance in planning for her child's upcoming medical appointment. The tools and models outlined contribute to the development of trusting relationships while positively contributing to participants' sense of self and confidence. All the while, these approaches model practices that parents themselves can put in place with their children and contribute to more positive productive parent-child relationships. Home visiting programs have had to quickly adapt their interventions and models under the new remote environment in response to COVID-19. The most significant adaptation has been to transition the services in the home to tele-home visiting, in which all services were provided remotely via tele- conferencing. National models such as Parents As Teachers, Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) and Healthy Families America provided guidelines and adaptations in response to COVID-19 to continue to support local programs (National Alliance of Home Visiting Models, 2020National Alliance of Home Visiting Models Model guidance in response to COVID-19.https://cppr-institute-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/modules/resources/web/crr/resources/Alliance-Guidance.pdfDate: 2020, March 24Google Scholar). As an agency, Mary's Center quickly developed guidelines and protocols in response to the pandemic following the guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), home visiting national models, and allied professionals such as medicine and behavioral health who had research to support this service modality (Hutkins Seda, 2020Hutkins Seda C. Health centers on the frontlines: Mary's Center on virtual enabling services, internal communication, and finances during COVID-19.https://www.migrantclinician.org/blog/2020/apr/health-centers-frontlines-st.-marys-center-virtual-enabling-services-internal-communicDate: 2020, April 16Google Scholar). For example, in a systemic review of tele-behavioral health services using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), it was found that tele-behavioral health services are equal to in-person therapy and may have more long-term impact beyond the end of treatment (Dettore et al., 2015Dettore D. Pozza A. Andersson G. Efficacy of technology-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD versus control conditions, and in comparison with therapist-administered CBT: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.Cognitive Behavior Therapy. 2015; 44: 190-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Vogel et al., 2012Vogel P.A.

In addition, Mary's Center has provided tele-medicine and tele-behavioral health services for several years showing success since our use of tele-health in 2017. A Managed Care Organization partner, AmeriHealth, has publicly commented that Mary's Center's telemedicine has been \"extremely beneficial\" with performance outweighing other similar providers, and exceeding national quality assurance benchmarks for medical services such as diabetes care (Evans and Koppelman, 2018Evans E. Koppelman D. TeleMedicine: Health at home.Publisher Name: National Nurse-Led Care Consortium, Public Health Management Corporationhttps://nurseledcare.phmc.org/images/events/2018/2018-10-17_2A-Breakout-A-Nurse_Led-Programs-Brings-the-Innovation-of-Telemedicine-to-Urban-Washington-DC.pdfDate: 2018, October 17Google Scholar). It is with these successes that many protocols were easily adapted to home visiting programming. When visits became virtual, HFA released prompts to support home visitors with achieving the HFA Best Practice Standards to \"assess, address, and promote positive parent-child interaction, attachment, and bonding and the development of nurturing parent-child relationships\" (Healthy Families America, 2018Healthy Families America HFA Best Practice Standards. Prevent Child Abuse America.2018, JuneGoogle Scholar). These new guidelines allow for home visitors to either use observations through video visits, or open-ended questions to elicit parents description of their interaction with their children on phone calls (Healthy Families America, 2020Healthy Families America Guidance for Healthy Families America sites in response to COVID-19.https://www.healthyfamiliesamerica.org/hfa-response-to-covid-19/Date: 2020Google Scholar). Similarly, to adjust to tele-home visits, Parents as Teachers introduced \"Verbal Videos,\" a technique that guides parents to narrate telephone visits, which allows parents to observe their children's cues while stimulating language development. With the parent-child interaction observations or narrations, home visitors continue to follow programmatic guidelines as part of in-person visits, and address specific strengths while introducing relevant curriculum to address parents' concerns. It is in this same space where home visiting has adapted its strategy to provide the support matching participants' most immediate needs. Basic material needs including groceries, diapers and formula, safe transportation, and safe secure housing all came to the forefront as most sought-after resources during the initial months of the pandemic. Within this context, many resources and opportunities became available in the metro area, yet logistics were consistently changing, eligibility criteria was often restricted or varied, and communication about what was available was challenged by the stay-at-home order itself. While families are required to stay at home, the home visitor is a central resource providing access to important services relevant and appropriate for families. Home visitors also have already-established relationships with other community-based programs, consistently receiving up-to-date information and a direct contact to optimize family's time and chance of success. Beyond the creative contact methods and structural strategies of home visiting, home visitors recognized that simply living under COVID-19 is a new norm for participants. Mary's Center Home Visiting is aware that COVID-19 has magnified issues already present in the environment and our program makes space to intentionally incorporate self-care strategies for our participants, especially parents. An example of this is the Father-Child Attachment program that has opened forums for fathers to discuss masculinity and mental health amid the social upheaval of the pandemic and evolving awareness around police brutality. Home visitors and participants have co-created space that allows for the discussion of the emotional and mental toll these stressors present. While the most notable consequences of the pandemic have been those hindering health and access to services, there are positive effects of the paradigm shift caused by the pandemic. Access to some health services available through a tele-format has increased during the past few months. At Mary's Center we have seen an increase in number of patients seeking mental health services offered virtually. Anecdotally, reasons for this increase may be attributed to participants having more time available to attend clinical appointments remotely while increased need for these services may also be a factor. In complement to individual therapy, group care is increasing across the country; Postpartum Support International reports the number of women participating in online support groups has increased 400% from February to April 2020 (Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, 2020Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance Policy recommendations maternal mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic congressional briefing.https://www.mmhla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Policy-Recommendations.pdfDate: 2020, May 19Google Scholar). This expansion is not exclusive to mental health services and the potential of tele-health services expanding access to other areas of care is changing entire landscapes of health systems. At Mary's Center, tele-health services are already an integral component of our service delivery strategy, and are growing in areas of medical, dentistry, behavioral health, social services, and home visiting, improving access for those who previously did not attend in-person appointments. National home visiting models have made these easy, establishing guidelines for tele-visits years ago, and now expanded support and investment for their implementation is warranted within this system as well as nationally (Healthy Families America, 2020Healthy Families America Guidance for Healthy Families America sites in response to COVID-19.https://www.healthyfamiliesamerica.org/hfa-response-to-covid-19/Date: 2020Google Scholar; Nurse Family Nurse Family Partnership, 2020Nurse Family Partnership Nurse family partnership and telehealth.https://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Telehealth-Fact-Sheet_2020.pdfDate: 2020Google Scholar). Families have been negatively impacted by the pandemic yet the effect is deeper among families who are suffering from social and health inequities. The pandemic has unveiled countless examples of the wide-ranging disparities - unemployment, food scarcities, anxieties, depression, loneliness and family stressors. As these social determinants and upstream aspects of well-being and health are supported with safety net services such as home visiting, these programs need to be financed, utilized and expanded now more than ever.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.10.013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3094572258", "source": "openalex"}

There are myriad challenges and barriers ranging from testing interventions that do not target priority needs of populations or policymakers to interventions that cannot achieve adequate coverage to decrease the treatment gap in LMIC. Method We propose a ‘roadmap to impact’ process that guides planning for interventions to move from the research space to the implementation space. Results We establish four criteria and nine associated indicators that can be evaluated in low-resource settings to foster the greatest likelihood of successfully scaling mental health and psychosocial interventions. The criteria are relevance (indicators: population need, cultural and contextual fit), effectiveness (change in mental health outcome, change in hypothesised mechanism of action), quality (adherence, competence, attendance) and feasibility (coverage, cost). In the research space, relevance and effectiveness need to be established before moving into the implementation space. In the implementation space, ongoing monitoring of quality and feasibility is required to achieve and maintain a positive public health impact. Ultimately, a database or repository needs to be developed with these criteria and indicators to help researchers establish and monitor minimum benchmarks for the indicators, and for policymakers and practitioners to be able to select what interventions will be most likely to succeed in their settings.

There exists poor mental health literacy, high levels of stigma, and weak capacity at the community level to address this healthcare need. These challenges are significant barriers to accessing mental health care for Depression, soon to be the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease. We here describe an innovative approach that addresses these issues simultaneously while concurrently strengthening key mental health components in existing education and healthcare systems as applied in Malawi and replicated in Tanzania. Improving the pathway to care for young people with Depression requires: improving Mental Health Literacy (MHL) of communities, youth and teachers; enhancing case identification, and linking schools to community health clinics; improving the capacity of community healthcare providers to identify, diagnose and effectively treat Depression in youth. Funded by Grand Challenges Canada we developed and applied a program called \"An Integrated Approach to Addressing the Challenge of Depression among the youth in Malawi and Tanzania\" (IACD). This was an example of, a horizontally integrated pathway to care model designed to be applied in low-resource settings. The model is designed to: 1) improve awareness/knowledge of mental health and mental disorders (especially Depression) in communities; 2) enhance mental health literacy among youth and teachers within schools; 3) enhance capacity for teachers to identify students with possible Depression; 4) create linkages between schools and community health clinics for improved access to mental health care for youth identified with possible Depression; 5) enhance the capacity of community-based healthcare providers to identify, diagnose and effectively treat youth with Depression. Using interactive, youth-informed weekly radio programs, mental health curriculum training for teachers and peer educators in secondary schools, and a clinical competency training program for community-based health workers, the innovation created a \"hub-and-spoke\" model for improving mental health care for young people. Positive results obtained in Malawi and replicated in Tanzania suggest that this approach may provide an effective and potentially sustainable framework for enhancing youth mental health care, thus providing a policy ready framework that can be considered for application in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00542", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2961268268", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2439917869", "title": "A Review and Critique of Mental Health Policy Development", "text": "IntroductionThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mental health as 'a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community'. WHO is appealing to countries to increase their support for mental health services. The appeal, which was published in The Lancet (1), see also http://www.who.int/mental_health/en/), is part of a series of six reviews on global mental health. Policy statements made by various governments post WHO's appeal may resonate the core element of the appeal and place a higher emphasis on mental health. For example, in the UK, the government recently launched its mental health care policy entitled 'no health without mental health' (2). While, in New Zealand, the Commission for Mental Health tendered a literature review (3) and the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand based their strategy vision for 2009-15 entirely on the premise that 'flourishing' people do better in life (4). However, such documents commonly tend to present a simplistic but deterministic view of cause and effect. For example, a statement may declare that increasing access to mental health services will lead to a higher service uptake and therefore will improve outcomes for a particular mental health issue. In this context, 'access' is multi-dimensional and can be related to physical and geographical factors (e.g. transport), and the appropriateness of services being offered. Thus, the terminology and the language of the strategy documents may imply an elective approach to policy development, where, supporting information is sought subsequent to the policy implementation (5).One of the main issues in the context of evidence-based decision making is the role of information. What constitutes evidence? Who decides which information can be classed as evidence and which to ignore? Can the public's overall wellbeing be clinically contextualised and determined? In this paper, I argue that 'evidence' and 'knowledge' should be critically assessed, and policy formation needs to be informed by a broader range of evidence rather than selectively. Therefore, a fresh approach to policy development is well overdue.BackgroundMental health problems are prevalent in the general population with 20% of New Zealanders experiencing a mental disorder at any one time (6). This figure is much higher for specific populations such as youth, Maori and Pacific Peoples. According to WHO (7), prevalence is increasing, and by 2020, depression will be the most common long term disability worldwide.Mental health issues are poorly understood, and as many as 60% of people experiencing a mental health issue do not have their problems recognized: as many as 80% of people with alcohol issues remain untreated (6). Suicide rates in New Zealand are unacceptably high when compared with other OECD countries.Furthermore, 36% of people presenting to GP (General Practitioner) surgeries in New Zealand meet the criteria for mental disorder at the time of consultation (8). Many mental health problems can be treated effectively within primary care, however, there are a number of barriers to accessing primary care which need to be addressed. They include, but are not limited to, cost to the service user, stigma, lack of understanding about mental health issues from both community and clinicians, lack of culturally appropriate models of care and lack of time within a fee for service model (9).In some health care systems, primary care is the gateway to secondary and clinical care services. The Evaluation of Primary Mental Health Initiatives (10) suggests evidence that funding primary mental health initiatives produces significant improvement in health outcomes for people experiencing mild to moderate mental health issues. However, primary care clinicians still require both the opportunity to upskill around the management of mental health issues and need more support from specialist mental health clinicians. …", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2439917869", "source": "openalex"}

The Summit proposed a model that encompassed seven focal areas: post-diagnostic counseling; psychological and medical surveillance; periodic reviews and adjustments to the dementia care plan; early identification of behaviour and psychological symptoms; reviews of care practices and supports for advanced dementia and end of life; supports to carers/ support staff; and evaluation of quality of life. It also explored current practices in providing PDS in intellectual disability services.Results: The Summit concluded that although there is limited research evidence for pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for people with intellectual disability and dementia, viable resources and guidelines describe practical approaches drawn from clinical practice. Post diagnostic support is essential, and the model components in place for the general population, and proposed here for use within the intellectual disability field, need to be individualized and adapted to the person's needs as dementia progresses.Conclusions: Recommendations for future research include examining the prevalence and nature of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) in adults with an intellectual disability who develop dementia, the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological interventions, the interaction between pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and the utility of different models of support.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2017.1373065", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2750838224", "source": "openalex"}

Aims To identify the challenges, opportunities and strategies for more equitable and sustainable mental health financing in six sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries, namely Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. Method In the context of a mental health systems research project (Emerald), a multi-methods approach was implemented consisting of three steps: a quantitative and narrative assessment of each country's disease burden profile, health system and macro-fiscal situation; in-depth interviews with expert stakeholders; and a policy analysis of sustainable financing options. Results Key challenges identified for sustainable mental health financing include the low level of funding accorded to mental health services, widespread inequalities in access and poverty, although opportunities exist in the form of new political interest in mental health and ongoing reforms to national insurance schemes. Inclusion of mental health within planned or nascent national health insurance schemes was identified as a key strategy for moving towards more equitable and sustainable mental health financing in all six countries.

Aims To examine three theoretically informed mediators of the Thinking Healthy Programme Peer-delivered (THPP), an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for perinatal depression, on symptom severity in two parallel, randomised controlled trials in Goa, India and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Method Participants included pregnant women aged ≥18 years with moderate to severe depression, as defined by a Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score ≥10, and were randomised to either THPP or enhanced usual care. We examine whether three prespecified variables (patient activation, social support and mother–child attachment) at 3 months post-childbirth mediated the effects of THPP interventions of perinatal depressive symptom severity (PHQ-9) at the primary end-point of 6 months post-childbirth. We first examined individual mediation within each trial ( n = 280 in India and n = 570 in Pakistan), followed by a pooled analysis across both trials ( N = 850). Results In both site-specific and pooled analyses, patient activation and support at 3 months independently mediated the intervention effects on depressive symptom severity at 6 months, accounting for 23.6 and 18.2% of the total effect of THPP, respectively. The intervention had no effect on mother–child attachment scores, thus there was no evidence that this factor mediated the intervention effect.

The short variation (S allele) produces less transcriptional efficiency of serotonin, which can partly account for psychiatric disorders. Despite strong biological plausibility, the relationship between 5-HTTLPR and the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) is unclear. To elucidate the relationship, we applied meta-analysis techniques to molecular studies of 5-HTTLPR and MDD. Methods A total of 22 articles were identified from MEDLINE through March 2008, using the search keywords ‘depression,’ ‘5-HTTLPR’, and ‘polymorphism.’ The authors assessed the evidence of genotypic association using STATA Version 8.2. Results Summary frequencies of the S allele of 5-HTTLPR among Caucasians and Asians based on the random effects model were 42.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 40.5–43.6] and 76.8% (95% CI = 73.9–79.7), respectively. The distribution of the S allele was significantly different between Asians and Caucasians (P<0.001). The SS genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of MDD among Caucasian populations (odds ratio = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.15–1.72), although there was no significant association among Asians. Conclusion Although the summary risk for developing MDD in individuals with the ‘at-risk’ SS genotype of 5-HTTLPR may be small, MDD is such a common disease that even a small increase in risk translates to a large number of excess MDD cases in the population. Thus, 5-HTT may be a candidate MDD susceptibility gene.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ypg.0b013e328335112b", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2053898109", "source": "openalex"}

Adherence was defined as medication possession ratio of 0.8 or more, and persistence was defined as the duration of therapy without exceeding a 30-day gap. Logistic regression and negative binominal regression were conducted. Overall, 55.8% of patients were adherent and the average duration of duloxetine therapy was 118.4 days within 6 months after initiation.

But experimental evidence remains sparse and no concise information on the neurophysiological bases exists, although cognitive decline represents a major impediment to healthy aging. A challenge in the field of aging is developing training regimens that stimulate neuroplasticity and delay or reverse symptoms of cognitive and cerebral decline. To be successful, these regimens should be easily integrated in daily life and intrinsically motivating. This study combines for the first-time protocolled music practice in elderly with cutting-edge neuroimaging and behavioral approaches, comparing two types of musical education.We conduct a two-site Hannover-Geneva randomized intervention study in altogether 155 retired healthy elderly (64-78) years, (63 in Geneva, 92 in Hannover), offering either piano instruction (experimental group) or musical listening awareness (control group). Over 12 months all participants receive weekly training for 1 hour, and exercise at home for ~ 30 min daily. Both groups study different music styles. Participants are tested at 4 time points (0, 6, and 12 months & post-training (18 months)) on cognitive and perceptual-motor aptitudes as well as via wide-ranging functional and structural neuroimaging and blood sampling.We aim to demonstrate positive transfer effects for faculties traditionally described to decline with age, particularly in the piano group: executive functions, working memory, processing speed, abstract thinking and fine motor skills. Benefits in both groups may show for verbal memory, hearing in noise and subjective well-being. In association with these behavioral benefits we anticipate functional and structural brain plasticity in temporal (medial and lateral), prefrontal and parietal areas and the basal ganglia.

Adequate recognition of depression is the critical step in the path to effective care, particularly in low income countries. As part of the Programme for Improving Mental healthcare (PRIME), a project supporting the implementation of integrated mental healthcare in primary care, we evaluated the level of recognition of depression by clinicians working in primary care in rural Ethiopia prior to in service training. We hypothesised that the detection rate of depression will be under 10% and that detection would be affected by gender, education and severity of depression. Cross-sectional survey in eight health centres serving a population of over 160,000 people. A validated version of the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) was administered as an indicator of probable depression. In addition, primary care clinicians completed a clinician encounter form. Participants were consecutive primary care attendees aged 18 years and above. A total of 1014 participants were assessed. Primary care clinicians diagnosed 13 attendees (1.3%) with depression. The PHQ9 prevalence of depression at a cut-off score of ten was 11.5% (n = 117), of whom 5% (n = 6/117) had received a diagnosis of depression by primary care clinicians. Attendees with higher PHQ scores and suicidality were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis of depression by clinicians. Women (n = 9/13) and participants with higher educational attainment were more likely to be diagnosed with depression, albeit non-significantly. All cases diagnosed with depression by the clinicians had presented with psychological symptoms. Although not based on a gold standard diagnosis, over 98% of cases with PHQ-9 depression were undetected. Failure of recognition of depression may pose a serious threat to the scale up of mental healthcare in low income countries. Addressing this threat should be an urgent priority, and requires a better understanding of the nature of depression and its presentation in rural low-income primary care settings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-017-0628-y", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2605468937", "source": "openalex"}

The World Health Organization (WHO)’s Mental Health Atlas series has established itself as the single most comprehensive and most widely used source of information on the global mental health situation. The data derived from the latest Mental Health Atlas survey carried out in 2014 describes the availability and delivery of mental health services in the WHO's Member States, focussing on differences by country's income level. Methods. The data contained in this paper are mainly derived from questions relating to mental health service availability and uptake, as well as on financial and human resources for mental health. Results are presented as median values and analysed by World Bank income group. Interquartile ranges are also provided as measures of statistical dispersion. Results. In total, 171 out of WHO's 194 Member States were able to at least partially complete the Atlas questionnaire. The results highlight a wide gap between high and low-medium income countries in a number of areas: for example, high-income countries have 20 times more beds in community-based inpatient units and 30 times more admissions; the rate of patients cared by outpatient facilities is 40 times higher; and there are 66 times more community outpatient contacts and 15 times more mental health staff at outpatient level. Overall resources for mental health are not distributed efficiently: globally about 60% of financial resources and over two-thirds of all available mental health staff are concentrated in mental hospitals, which serve only a small proportion of patients. Results indicate that outpatient care is the only effective means of increasing the coverage for mental disorders and is expanding, but it is strongly influenced by country income level. Two elements of the network of mental health facilities are particularly scarce in low- and middle-income countries: day treatment facilities and community residential facilities. Conclusions. The WHO Mental Health Atlas 2014 survey provides basic mental health information at the level of WHO's Member States, concerning mental health resources and activities. Atlas promotes the use of information, usually underestimated not only in low- and middle-income countries but also in high-income countries. Information is needed not only for monitoring the scaling up of the mental health system at country level, but also for improving transparency and accountability for users, families and the public.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s2045796017000075", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2596249796", "source": "openalex"}

The delivery of effective psychological treatments for perinatal depression through existing health systems is a challenge due to a lack of human resources. This paper reports on a trial protocol that aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Thinking Healthy Programme delivered by peers (Thinking Healthy Programme Peer-delivered; THPP), for women with moderate to severe perinatal depression in rural and urban settings in Pakistan and India.THPP is evaluated with two randomised controlled trials: a cluster trial in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and an individually randomised trial in Goa, India. Trial participants are pregnant women who are registered with the lady health workers in the study area in Pakistan and pregnant women attending outpatient antenatal clinics in India. They will be screened using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression symptoms and will be eligible if their PHQ-9 is equal to or greater than 10 (PHQ-9 ≥ 10). The sample size will be 560 and 280 women in Pakistan and India, respectively. Women in the intervention arm (THPP) will be offered ten individual and four group sessions (Pakistan) or 6-14 individual sessions (India) delivered by a peer (defined as a mother from the same community who is trained and supervised in delivering the intervention). Women in the control arm (enhanced usual care) will receive health care as usual, enhanced by providing the gynaecologist or primary-health facilities with adapted WHO mhGAP guidelines for depression treatment, and providing the woman with her diagnosis and information on how to seek help for herself. The primary outcomes are remission and severity of depression symptoms at the 6-month postnatal follow-up. Secondary outcomes include remission and severity of depression symptoms at the 3-month postnatal follow-up, functional disability, perceived social support, breastfeeding rates, infant height and weight, and costs of health care at the 3- and 6-month postnatal follow-ups. The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat.The trials have the potential to strengthen the evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an evidence-based psychological treatment recommended by the World Health Organisation and delivered by peers for perinatal depression. The trials have the unique opportunity to overcome the shortage of human resources in global mental health and may advance our understanding about the use of peers who work in partnership with the existing health systems in low-resource settings.Pakistan Trial: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02111915 (9 April 2014) India Trial: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02104232 (1 April 2014).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-1063-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2176196946", "source": "openalex"}

We introduce a new method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic Modeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each. We first identify a set of vectors (\"discourse atoms\") that provide a sparse representation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words; one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2108801119", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220807609", "source": "openalex"}

The effort is admirable, but unfortunately their results show that improved household pesticide storage did not reduce the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning. In the study, households in 90 rural villages in North Central Province, Sri Lanka, that had farmed or had used or stored pesticides in the preceding agricultural season were randomly assigned to receive a lockable storage container, or no intervention, amounting to 27 091 households (114 168 individuals) in the intervention group and 26 291 households (109 693 individuals) in the control group. In individuals aged 14 years or older, 611 cases of pesticide self-poisoning had occurred by 3 years in the intervention group compared with 641 cases in the control group. The primary outcome, incidence of pesticide self-poisoning, did not differ between groups (293·3 per 100 000 person-years of follow-up in the intervention group vs 318·0 per 100 000 in the control group; p=0·33). The investigators found no evidence of switching from pesticide self-poisoning to other forms of self-harm, with no significant difference in the number of fatal (82 in the intervention group vs 67 in the control group) or non-fatal (1135 vs 1153) self-harm events involving all methods. Discouraging though these findings may seem, they are valuable in providing insights into the understanding of the complexities of any suicide prevention effort.2Hawton K van Heeringen K Suicide.Lancet. 2009; 373: 1372-1381Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 3Yip PSF Caine E Yousuf S Chang SS Wu KCC Chen YY Means restriction for suicide prevention.Lancet. 2012; 379: 2393-2399Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar Suicide is not a disease reflecting well defined pathological mechanisms, and the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is usually the outcome of complex interactions of socioenvironmental, behavioural, and psychiatric factors.4Mann JJ Apter A Bertolote J et al.Suicide prevention strategies: a systematic review.JAMA. 2005; 294: 2064-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar Restricting access to lethal means of suicide has received much empirical support, this method being most effective among sudden, unplanned suicides, because those victims tend to use the method most readily accessible to them.5Yip PSF Lee DTS Charcoal-burning suicides and strategies for prevention.Crisis. 2007; 28: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Knox KL Conwell Y Caine ED If suicide is a public health problem, what are we doing to prevent it?.Am J Public Health. 2004; 94: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar If a lethal method is not available at the moment of the potential deadly action, it might be possible to buy time so that (in some cases at least) suicidal impulses will fade without fatal consequences. Even when suicides are planned, difficulty in gaining access to the most lethal means of suicide can serve as a substantial impediment. Nonetheless, this proposed method per se seems not sufficient enough to lower pesticide poisoning, suicide, or self-harm rates at the community level. Since highly lethal pesticides and the keys to their storage are still within reach in the household, no other less lethal method is a better substitute for pesticide suicides in such cases. Because the causes of suicides are multifactorial, restriction of means needs to be incorporated into a holistic and integrated suicide prevention programme rather than as a stand-alone measure. Suicide is still a rare event. Despite the fairly large number of households involved in the study it was still not large enough to detect differences, especially because non-compliance in the intervention group was not small: about 30% in the first year and 50% in the third, and some lockable pesticide storage was used in the control region. Furthermore, because of the close proximity of the intervention and the control sites, a contamination effect might have occurred. Hence, we cannot infer from this specific intervention (household lockable pesticide storage) that restriction of means is not useful in preventing suicides, because many studies have demonstrated its effectiveness.7WHOWorld suicide report. World Health Organization, Geneva2014http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/Google Scholar The more important and relevant question is why does this specific intervention not produce a desirable result in the setting of Sri Lanka? Is it that the proposed restriction method is not secure enough to achieve the target of deterrence and buying time for any intervention to take place? Undoubtedly, lockable storage might help to reduce the risk of self-harm or suicide in some impulsive individuals. The deterrent effect seems to be greatly compromised compared with the removal of highly hazardous pesticides in the agricultural environment, as suggested by the investigators.1Pearson M Metcalfe C Jayamanne S et al.Effectiveness of household lockable pesticide storage to reduce pesticide self-poisoning in rural Asia: a community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial.Lancet. 2017; (published online Aug 11.)http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31961-XSummary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar In Hong Kong and Taiwan, however, my experience with colleagues in restricting the availability of charcoal in reducing charcoal-burning suicides, was more encouraging.8Yip PSF Law CK Fu KW Law YW Wong PW Xu Y Restricting the means of suicide by charcoal burning.Br J Psychiatry. 2010; 196: 241-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Chen YY Chen F Chang SS Wong J Yip PSF Assessing the efficacy of restricting access to barbecue charcoal for suicide prevention in Taiwan: a community-based intervention trial.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0133809Google Scholar Barbecue charcoal was removed from open shelves and put in locked storage where the customers had to ask a shop assistant before they could obtain it.

Due to the enormous size of the dataset, we are able to perform a large-scale study of online tracking, on three levels: (1) On a global level, we give a precise figure for the extent of tracking, give insights into the structural properties of the `online tracking sphere' and analyse which trackers (and subsequently, which companies) are used by how many websites. (2) On a country-specific level, we analyse which trackers are used by websites in different countries, and identify the countries in which websites choose significantly different trackers than in the rest of the world.

In particular, the three tracking domains with the highest PageRank are all owned by Google. The only exception to this pattern are a few countries such as China and Russia. Our results suggest that this dominance is strongly associated with country-specific political factors such as freedom of the press.

Despite a perception among health workers that there was little popular awareness of biomedical treatment for mental disorders, psychiatric services had been used by almost all informants. However, in many cases antipsychotic treatment had been discontinued, even where it had been recognised to have beneficial effects such as controlling aggression or inducing sleep. Unpleasant side effects such as feelings of weakness and prolonged drowsiness conflicted with notions of health as strength and were seen to reduce the ability to work. The reduction of perceptual experiences such as visions was less valued than a return to social functioning. The failure of antipsychotics to achieve a permanent cure also cast doubt on their efficacy and strengthened suspicions of a spiritual illness which would resist medical treatment.

The existing literature on interventions that offer support, advice and/or treatment to sick doctors has not yet been synthesised in a way that considers the complexity and heterogeneity of the interventions, and the many dimensions of the problem. We (1) reviewed interventions to tackle doctors’ and medical students’ mental ill-health and its impacts on the clinical workforce and patient care—drawing on diverse literature sources and engaging iteratively with diverse stakeholder perspectives—and (2) produced recommendations that support the tailoring, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of contextually sensitive strategies to tackle mental ill-health and its impacts. Methods Realist literature review consistent with the RAMESES quality and reporting standards. Sources for inclusion were identified through bibliographic database searches supplemented by purposive searches—resulting also from engagement with stakeholders. Data were extracted from included articles and subjected to realist analysis to identify (i) mechanisms causing mental ill-health in doctors and medical students and relevant contexts or circumstances when these mechanisms were likely to be ‘triggered’ and (ii) ‘guiding principles’ and features underpinning the interventions and recommendations discussed mostly in policy document, reviews and commentaries. Results One hundred seventy-nine records were included. Most were from the USA (45%) and were published since 2009 (74%). The analysis showed that doctors were more likely to experience mental ill-health when they felt isolated or unable to do their job and when they feared repercussions of help-seeking. Healthy staff were necessary for excellent patient care. Interventions emphasising relationships and belonging were more likely to promote wellbeing. Interventions creating a people-focussed working culture, balancing positive/negative performance and acknowledging positive/negative aspects of a medical career helped doctors to thrive. The way that interventions were implemented seemed critically important. Doctors and medical students needed to have confidence in an intervention for the intervention to be effective. Conclusions Successful interventions to tackle doctors’ and students’ mental ill-health are likely to be multidimensional and multilevel and involve multiple stakeholders. Evaluating and improving existing interventions is likely to be more effective than developing new ones. Our evidence synthesis provides a basis on which to do this.

Method: An instrument that assessed biopsychosociospiritual symptoms and function and health outcomes was administered to 289 patients attending two primary care clinics. Responses were analyzed using principal component factor analysis with Equimax rotation. This led to the development of five Biopsychosociospiritual Inventory scales (impaired functional status, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, social symptoms, and spiritual symptoms). Demographic differences in mean scale scores were sought. In addition to internal consistency, construct validity was assessed based upon dimension-specific health care utilization, life satisfaction, and perceived health status. Results: All five scales had excellent internal consistency (alpha &gt; 0.8) and construct validity. Differences were strongly related to income, marital status, and employment in a manner consistent with previous research. Conclusions: This study developed and validated the Biopsychosociospiritual Inventory which could potentially provide a holistic estimate of the impact of disease and its treatment, support research in this area, and lead to the expansion of classification systems that include spirituality. Further validation of this instrument in other primary care sites using diverse patient populations as well as its function over time is needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2190/pm.37.4.d", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156842925", "source": "openalex"}

Over the past decade, successful HIV/AIDS care and treatment programmes have been instituted in over a dozen hardest-hit sub-Saharan African countries, largely through bilateral and multilateral programmes like the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.2 HIV-infected women are at heightened risk for pre-invasive and invasive neoplasia of the cervix.3,4 HIV/AIDS care and treatment programmes thus provide an ideal platform to integrate cervical cancer prevention activities in countries which face a dual burden of both AIDS and cervical cancer, an AIDS-defining disease. With steady donor support over the past 5 years, these programmes are slowly but steadily contributing to the development of health-care service delivery capacity in emerging nations by establishing infrastructures, training the health-care work force, and tackling complex and challenging problems in implementation and scale-up.5 Limited access to cervical cancer prevention services, the usual circumstance for women in low-resource environments, serves as a counterforce to the life-prolonging potential of increased access to affordable antiretroviral therapy. Cervical cancer prevention strategies that use visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and same-visit cryotherapy (“see-and-treat”) are cost-effective alternatives to cytology-based screening programmes. These procedures can be performed by nurses and other non-physician health-care workers and allow screening and treatment to be linked to the same clinic visit. Our experience in Zambia has shown that VIA-based prevention services that are nested within the context of antiretroviral therapy programmes allow early detection of cervical cancer in high-risk HIV-infected women in a cost-effective way.6,7 It also allows opportunities for the provision of broader gynaecologic and other health care for women. Eventual integration of low-cost, rapid screening tests for detecting human papillomavirus within VIA-based screening services will additionally increase programmatic efficiency. When cervical cancer prevention services are offered to HIV-infected women in a venue attended by non-HIV-infected women, a scalable intervention is established that can reach out to all women regardless of HIV status. Horizontal and diagonal collaborations between agencies and individuals focusing on HIV/AIDS care and cancer prevention could open new vistas for expanding availability of care for women at risk of one or both of these conditions, thereby ensuring wider programme impact. The conjoint contributions of such collaborations may be larger than the sum of their parts. ■", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.08.056275", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1923889212", "source": "openalex"}

Design/methodology/approach – The paper opted for an exploratory study using the open-ended approach of grounded theory, including 21 depth interviews with patients, staff members and patients’ relatives, documentation review and observation by an independent assessment team consisting of the author, a sociologist with mental disabilities, and a psychologist using the World Health Organization QualityRights tool kit which uses the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as its frame. The data complemented by a group discussion with employees in another Clinic of the same hospital. Findings – The paper provides empirical insights about how the steps taken by the Psychiatric Clinic to address several of the themes drawn from the CRPD require either improvement or initiation to comply fully with the convention's themes, and how this compares unfavorably with the Urology Clinic. Research limitations/implications – Sample size and restriction of the data to only one mental health facility limit the generalizibility of the results. Staff who reported professional burnout and cuts in wages may have been be susceptible to recall bias due to current negative mood. Respondent patients may also have failed to disclose their true experiences due to fear of punishment.

As science classrooms transition from traditional lecture to active learning, researchers have sought to understand how active learning affects undergraduate anxiety. However, although community colleges educate nearly half of all undergraduates, no studies have explored the relationship between anxiety and active learning in the context of community college science courses. In this study, we interviewed 29 students enrolled across nine community colleges in the southwestern United States to probe factors that increase and decrease their anxiety in active-learning science courses. Using inductive coding, we identified a set of common factors that affect community college student anxiety in active learning. We found that community college student anxiety decreased when students perceived that active-learning activities enhanced their learning by providing them with multiple ways of learning or the opportunity to learn from others. We also identified fear of negative evaluation as the primary construct underlying student anxiety in active learning and described factors that mediated students' fear of negative evaluation in the community college science classroom.

They reported statistical evidence for lower suicide incidence in municipalities with large or moderate proportions of green space compared with those with less green space. By contrast, no evidence was found for an association of suicide with blue spaces or living near the coast. The study is original in its systematic investigation of three types of natural environments in relation to suicide mortality and its use of advanced spatial analysis methodology. Although the findings resonate with contemporary concerns about the destruction of the natural environment, they need to be interpreted in the context of several caveats. First, this is an ecological, cross-sectional study and the possibility of confounding is substantial. Past research into geographical variations in suicide rates has shown strong associations with area socioeconomic characteristics,8Rehkopf DH Buka SL The association between suicide and the socio-economic characteristics of geographical areas: a systematic review.Psychol Med. 2006; 36: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar which in turn are likely to be related to an area's natural environments (eg, poorer areas might be more densely built with fewer green spaces). Helbich and colleagues' findings were notably weakened in the model controlling for potential confounding factors such as unemployment. For example, the unadjusted model showed a 24% reduction in suicide incidence in municipalities with a high level of green space (rate ratio [RR] 0·760, 95% credibility interval 0·681–0·849) whereas the risk reduction halved (12%; 0·879, 0·779–0·991) after adjusting for confounders. Residual confounding (ie, confounding that remains uncontrolled for) is likely because the unemployment variable was based on a one-off measure using data for 2005 whereas the suicide data spanned over the period 2005–14, a time when unemployment rates fluctuated considerably. Furthermore, the study used house prices as an indicator of local economic circumstances, but prices can be affected by the local housing market and the type of housing available, which might vary considerably across areas—eg, between urban and rural areas—and thus might not reflect local economic circumstances as well as other indicators. Other spatial analyses of suicide have used income or deprivation indices, which might better capture socioeconomic deprivation than do house prices, and have generally found strong associations of these deprivation indicators with local suicide incidence.9Hsu CY Chang SS Lee ES Yip PS Geography of suicide in Hong Kong: Spatial patterning, and socioeconomic correlates and inequalities.Soc Sci Med. 2015; 130: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar Second, the measures of local levels of green and blue space were based on the amount of land in certain land-use categories (eg, agricultural and natural areas and man-made greenery such as parks for green spaces) in each municipality. Measures based on other indicators such as travelling distance to the exposures of interest might yield different findings,10Guo Y Chang S-S Chen M Yip PSF Do poorer areas have poorer access to services in Hong Kong? A small-area analysis based on multiple spatial accessibility indicators.Soc Ind Res. 2018; (in press).Google Scholar and sensitivity analyses using different availability and accessibility measures of natural environments would aid examination of the robustness of findings. Furthermore, the median municipality population was approximately 25 000, and within area units this populous, there is likely to be very mixed accessibility and proximity to green space. Third, previous studies have indicated access to suicide methods as an important factor contributing to the spatial patterning of suicide.11Chang SS Sterne JA Wheeler BW Lu TH Lin JJ Gunnell D Geography of suicide in Taiwan: spatial patterning and socioeconomic correlates.Health Place. 2011; 17: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar For example, suicide by drowning would be more common in coastal areas or regions with major harbours or lakes, which might complicate the association of blue spaces with suicide. In fact, a study12Middleton N Sterne JA Gunnell DJ An atlas of suicide mortality: England and Wales, 1988–1994.Health Place. 2008; 14: 492-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar from England and Wales has shown increased suicide incidence in coastal areas. Agricultural areas, where the percentage of farmers and hunters is higher, could see more suicides by firearms.13Skegg K Firth H Gray A Cox B Suicide by occupation: does access to means increase the risk?.Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2010; 44: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar Sensitivity analyses based on suicide by methods whose accessibility does not vary geographically (eg, hanging) could be considered to test the robustness of the suicide–nature association. The authors rightly point out the need for future research to verify the association they found. Useful approaches might include natural experiments (eg, after park construction or loss of green space) or investigations of people who move from one area to another14Wood L Hooper P Foster S Bull F Public green spaces and positive mental health - investigating the relationship between access, quantity and types of parks and mental wellbeing.Health Place. 2017; 48: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar to study the effect of natural environments on factors underlying suicide risk such as depression.

Given comments on posts from users expressing suicidal thoughts can be written from any part of the world at any time, moderating in a timely manner can be tedious. Furthermore, Reddit's default comment ranking does not involve aspects that relate to the \"helpfulness\" of a comment from a suicide prevention (SP) perspective. Being able to automatically identify and score helpful comments from such a perspective can assist moderators, help SW posters to have immediate feedback on the SP relevance of a comment, and also provide insights to SP researchers for dealing with online aspects of SP. In this paper, we report what we believe is the first effort in automatic identification of helpful comments on online posts in SW forums with the SW subreddit as the use-case. We use a dataset of 3000 real SW comments and obtain SP researcher judgments regarding their helpfulness in the contexts of the corresponding original posts. We conduct supervised learning experiments with content based features including n-grams, word psychometric scores, and discourse relation graphs and report encouraging F-scores (≈ 80 - 90%) for the helpful comment classes. Our results indicate that machine learning approaches can offer complementary moderating functionality for SW posts.

Research on early psychological programmes that aim to prevent or reduce mental health symptoms and that have been tested in frontline responders may assist service providers with choosing a suitable intervention for rapid dissemination in healthcare settings. Design and outcome measures First, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched through a systematic literature review of early psychological interventions administered to frontline responders in the last 15 years. Interventions were included if they were designed to prevent or reduce psychological impact and had outcome measures of psychological distress (eg, general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress) and/or positive mental health domains (eg, resilience, self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Second, the suitability of these programmes for the healthcare workforce was evaluated according to the criteria of effectiveness, content applicability and feasibility. Results Of 320 articles retrieved, 12 relevant studies were included that described six early psychological interventions. Although the evidence base is limited, psychological first aid, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, and trauma risk management showed effectiveness across at least two studies each with frontline workers. Resilience and coping for the healthcare community; anticipate, plan, and deter; and resilience at work programmes found promising results in single studies. Concerning other suitability criteria, all programmes appear applicable to healthcare settings and have acceptable feasibility for rapid implementation.

However, many low income countries lack epidemiological information on which to base future preventive strategies. This study reports on gender and age profiles as well as the likely background and means used for suicide attempts and suicides in Bolivia. METHOD: This study presents 1124 cases from four different sources of information: (i) emergency ward data with suicide attempts by poisoning from the year 2007, (ii) psychiatric ward data including suicide attempts from July 2011 to July 2012, (iii) newspaper articles reporting attempted suicides and suicides from 2009 to 2011, and (iv) the National Statistics on Crime reporting suicides from the years 2010-2011. Data on age was stratified into three age groups: adolescents aged 10-19 years, young adults aged 20-29 years, and older adults aged above 29 years. Data from the hospital wards and Crime Statistics were pooled to compare characteristics of suicide attempts with suicides concerning age and gender. Data on age, gender, methods used, and reasons were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Hospital data showed that more females (403/657, 61%) than males (254/657, 39%) attempted suicide, and females attempted suicide at a younger age than males (p<0.05). In contrast to this, more males (208/293, 70.5%) than females (85/293, 29.5%) committed suicide, and furthermore it was most prevalent among young adults aged 20-29 years of both genders, as observed from the Crime Statistics. The dominant method was pesticide poisoning varying from 400 out of 657 (70.5%) of the hospital poisoning cases to 65 out of 172 (37.8%) of the newspaper cases. Newspaper data showed a higher mortality rate (65/77, 85.1%) among those using violent methods such as hanging and jumping compared to non-violent methods (43/84, 50.9%) such as ingesting chemicals and drugs (p<0.05). The reasons were related to interpersonal problems, economic problems, depression, and unwanted pregnancies. Many cases of suicide seemed to be hidden due to cultural and religious reasons. CONCLUSION: More females attempted suicide, whereas more males realized suicide. Suicide attempts were most numerous among adolescents in contrast to suicides being most prevalent in the older age groups. Self-poisoning with pesticides was the most popular method used. Access to potential suicide materials should be restricted and psychosocial interventions initiated to prevent suicides.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1515/ijamh-2013-0309", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115890979", "source": "openalex"}

For instance, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 41 percent of the world's countries do not have a mental health policy, and 37 percent do not have community mental health care facilities. Moreover, 70 percent of the world's population has access to fewer than one psychiatrist per 100,000 people.To address these striking holes in mental health care, WHO launched the mental health Global Action Program (known as mhGAP) at the beginning of this year to focus on suicide prevention and the prevention and management of certain mental disorders in areas of the world that are woefully lacking in mental health services. These disorders are depression, schizophrenia, alcohol and drug dependence, dementia, and epilepsy. WHO program administrators hope to increase government awareness of mental disorders, enhance the quality of mental health services, and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness worldwide.Several StrategiesAccording to a report on the mhGAP initiative, released in April, WHO will use a number of strategies to improve mental health services and strengthen mental health policy throughout the world. One strategy will use the power and speed of the Internet to disseminate different types of mental health–related information to the public.For instance, WHO plans to establish an electronic database with statistics on the prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse in a number of countries. This information will be helpful because, according to the WHO report, almost 30 percent of the world's nations do not have a system for monitoring and reporting on mental health problems.Shekhar Saxena, M.D., coordinator of WHO's Mental Health and Research Division, told Psychiatric News that WHO is building a system to monitor substance abuse and dependence. It will include \"information on the use and abuse of and dependence on legal and illegal substances that have an impact on health\" in countries that lack monitoring systems.In addition, WHO is planning to expand its Internet-based database on global mental health resources. Data from WHO's Project Atlas, including the availability of mental health services, legislation, and mental health budgets in more than 100 countries, is available on the Web at mh-atlas.ic.gc.ca.The Web site allows users to click on the name of a country to access its related mental health information. For example, by clicking on \"Cameroon,\" users will learn that there are .08 psychiatric beds per 10,000 people and just .03 psychiatrists per 100,000 people.\"These data will facilitate action by policymakers and researchers,\" said Saxena. \"[They] will also empower public health institutions and consumer associations in their advocacy efforts.\"Health Care WorkersWHO's mental health program isn't just targeting the public with its educational efforts. Even some health care workers in certain corners of the world live in ignorance of the barriers to quality treatment of mental disorders. To better educate this group, WHO staff will distribute literature on the treatment of mental disorders, including \"information on how mental disorders, especially depression, negatively influence adherence to medical regimens. . .for a range of physical conditions,\" according to the report.Much of this information about mental health, however, does not pertain to residents of third-world countries, according to the WHO report. Most of the psychiatric literature is based on research that has been conducted in the world's wealthiest nations.To ensure that psychiatric research is more representative of people throughout the world, the mhGAP initiative will provide research training fellowships to psychiatrists and professionals in other disciplines in developing countries. Said Saxena, \"The fellowships will benefit researchers with an interest in mental health from all fields.\" As part of the initiative, WHO has contacted universities in some of these countries about training faculty in mental health and substance abuse research, he added.The report, \"Close the Gap, Dare to Care,\" is posted on the Web at www5.who.int/mental_health/download.cfm?id=0000000265, and the Project Atlas Web site is mh-atlas.ic.gc.ca. ▪ ISSUES NewArchived", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/pn.37.12.0030", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027031486", "source": "openalex"}

Some are inherited while others are acquired, and both vary greatly in onset and severity. Impaired endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis, involving Ca2+ signaling, protein synthesis, processing, trafficking and degradation, is now recognized as a key risk factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Lipidostasis involves lipid synthesis, quality control, membrane assembly as well as sequestration of excess lipids or degradation of damaged lipids. Proteostasis and lipidostasis are maintained by interconnected pathways within the cellular reticular network, which includes the ER and Ca2+ signaling. Importantly, lipidostasis is important in the maintenance of membranes and luminal environment that enable optimal protein processing. Accumulating evidence suggest that the loss of coordinate regulation of proteostasis and lipidostasis has a direct and negative impact on the health of the nervous system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00220", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2608207285", "source": "openalex"}

However, little is known about the prevalence, correlates or care pathways in countries other than the UK and the USA . A new study, the International Prevalence and Treatment of Diabetes and Depression Study ( INTERPRET – DD ) aims to address this dearth of knowledge and identify optimal pathways to care across the globe. Method INTERPRET – DD is a 2‐year longitudinal study, taking place in 16 countries’ diabetes outpatients’ facilities, investigating the recognition and management of depressive disorders in people with Type 2 diabetes. Clinical interviews are used to diagnose depression, with clinical and other data obtained from medical records and through patient interviews. Pathways to care and the impact of treatment for previously unrecognized (undocumented) depression on clinical outcomes and emotional well‐being are being investigated. Results Initial evidence indicates that a range of pathways to care exist, with few of them based on available recommendations for treatment. Pilot data indicates that the instruments we are using to measure both the symptoms and clinical diagnosis of depression are acceptable in our study population and easy to use. Conclusions Our study will increase the understanding of the impact of comorbid diabetes and depression and identify the most appropriate (country‐specific) pathways via which patients receive their care.

Examining these potential moderator variables can help explain heterogeneous results within and between psychotherapy meta-analyses. The present manuscript provides an overview of moderators that are highly relevant to test the generalizability of effects across psychotherapy trials. These moderators mainly fall into one of the following groups: (a) structural equivalence of interventions, (b) preferences/allegiances, (c) therapist effects, and (d) sample representativeness. Individual moderators include: Bona fide psychotherapy, proximity to psychological interventions, psychotherapy orientation, pre-training of therapists, supervision, caseload of therapists, dosage, homework, patient preferences, researcher and therapist allegiance, therapist effects in nested designs, aspects of sample representativeness, multiple outcomes, and time of assessment. Our analysis of 15 psychotherapy meta-analyses published in 2016 suggests that the structural equivalence of psychotherapeutic conditions, patient and therapist preferences/allegiances, therapist effects and nested data structures as well as sample representativeness were often neglected and little-discussed as potential moderators. The manuscript describes further conceptual and methodological challenges when conducting moderator analyses such as the categorization of psychological treatments and the importance of interrater coding. We encourage meta-analysts to consider moderators which have previously shown utility in explaining heterogeneous results in the psychotherapy literature.Clinical or methodological significance of this article: Relevant moderator variables help explain heterogeneous results in psychotherapy meta-analyses.

This paper describes a strategy for the scale-up of an intervention delivered by lay health workers (LHWs) to 60 primary health care facilities in Zimbabwe.A mixed methods approach was utilized as follows: (1) needs assessment using a semi-structured questionnaire to obtain information from nurses (n = 48) and focus group discussions with District Health Promoters (n = 12) to identify key priority areas; (2) skills assessment to identify core competencies and current gaps of LHWs (n = 300) employed in the 60 clinics; (3) consultation workshops (n = 2) with key stakeholders to determine referral pathways; and (4) in-depth interviews and consultations to determine funding mechanisms for the scale-up.Five cross-cutting issues were identified as critical and needing to be addressed for a successful scale-up. These included: the lack of training in mental health, unavailability of psychiatric drugs, depleted clinical staff levels, unavailability of time for counseling, and poor and unreliable referral systems for people suffering with depression. Consensus was reached by stakeholders on supervision and support structure to address the cross-cutting issues described above and funding was successfully secured for the scale-up.Key requirements for success included early buy-in from key stakeholders, extensive consultation at each point of the scale-up journey, financial support both locally and externally, and a coherent sustainability plan endorsed by both government and private sectors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2016.8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2324252594", "source": "openalex"}

There may be both benefits and risks. Yet, almost all published research on this topic is from high‐income countries. This paper presents new findings across four countries of varying wealth. Methods We analyse data gathered through the Global Kids Online project from nationally representative samples of Internet‐using children aged 9 to 17 years in Bulgaria ( n = 1,000), Chile ( n = 1,000), Ghana ( n = 2,060) and the Philippines ( n = 1,873). Data was gathered on Internet usage on week and weekend days. Measures of absolute (comparable across countries) and relative (compared to other children within countries) time use were constructed. Mental health was measured by Cantril’s ladder (life satisfaction). The analysis also considers the relative explanatory power on variations in mental health of children’s relationships with family and friends. Analysis controlled for age, gender and family socioeconomic status. Results In Bulgaria and Chile, higher‐frequency Internet use is weakly associated with lower life satisfaction. In Ghana and the Philippines, no such pattern was observed. There was no evidence that the relationship between frequency of Internet use and life satisfaction differed by gender. In all four countries, the quality of children’s close relationships showed a much stronger relationship with their life satisfaction than did time spent on the Internet. Conclusions Time spent on the Internet does not appear to be strongly linked to children’s life satisfaction, and results from one country should not be assumed to transfer to another. Improving the quality of children’s close relationships offers a more fruitful area for intervention than restricting their time online. Future research could consider a wider range of countries and links between the nature, rather than quantity, of Internet usage and mental health.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13280", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3041904716", "source": "openalex"}

Data collected within the Mediterranean Islands (MEDIS) Study, a health and nutrition survey of elderly people living on Mediterranean islands was used. A total of 851 postmenopausal women living in various Greek islands, Cyprus, and Malta participated in the study. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Age-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that a year's increase in the time since menopause increased the likelihood of postmenopausal women having severe depressive symptoms by 3% (odds ratio [OR] per 1 year = 1.03, 95% CI 1.001-1.05). This positive association was also evident when other potential confounding factors (i.e, living conditions, financial status, physical activity, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, smoking habits, and several clinical conditions) were also taken into account in multivariable analyses.

Child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) postgraduate training can play a pivotal role in increasing access to youth mental health services. In comparison to Europe and North America, however, little is reported regarding CAP training in the Far East, one of the most dynamic and rapidly developing world regions with a very young population. This paper presents an original study on the current status of academic child and adolescent psychiatry training across the Far East.We collected data from 17 countries in the Far East using an internally distributed questionnaire to the Consortium members invited for this study, consisting of leading academic child and adolescent psychiatrists in each country.Based on informants' input, we found an overall underdevelopment of CAP postgraduate training systems despite CAP's recognition as a subspecialty in 12 of 17 of the nations or functionally self-governing areas in the Far East. Paucity of official guidelines for CAP training was also evident. All informants reported a need for additional child and adolescent mental health professionals.There seems to be several obstacles to the development of CAP postgraduate training in the Far East, including stigma towards mental health issues and lack of funding. International collaboration is desired to develop evidence-based and culture-tailored CAP training systems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pcn.12248", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127532241", "source": "openalex"}

A joint structural model was first built for SCIT and S-desmethylcitalopram (SDCIT) in plasma using NONMEM and the milk-to-plasma ratio (MPR) was estimated by adding the drug breast milk concentrations. The effect of different influential covariates was tested and the average drug exposure with variability through breastfeeding was predicted under various conditions by simulation.The study enrolled 33 patients treated with SCIT or racemic citalopram who provided 80 blood and 104 milk samples. Mean MPR for both parent drug and metabolite was 1.9. Increased milk fat content was significantly associated with an increased drug transfer into breast milk (+28% for SCIT and +18% for SDCIT when fat amount doubles from 3.1 to 6.2 g/100 mL). Simulations suggested that an exclusively breastfed infant would ingest daily through breast milk 3.3% of the weight-adjusted maternal SCIT dose on average.The moderate between-subject variability in milk concentration of SCIT and the limited exposure to escitalopram through breast milk observed provide reassurance for treated mothers of breastfed healthy infants.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14278", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3011320561", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: The Irish Central Statistics Office provided suicide and undetermined death data for 1980–2006. The National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm collected data relating to deliberate self harm presentations made in 2006–2008 to all 40 Irish hospital emergency departments. Results: Rates of female suicide among older adults (over 55 years) were relatively stable in Ireland during 1980–2006 whereas male rates increased in the 1980s and decreased in more recent decades. Respectively, the annual male and female suicide and undetermined death rate was 22.1 and 7.6 per 100,000 in 1997–2006. Male and female deliberate self harm was 3.0 and 11.0 times higher at 67.4 and 83.4 per 100,000, respectively. Deliberate self harm and suicide decreased in incidence with increasing age. Deliberate self harm generally involved drug overdose (male: 72%; female 85%) or self-cutting (male: 15%; female 9%). The most common methods of suicide were hanging (41%) and drowning (29%) for men and drowning (39%) and drug overdose (24%) for women. City and urban district populations had the highest rates of hospital-treated self harm. The highest suicide rates were in urban districts. Conclusions: Older Irish adults have high rates of hospital-treated deliberate self harm but below average rates of suicide. Drowning was relatively common as a method of suicide.

The typical treatment options include antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. However, these treatments do not ensure the safety of the fetus. Recently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has emerged as a promising treatment for neuropathies as well as depression. Nevertheless, many studies excluded pregnant women. This systematic review was conducted to confirm whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was a suitable treatment option for peripartum depression. Methods We performed a systematic review that followed the PRISMA guidelines. We searched for studies in the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases published until the end of September 2020. Eleven studies were selected for the systematic review, and five studies were selected for quantitative synthesis. Data analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3 software. The effect size was analyzed using the standardized mean difference, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was determined by the generic inverse variance estimation method. Results The therapeutic effect size of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for peripartum depression was 1.394 (95% CI: 0.944–1.843), and the sensitivity analysis effect size was 1.074 (95% CI: 0.689–1.459), indicating a significant effect. The side effect size of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for peripartum depression was 0.346 (95% CI: 0.214–0.506), a meaningful result. There were no severe side effects to the mothers or fetuses. Conclusions From various perspectives, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can be considered an alternative treatment to treat peripartum depression to avoid exposure of fetuses to drugs and the severe side effects of electroconvulsive therapy.

This article summarises the results of the various studies and offers possible explanations for differences in findings between the UK and other allied nations. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates are perhaps surprisingly low amongst British forces, with prevalence rates of around 4% in personnel who have deployed, rising to 6% in combat troops, despite the high tempo of operations in recent years. The rates in personnel currently on operations are consistently lower than these. Explanations for the lower PTSD prevalence in British troops include variations in combat exposures, demographic differences, higher leader to enlisted soldier ratios, shorter operational tour lengths and differences in access to long-term health care between countries. Delayed-onset PTSD was recently found to be more common than previously supposed, accounting for nearly half of all PTSD cases; however, many of these had sub-syndromal PTSD predating the onset of the full disorder. Rates of common mental health disorders in UK troops are similar or higher to those of the general population, and overall operational deployments are not associated with an increase in mental health problems in UK regular forces. However, there does appear to be a correlation between both deployment and increased alcohol misuse and post-deployment violence in combat troops. Unlike for regular forces, there is an overall association between deployment and mental health problems in Reservists. There have been growing concerns regarding mild traumatic brain injury, though this appears to be low in British troops with an overall prevalence of 4.4% in comparison with 15% in the US military. The current strategies for detection and treatment of mental health problems in British forces are also described. The stance of the UK military is that psychological welfare of troops is primarily a chain of command responsibility, aided by medical advice when necessary, and to this end uses third location decompression, stress briefings, and Trauma Risk Management approaches. Outpatient treatment is provided by Field Mental Health Teams and military Departments of Community Mental Health, whilst inpatient care is given in specific NHS hospitals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3402/ejpt.v5.23617", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2098699783", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2790329759", "title": "Mental health policies in Commonwealth countries", "text": "The large global burden of mental health conditions1 has led to an increased emphasis on improving access to mental health services in countries across the world. There is clear recognition that improving mental health governance is key to improving access to and quality of mental health services, and the existence of a mental health policy is an important component of improving mental health governance2. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Mental Health Atlas 2014 found that 68% of countries had a mental health policy3, while the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 set a target that 80% of countries should have developed or updated their mental health policies/plans in line with international and regional human rights instruments by 20202. The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 52 independent and sovereign states part of the erstwhile British Empire which, in spite of their geographical variations, generally have similar political, legal and governance systems. We reviewed the mental health policies of Commonwealth countries in order to compare them to standards developed by the WHO and to assess their compliance with international recommendations. We identified and downloaded mental health policies of Commonwealth countries from WHO MINDbank4. If a mental health policy was not found there, we extended our search to official government websites of countries. In the case of federal countries such as Canada and Australia, we relied on a federal mental health policy and, if this was absent, we used the most recent mental health policy from any of the provinces or, if there were two policies from the same year, the mental health policy from the province with the larger population. We used WHO's Mental Health Policy checklist5 to assess compliance of country mental health policies with international recommendations. Eleven countries (21.1%) did not have a mental health policy. We were unable to find a mental health policy in 16 (30.8%) additional countries, although we found references in various documents to such a policy. We found a mental health policy in 25 countries (48.1%), of which Naaru and Zambia had a “final draft” policy and Uganda and St. Lucia had a draft policy. Of the countries with a mental health policy, only seven (28.0%) had adopted it after 2011. In only two (8.0%), the policies contained an explicit reference to country data and research informing policy development. While 15 policies (60.0%) indicated how funding would be used for financing mental health services, only four (16.0%) had a clear statement on providing equitable funding between mental and physical health, and only five (20.0%) explicitly stated that mental health should be included in health insurance. Seventeen policies (68.0%) promoted human rights, while only 14 (56.0%) specifically mentioned developing human rights oriented mental health legislation. Only one policy (4.0%) had detailed intersectoral collaboration outlined, while four (16.0%) had it to some extent. Fourteen policies (56.0%) included a process to measure and improve the quality of mental health services. Only three policies (12.0%) either significantly or to some extent made a commitment to putting in place suitable working conditions for mental health providers. Twenty-one policies (84.0%) did, however, recognize that training in core competencies and skills was important for human resource development. Fourteen policies (56.0%) promoted integration of mental health services into general health services, but only 11 policies (44.0%) promoted deinstitutionalization. Nearly half of the policies had provisions for promotion of mental health, prevention of mental disorders and rehabilitation of persons with mental illness. Only half of the policies emphasized the need for research and evaluation of services and assessment of the policy and strategic plan. Thus, while the WHO reported that 68% of countries globally had a mental health policy, we were only able to find such a policy in 48% of Commonwealth countries. Most (72%) of the Commonwealth mental health policies were adopted prior to 2011. Thus, these countries were behind the global average of 47% of countries having adopted a mental health policy after 20103. There are many possible reasons for these findings, including failure of mental health sector to advocate effectively, lack of technical skills in mental health policy development, and limited political interest due to stigma and discrimination. Financing of mental health remains a concern. Although 60% of policies recognized the role of funding in equitable mental health services, only a tiny minority explicitly addressed equitable funding between services for mental and physical health. We know anecdotally that in many countries health insurance from private (and at times also public) insurance providers excludes treatment of mental illness. It is a matter of serious concern that policies in only a fifth of the countries have a commitment to including mental health in general health insurance. As we said, the WHO Mental Health Action Plan sets a global target for 80% of countries to develop or update their mental health legislation in line with international human rights instruments by 20202. Although half of the Commonwealth country policies identify the development of new mental health legislation as a key policy action, the reality lies in actual delivery and whether countries which have new legislation as a key policy action do succeed in delivering equity. It is now well accepted that addressing mental health problems requires intervention across many different sectors including health, social welfare, education, justice, employment to name just a few. It is therefore surprising to note the near total absence of any emphasis on intersectoral collaboration in these policies in Commonwealth countries. We were also concerned to note that only half of the policies promoted integration of mental health with physical health services, deinstitutionalization, promotion of mental health, prevention of mental disorders and rehabilitation. The lack of emphasis on improving quality of mental health services in the policies of half of the countries is equally disconcerting, because it allows poor quality services to continue without change and perpetuates poor outcomes. Only half of the policies mentioned the need for research and evaluation of policies and services, indicating a general lack of interest in an important component of future policy development. The absence of systematic evaluation of existing policies may result in ineffective services continuing to be offered and consequent failure to achieve policy goals. In conclusion, our findings indicate that there is still some way to go in bringing about equity between physical and mental health care but also equity between Commonwealth countries. The informal links between these countries indicate the strength of the relationship and perhaps high-income countries need to consider mentoring and supporting low-income countries to ensure that mental health policies are developed appropriately in order to deliver best care which our patients need, deserve and will utilize.

This study investigates the associations between maternal mental health problems, breastfeeding beliefs and breastfeeding practices in rural China.Cross-sectional data were collected in November and December 2019 from 742 mothers of infants under 6 months old in rural Sichuan Province, China. Maternal mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms) was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (short form). Breastfeeding beliefs were assessed using the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale and Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (short form). Breastfeeding practices were assessed through a 24-h dietary recall questionnaire. Ordinary least squares regression, multiple logistic regression and heterogeneous effects analyses were used to identify associations between symptoms of mental health problems and breastfeeding outcomes.The average age of sample infants was 2.7 months. Among mothers, 13% showed symptoms of depression, 16% anxiety, and 9% stress. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in the previous 24 h was 38.0%. Depression symptoms were significantly associated with breastfeeding attitude (훽= - 1.11, 95% CI: - 2.07, - 0.14) and breastfeeding self-efficacy (훽= - 3.19, 95% CI: - 4.93, - 1.45). Anxiety and stress symptoms were significantly associated with breastfeeding self-efficacy (훽= - 1.81, 95% CI: - 3.43, - 0.18 and 훽 = - 2.88, 95% CI: - 4.98, - 0.78, respectively). There were no significant associations between symptoms of mental health problems and exclusive breastfeeding. The heterogeneous effects analyses revealed that less educated mothers with symptoms of stress had lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding than educated mothers without symptoms of stress (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.25,1.10). Mothers of younger infants had higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding than the mother of older infants, regardless of depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms.Symptoms of maternal mental health problems are significantly associated with breastfeeding attitude and self-efficacy; however, these symptoms are not associated with breastfeeding practices. Maternal educational level and infant age may play a role in mothers' breastfeeding practices. To improve breastfeeding practices, interventions should employ a multi-dimensional approach that focuses on improving maternal mental well-being and considers demographic characteristics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13006-022-00504-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4292542209", "source": "openalex"}

Methods This observational study included 462 participants from the Departments of Ophthalmology of the University of Campinas and Conderg-Divinolândia. The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire and Rasch analysis were used to assess the vision-related quality of life (VRQoL). Patients with macular neovascularization were interviewed at enrollment and after three loading doses of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment. Results One hundred thirty-three patients were excluded because they had another ophthalmic disease, for a total of 349 patients included in the study (177 in the AMD group, 172 in the control group; 56.4% were women; mean ± standard deviation age, 70.6 ± 9.5 years). Most NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores were significantly lower in the AMD group compared with the control group. The Rasch-calibrated NEI-VFQ-25 median score in the visual-functioning component was 56.41 for the AMD group and 61.53 for the control group, a difference of ± 4.00 (P = 0.0001). Separate analyses of the sociodemographic and ocular characteristics showed that the NEI-VFQ-25 scores were affected mostly by family income, educational level, descent, diet (vegetables/fruits), physical activity, and visual acuity (VA). The longitudinal component assessed a different group of 48 patients with exudative disease treated with anti-VEGF drugs. The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution change in VA in treated eyes was a 0.16 decrease (P = 0.01). The mean change in the optical coherence tomography macular thickness was a 36.74-μm decrease (P = 0.012) from baseline to 4 months. The mean NEI-VFQ-25 scores improved significantly from baseline to follow-up at 4 months in almost all subscales. Conclusions In a Brazilian community, patients with AMD had a worse VRQoL than controls. The AMD severity and bilaterality were associated with decreased NEI-VFQ-25 scores.

In humans, mood disorders are often accompanied by abnormalities in the organization of the circadian system, which normally synchronizes activities and functions of cells and tissues. Studies on animal models suggest that the basic circadian clock mechanism, which runs in essentially all cells, is implicated in the modulation of biological phenomena regulating affective behaviors. In particular, recent findings highlight the importance of the circadian clock mechanisms in neurological pathways involved in mood, such as monoaminergic neurotransmission, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation, suprachiasmatic nucleus and olfactory bulb activities, and neurogenesis. Defects at the level of both, the circadian clock mechanism and system, may contribute to the etiology of mood disorders. Modification of the circadian system using chronotherapy appears to be an effective treatment for mood disorders. Additionally, understanding the role of circadian clock mechanisms, which affect the regulation of different mood pathways, will open up the possibility for targeted pharmacological treatments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035883", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2315115992", "source": "openalex"}

In a natural experiment, we examined effects of legislative changes on return to work and work participation. <h3>Methods</h3> The source population consisted of up to 72 164 Finnish public sector employees with a permanent job contract in 2008–2011 (before) and in 2013–2014 (after). We used employees with a continuous sickness absence of at least 30 calendar-days (n=5708–6393), 60 compensated days (n=1481–1655) and 90 compensated days (n=766–932). We examined sustainable return to work (a minimum of 28 consecutive working days) with survival analysis as well as monthly work participation after a sickness absence, and annual gain in work participation after the intervention, using trajectory analyses. <h3>Results</h3> Sustainable return to work after 60 days of sickness absence occurred earlier after the legislative changes (p value 0.017), although the effect reduced towards the end of the follow-up. There were no differences in return to work after a 30 or 90 days of sickness absence. The largest annual gain, postintervention versus preintervention, in monthly work participation was observed among employees with 60 days of sickness absence and was 230.9 person-years/10 000 employees.

Research has been conducted into what building blocks are required to reform mental health systems in states emerging from wars and into the barriers to reform. What is less well known is what work and activities are actually performed when mental health systems in war-affected resource-poor countries are reformed. Questions that remain unanswered are: What is it that international humanitarian aid workers and local experts do on the ground? What are the actual activities they perform in order to enable and sustain system reform? This article begins to answer these questions through ethnographic case studies of mental health system reform in Kosovo and Palestine. Based on the findings, a theory of “practice-based evidence” is developed. Practice-based evidence assumes that knowledge is derived from practice, rather than the other way around where practice is believed to be informed by systematic evidence. It is argued that a focus on practice rather than evidence can improving system reform processes as well as the provision of mental health care in a way that is sensitive to local contexts, structural realities, culture, and history.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11013-019-09641-w", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2971946482", "source": "openalex"}

In Nepal, suicide research based on General Hospital Psychiatry Unit (GHPU) settings can be informative to explore the trend in suicidal behaviors. In this study, we aimed to study the pattern of suicide attempts in Southern Nepal by including retrospective suicide attempt cases registered in the three GHPU centers.Methods: The study included 116 survivors of suicide attempts registered over a period of six months (Jan, 2017 to July, 2017) at three centers in Southern region of Nepal. The cases were referred from medical emergency or other medical departments for psychiatric evaluation. They underwent evaluation by at least one consultant psychiatrist and received appropriate interventions.Results: Majority of the victims were female (68%), belonging to younger age group (90%) with one third in adolescent age group and homemakers (32%) or students (31%) by occupation. The most common method of attempt was self poisoning with pesticides (78.4%) followed by medication overdose (8.6%) and hanging (7.8%). Most of the attempts (82.7%) were impulsive in nature. Mental illness was diagnosed in 60 % of the cases, mainly depressive disorder, and adjustment disorder. Most of the attempts (87%) were triggered by psycho-social factors before the attempt, mainly interpersonal conflicts. Conclusions: The pattern shows predominance of female gender, younger age group, a role of mental illness, impulsivity and psychosocial factors in suicide attempts. Future research should focus on these aspects to develop effective prevention strategies. Med Phoenix.

However, the role of rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) remains under investigated. Here, we sought to identify rare SNVs with predicted deleterious effect that may contribute to ADHD risk. We chose to study ADHD families (including multi-incident) from a population with a high rate of consanguinity in which genetic risk factors tend to accumulate and therefore increasing the chance of detecting risk alleles. We employed whole exome sequencing (WES) to interrogate the entire coding region of 16 trios with ADHD. We also performed enrichment analysis on our final list of genes to identify the overrepresented biological processes. A total of 32 rare variants with predicted damaging effect were identified in 31 genes. At least two variants were detected per proband, most of which were not exclusive to the affected individuals. In addition, the majority of our candidate genes have not been previously described in ADHD including five genes ( NEK4 , NLE1 , PSRC1 , PTP4A3, and TMEM183A ) that were not previously described in any human condition. Moreover, enrichment analysis highlighted brain-relevant biological themes such as “Glutamatergic synapse”, “Cytoskeleton organization”, and “Ca 2+ pathway”.

While these scientists have produced tremendous quantities of new research, the relatively rapid growth in their ranks has been accompanied by two problems. First, the increase in the supply of postdocs has not been accompanied by a commensurate increase in the demand for them, at least in the academic sector. Second, large postdoctoral populations on campuses have strained institutions' capacities for providing these researchers with basic administrative oversight. Each of these recommended measures comes at a cost, so assessing their relative benefits is important if institutions are to allocate their resources efficiently. This chapter develops such an assessment. Linear models are used to isolate the effects of specific measures on outcomes using data from a large-scale survey of postdocs. The results are striking: a handful of straightforward and relatively inexpensive measures appear to make a large difference in postdoc productivity and in the overall quality of the postdoctoral experience.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226261904.003.0004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1485924465", "source": "openalex"}

On the other hand, attempted suicide (AS) is a risk factor for CS but there are limited data on its rates in various countries. In constructing a ratio for AS/CS rates, most would agree that for CS, the denominator should be the annual suicide rate (per 100 000). As for the ratio's numerator (AS) per 100 000, there are three possible calculations: (1) annual prevalence from population surveys, (2) annual prevalence from national clinical registers or (3) lifetime prevalence from population surveys. We think that the first possibility would probably be the best choice but, unfortunately, surveys providing the annual prevalence of AS are lacking for most countries. Annual prevalence from national registers is also lacking for most countries and is contaminated by under-reporting. Therefore, in this editorial, we are left with only the last option, a ratio for lifetime prevalence of AS (per 100 000) divided by annual rate of CS (per 100 000). This ratio for AS/CS rates appears to differ substantially across countries worldwide but presents no big regional differences other than two remarkable exceptions, one per continent. In Europe, Spain and France had greater ratios (174.4 and 152.5, respectively) than Italy (64.1). In Asia/Pacific, New Zealand has a higher ratio (345.9) compared with China (75.8) and Japan (76.9). The ratio for AS/CS rates could be a good index for implementing evidence-informed decision-making regarding suicidal behaviour (SB) among health service managers, and for helping them in the allocation of health resources for the prevention of SB.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s2045796018000628", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2898493865", "source": "openalex"}

Given that 91% of firearm deaths among older U.S. adults in 2017 resulted from self-inflicted wounds, the well-established relationship between cognitive impairment and depression is particularly concerning in this population (1, 2). Those with dementia may also shoot themselves or others because of confusion or increased agitation and the associated aggression (3). Recent publications have encouraged clinicians to discuss with patients their own or their aging loved ones' access to firearms (4); however, little is known about the prevalence of household firearm ownership and storage practices among older adults.Objective: To characterize adults aged 65 years or older residing in firearm-owning households and their firearm storage practices with regard to self-reported sociodemographic features, suicide risk factors, and confusion or memory loss. Data from the 2016 Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used.Methods and Findings: The BRFSS uses a complex survey design to gather representative estimates of various behaviors (Appendix). We focused on alcohol consumption, mental health, and memory loss in addition to household firearm ownership and storage practices (Supplement). Storage was characterized in 3 mutually exclusive categories: all firearms stored locked and unloaded (the safest option), 1 or more firearms stored either unlocked and unloaded or locked and loaded, and 1 or more firearms stored unlocked and loaded (the least safe option). The analyses were conducted using Stata 15 (StataCorp). The Washington State Department of Health and University of Washington institutional review boards have determined that the BRFSS is exempt from review and approval.A total of 5074 older adults responded. After exclusion of 581 who did not respond to the firearms module and 65 who reported household firearm ownership but did not report on storage, 4428 responses were available for analysis. Overall, 38.6% reported a firearm in the home (an estimated 410 000 statewide). Respondents from firearm-owning households tended to be younger and were more likely to be white, male, and married (Table 1). Among firearm-owning households, 32.5% stored all firearms locked and unloaded, and 23.5% stored at least 1 firearm unlocked and loaded. Those reporting unlocked and loaded storage were more likely to be male, to be a veteran, and to reside in a rural area than those reporting safer storage.Table 1. Demographic Characteristics of Washington Residents Aged 65 Years or Older, by Household Firearm Ownership and Storage Practices*The prevalence of diagnosed depression and frequent mental distress was 17.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Memory loss in the previous year was reported by 12.2% of participants, and 5.6% reported discussing it with a clinician. The prevalence of these conditions did not vary meaningfully by household firearm ownership (Table 2). Among those in firearm-owning households, the prevalence of suicide risk factors or memory loss did not vary meaningfully by storage practice.Table 2. Prevalence of Suicide Risk Factors and Indicators of Memory Loss, by Household Firearm Ownership and Storage Practices*Discussion: In this statewide representative study of older adults in Washington, the prevalence of mental health or memory loss indicators did not vary by household firearm ownership or storage practices. Given the association between firearm ownership and suicide (5), limiting access to lethal weapons for the older adult population represents an important avenue for suicide prevention. This is especially important among aging adults with firearms in the home who are beginning to show symptoms of depression or dementia.The lack of significant differences in suicide risk factors and memory loss among older adults in households with and without firearms is concerning and indicates the need for action on the part of policymakers, physicians, and families to address this issue. In addition to patient–provider communication, risk-based policies on eligibility for firearm ownership reduce access to lethal means. Some states currently restrict access for persons with mental illness, but few mention dementia. As \"red flag\" laws continue to be adopted throughout the country, the potential risk for firearm injury among older adults with memory loss should be considered an important indication. Recently published guidelines provide recommendations on the timing and content of conversations about firearms and suggest that providers include screening questions when seeing persons with dementia (4). These conversations with older patients could be crucial opportunities to prevent injuries and save lives.Appendix: BRFSS MethodsHealth characteristics estimated from the BRFSS pertain to the U.S. noninstitutionalized population aged 18 years or older. In 2011, a new weighting method called iterative proportional fitting, or \"raking,\" replaced the poststratification method to weight BRFSS data. Raking allows incorporation of cellphone survey data and permits the introduction of such demographic characteristics as education level, marital status, or home renter or owner status in addition to age, race/ethnicity, and gender to improve the degree and extent to which the BRFSS sample reflects the sociodemographic makeup of the individual state. The 2016 BRFSS raking method includes categories of age by gender, detailed racial and ethnic groups, education level, marital status, regions within states, gender by race and ethnicity, telephone source, renter or owner status, and age by race and ethnicity. In 2016, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands collected samples of interviews conducted by landline and cellphone. Data from before and after the 2011 change are not directly comparable, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises against using both in the same analysis.Each year, states—represented by their BRFSS coordinators and the CDC—agree on the content of the questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of a core component, optional modules, and state-added questions. Many questions are taken from established national surveys, such as the National Health Interview Survey or NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). This allows the BRFSS to take advantage of questions that have been tested and allows states to compare their data with those from other surveys. Any new questions that states, federal agencies, or other entities propose as additions to the BRFSS must undergo cognitive testing and field testing before being included. In addition, a majority vote of all state representatives is required before questions are adopted. The BRFSS guidelines, which are agreed on by the state representatives and the CDC, stipulate that all states ask the core component questions without modification. They may choose to add any, all, or none of the optional modules and may add questions of their choosing (state-added questions). Questions on alcohol consumption and a limited set of questions on other subjects are part of the core, additional questions on mental health and cognitive decline are optional modules, and Washington has inquired about firearm ownership and storage through state-added questions. The 2016 survey was the only one after the change in methods in which Washington added the cognitive decline modules.Data from the BRFSS are made available by the Washington State Department of Health, Center for Health Statistics, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and supported in part by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cooperative agreements U58/SO000047-3 [2013], U58/DP006066-01 [2015], and NU58/DP006066-02-02 [2016]).

Rivara, MD, MPH, Ali Rowhani-Rahbar, MD, PhDUniversity of Washington17 September 2019 Authors' Response Dr. Ross has called to attention the assumptions on what constitutes safe storage. While preference for firearm storage techniques varies by owner circumstance, many professional medical and public health organizations have been consistent in messaging locked and unloaded storage as the safest practice.1 These positions are informed by decades of research beginning with the 1992 publication by Kellermann and colleagues which found associations between firearms in the home and suicide risk, which increased in magnitude when firearms were stored either unlocked or loaded.2 More recently, this question was assessed among adults over the age of 50, and storage was again found to be significantly associated with suicide death.3 Given the evidence supporting the association between locked and unloaded storage and reduced risk of suicide at all ages, and that several professional health organizations have published position papers supporting these methods, we believe that it is appropriate to consider firearms kept locked and unloaded as \"safe\" storage. Additionally, the availability of pushbutton locks on lockboxes can assure access to firearms within seconds, making such storage compatible with protection as the reason for owning a firearm. Dr. Ertle raised the important issue of implications of safe storage specific to an older adult population and means substitution if firearms are not available. Firearm ownership and risk of suicide among those aged 50 and older has been studied and results are similar to those of other age groups.3 Increased risk of suicide in older adults across the world is significant but is not solely explained by the availability of firearms. It is important to note that the case fatality of firearm suicide attempts is far higher than suicide attempts by other means.4 While individuals making serious attempts to die by suicide may use other means, these means are less likely to be fatal. Some other countries with a lower prevalence of firearm ownership may have higher rates of suicide among older adults; however, it is important to consider that the difference in firearm ownership is not the only difference between the United States and Japan or China. Complex cultural differences in healthcare, socializing, views of the older adults, stigma surrounding mental health, and honor—among other differences—may also partially explain higher rates of suicide despite limited access to firearms.5 We recognize that limiting access to firearms alone is not sufficient to prevent all suicide deaths. Nonetheless, this is one potential opportunity for prevention. 1. Butkus R, Doherty R, Bornstein SS.

Alan R. ErtleEmeritus Enterprises, LLC7 August 2019 Household Firearm Ownership: Does it Make a Difference in the Elderly Suicide Rate? I read the article by Morgan and colleagues with interest. Approximately 1% of Americans will die by suicide (1). Older men and women show the highest suicide rate in almost all countries, including those with very limited access to firearms such as Japan and China where the rate of suicide in the elderly is nearly three times that found in the United States (2,3). The authors cite the article by Angelmeyer and colleagues that concludes that the access to firearms is associated with risk for completed suicide and being the victim of homicide (4). However, this article was not specific to the elderly and thus makes it quite difficult to extrapolate to that population. The authors conclude, \"…limiting access to lethal weapons for the older adult population represents an important avenue for suicide prevention.\" Based on this study, it is impossible for the authors to conclude this. There is no evidence that limiting access to firearms would change the overall rate of suicide in the elderly in the US. Limited access to firearms might reduce the risk of suicide by firearms, but there is no evidence to support that the overall suicide rate would be reduced. This is supported by the higher rates of suicide in the elderly in countries with exceptionally limited access to firearms. With their logic, one should limit access to acetaminophen, ropes, automobiles, stairs, knives, bathtubs and a whole host of other potential suicide risks. 1.

Kerry RossSalem Medical Center19 April 2019 \"Safe\" firearm storage The authors evidence a bias in their definition of what constitutes \"safe\" gun storage. If an individual chooses to own a firearm for the reason of protection of themselves/their family and their property then storing a firearm unloaded and locked away renders it useless for that purpose. If someone chooses to own a firearm for that reason - which is perfectly valid and legal - then it is perjorative to them to suggest that they are not storing their firearms in as \"safe\" a manner as other firearm owners. This is what is explicitly stated in the article and it is inappropriate. The true definition of \"safe\" is a subjective one that depends on the individual firearm owner's situation and personal beliefs/choices.

This research is a starting point in tracing the multiple ‘doings’ of mhGAP‐IG – connecting questions of how it is ‘done’ and what does it ‘do’ – to the living histories and wider global mental health assemblages that make the tool possible and shape its global circulation. We examine the conditions of possibility that produce and legitimate mhGAP‐IG, and the ways these are ‘black boxed’ through casting mhGAP‐IG in technical rather than epistemological terms. The study illuminates how its explicit design for global expansion positions mhGAP‐IG as open to questioning from those who are technical ‘insiders’ and setting the epistemological parameters of its own critique. It analyses mhGAP‐IG as an ‘inscription device’ that inscribes and materialises algorithmic imaginaries of mental health that impact on design and local implementation. This study is one attempt at initiating dialogue with the WHO from perspectives and methodological approaches not usually included in the conversation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.12870", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2916251857", "source": "openalex"}

In this sense, a philosophical-existential therapeutic approach, which considers the ultimate meanings of existence, may be more useful, efficacious, and appropriate. In existential depression, the mood is oriented in a depressive sense, at first glance in a similar way to other depressive disorders. However, it is necessary to diagnostically differentiate this sort of depressive state from others, as it requires a different type of intervention from those typically used today in treating pathological depression, such as standard psychotherapy and/or psychiatric drugs. This specific depressive condition originates from particular reflections and considerations on life, and produces a profound discomfort, highlighting how the depressive state can represent, at least in some cases, a pivotal moment of existence. In this article, the author, a psychiatrist and existential therapist, describes existential depression, its phenomenology, genesis, and philosophical-existential treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0022167819834747", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2919706001", "source": "openalex"}

A szorongás és a diabetes közti összefüggést már kevesebben vizsgálták, pedig jelentős szerepük van a szorongásos kórképeknek is, hiszen nagyon gyakori a két betegség együttes előfordulása. A diabetes már önmagában is nagy betegségterhet jelent a betegek számára, a társuló pszichiátriai kórképek pedig tovább rontják a kezelés minőségét, ezért fontos a korai felismerésük és kezelésük. Jelen összefoglaló közleményünk célja a szorongásos kórképek és elsősorban a 2-es típusú cukorbetegség közti összefüggés feltárása. Több elmélet született a köztük lévő kapcsolat magyarázatára. Egyesek szerint szerepet játszhat benne a közös etiológiai háttér, mások szerint a cukorbetegség diagnózisa és a gondozásával kapcsolatos feladatok vezetnek szorongáshoz. Megint mások pedig ellentétes irányból vizsgálva a köztük lévő kapcsolatot, arra a megállapításra jutottak, hogy a szorongás különböző fiziológiai mechanizmusokon keresztül vezethet cukorbetegséghez. A szorongás és a diabetes közti kapcsolat irányától függetlenül javasolt a depresszió mellett a szorongásnak a szűrése és minél korábbi kezelése a cukorbetegek körében, így csökkennének a komorbiditásból származó szövődmények, a kezelési nehézségek, javulna a betegek életminősége és a terápiával való együttműködésük. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(31): 1226–1232. Summary. The relationship between diabetes and depression has been evaluated in numerous studies. The association between diabetes and anxiety was less investigated, although the importance of anxiety disorders is underlined by its frequent co-occurrence with diabetes. Diabetes alone carries a significant disease burden for patients. Comorbidity with psychiatric disorders deteriorates the quality of care, therefore early treatment and diagnosis of these conditions are essential. The aim of the present review is to outline the relationship between anxiety and mainly type 2 diabetes. There are several theories to explain the relationship between them. Some researchers suggest that common etiological background may play a role in their co-occurrence, some believe that the diagnosis of diabetes and the burden of self-management lead to anxiety, while others – investigating the relationship from the opposite direction – suggest that anxiety leads to diabetes through physiological mechanisms. Independently of the direction of the relationship, screening for anxiety and timely treatment among diabetic patients may decrease the risk of complications, the difficulty in treatment arising from the co-occurrence of these two conditions and may improve patients’ quality of life and adherence to therapy.

Alert to the pitfalls of analytical approaches that either privilege over-arching structural explanations—like those favoured by Durkheim—or, conversely, give too much credence to individual agency and psychology, my analysis here attempts to chart a course through these polarities. It does so by drawing both on Ian Hacking’s ‘ecological niche’ metaphor—to explore how particular configurations of events and circumstances, at different times, might render suicide related behaviour more or less likely among different groups; and on Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of the ‘habitus’—to consider how particular sets of bodily dispositions might generate certain styles of attempted suicide and self-harm.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/006996671104600206", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081436507", "source": "openalex"}

In 2007, violence was one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States for people from birth to age 64 years. Violence takes many forms, such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, self-directed violence, and youth violence. Violence may be best understood and prevented through a public health approach. A focus is placed on preventing violence before it occurs (primary prevention), employing a scientific approach to understand the problem and what action can be taken to prevent it, taking a population perspective that places an emphasis on broad-based changes in communities and society that benefit the largest number of people, and working across sectors (eg, health, justice, education) and integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines (eg, epidemiology, psychology, sociology, medicine). In this article, the authors review the incidence and burden of different forms of violence and the factors that place people at risk for, or protect people from, experiencing violence either as a victim or as a perpetrator. The authors also review strategies based on the best available evidence that may be implemented to prevent violence from occurring, highlighting violence prevention tools for health practitioners. By understanding the burden of violence, the factors that place people at risk for and protect people from experiencing violence, and strategies that can prevent and interrupt violence, health practitioners can play a more active role in enhancing the health and safety of their patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1559827611409127", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2050768073", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027252381", "title": "Working at the World Health Organization: An international perspective on mental health nursing", "text": "In August 2003 I was appointed Technical Officer with the Mental Health Policy and Service Development Team within the Department of Mental Health and Substance Dependence at the World Health Organi­zation (WHO). It is an exciting time at WHO. The World Health Assembly has affirmed its commitment to WHO's Global Action Programme for Mental Health. The international health community is increasingly recognizing that mental disorders are a major public health issue. Neuropsychiatric disorders contribute 12% to the total global burden of disease with an estimated 450 million people worldwide affected by a mental, neurological or behavioural problem. The impact of mental disorders is likely to increase over the next 15 years with unipolar major depression expected to become the second highest cause of disease burden by the year 2020 (World Health Organization 2001). Developing countries are likely to face a disproportionate increase in this burden. The economic consequences of mental disorders for both the individual and the community are substantial. People with mental disorders face widespread stigma and discrimination (World Health Organization 2003). It is not surprising that the treatment and prevention of mental disorders and the promotion of mental health is a WHO priority. Mental health nursing can make an important contribution to the aims and objectives of WHO. Mental health nurses are at the forefront of the treatment and care of people with a mental disorder. They are major contri­butors to the promotion of mental health and the pre­vention and early intervention of mental disorders. Unfortunately, in most countries mental health nurses do not have a high profile at a policy level despite the fact that they are the backbone of mental health care. Many countries have only a fledgling (if any) mental health nursing workforce. Mental health nurses from industrialized countries need to support their colleagues in developing countries to ensure that there is an ­appropriately trained workforce available in all countries. However, the worldwide shortage of mental health nurses often results in the movement of mental health nurses from developing countries to industrialized nations. So rather than being supported, developing countries have their mental health nursing work­force depleted by wealthier nations. For those of you who may be interested in this issue, a discussion paper on nurse mobility was recently released by the Inter­national Council of Nurses and can be accessed at http:www.icn.chIntNursemobility%20final.pdf. Research is essential to health policy to ensure that decisions are based on facts rather than political expediency or ideology (Whiteford 2001). Unfortunately mental health nursing research is underdeveloped. Too few mental health nurses engage in research, and of those that do, the majority undertake small projects that have limited generalisability beyond the setting in which it was conducted. Many good quality projects are not published, or publication is restricted to the nursing liter­ature. Participation in large multidisciplinary projects is often limited to research assistance with little opportunity to influence the broader research goals (and indeed little recognition of nurses contribution). We must develop and grow our research culture if mental health nursing is to effectively influence policy. It is also essential that we promote mental health nursing among our general nursing colleagues. While mental health nursing is a specialty area, many general nurses are involved in the care and treatment of people with a mental disorder. A significant proportion of people with a physical disorder also have a comorbid mental disorder. As well, general nurses are important in the identification and appropriate referral of patients with a mental disorder. We need to assist general nurses to develop skills to respond to the mental health needs of their patients. One of the important projects at WHO that I am involved in is the Mental Health Policy Project. The WHO Mental Health Policy and Service Guidance Package has been developed. It comprises a series of modules on issues such as the service organization, policy development, financing, legislation, advocacy and quality improvement. These are available at http:www.who.intmentalhealthresourcespublicationsen. A number of international, regional, subregional and national training forums have been conducted to assist policy makers and mental health professionals. The Mental Health Policy Project also provides technical assistance directly to countries to support mental health policy, legislation and service development. A ‘Faculty of Consultants’ is being developed to provide training workshops and technical assistance to countries. I look forward to the challenges in my role and to the opportunity to contribute a mental health nursing ­perspective to this important work.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1447-0349.2003..x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027252381", "source": "openalex"}

Under the host country's laws, the refugees are not usually permitted to work, and often children aren't allowed to attend local schools.The combination of dislocation, poverty, enforced idleness, and an uncertain future have taken a serious toll on these displaced individuals. Zeinab Hijazi: \"One child went from drawing his destroyed house to drawing his dream house.\"\"The Iraqi refugees are not located in separate camps but live in towns and cities, often in hiding from the authorities,\" explained Zeinab Hijazi, the International Medical Corps' (IMC) program director for mental health in Lebanon. The IMC, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is an international nongovernmental organization providing both acute and long-term medical and psychosocial help following disasters.It is one of several nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Medicins Sans Frontieres, working with refugees in the region. The Syrian and Jordanian governments also provide some support for refugees within their boundaries.Hijazi's work in mental health care came about because of a different war in the Middle East. Born in Los Angeles to Lebanese parents, she grew up in the United States, France, and Lebanon, where she earned a B.A. degree in architecture from the American University of Beirut.After the 2006 war in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah fighters, she wanted to do something to help civilians whose homes and livelihoods were destroyed. She met Lynne Jones, M.D., an IMC-affiliated psychiatrist (Psychiatric News, March 17, 2006), who found a role for Hijazi creating \"child-friendly spaces,\" a process helped by her interior-design training. There children could play but also could express their feelings through art.\"One child went from drawing his destroyed house to drawing his dream house,\" Hijazi recounted in an interview.After the acute postwar phase passed, she helped in the transition of the children's spaces to community centers that could offer vocational training, psychosocial help, and some basic hygiene and sanitation aid. In southern Lebanon, the IMC worked to link schools and clinics to reduce the stigma of needing and seeking help for mental health problems.Psychiatrists and psychologists from the American University of Beirut have helped train primary care clinicians to screen and refer patients with mental health needs in a program now certified by Lebanon's Ministry of Health.In 2007 Hijazi's work expanded to include Iraqi refugees, first in five regions in Lebanon, and later in Syria and Jordan.Many live hand-to-mouth and in fear of expulsion by local authorities, although that is less so in Syria than in Jordan or Lebanon, said Hijazi.\"In the southern suburbs of Beirut, Iraqi refugees are confined to a two-block radius of their homes,\" she told a group of nongovernmental organizations working on Iraqi refugee issues in Washington, D.C., in early April. \"That means setting up clinics within neighborhoods or using mobile outreach units.\"The IMC's work among the Iraqi refugees began in 2007, when there were 55,000 of them in Lebanon, 500,000 in Jordan, and 1.2 million in Syria; the organization is in the process of updating those figures. Besides offering basic medical care and mobile medical units for outreach and home care, the IMC sought to provide some secondary health care and follow-up services—including psychosocial interventions—to these refugees.However, the IMC did not want to simply parachute in Western ideas and values, which could have a negative impact, said Hijazi. Any intervention had to be developed with an understanding of different cultures, whose views on behavior and on mental health and illness vary widely, both from Western norms and according to indigenous religious or ethnic groupings.International aid agencies have poorly integrated psychosocial elements into humanitarian work in the past, but that has begun to change, said Hijazi. Basic needs—food, water, shelter, medical care—have to be addressed first in emergencies, then a variety of social, community, and personal supports must be added as time passes and other needs become apparent.Within that framework, the IMC's goal is to prepare Iraqi refugees for return to Iraq when that becomes possible, as well as for reconciliation between factions there and reconstruction of the country, said Hijazi.For a start, that has meant integrating mental health into primary care by training general practitioners in the tools and skills needed to identify cases, treat mental disorders of low or moderate severity, and know when to refer more complex cases for further evaluation and treatment.Doctors participating in the 12-day theoretical training course begin by studying the social psychology of displacement, then move on to screening, diagnosis, and referral, as well as training in the use of psychotropic medications and cognitive-behavioral therapy.Trainers then accompany the physicians back to the clinic, where they observe how the physicians put the training into action and relate to patients. The organization also recruited psychologists and social workers to go into the homes of refugees, lessening the stigma of and reducing barriers to going to a clinic for mental health care.The IMC also implemented nonspecific activities that had psychological benefits. Because the refugees were scattered within towns, and often in hiding, there were few social focal points where they could gather. Hijazi set up spaces where the children could play. Their mothers then gathered spontaneously into what were effectively support groups to chat and interact. Cooking classes for the women served a similar function.Outreach to men has proved more difficult, said Hijazi.\"We have tried support groups, but they didn't work, so now in Jordan we have begun using home-based services to reach them,\" she said.\" In Lebanon, we are setting up father-son sports activities.\"Since refugee men are not allowed to work in the host country, many have lost their central role in their family, community, and society. Many have become depressed and anxious, and that has at times led to domestic violence against wives or children, she said. Many people have also suffered trauma and have posttraumatic stress disorder.In each clinic serving the refugees, the IMC supports a local psychologist and psychiatrist who offer care free of charge. It also provides continuing medical education for Iraqi doctors to allow them to maintain their skills in preparation for the time when they return home.The IMC neither encourages nor discourages Iraqi refugees to return to Iraq. Many could not do so if they wanted to. However, the group does offer information sessions to help them better assess that possibility.Information about the IMC's mental health program is posted at<http://imcworldwide.org/section/programs/mental_health>.▪ ISSUES NewArchived", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1176/pn.44.9.0004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009628211", "source": "openalex"}

Activities that are not perceived to obviously and directly contribute to profits could be sacrificed. This paper argues that WHP must remain centre-stage because of the rights of workers to a healthy, safe working environment but also because of WHP's beneficial financial implications for enterprises. Capacity building for WHP can be developed even within a recessionary environment, particularly if the focus is on the wider workforce, described here as people for whom workplace health promotion may not be their primary function but who have an important role to play in health improvement in workplaces. There is a strong case for the development of the wider workforce based both on the lack of suitably qualified specialists and on the practicalities of having WHP implemented within organizations, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs make up a very significant proportion of the global economy and are identified as a priority area for action internationally. An example of an e-learning course, the Healthy Together programme, developed by a partnership of three countries, is discussed as an approach that has potential to develop capacity for WHP in the current climate. The findings of the evaluation of the Healthy Together programme indicate that there is a real potential in developing e-learning materials for training those with a brief for promoting workplace health and safety in SMEs. Although modifications in some aspects of delivery identified in the evaluation of the pilot course need to be considered, the course was well received, and was reported to be relevant to the learning needs of students, to their workplaces and specifically to small businesses in rural areas. Specific features of the e-learning approach increase its potential to address capacity building for WHP.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975909356629", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118920399", "source": "openalex"}

A pandemic is a problem of public health and occupational medicine since healthcare workers are at the forefront of the fight against the epidemic for the health and life of the population and are themselves at extreme risk. On issues of labor protection and the health of healthcare workers, most women, there are a lot of works; there is ILO Nursing personnel Convention No. 149: Recognize their contribution, address their needs (1977), ratified by Russia. The profession is characterized by the exposure to biological agents, stress, physical loads, etc., causing physical health problems (including reproductive and newborn health), disorders of mental health and social well-being. The weakening of immunity towards the end of the working day was observed among employees of the sanitary and epidemiological surveillance services, maternity hospitals, as well as ambulances and burn centers. In general, the working conditions of the main professions of healthcare workers in the literature are assessed as harmful (classes 3.2-3.3) according to the criteria of Guidelines R 2.2.2006-05, and in an epidemic under conditions of increased loads, stress, the use of PPE and other, their working conditions can be assessed as very harmful and extreme (classes 3.4-4). The official statistics on the morbidity and mortality of healthcare workers is absent, although the media note their elevated rates. Among the preventive measures, vaccination, a regimen of work and rest, multivitamins, and others are recommended; workplaces ought to be organized as to avoid work nearby and opposite each other. It should be borne in mind that PPE, while protecting, can simultaneously create new risks (ILO, 2001). Strengthening the safety and health of healthcare workers in such emergencies is already recognized in Russia as a priority and provided with increased social protection.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31089/1026-9428-2021-61-1-49-61", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127456768", "source": "openalex"}

Previous research indicates that exposure to the idealized thin media standard of female beauty can contribute to body dissatisfaction, negative self-perception, depressed mood, and disordered eating. Importantly, studies have revealed that social comparison processes underlie this negative media effect: Women routinely compare themselves with the encountered mass-mediated thin ideals, which, in turn, elicits negative consequences. While there are a multitude of studies on this topic, little is known about how this negative effect can be counteracted. We tested whether watching an awareness intervention video highlighting the artificial nature of mass-mediated idealized female beauty reduces social comparison processes in a subsequent situation. As a replication of previous research, we found that exposure to the awareness intervention material reduced social comparison processes. Supplementary analysis revealed that this effect was mediated through a change in the ideal self: Watching the awareness material elicited a more realistic perception of the specific body that individuals ideally wanted to possess. This more realistic ideal-self standard, in turn, reduced social comparison processes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-1105/a000181", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2527129411", "source": "openalex"}

This study aimed to explore the impact of Second Chance Schools (SCS) and the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and self-image of Greek SCS students. A total of 251 SCS students from two consecutive study cycles participated, completing the research instruments at the beginning and end of their studies. Participants' anxiety, depressive symptomatology, well-being, self-esteem and self-efficacy were evaluated by means of the GAD-7, PHQ-8, WHO-5 Well-being Index, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, respectively. The research spanned three years, including a year of universal lockdown, a year with protective measures and a year without anti-COVID-19 measures. Factor analysis, regression analyses and two two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were applied to the collected data. All five psychological dimensions measured by the study's instruments were grouped into two factors, namely mental health and self-image. Well-being positively influenced mental health, while anxiety and depression had a negative impact. On the other hand, self-efficacy and self-esteem positively contributed to self-image. Mental health and self-image were moderately correlated. Pre-SCS values of mental health and self-image predicted a higher percentage of variance in post-SCS values compared to anxiety, depression, well-being, self-efficacy and self-esteem. Moreover, mental health improved after the completion of SCS, but only for participants after the lifting of anti-COVID-19 measures. Conversely, self-image improved for all participants regardless of the presence of anti-COVID-19 measures. Overall, the SCS had a considerable impact on the participants' mental health and self-image, although the effect was influenced by COVID-19.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci13081203", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4385834934", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the rapid development of diagnostic tools and treatments in most areas of medicine, our understanding of mental disorders and their treatment has made limited progress during the last decades. While recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have a large potential, the complexity and multidimensionality of the brain processes hinder the discovery of disease mechanisms that would link genetic findings to clinical symptoms and behaviour. This applies also to schizophrenia, for which genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic risk loci, spanning hundreds of genes with diverse functionalities. Importantly, the multitude of the associated variants and their prevalence in the healthy population limit the potential of a reductionist functional genetics approach as a stand-alone solution to discover the disease pathology. In this review, we outline the key concepts of a \"Biophysical Psychiatry\", an approach that employs large-scale mechanistic, biophysics-founded computational modelling to increase transdisciplinary understanding of the pathophysiology and strive toward robust predictions. We discuss recent scientific advances that allow a synthesis of previously disparate fields of psychiatry, neurophysiology, functional genomics, and computational modelling to tackle open questions regarding the pathophysiology of heritable mental disorders. We argue that the complexity of the increasing amount of genetic data exceeds the capabilities of classical experimental assays and requires computational approaches. Biophysical Psychiatry, based on modelling diseased brain networks using existing and future knowledge of basic genetic, biochemical and functional properties on single neuron to microcircuit level, may allow a leap forward in deriving interpretable biomarkers and move the field toward novel treatment options.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00534", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2957195417", "source": "openalex"}

Higher levels of negative and disorganized schizotypy were associated with worse mental health. Separate regression analyses for women and men showed that the pattern for women was the same as for the total sample, whereas only disorganized schizotypy predicted mental health (negative relation) for men.

This paper synthesizes a substantial body of research which suggests that a deficit in the domain-general perceptual learning process of invariant detection in ASD can lead to a cascade of consequences in different developmental domains.

Kesehatan mental menurut seorang ahli kesehatan Merriam Webster, merupakan suatu keadaan emosional dan psikologis yang baik, dimana individu dapat memanfaatkan kemampuan kognisi dan emosi, berfungsi dalam komunitasnya, dan memenuhi kebutuhan hidupnya sehari-hari.

Social support is the presence of certain people who personally provide advice, motivation, direction and show a way out when individuals experience problems and when they experience obstacles in carrying out activities in a directed manner to achieve goals (Bastaman, in Fatwa, 2014). Mental health according to a health expert Merriam Webster, is a good emotional and psychological state, where individuals can utilize their cognitive and emotional abilities, function in their community, and meet their daily needs. The data collection used in this study is the goggle form. From the data we received, there were 83 respondents who were willing to fill out the goggle form we distributed. Then the data is processed using quantitative methods, with Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS applications.&#x0D; The results showed a value of sig = 0.045 which means, there is enough statistical evidence to conclude that the relationship between social support and health did not occur by chance or arguably balanced. The study also showed that, on average, the health rate of adolescent boys is higher than adolescent girls. However, the average level of social support of adolescent girls is higher than that of adolescent boys.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.61994/jcss.v1i1.135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4390453621", "source": "openalex"}

With the QualityRights program, World Health Organisation highlights that one of element founding the quality of services is the respect for users' rights, in the belief that there is no quality of care without respect for human rights and vice versa. To date, studies explored the issue mainly in Europe. In this sense, the purpose of the study is to verify if the perception of respect for patients' rights is a component of organisational well-being for mental health workers in three countries of Latin America (Argentina, Colombia, Peru). A random sample representative of professionals working in three mental healthcare networks in Argentina, Colombia, and Peru was enrolled (n = 310). Each health worker completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic data and the Well-Being at work and respect for human rights (WWRR). The WWRR consists of seven items on satisfaction at work, beliefs about users' satisfaction in received care, the satisfaction of work's organisation, respect of users' and staff's human rights, adequacy of resources, and perceived needs of resources in the mental health service. The principal components analysis of the instrument was carried out with Varimax rotation and Kaiser normalisation (including all components with Eigen value > 1). The total explained variance was 67.2%. Item 6 saturated in one single factor, and the first five items saturated in factor 1 with factor loadings ranging from 0.52 to 0.86.

The prognosis of patients with BS depends on the clinical type, cardiac arrest, syncope or if asymptomatic. The ratio of the asymptomatic group varies from 56.9% to 63.6% and, furthermore, their annual cardiac event rate is relatively lower at 0.24-3.6% compared with the cardiac arrest group. Patients with a drug-induced Brugada-type ECG have a poor prognosis if they had a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or aborted sudden cardiac death, because their risk becomes similar to that of patients with spontaneous Brugada-type ECG. They have the disturbance of the Na+-channel and the electrophysiologic substrate of VF, proven by the high inducibility of VF by stimulation test even in patients without spontaneous VF. Spontaneous VF will never occur if there is no VF substrate.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2794208103", "title": "Chance of response to an antidepressant: what should we say to the patient?", "text": "Talking with patients appropriately is considered as one of the key competences of psychiatrists. “I would like to prescribe you the antidepressant X against your depression. According to available evidence, it will be helpful for one in five patients of your type”. This seems to be the truth according to meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews1, 2. Numbers needed to treat (NNTs) are considered as an illustrative and rather exactly calculable result of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses which can easily be understood and communicated. Still, a communication as mentioned above would sound disastrous to the patient. But, would it be ethical to withhold this information, although the doctor is well aware of it? The World Health Organization considers “health-related education and information” as an “underlying determinant of health”3. Most developed countries provide detailed legal frameworks on the duty of physicians to inform patients comprehensively on suggested treatments, and failure to do so might entail legal consequences. Within the last decades, patient's rights have been increasingly strengthened in many countries, and jurisdiction has outlined explicitly in how much detail patients must be informed. Ethically, the respect for patient's autonomy requires informed consent for all medical procedures. On the other hand, the ethical principles of “beneficence” and “non-maleficence” demand that physicians should do what is helpful for their patients and avoid what might have negative consequences without further benefit4. Giving hope is one of the most powerful instruments of doctors, and that applies particularly to depression, a condition in which hopelessness is a key symptom5. The role of unspecific factors in the treatment of depression is indicated by the high placebo response in drug trials. On average, 36% of patients receiving placebo reached the defined “response” criterion in antidepressant trials after the year 2000, whilst the corresponding rate under antidepressant treatment was 46%6. Analyses show that the placebo effect has even increased within past decades, possibly due to heightened expectations of clinicians and patients6. Vice versa, a higher chance and subsequent expectation to receive a placebo in antidepressant trials decreases the placebo effect7. Hence, communications as the above mentioned that diminish or even intentionally erode expectations are likely to decrease the chance of a good outcome and thus mean harm for the patient. This poses a difficult ethical dilemma between the duty to inform the patient before obtaining informed consent and the necessity to provide the best available therapy which, in this case, includes giving hope. Help for the clinician in reconciling this dilemma comes from an unexpected source: from statistics. The basic question is whether the NNT does indeed indicate how many patients respond to a certain treatment and how many do not. This is suggested by the term and rarely questioned. However, what NNTs are and what they are not has been recently clarified7. Valid response rates are mostly unknown and difficult to determine. Actually, repeated individual cross-over testing would be required to eliminate several sources of variance and determine the real response rate. Recently, it could be demonstrated that even in mice the response rate under treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was significantly dependent on the circumstances of the environment8. In everyday practice, key predictors of the individual response rate are in fact the “health care system” and the variable “doctor”7. And this brings us back to our initial discussion: whether an antidepressant works in the next episode is not only dependent on the results of available RCTs, but also on the circumstances under which the treatment takes place, and, least but not last, what the doctor himself says or does. RCTs are conducted under defined circumstances with the control group receiving considerable psychological attention and support through study workers. This is a common explanation for the small observed effect sizes in those studies. NNTs are an abstract measure which is based on arbitrary dichotomous definitions of “response”, “recovery” or whatsoever, calculated from the differences between drug response and placebo response in these trials under artificial conditions. Even if we assume that all patients benefit from a certain therapy to an identical degree, some of them would achieve the defined “response” or “recovery” threshold and others would not, depending on the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention and the individual baseline level. This is substantially different from interventions with dichotomous outcomes, e.g. death vs. recovery. In conditions with a dimensional character, which is the nature of most mental disorders, remission rates do not indicate individual ben efit. Therefore, NNTs are basically a statistical construct which allows us to determine easily in illustrative figures how effective an intervention is and whether one is more effective than another. But they do not at all indicate an individual likelihood of a positive outcome. Thus, the clinician's dilemma can be solved successfully: never use NNTs or response rates to explain chances and risks to patients.

Psychiatrists frequently lead in communicating a diagnosis but little is known about the factors that could contribute to potential disparities between actual and best practice with regard to diagnostic disclosure. A clearer understanding of psychiatrists’ subjective experiences of disclosure is therefore needed to improve adherence to best practice guidelines and ensure that diagnostic disclosure facilitates living well with dementia. Methods: This study utilized qualitative methodology. Semi-structured interviews conducted with 11 psychiatrists were analyzed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: Three superordinate and nine subordinate themes emerged from the data analysis. These included the following: (i) “The levels of well-being” (Continuing with life, Keeping a sense of who they are, Acceptance of the self), (ii) “Living well is a process” (Disclosure can set the scene for well-being, Positive but realistic messages, Whose role it is to support well-being?), and (iii) Ideal care versus real care (Supporting well-being is not prioritized, There isn't time, The fragmentation of care). Conclusions: Findings indicate that psychiatrists frame well-being in dementia as a multi-faceted biopsychosocial construct but that certain nihilistic attitudes may affect how well-being is integrated into diagnostic communication. Such attitudes were linked with the perceived threat of dementia and limitations of post-diagnostic care.

A representative sample ( N = 1,481) of Spanish coaches (18.1% women, mean age = 32.98 years, SD = 11.60) completed a battery of questionnaires. Results showed that, in comparison with the general workforce, coaches showed statistically significant differences in most of the PWE areas assessed. The emotional demands experienced by coaches are a health risk, while trust regarding management and recognition are positive features in their PWE. Coaches’ emotional demands were associated with low mental-health scores and higher levels of behavioral-stress symptoms and burnout, whereas social community at work and role clarity were protective factors for health.

The disease is rarely diagnosed, patients are often observed with an erroneous diagnosis of chronic cerebrovascular disease (chronic cerebral ischemia, discirculatory encephalopathy) and do not receive the necessary treatment. It is relatively rare for AD patients to receive advice on non-drug therapies that include cognitive stimulation, cognitive training, regular physical activity, and antioxidant-rich nutrition. Anti dementic agents are rarely prescribed to patients: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and memantine, an NMDA receptor blocker. Only a relatively small percentage of people who developed Alzheimer’s disease receive effective antidement therapy. This may be due to the fact that AD is not diagnosed or is diagnosed at more advanced stages of the disease when antidement therapy is not so effective, or that doctors do not have sufficient knowledge about antidement drugs and, finally, that the price of drugs is relatively high and the prescribing process for preferential provision of drugs is rather complicated. Unfortunately, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are often unreasonably prescribed to patients with AD, the use of which impairs cognitive functions. The article presents a clinical observation of a relatively young patient with AD, who was followed up for a long time with an erroneous diagnosis of discirculatory encephalopathy. The issues of optimizing the management of AD patients in our country are discussed, and the data of the Cochrane review on the use of donepezil at different stages of the disease are analyzed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21518/2079-701x-2020-19-23-28", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3111782919", "source": "openalex"}

Their contact with health care is often crisis-driven and mediated through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a psychosocial intervention recommended by the World Health Organisation to address distress experienced by adults affected by humanitarian crises. We are investigating its application for the first time in a high-income country.In a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), PM+ will be delivered to AS&Rs in contact with NGOs in Liverpool City Region, UK by lay therapists who have lived experience of forced migration. Following systematic review and stakeholder engagement, PM+ has been adapted to the local context, and lay therapists have been trained in its delivery. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of five 90-min sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups by lay therapists to AS&Rs experiencing emotional distress and functional impairment, compared with each other and with usual support offered by local NGOs. Distress and impairment at baseline will be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). We aim to recruit 105 participants, 35 per arm. Primary health outcomes are anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months, measured by HADS. Secondary outcomes include subjective wellbeing, functional status, progress on identified problems, presence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorder and service usage. Longer-term impact will be assessed at 6 months post baseline, on the same parameters. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in relation to the following elements: recruitment and retention of lay therapists and study participants; fidelity of delivery of PM+; and suitability of the study measures, including any linguistic or cultural barriers.We will use these findings to specify the parameters for a full RCT to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PM+ in reducing emotional distress and health inequalities, and improving functional ability and wellbeing, amongst asylum seekers and refugees.ISRCTN, ID: ISRCTN15214107.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1994435010", "title": "The fickle fates of push and pull in the dissemination of mental health programs for children.", "text": "As the demand for evidence-based programs has increased, considerable research has concentrated on the development and testing of innovative and promising prevention and treatment programs. However, a knowledge gap remains between research in children's mental health and the educational and health services providers who could use the programs produced. In contrast to the elaborate national system set up for monitoring and disseminating medications, the infrastructures to support the evaluation and dissemination of prevention and treatment programs targeting children's mental health have only begun to be developed. Based on my experiences in a community-based research project that has worked for the last decade to develop and evaluate the WITS (Walk away, Ignore, Talk it out, and Seek help) programs for the prevention of peer victimization, I illuminate obstacles to the dissemination of evidence-based prevention programs for children and solutions that are beginning to address these obstacles. In particular, I argue that enduring, integrated community, provincial and federal infrastructures are needed to improve program dissemination and to monitor their effects on children's well-being. Keywords: knowledge transfer, diffusion of innovation, mental health, children adolescence The reality that children and adolescents suffer from mental health problems is no longer questioned. There is also no doubt that the social, emotional and behavioural problems that are symptomatic of their mental health problems can have pervasive consequences for healthy child development: childhood and adolescent mental illnesses can disrupt school readiness and academic achievement; compromise relationships with family, teachers and peers; undermine attention; exacerbate physical complaints, and even damage the architecture of the developing brain (Gunner, 2007; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000; Tolan & Dodge, 2005). The fact that few children who have mental health problems receive the care that they need is also widely recognised. Canadian and United States data indicates that only 5-18% of children with a diagnosable psychological problem receive any form of treatment (Kirby & Keon, 2006; Tolan & Dodge, 2005). Two widely circulated reports Out of the Shadows at Last: Highlights and Recommendations of the Final Report on Mental Health, Mental Illness and Addiction (Kirby & Keon, 2006) and Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 1999) make clear that early detection of childhood mental health concerns can help to prevent school failure, poor employment opportunities and criminal activities. Considerable research also shows that even prodromal or subclinical symptoms, those that do not meet criteria for diagnosis of a disorder, can affect children's development and their relationships with their parents, peers, teachers, and so forth. However, universal mental health promotion programs or secondary prevention programs addressing these concerns are not widely available. What role can prevention programs play in the gathering momentum to improve children's mental health? Prevention of mental health problems in children shows benefits in reducing treatment costs in the United States (Weissberg, Kumpfer, & Selligman, 2003), but in Canada universal and even secondary prevention programs - particularly involving mental health concerns typically are not widely distributed and their effectiveness and cost savings are not monitored. Indeed, despite extensive research on the development and evaluation of innovative programs, only a few are adopted, often only locally, and typically for only short periods. In this paper, I argue that there are serious obstacles embedded in our traditional reliance on relationships between individual researchers and service providers for the development and dissemination of evidence-based programs to promote children's mental health and prevent illness. …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0020486", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994435010", "source": "openalex"}

The introduction of the IoT in psychology has resulted in various intelligent systems that aim to help people—particularly those with special needs, such as the elderly, disabled, and children. This paper proposes a framework to investigate the role and impact of the IoT in psychology from two perspectives: (1) the goals of using the IoT in this area, and (2) the computational technologies used towards this purpose. To this end, existing studies are reviewed from these viewpoints. The results show that the goals of using the IoT can be identified as morale improvement, diagnosis, and monitoring. Moreover, the main technical contributions of the related papers are system design, data mining, or hardware invention and signal processing. Subsequently, unique features of state-of-the-art research in this area are discussed, including the type and diversity of sensors, crowdsourcing, context awareness, fog and cloud platforms, and inference. Our concluding remarks indicate that this area is in its infancy and, consequently, the next steps of this research are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities5030060", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4296097686", "source": "openalex"}

We made use of the natural language processing and large-scale Twitter data to explore this in depth, identifying emotions in COVID-19 news content and user reactions to it, and how these evolved over the course of the pandemic. We focused on major UK news channels, constructing a dataset of COVID-related news tweets (tweets from news organisations) and user comments made in response to these, covering Jan 2020 to April 2021. Natural language processing was used to analyse topics and levels of anger, joy, optimism, and sadness. Overall, sadness was the most prevalent emotion in the news tweets, but this was seen to decline over the timeframe under study. In contrast, amongst user tweets, anger was the overall most prevalent emotion. Time epochs were defined according to the time course of the UK social restrictions, and some interesting effects emerged regarding these. Further, correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between the emotions in the news tweets and the emotions expressed amongst the user tweets made in response, across all channels studied. Results provide unique insight onto how the dominant emotions present in UK news and user tweets evolved as the pandemic unfolded. Correspondence between news and user tweet emotional content highlights the potential emotional effect of online news on users and points to strategies to combat the negative mental health impact of the pandemic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7283166", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4323656451", "source": "openalex"}

Design/methodology/approach The mental health laws of four countries were assessed both by country partners and staff of WHO, Geneva, using the World Health Organization (WHO) Checklist on Mental Health Legislation, which examines the level of coverage of key issues in mental health laws. Findings The older laws of Ghana, Uganda and Zambia do not address fundamental human rights of people with mental health conditions. South Africa's more recent Mental Health Care Act (2002) incorporates critical human rights standards, though certain provisions fail to adequately safeguard against potential violations. For mental health legislation to maintain currency with human rights standards it must be regularly reviewed and updated. Originality/value The findings highlight the urgent need to revise the mental health laws of Zambia, Uganda and Ghana, and to plan ways to address the gaps identified in the relatively new South African mental health law. The entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008 signals a new era in how mental health legislation is to be drafted. The identification of gaps in national laws, as has been undertaken by the four countries, is an important first step towards putting in place legal frameworks to promote the rights of people with mental health conditions in line with current international human rights standards.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1108/17465721311304249", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1985298717", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1971361173", "title": "Neighbourhood Peacekeeping: The Inter-American Development Bank's Violence Reduction Programs in Colombia and Uruguay", "text": "Abstract The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) incorporated, nearly a decade ago, violence prevention in its lending portfolio. Since the first citizen security project loan was approved, the IDB has accumulated valuable experience on the design and implementation of violence prevention operations, placing the Bank at the forefront of this type of lending in the region. To date, the IDB has financed more than US$150 million for six citizen security loans, technical cooperation projects, and international seminars and meetings. In addition, several other citizen security projects are in advanced stages of design. This report overviews the Bank's work in this area, analysing, based on available data from completed projects, what works and the challenges that remain in reducing and preventing crime and violence. For example, Colombia (Bogotá) and Uruguay have completed their operations with success in the areas of community policing, institutional strengthening, community mediation units, domestic and youth violence prevention, and social awareness campaigns. This report also presents recommendations to maximise benefits and increase the effectiveness of the interventions in future project loans. Despite the accomplishments in this area, it is important to emphasise that crime and violence prevention is not a ‘one shot deal’ but a process that ought to be sustained over time and governments in the region must fully commit to combat it.

Those young men, who described themselves collectively as the “Unassuming Geeks” had all spent some time in their lives seriously considering suicide. This article focuses on the moment 10 years later, when the same group met together to mourn the loss of one of their members. This text articulates the collective witnessing and writing practice the group used and employs devices borrowed from ancient Greek theatre, together with fictionalized accounts, in an attempt to cultivate a “poetics of insufficiency” and disrupt notions of authenticity within “voices.” In looking back to what was silent/silenced and unsaid in previous work, the edges between therapy, research, and writing are blurred and troubled.

This study documents a paradox: the happiest places have the highest suicide rates. The study combines findings from two large and rich individual‐level data sets—one on life satisfaction and another on suicide deaths—to establish the paradox in a consistent way across U.S. states. It replicates the finding in data on Western industrialized nations and checks that the paradox is not an artifact of population composition or confounding factors. The study concludes with the conjecture that people may find it particularly painful to be unhappy in a happy place, so that the decision to commit suicide is influenced by relative comparisons.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.24148/wp2010-30", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129942132", "source": "openalex"}

Mental health is defined as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. The understanding of the relationship between spirituality and substance use problems has been influenced by various historical factors concerned with the relationship between religion and excessive alcohol consumptionor in the case of Islam, any alcohol consumption.

In this case‐cohort study, cases were all individuals born or residing in Denmark who made a nonfatal suicide attempt during 1995–2015 ( n = 22,974). The comparison subcohort included a 5% random sample of the Danish population on January 1, 1995 ( n = 265,183). Stress disorder diagnoses and suicide attempts were identified using ICD‐10 codes from national medical registries. The presence of any stress disorder substantially increased the rate of suicide attempts versus the comparison subcohort, rate per 100,000 person‐years (PYs) = 604 vs. 13. We observed associations between each type of stress disorder and suicide attempts, hazard ratios ( HR s) = 10.1–37.6, even after adjustment for potential confounders, adjusted HR s = 1.8–8.3, with the strongest associations for adjustment disorder relative to other diagnoses. After adjusting for demographic and health variables, the rate of suicide attempts among individuals with any stress disorder diagnosis was nearly 13 times the suicide attempt rate in the comparison cohort. A bias analysis demonstrated that associations remained robust despite potential differential misclassification of suicide attempts. Study strengths included the use of individual‐level data linked across administrative and medical registries in the setting of universal health care and the use of longitudinal analyses capturing data over 20 years. The study demonstrated associations between the full range of stress disorders and suicide attempts, extending research specific to posttraumatic stress disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22695", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3164823957", "source": "openalex"}

When tested at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg, the methanol extract of S. campanulata (MESC) showed dose-dependent antidepressant activity in the force swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), lithium chloride-induced twitches test and the open field test. In FST and TST, animals treated with MESC demonstrated a significant decrease in the immobility period compared to the control group. The lithium chloride-induced head twitches were significantly reduced following administration of MESC. The latter, at the dose of 400 mg/kg, also significantly reduced locomotor activity. Following administration of MESC, changes in the levels of serum corticosterone, and of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured in different brain regions using HPLC. The presence of spatheoside A (m/z 541) and spatheoside B (m/z 559) in MESC was detected using HPLC/ESI-MS. These two iridoids demonstrated a high predictive binding affinity for the active site of the type A monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) enzyme with scores of 99.40 and 93.54, respectively. These data suggest that S. campanulata flowers warrants further investigation as a source of novel templates for antidepressive drugs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14715/cmb/2021.67.1.1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3134202691", "source": "openalex"}

It incurred substantial costs to societies all over the world. Estimating the medical costs of depression will provide implications for related policies and interventions. However, there is scarce of evidence on the economic costs of depression in China. The aim of this study is to assess depression-related medical service utilisation, the direct medical costs of depression and potential associated factors.This study used data that comprised 5% random sample of claims data from China's Urban Basic Medical Insurance between January 2013 and December 2016. Beneficiaries' demographic information, diagnoses and cost of outpatient and inpatient services were recorded in the data set.26 123 patients with depression were identified as the study population in this study.The information on health service utilisation and cost was extracted based on the condition that depression was claimed as the index disease.From 2013 to 2016, weighted average annual total medical cost of depression in urban China was RMB2706.92, and the annual out-of-pocket cost was RMB786.4. The annual total medical cost of depression among urban residents in China was estimated to be 4.4 billion RMB (95% CI 4.15 to 4.67) (US$ 0.70, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.74). Nearly 65% of medical costs (RMB 1795.7 or US$ 285.0) were accounted by inpatient expenditure, and tertiary hospitals were the main provider of depression treatment. Depression-related medical care utilisation and direct costs were associated with gender, age, insurance status, severity of depression and diagnosis. Medication costs and medical service contributed to 41.7% and 56.6% of the average depression-related medical costs.Depression poses a considerable burden on both the health system and the individual in urban China. Specific policies to strengthen the mental health resources in primary and secondary hospitals are in urgent need, and effective treatment strategies are important to prevent a progression and recurrence of depression, as well as an increase in medical cost.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056422", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4297535566", "source": "openalex"}

Design/methodology/approach In total, 30 interviews were conducted in four mental health organizations which are implementing co-production in the North of Italy. Interviews were conducted with clinicians, nurses, patients and family members. The data collected was triangulated with further sources and official documents of organizations. The results have been compared by means of a validated international framework (IAP2) regarding the contextual factors and the level of co-production adopted. Findings The adoption of co-production in the four cases differs by the activities implemented and how organizations involve informal actors. It seems to be influenced by the contextual factors specific to each organization: power, professionals’ opinions and leadership. Organizations whose practitioners and leaders are willing to distribute their power and value informal actors’ opinions seem to facilitate the systematic involvement of users.

All clinically used antidepressant drugs suffer from very serious side effect (e.g. suicidal thoughts) and require about six weeks before the full therapeutic effect occurs [2]. In our search for possible leads to control depression we have investigated three Florida sponges: Verongula rigida, Smenospongia aurea and S. cerebriformis. Several known compounds were isolated and evaluated in the porsolt forced swim test and chick anxiety-depression model. Among the examined metabolites, 5,6-dibromo-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (1) exhibited significant antidepressant action while 5-bromo-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (2) caused reduction in locomotor activity, which indicates potential sedative action. This study reveals the potential of marine natural products as leads to control depression. Acknowledgements: We are grateful to Mr. J. Diers for testing (1) in the forced swim test.

Efficient protocols for participant recruitment need to be established for conducting clinical trials. To meet this need, a large‐scale online registry system, the Integrated Registry of Orange Plan (IROOP ® ), was created for healthy individuals. Although the risk factors for dementia have been discussed in our previous studies for a short interval of 6 months, some factors remain controversial. The present study aimed to explore factors affecting longitudinal changes in cognitive function for a longer interval of 18 months using the IROOP ® data. Methods This study assessed the longitudinal changes in the collated data for predicting the risk of dementia and included 473 individuals (175 men and 298 women; mean age 59.6 ± 10.1 years) registered in the IROOP ® between July 5, 2016 and January 15, 2018 who completed the initial questionnaire and brief assessment of cognitive function (Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen) at baseline and the regular questionnaire and the Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen at least once after baseline. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS, version 23.0, for Windows for demographic data and the MIXED procedure in SAS, version 9.4, for the linear mixed‐effect model. In each analysis, the statistical significance level was set at P &lt; .05. Results Mood, sleep, quality of life, and medical histories including cognition were found to influence longitudinal changes in cognitive function. Discussion Given the multifactorial etiology of dementia, preventive measures targeting multiple domains are required for maintaining cognitive function, instead of focusing on one lifestyle factor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trci.2019.06.003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2965829574", "source": "openalex"}

While most children are likely to return to school when they reopen, quite a few may drop out. In addition, the economic recession generated by the crisis will affect livelihoods, leading to higher rates of poverty and food insecurity. This also may have negative impacts on both Catholic schools and their students. This paper, the second in a set of two, looks at likely impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on Catholic Schools in developing countries, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa, a vulnerable region given the comparatively weak performance of its education systems and the limited availability of resources for governments to protect education budgets (acknowledging that many Catholic schools in the region are public schools). How Catholic schools will be able to respond to the twin challenges of school closures and the economic downturn may affect their comparative advantage for the medium term.

Scientists from different countries have made attempts to study the influence of psychological, social, cultural, ethnic, and geographical factors on the spread of tuberculosis and the effectiveness of its treatment. But so far little is known about personal or sociocultural factors that lead to a violation of treatment compliance, which significantly actualises the problems stated in this article. The relevance of the study is also determined by the fact that all measures currently used for treating tuberculosis do not lead to its complete eradication and elimination of the epidemic in the world as well as in the Russian Federation. The purpose of this work was to study the psychosocial characteristics of TB patients in Russia and their interrelationships, which will provide an opportunity to predict the patients’ behaviour in a disease situation and their treatment compliance. The study involved 1600 respondents aged 19-60 years: 800 women and 800 men, residents of Samara (Russia), of which 800 persons were TB patients and the other 800 were conditionally healthy. The following psychodiagnostic techniques were used: The World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Questionnaire (core module), The Level of Social Frustratedness Questionnaire, The Neurotic Disorders Questionnaire (Russian modification of H.D. Hansgen’s BVNK-300), M. Bond’s Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ) in Russian adaptation by E. Tunik, The Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WSQ) by S. Folkman and R. Lazarus in a modified and adapted Russian version, The Type of Attitude Towards the Disease (TATD) Questionnaire, and The Level of Compliance Questionnaire. It was found that the TB patients had a significantly decreased quality of life, especially in the spheres of social relations, psychological state and spirituality. Characteristic features of the TB patients in Russia were disorders of the digestive and cardiovascular systems, sleep and motor disorders, affective instability, mental exhaustion, excitability, impaired working ability, fears, and social-psychological maladaptation. The respondents tended to use more maladaptive psychological defence mechanisms. As the leading coping ways for the TB patients, search for social support and acceptance of responsibility were identified. The prevailing types of attitudes toward the disease were characterised by an intrapsychic orientation, causing impaired social adaptation of these patients. The authors constructed regression models of compliance to determine strategies for TB patients psychological support. The results of the study as well as the constructed models can be used for training professional personnel in the field of medicine, clinical psychology, social work and social pedagogy in order to optimise the provision of medical, social, psychological and pedagogical assistance to TB patients in Russia and in other countries of the world: studies show that the factors identified and analysed in this paper are similar in TB patients in different countries, regardless of their geographic location or the level of economic development and cultural features.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-2-330-347", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3039681564", "source": "openalex"}

Supporting Member States in addressing depression and suicide (including under use of eHealth), replacing institutional by community-based,socially-inclusive treatment and care models (including through the use of EU-Structural Funds), strengthening promotion and prevention as core mission of mental health systems are key objectives of EU-mental health policy. Increasing the mental health literacy of citizens and empowering patients are further priorities. Psychiatry plays a key role: where necessary, it needs to strengthen patient-centred treatment models and their practice in the community, engage more in multisectorial cooperation for early interventions, promote social inclusion of people with mental health problems, support other sectors (workplaces, schools, local communities), strengthen ties with other medical disciplines to improve their training on mental health and better treatment of co-morbidity of physical and mental disorders. In 2008, the European Commission launched the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being. Ministers of Health adopted Council Conclusions in 2011. A Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-being co-financed from the EU-Health Programme was launched early 2013, involving more than 20 Member States. The Joint Action will review the scientific evidence and country situations, deliver country-specific policy recommendations and develop a common framework for action on mental health and well-being. Mental health is embedded in the context of EU-health policy on chronic disease.

Thus, the aim of this study was to identify these progressive S-W changes by developing ASID in rats, via repeated exposure to an AS, and compare this ASID-associated sleep phenotype with the sleep phenotype of human depression. To achieve this aim, rats were first recorded for a 6 h period of baseline S-W activity without AS. Then, rats were subjected to 5 days of AS [Day 1: inescapable foot-shock; 5 trials of 3 s foot-shocks (1.0 mA) at 3 min intervals; Days 3-5: 15 trials of 5 s foot-shocks at 45 s intervals]. S-W activity was recorded for 6 h immediately after each AS treatment session. Two days later rats were again recorded for 6 h of S-W activity, but with no exposure to the AS (NASD). Compared to the baseline day: Day 1 of AS (ASD-1) increased wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS) latency, and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep latency, but decreased the total amount of REM sleep; ASD-2 animals remained awake throughout the 6 h S-W recording period; ASD-3, ASD-4, and ASD-5 (ASDs-3-5) decreased wakefulness, SWS latency, and REM sleep latency, but increased the total amount of REM sleep. Interestingly, these results reveal that initial exposure to the AS versus later, repeated exposure to the AS produced opposing S-W changes. On NASD, animals exhibited baseline-like S-W activity, except slightly less REM sleep. These results suggest that repeated AS produces a sleep phenotype that resembles the sleep phenotype of depression in humans, but consistent re-exposure to the AS is required. These results are promising because the methodological simplicity and reversibility of the ASID-associated S-W phenotype could be more advantageous than other animal models for studying the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the expression of ASID.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2013.00015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1967422127", "source": "openalex"}

A Bayesian network (BN) was developed and applied to establish conditional dependence relationships among variables for each individual subject studied. These conditional dependencies represented the different states that patients could experience in relation to suicidal behavior (SB). The clinical sample included 650 mental health patients with mood and anxiety symptomatology. The results mainly indicated that variables within the Bayesian network are part of each patient’s state of psychological vulnerability and have the potential to impact such states and that these variables coexist and are relatively stable over time. These results have enabled us to offer a tool to detect states of psychological vulnerability associated with suicide risk. If we accept that suicidal behaviors (vulnerability, ideation, and suicidal attempts) exist in constant change and are unstable, we can investigate what individuals experience at specific moments to become better able to intervene in a timely manner to prevent such behaviors. Future testing of the tool developed in this study is needed, not only in specialized mental health environments but also in other environments with high rates of mental illness, such as primary healthcare facilities and educational institutions (schools and universities).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.12078/v2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4254217899", "source": "openalex"}

In gynaecological malignancy, ovarian cancer has the highest associated rate of mortality. This study investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of four sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), including dehydroleucodine (Deh), alantolactone (Ala), costunolide (Cos), and parthenolide (Pat), and their effect on DNA methylation in ovarian cancer. The binding of the SLs with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were studied using molecular docking. The in vitro antiproliferative activity was evaluated in human ovarian cancer cell lines. SL-induced pro-apoptotic activity and effect on cell cycles was evaluated using enzymatic assays and flow cytometry. Global DNA methylation and DNMTs activity by SLs were measured using ELISA assays. DNA methylation and expression of tumour suppressor genes MHL1 and PTEN were quantified using pyrosequencing and RT-qPCR, respectively. SLs displayed strong binding to DNMT1, 3A and 3B in silico, with Deh exhibiting the strongest binding. SLs showed cytotoxicity in the order of Deh ≈ Ala > Pat > Cos, induced apoptosis, and arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase. Deh and Ala possessed DNMT inhibitory activity, reduced global and gene-specific DNA methylation, and increased expression of notable MHL1 and PTEN, which could contribute to the induction of apoptosis and cell death. In conclusion, Deh and Ala, possess strong cytotoxicity and hold the exciting potential as novel therapeutic agents in ovarian cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prmcm.2022.100074", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4214837759", "source": "openalex"}

Current measures of patient satisfaction are inadequate. For instance, some do not acknowledge the role of cultural diversity, values, and identities in patient satisfaction. The main purpose of this article is to identify the aspects of an adequate measure of patient satisfaction. A brief review of existing scales is provided. More specifically, a small sample of scales in the following healthcare contexts is critically evaluated: primary care; out-of-hours primary care; outpatient care; nursing care; chronic illness care; integrated elderly care; mental health care; psychiatric care; and compassionate care. Various healthcare settings are explored in order to provide a more holistic overview of patient satisfaction. Drawing on a range of social psychological theories of identity, representation, and action, it is argued that an appropriate measure should be patient-focused and capture patients’ perceptions and experiences of the care they receive; it should be culturally sensitive and consider cultural values; and it should encompass both the physical and psychological dimensions of healthcare. Conclusions provide general recommendations regarding the items that could form part of a new measure of patient satisfaction in healthcare, including a set of generic items that should constitute its backbone. This new universal measure could facilitate more systematic data collection surrounding patient satisfaction as well as the comparison of patient satisfaction in distinct healthcare contexts. A multi-faceted measure of patient satisfaction drawing on social psychological principles will be a pivotal tool for collecting data that are conducive to the improvement of patient quality of care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.53841/bpsspr.2017.19.1.20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2795927194", "source": "openalex"}

Some suicides are like baobab trees—these large and resilient trees grow deep roots for many years, only spreading their limbs above ground once they are firmly established. Like the baobab, when suicide or a suicide attempt occurs, suicidal ideations are well cultivated and have often already been repeatedly planted. Consequently, suicide is often difficult to prevent: once the death seed is planted, it is difficult to recreate life. Every year, more than 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide (1.4% of all deaths), which is approximately 1 person every 40 seconds. These unexpected deaths, predominantly occuring among young and middle-aged adults, have a continuing ripple effect and result in a huge economic, social, and psychological burden for individuals, families, communities, and countries. The complexity of suffering and pain experienced by suicidal individuals and their families, regardless of the success or failure of the suicidal act, is intensified by strong stigmas attached to traditional concepts of sin and eternal damnation. This unfortunate reality emerges in the narrative as a tragic family drama, which is permeated by deep feelings of helplessness. But suicide is preventable. Prevention requires 3 important factors: knowledge, public support, and creation of strategies to enact social change. Now is the time to act and make suicide prevention an imperative goal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/14-201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2257713333", "source": "openalex"}

School closures have threatened children’s ability to learn and later return to school well prepared. The impact of the economic recession is going to be even more devastating: first for students, but also for the ability of some Catholic schools to maintain their enrollment and remain sustainable financially in countries where they do not benefit from government support. This paper, the first in a set of two, looks at some of the likely impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on Catholic Schools in developed countries with a particular focus on the United States, a country not only hard hit by the crisis but also where Catholic schools are especially vulnerable to downturns. While Catholic schools may be able to respond to the immediate challenge of school closures among others through distance learning options, their ability to maintain enrollment during the economic downturn is less clear. How schools will respond to the twin challenges of ensuring learning during school closures and beyond, and remaining affordable for families at a time of economic stress, may affect whether they are able to maintain their comparative advantage. A key aim of the paper is to make Catholic school teachers and leaders aware of some of the discussions on how to respond to the crisis, and provide links to online resources that may be useful.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15365/joce.2301022020", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3024343092", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2331065227", "title": "The ups and downs of bipolar disorder", "text": "FigureBipolar disorder affects 2.6% of all adults, regardless of gender or race. The average age of onset is 25, but symptoms may emerge earlier. In any practice setting, you may be assigned to care for a patient with bipolar disorder. This recurrent mood disorder causes extreme emotional swings—ranging from euphoria to severe, incapacitating depression—with symptoms that can present a challenge to nursing care. In this article, I'll explore the common symptoms of bipolar disorder and how to provide the best care for your patient. Mania and depression roller coaster The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V), defines bipolar disorder as a recurrent mood disorder that includes periods of mania or mixed episodes of mania and depression. People experiencing bipolar disorder may describe their lives as a roller coaster ride that's scary and unpredictable. There are two classifications of bipolar disorder. Bipolar I disorder involves recurrent episodes of mania and depression. A reduced level of mania, called hypomania, characterizes bipolar II disorder. The symptoms for hypomania are the same as for mania, but they're less severe. When the patient is in a manic phase, symptoms of euphoria and elation are common. Other symptoms of mania include overconfidence, hyperverbosity, hyperactivity, irritability, poor judgment, hypersexuality, physical aggression, and diminished sleep and appetite. When the patient is in a depressive phase, feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, and hopelessness; difficulty concentrating; loss of interest in people or activities that usually bring pleasure; fatigue; sleep problems; somatic complaints; and suicidal thoughts prevail. The length of the phases varies, lasting days or weeks. Certain people with bipolar disorder are described as rapid cycling, defined by the DSM-V as four or more mood swings in a single 12-month period. Patients who experience rapid cycling are harder to treat, with women and children more likely to be rapid cyclers. An inherited imbalance The cause of bipolar disorder is multifactorial. Evidence suggests a strong hereditary component. A person with a parent or sibling who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder is four to six times more likely to develop the illness. Scientists are researching commonalities in the genetic patterns of people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database was developed to link visible symptoms of the disorder with common genetic changes. This database may result in finding the gene, or combination of genes, that causes the symptoms of bipolar disorder and help direct future treatment modalities. The mood instability of bipolar disorder is linked to chemical changes. An imbalance of the neurotransmitters that allow smooth transmission of impulses from one neuron to another is associated with the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Inadequate release or faulty storage mechanisms may cause the imbalance. However, the chemical origins of psychiatric disorders are becoming more complex. New neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and glycine, are being studied because of their influence on neuronal cell growth and decreasing manic symptoms. Inflammation can also play a role in the disorder by increasing cytokine levels and decreasing resistance to cortisol. This inflammation may result in the depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder. Brain imaging studies are further assisting scientists to observe what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography allow researchers to study the brain at work. In fact, one study found similar patterns of brain activity in people reporting an unstable mood. Examining changes in the structure and function of the brain can assist with identification of neural circuit biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder. Difficult diagnosis The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is based on the patient's symptoms, course of the illness, and family history when available. Several standardized rating scales can assist with accurate diagnosis and help you identify patients that may need further evaluation and treatment for bipolar disorder. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire is a self-reporting tool that covers the major symptoms of depression. The Clinical Global Impression Scale identifies symptoms of bipolar disorder and the affect they have on activities of daily life. The Young Mania Rating Scale addresses the symptoms of bipolar disorder that an adolescent may experience. In children, diagnosis can be difficult because other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or anxiety disorder, share similar symptoms. In adolescents, hormonal changes can trigger mood swings that may mimic bipolar disorder. Twenty percent of older patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience their first episode after age 50. It may be that minor symptoms occurring before the diagnosis are overlooked in older adults. They may seek treatment when depressed, but the manic symptoms of elevated mood and increased energy may go unreported. In addition, medical problems such as endocrine or electrolyte disturbances, neurologic problems, and adverse reactions to medications can mimic symptoms of bipolar disorder. Treatments in combination Medication therapy is critical for treating bipolar disorder. First-line treatment includes lithium, antiepileptic drugs, and antipsychotics (see Medications used to treat bipolar disorder). Lithium is a simple alkali metal, similar to sodium, which has been used for 50 years to treat bipolar disorder. Although it's effective in managing mood, it has a narrow therapeutic range and can cause various adverse reactions. The effective and safe use of lithium depends on a balance of the patient's plasma lithium level. Frequent monitoring is needed, particularly at the beginning of treatment and with dosage changes. If lithium plasma levels exceed therapeutic dosage ranges, gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue can occur. With increasing levels or toxicity, the patient can experience cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even coma. Lithium is excreted through the kidneys, so effective regulation depends on the patient's kidney function and electrolyte concentration. Hyponatremia can cause lithium retention in the kidneys and quickly lead to toxic levels. In return, high lithium plasma levels can increase renal sodium excretion and lead to hyponatremia. Be aware of any other medications the patient is taking that can affect urine production, such as diuretics, because these medications can alter lithium levels. Long-term lithium use can lead to renal failure, so it's important to monitor the patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine plasma levels.Table: Medications used to treat bipolar disorderAntiepileptic medications also play a key role in treating bipolar disorder. Divalproex stabilizes mood as effectively as lithium, but has adverse reactions such as blood dyscrasia and weight gain. Carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and topiramate are other antiepileptic drugs prescribed for the symptoms of mania and depression that occur in bipolar disorder. Divalproex and carbamazepine require regular blood work to ensure that their levels are within the therapeutic range. These medications are metabolized in the liver, so it's important to routinely monitor liver function. Antipsychotic medications may be utilized alone or in combination with other drugs. Older antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and perphenazine, play a key role in treating the psychotic symptoms that can occur with bipolar disorder. Adverse reactions, such as sedation, seizures, and extrapyramidal effects, can limit compliance with or use of these agents. Newer antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone, can be as effective as the older antipsychotics, but they, too, have their share of unwanted adverse reactions. Insulin resistance (leading to weight gain and diabetes) and ECG abnormalities may limit the use of these medications. Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine, can be used in combination with other medications to treat depression in bipolar disorder. Because these medications can trigger a manic episode, it's important to assess for early symptoms of mania, such as a decreased need for sleep, high energy, or a labile mood. Adverse reactions, from weight gain to life-threatening events, can occur with all of the medications used to treat bipolar disorder. If these reactions cause significant disruption of the patient's quality of life, compliance with treatment may be hampered. And for a patient with bipolar disorder, stopping a medication can be a trigger for relapse. As with other psychiatric disorders, the kindling theory explains the persistence of the symptoms. Reactions or responses to stimuli escalate over time; with each episode, the mood disturbances become more severe and frequent. Preventing relapse and ensuring compliance with treatment will result in a better prognosis and quality of life. Treatment of bipolar disorder is most effective when psychosocial and medication therapies are combined. Psychotherapy, or “talk” therapy, can augment long-term treatment for a patient with bipolar disorder. The patient meets with a psychologist, social worker, or nurse practitioner either alone or in a group to discuss managing the illness, dealing with interpersonal problems, and responding to early symptoms of relapse. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended for a patient who doesn't respond to standard therapy or for whom medications are contraindicated, such as in pregnancy. ECT can be used to effectively treat severe mania and depression, often allowing a person to begin participation in treatment. Your support is needed Because bipolar disorder is a chronic illness, you may encounter patients with this diagnosis in any setting. As with other chronic illness, assess the patient, provide a safe environment, monitor medication effects, and teach the patient about the disorder. Establishing a positive, supportive relationship is the first step in caring for a patient with bipolar disorder. Suicide and homicide are possible dangerous consequences of the poor judgment and sadness that can accompany bipolar disorder. Any mention of the patient killing him or herself or others should be taken seriously. In many states, such threats are legal grounds for involuntary commitment to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Other red flags include feelings of hopelessness or helplessness, extreme anxiety, alcohol or drug abuse, and a personal or family history of suicide attempts. Providing a highly structured, calm environment can prevent or decrease manic symptoms. When caring for a patient with bipolar disorder experiencing a manic episode, turn off the TV or radio, dim the lights, and try to eliminate loud conversation around the patient. Pay attention to sleep patterns because any disturbances can indicate worsening illness. Also monitor the patient's intake and output to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration. It's critical to educate the patient about all aspects of medication therapy. Emphasize the need to take the prescribed medications at the same time each day and under the same circumstances, such as with or without meals. Teach the patient about the expected actions and adverse reactions of prescribed medications. Monitor any adverse reactions and ensure therapeutic ranges with regular testing. Advise the patient that some adverse reactions, such as drowsiness, may improve over time; however, he or she must be careful driving or operating machines until the effects subside. Taking medications is hard for patients with a chronic illness. Talk with the patient about concerns and financial barriers, and instruct him or her to call the prescriber before stopping any medication. A social worker or psychologist may be consulted when planning for care at home or coordinating follow-up appointments. And remember that it's important to include the patient's family and other support systems in care planning and assisting along the road to stability. Understanding and caring Nurses play a critical role in the identification and care of patients with bipolar disorder. Understanding this disorder and how to care for these patients will enhance the quality of the care you provide. cheat sheet Symptoms of bipolar disorderFigureManic phase Feelings of euphoria and elation Overconfidence Hyperverbosity Hyperactivity Hypersexuality Irritability Poor judgment Physical aggression Diminished sleep and appetite Depressive phase Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, and hopelessness Difficulty concentrating Loss of interest in people or activities that usually bring pleasure Fatigue Sleep problems Somatic complaints Suicidal thoughts FigureOn the webFigureGeneral American Psychological Association:http://www.apa.org/topics/bipolar/ Mayo Clinic:http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356 National Alliance on Mental Illness:http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Mental_Illnesses/Bipolar1/Home_-_What_is_Bipolar_Disorder_.htm National Institute of Mental Health:http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml Stanford Bipolar Disorders Clinic:http://bipolar.stanford.edu/bipolar.html In teenagers KidsHealth.org:http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/mental_health/bipolar.html In older adults University of Michigan Depression Center:http://www.depressiontoolkit.org/bipolar/adults.asp key points Nursing considerationsFigure Assess for signs of bipolar disorder in any setting.

This study first uses questionnaires to examine how self-efficacy, satisfaction of basic psychological needs, and adaptive stress may influence wellbeing for a group of asylum-seeking mothers attending a community-based psychosocial program called Welcome Haven. Second, we explore mothers' experiences attending the Welcome Haven program through qualitative interviews. Analysis reveals the importance of relatedness as a predictor of wellbeing as well as the mediating role of adaptive stress between need satisfaction and wellbeing. Further, attending Welcome Haven is associated with reduced adaptive stress and increased wellbeing, which correspond with the thematic analysis showing that attendance at the workshops fostered a sense of belonging through connection with other asylum seekers and service providers as well as empowerment through access to information and self-expression. The results point to the importance of community-based support that addresses adaptive stress and the promotion of social connection as key determinants of wellbeing. Nonetheless, the centrality of pervasive structural stressors asylum seekers experience during resettlement also cautions that relief offered by interventions may be insufficient in the face of ongoing systemic inequality and marginalization.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20227076", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4388761711", "source": "openalex"}

While this represents a positive shift in clinical it also leaves many frontline clinicians, organisations, and policymakers in a state of uncertainty about how to achieve such ideals. What does it mean to be evidence-based? Am I using the research information possible? What constitutes a sound or adequate program evaluation? These questions, and many others like them, receive a wide range of answers by current psychology practitioners. This variability, in part, represents the nascent status of the field and the paucity of research in children's mental health. Notwithstanding these challenges, it is an exciting and important time of transition where practitioners, organisations, and policymakers are all striving toward the realisation of improved child and adolescent mental health interventions. However, much is to be learned as frontline practitioners face the challenge of incorporating new knowledge into daily clinical practice. This journey is a process which will require collaboration across multiple sectors and disciplines, and will inevitably result in some failures and mistakes along the way. Like Dr. Seuss, who was rejected by publishers 27 times before his first book, And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street, was published, persistence in our efforts to implement and build more effective interventions is critical to the success of our work. The current article will attempt to describe my perspective and thoughts as a frontline practitioner on how psychology's unique skill set can be used to build more effective interventions in the children's mental health system. This will include psychology's ability to use the various approaches to evidence-based practice that currently exist in the children's mental health field. In addition to promoting the use of effective approaches, psychology can and should play an increasingly critical role in facilitating the careful implementation of evidence-based practices. Finally, in light of the current state of the field, recommendations for moving forward are provided both from the perspective of a frontline practitioner and from the personal lessons learned through implementing evidencebased programs in a community-based children's mental health centre (Schmidt & Taylor, 2002). Effectiveness of Usual Children's Mental Health Treatment Kutcher (2011) argues that the children's mental health field must move toward best evidence, not best practice, and must use interventions which are right rather than using what feels right. These strong statements by Kutcher arise from the disappointing results found in past reviews of Treatment as Usual (TAU) in the children's mental healm system. As described in past studies, TAU refers to the usual provision of eclectic treatment services, by community-based clinicians, under the confines of existing available resources. …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026383", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976386561", "source": "openalex"}

Postgraduate psychiatry training may be one way to improve the self-rated competence of primary care physicians and their ability to successfully manage these disorders. Previous studies have reported associations between mental health training and greater levels of physician confidence and skill; however, these associations have not been made in reference to specific mental disorders. Our study examined and provided quantitative, disorder-specific associations between postgraduate psychiatry training and confidence levels of primary care internal medicine physicians in managing different mental health disorders. The associations between postgraduate training and the capability of physicians to manage patients with mental health disorders were also evaluated.Design: Cross-sectional studyMethods: Questionnaires were sent to 4,030 private clinics in Japan. After excluding responses from those working in non-private clinics and those without an internal medicine specialty, 544 responses were included in the analysis. Outcome data were measured by respondent self-report. Adjusted odds ratios of confidence and skillfulness in the management of various psychiatric disorders were calculated.Results: Experience of postgraduate psychiatry training was significantly associated with greater physician confidence levels in identifying, treating, and following-up of many psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder). Training was also significantly associated with greater self-evaluated competency in providing patient education, psychological therapy, and specialist referrals.Conclusions: Postgraduate psychiatric training may be important in developing primary care physician self-rated competence in managing psychiatric disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14789/jmj.61.508", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2301559782", "source": "openalex"}

Hence, schizophrenia needs careful management practice from one’s birth. This paper argues that schizophrenia needs to be treated as a collaborative process and as a result, the ‘awareness’ and ‘knowledge-sharing’ capability of various roles involved in the management process need to be addressed explicitly. This paper proposes high-level specification of a novel methodology for identifying and evaluating the level of awareness required by these roles for ‘at risk’ schizophrenics throughout their lives. The authors have both applied and validated a collaborative management approach and an associated analytical tool called the Awareness Information Net (AIN) model to assist in maintaining awareness capabilities among various roles involved in the management of schizophrenics. The ultimate goal of the current study is to develop conceptual foundation for an automated workflow management system for a collaborative management process for schizophrenia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1504/ijaip.2013.056429", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2028601230", "source": "openalex"}

SCD participants with greater pure-tone HL exhibited lower hippocampal volume, but more cortical thickness in the left superior temporal gyrus and right pars opercularis. Greater speech-in-noise reception thresholds were associated with lower cortical thickness bilaterally across much of the cortex in AD. The AD group also showed a trend towards worse speech-in-noise thresholds compared to the SCD group. Highlights In SCD, greater pure-tone hearing loss was associated with lower right hippocampal volume. Pure-tone hearing loss was not associated with brain atrophy in MCI or AD. Individuals with AD exhibited a trend towards poorer speech-in-noise (SiN) thresholds than SCD. In AD, greater atrophy across large portions of the cortex was associated with greater SiN thresholds.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3092125729", "source": "openalex"}

Этот конфликт — решающий фактор суицидальных проявлений. Увеличение продолжительности рабочего времени, с одной стороны, структурирует жизнь, предупреждая скуку и тревогу, с другой — препятствует удовлетворению обыденных потребностей. В свою очередь, продолжительность видов деятельности во внерабочее время отражает тесноту связи с другими людьми (фактор снижения риска самоубийства), а также социальную изоляцию и одиночество (факторы повышения риска самоубийства).

The MHQ is derived from self-ratings of 47 mental health elements spanning ten disorders and provides a score that positions individuals along a spectrum from negative to positive mental health status that aligns with life impact and function criterion.Results:Classification models correctly identified 80% of those with a negative MHQ, while regression models predicted the specific MHQ score within ±15% of the position on the scale. Factors with the biggest predictive impact were young age followed by frequency of social interaction with friends, frequency of good sleep and physical exercise, and number of traumatic experiences. Age had twice the predictive power of social interaction which, in turn, was twice as important as the next four most important factors. Other predictive factors included sexual abuse, cyberbullying, and use of sleeping pills and sedatives.Conclusion:Social determinants of traumas and adversities and lifestyle can account for 60-70% of mental health challenges. However, additional factors are at play, particularly in younger age groups that are not included in this data and need further investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/k8h3u", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4386895774", "source": "openalex"}

Despite last-minute efforts by the international psychiatric community, the U.N. event went on without formal inclusion of mental health.Afterward, when Sorel asked the United States representatives on the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board to act on the matter, they said the organization would do something \"separate.\"\"But separate is not equal,\" Sorel told them. Furthermore, \"separate\" is the opposite of global trends to bind mental health more closely to general health by connecting primary care to psychiatry.Sorel organized a letter-writing campaign to the WHO Executive Board asking that mental health and mental illness be included in all health systems. Other signers included former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., a professor at Morehouse School of Medicine; former APA President Pedro Ruiz, M.D., now president of the World Psychiatric Association; Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D., APA president-elect; and Patricia Newton, M.D., Ph.D., president of the Black Psychiatrists of America.Their action resulted in a proposal to be discussed and voted upon at the WHO's World Health Assembly in Geneva in May.That's a move in the right direction, said Sorel.\"Integration of mental health is a matter of quality, economics, and access,\" he said. \"It will be interesting to see if they tack mental health onto the noncommunicable diseases or keep it a separate issue.\"These steps follow efforts by APA, such as its Integrating Psychiatry and Primary Care action paper that originated in the Assembly in May 2008 and initiatives by APA task forces and work groups, Sorel noted. They also mirrored the theme of this year's APA annual meeting, which was \"Integrated Care.\" The text of the WHO Executive Board's agenda item on mental health is posted at www.who.int/mental_health/mh_draft_resolution_EB130_R8_en.pdf.

The effective system of pharmaceutical care for epileptic patients requires the involvement of appreciable budgetary financial resources. In order to determine the actual state of pharmaceutical care to the population, clinical and economic studies are used, the results of which allow to optimize the cost of pharmacotherapy and ensure the implementation of the constitutional rights of Ukrainian citizens to available medical and pharmaceutical care. The aim of the study was to conduct a clinical and economic analysis of pharmacotherapy of epilepsy. The object of the study was the data of 118 medical records of patients diagnosed with epilepsy, who were treating at specialized healthcare facilities. Evaluation of the degree of pharmacotherapy rationality in epileptic patients was taken using frequency, VEN, ABC analysis. The results of the investigation of patients’ medical records showed that 87 trade names of medications (76 international non-proprietary names of medications) were prescribed for epileptic patients. The total number of prescriptions is 918. The average number of prescriptions per patient is 7, which indicates polypragmasy. It was found that the leader in the number of appointments were carbamazepine – 11.11% of the total number of prescriptions and valproic acid – 3.49%. It is proved that in the structure of prescriptions for epileptic patients the part of medication with index V was 7.89%, which indicates a low degree of prescriptions compliance with healthcare standards. According to the results of the integrated ABC and VEN analysis, it was proved that among the groups A/V, A/E, A/N, the group A/V has the largest amount of expenditures – 36.38% of total cost. In general, group N accounts for 41.97% of total costs, which may indicate the irrational use of drugs in the provision of pharmaceutical care to epileptic patients. The results of clinical and economic analysis of medical records of epileptic patients allowed to identify features in the organization of pharmaceutical care, as well as to substantiate the main directions of improving pharmacotherapy of epileptic patients with limited budget funding for healthcare.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.32352/0367-3057.3.22.04", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4286275891", "source": "openalex"}

Even if there have been efforts for deinstitutionalization, successive delays in restructuring services and little interest from the political, public, and scientific fields [2 Caldas-de-Almeida JM, Frasquilho D, Zózimo JR, et al.

Indeed, closing psychiatric institutions and changing to a community paradigm, includes creating other structures and components for rehabilitation and inclusion that would allow keeping people with psychosocial difficulties in the community. These also mean rehabilitating the patient, his/her relatives and the professional, as they shall operate in a new rehabilitative-communitarian model – putting them, even temporarily, somewhere in between this and the old bio-medical model, raising tensions and unexpected consequences.Materials and methods: This presentation is empirically based on an ethnographic study, which included 6-month daily participant observation, from April to October 2016, in two ambulatory units of a Psychiatry Department in a Portuguese general hospital, and interviews with users of these units. During this time, I participated in all the activities that these units provided in terms of care, social rehabilitation, or social events, as well as team/department meetings. All the people with whom I worked there were aware of my role as researcher and the project I was developing there. During these months, I have documented the daily routines of ambulatory psychiatric treatment, materialized by patients, relatives, professionals and in physical surroundings. Fieldnotes were analyzed from the starting point of finding points of tension/uncertainty in the provision of care and highlighting the solutions found by participants in order to solve them.Results: Data shows how different ideas of good care [3 Pols J. Good Care - enacting a complex ideal in long-term psychiatry. PhD Thesis. Trimbos-instituut, Utrech; 2004. [Google Scholar]] are practiced, intersecting different cultural, professional or contextual values, and articulate new opportunities for caring. To illustrate this, I will focus on apparently evident practices like eating activities, which originate different hospital repertoires: asylum; rehabilitation unit; home; leisure setting. If the therapeutic importance given to eating activities may overcome initial expectations, they may also be reconducted into a ludic dimension, for many opposite to the idea of caring.Discussion and conclusions: Grand societal explanations on mental illness collide and co-habit, in everyday life, with how actors appropriate of practices, different circumstances for action are created, or diverse positions and motivations towards food, wellbeing and illness coexist. These sometimes hinder training skills for everyday activities, but facilitate sociability/solidarity among participants. Hence, these versions of good create not only different ways of caring, but different settings, within the hospital, that are seldom depicted in official discourses, and which are urgent to know and debate for the success and quality of mental illness policies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2018.1560150", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2947176844", "source": "openalex"}

We refer to this as the dual nature of autism. Enhancing adaptation and wellbeing is the ultimate goal for intervention/support. Evidence-based support for autistic people across the lifespan is emerging. Support should be collaborative between autistic individuals, their families, and service providers, taking a shared decision-making approach. To maximize the individual’s potential, comprehensive early intervention and parent-mediated intervention, ideally taking a naturalistic approach, may help support the early development of adaptive, cognitive and language skills. Targeted intervention of social skills and aspects of cognition may help but challenges remain for behavioural flexibility and generalisation to different contexts. To minimize barriers for an individual’s development and adaptation, augmentative and alternative communication may potentially reduce communication difficulties. Alleviating co-occurring health challenges by timely medical, pharmacological or psychological interventions is essential. Finally, optimizing the person-environment fit by creating autism-friendly contexts through reasonable adjustments is critical.

Their contact with healthcare is often crisis-driven and mediated through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a psychosocial intervention recommended by the World Health Organization to address distress experienced by adults affected by humanitarian crises. We are investigating its application for the first time in a high income country. Methods In a pilot randomised controlled trial, PM+ will be delivered to AS&amp;Rs in contact with NGOs in Liverpool City Region, UK, by lay therapists who have lived experience of forced migration. Following systematic review and stakeholder engagement, PM+ has been adapted to the local context, and lay therapists have been trained in its delivery. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of five 90-minute sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups by lay therapists to AS&amp;Rs experiencing emotional distress and functional impairment, compared with each other and with usual support offered by local NGOs. Distress and impairment at baseline will be measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). We aim to recruit 105 participants, 35 per arm. Primary health outcomes are anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months, measured by HADS. Secondary outcomes include subjective wellbeing, functional status, progress on identified problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder and service usage. Longer term impact will be assessed at 6-months post baseline, on the same parameters. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in relation to the following elements: recruitment and retention of lay therapists and study participants; fidelity of delivery of PM+; and suitability of the study measures, including any linguistic or cultural barriers. Discussion We will use these findings to specify the parameters for a full randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of PM+ in reducing emotional distress and health inequalities, and improving functional ability and wellbeing, amongst asylum seekers and refugees.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.24388/v1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4250610086", "source": "openalex"}

While these characteristics have an innate basis, they are also shaped by personal experiences and various cognitive, affective and sociocultural factors. In this exploratory study in North-eastern Italy, we delve into an interdisciplinary field that explores the relationship between the environment of the residential area and its impact on children's attitudes toward Nature. To do so, we conducted a comprehensive questionnaire amongst 533 primary schoolchildren, aged 6-11 years, to gauge their connectedness to Nature, their perceptions of restorativeness in surrounding natural settings, and their schoolyard environment. Drawing from optical satellite imageries, we calculated a combined multispectral index to assess the naturalness degree of participants' residential areas, focusing on their 68 residential areas, located in three administrative Italian Regions (Trentino Alto Adige, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Veneto), which were classified into four different classes with respect to their level of presence of natural areas (\"coastal,\" \"low,\" \"average,\" \"high\"). By performing non-parametric tests for multiple comparisons amongst groups, we detected a significantly higher level of connectedness to Nature amongst children living in areas with high naturalness, compared to those living in areas with average or low naturalness. Perceived restorativeness scores exhibit a similar trend to that of connectedness to Nature, reinforcing the importance of natural spaces in fostering positive attitudes towards the environment. This result confirms that accessibility and the viewability of natural spaces, even semi-natural ones, seemed to play a crucial role in children's preference for these environments. However, schoolyards were consistently perceived as less regenerative than natural places, regardless of the naturalness of the neighbourhood. These findings raise intriguing questions about the potential consequences of inadequate exposure to Nature on children's affiliation to the natural world and possible subsequent effects on pro-environmental behaviour in adulthood. By shedding light on the complex interplay between personal characteristics, environment and attitudes towards Nature, our study underscores the significance of fostering a deeper connection with natural spaces to nurture a sustainable and environmentally conscious society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3897/oneeco.8.e111973", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4390397387", "source": "openalex"}

Having evidence and a well-designed package of interventions are not enough. We will not see progress in mental health without political commitment.\"Worldwide, only 2 percent of health funding is allocated to mental health, according to the WHO. Access to affordable care is difficult or impossible for millions of people. Many poor countries have fewer than one mental health professional per 100,000 population. The report estimates that one-third of people living with schizophrenia, more than half with depression, and three-quarters of those with alcohol use disorders lack access to care for those disorders.The WHO plan focuses on conditions with the highest burden of illness or economic cost or those associated with human-rights violations induced by stigma: depression, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorder, suicide, epilepsy, dementia, alcohol and drug abuse, and mental disorders in children.It describes evidence-based interventions to meet these challenges and calls for additional help for poor countries with high levels of disability-adjusted life years and greatest burden of mental, neurological, or substance abuse disorders.The program calls for policymakers, health professionals, health economists, social scientists, and nongovernmental organizations to organize and push for political commitment \"at the highest level\" to provide funds and human resources.\"Political leaders have to be aware of the problem ... [and] must be convinced that taking action serves their best interests,\" said Chan.The costs of increasing services would vary from country to country, the document pointed out, but \"should be feasible in absolute terms, although challenging.\" Reallocation of resources within national health budgets may be one strategy. Funds from international agencies or foundations may be another.\"In public health we see, time and time again, how a comprehensive program of action, backed by solid evidence, can attract political attention, inspire partners, secure funds, and accelerate progress,\" said Chan.\" Care for these highly prevalent, persistent, and debilitating disorders is not a charity.

Approximately 1% of persons in the United States will die by suicide (2). Older men and women have the highest suicide rate in almost all countries—including those with limited access to firearms, such as Japan and China, where the rate of suicide in elderly persons is nearly 3 times that in the United States (2, 3).Morgan and colleagues cite a review by Anglemyer and associates (4) that concludes that access to firearms is associated with risk for suicide and being the victim of homicide. However, this review was not specific to elderly persons, which makes extrapolating these findings to that population difficult. Morgan and colleagues conclude that “limiting access to lethal weapons for the older adult population represents an important avenue for suicide prevention.” On the basis of their study, it is impossible for Morgan and colleagues to draw this conclusion. There is no evidence that limiting access to firearms would change the overall rate of suicide among elderly persons in the United States. Limited access to firearms may reduce the risk for suicide by firearms, but evidence to support that the overall suicide rate would decrease is lacking. This fact is corroborated by the previously mentioned higher rates of suicide among elderly persons in countries with exceptionally limited access to firearms. According to Morgan and colleagues' logic, we should also limit access to acetaminophen, ropes, automobiles, stairs, knives, bathtubs, and a host of other potential suicide risks.References1.

After about two centuries of research in suicide prevention, the effectiveness of a number of interventions has been demonstrated and various risk factors have been placed in perspective. Thus, is no longer acceptable to state blandly that there is no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of suicide prevention measures and, even more importantly, ... the unacceptable rate of suicide worldwide can be reduced. WHO estimated that 877 000 deaths were due to suicide in the year 2002, (2) the majority of which (85%) occurred in low- and middle-income countries. (3) Attempted suicide can be up to 40 times more frequent than completed suicide. (4,5) Many of those who attempt suicide require medical attention and they are at high risk for completed suicide. (6-8) Self-inflicted injuries represented 1.4% of the global burden of disease in 20022 and are expected to increase to 2.4% by 2020. As suicide is among the top three causes of death in the population aged 15-34 years, (9) there is a massive loss to societies of young people in their productive years of life. Suicide mortality statistics are available at: http://www.who.int/mental_health! prevention/suicide/country_reports/en/ index.html. There have been several recent reviews of interventions that may be considered effective in reducing suicides. (1,10-12) Under the framework of universal, selective, and indicated interventions, (13) the general population is targeted by universal interventions (e.g. restricting access to means of suicide) and selective interventions focus on high-risk subgroups (e.g. people with mental disorders), whereas those who have attempted suicide are considered high-risk individuals and are therefore addressed with indicated interventions, which include a range of behavioural therapies and approaches such as cognitive therapy. (14) Among indicated interventions, various approaches have been tested to prevent subsequent suicidal behaviour by suicide attempters; extensive review articles are available. (15,16) Usually, the primary outcome measure used for these interventions was repeated suicide attempts. It is suggested that extrapolation from attempted to completed suicide is valid. (17) As completed suicide is a rare outcome in statistical terms, large numbers of suicide attempters would be needed to demonstram the effectiveness of an intervention in terms of a reduction of completed suicides. The multisite study presented here tried to tackle this challenge by combining data from different sites that had applied the same research protocol. Previously, completed suicides were used as an outcome measure in a study that investigated the maintenance of long-term contact (i.e. a total of 5 years and 24 contacts) with high suicide-risk psychiatric patients refusing further treatment. (18-20) The contact comprised regular short letters expressing concern for the person's well-being and inviting them to respond. This was associated with a significant reduction in suicide rates for at least 2 years after discharge from the in-patient setting. In addition, a tele-help/tele-check service (i.e. an alarm system that can be activated to call for help and a service that contacts a person twice a week for assessment of their needs and to provide emotional support) could significantly reduce the number of suicide deaths in the elderly, who typically have an elevated risk of suicide compared with an age-adjusted number for the general population. (21,22) These two examples demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the suicide rate in populations at risk by keeping in regular contact with patients. Brief interventions for alcohol problems are another promising type of intervention that have not been previously applied to suicidal behaviours. (23-25) These are designed to address the specific behaviour of drinking with information, feedback, health education and practical advice and focus in order to raise awareness of the problem and advise change. …", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2614613548", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2074492779", "title": "The Problem of Suicide, Continued", "text": "September, 2014. In my editorial in the July, 2013 issue of the Journal, I wrote about “The Complex Problem of Suicide,” describing a decision by the National Quality Forum to endorse a Performance Measure developed by the American Medical Association to establish as a standard the evaluation of a patient with first onset major depressive disorder for suicide risk. In that issue of the Journal, in the Law and Psychiatry column, Wortzel and colleagues introduced a model for therapeutic risk management of the suicidal patient, the first of a series of columns on this critical topic. Quite recently, on September 5, 2014, the World Health Organization issued a first-ever global report on suicide (http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/exe_summary_english.pdf?ua=1). In its introduction, the report states: “Social, psychological, cultural and other factors can interact to lead a person to suicidal behavior, but the stigma attached to mental disorders and suicide means that many people feel unable to seek help. Despite the evidence that many deaths are preventable, suicide is too often a low priority for governments and policy-makers. The objective of this report is to prioritize suicide prevention on the global public health and public policy agendas and to raise awareness of suicide as a public health issue.” Bravo! The need is indisputable, and the magnitude of the problem is staggering. The WHO report estimates that over 800,000 people die from suicide annually, and that it is the second leading cause of death for 15–29 year olds. And that for every person who dies by suicide, there may have been more than 20 others who attempted suicide. The report estimates that, worldwide, a suicide occurs once every 40 seconds. The world wakes up with alarm when someone who is well known dies by suicide, such as the recent tragic suicide of Robin Williams. In a blog that I wrote for the “Say No To Stigma” page of the Menninger Clinic website, I pointed out that “however much we know about the prevalence of depression and of suicide itself, we are still shocked when someone who feels so familiar chooses this way to disappear.” Media coverage usually focuses on the public, celebrity persona, but the internal landscape of thoughts and feelings is often tucked away in the shadows until it erupts with the intensity of a crisis. In my blog, I added: “I would go so far as to say that no one is 100% immune to the powerful, magnetic idea of suicide. When misfortune and stress become overwhelming and we feel like we’re boxed into a corner of hopelessness, it may seem to be the only way out.” The WHO report is entitled “Preventing suicide: A global imperative.” And prevention must be our crusade—an imperative for all of us. Every 40 seconds, somewhere, prevention must prevail, but that can only happen if we are on the alert, reaching out, and not reluctant to ask the right questions. In this issue of the Journal, Yen and colleagues report on adolescents who had been psychiatrically hospitalized for suicide risk, to evaluate their patterns of treatment utilization after discharge. Although treatment engagement was high, suicide risk remained substantial, suggesting that intensification or modification of outpatient treatment might be indicated. Also in this issue, Jayaram chronicles a 30-year process of establishing a culture of safety within inpatient care at Johns Hopkins, by utilization of a set of prevention strategies. Finally, in this issue’s Law and Psychiatry column, Silverman describes the essentials of suicide risk assessment and suicide risk formulation, a wrap-up overview of the model of therapeutic risk management of the suicidal patient developed at the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 19 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center and described by Wortzel and colleagues in Law and Psychiatry columns in four previous issues of the Journal.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4407387227", "title": "PLACENTAL GENE EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION", "text": "Abstract Background Recent meta-analyses showed that around 30% of women suffered postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, a two-fold increase compared to before the pandemic (1,2,3). The immune system plays a key role in responding to infections, and is a potential mechanism in the development of psychiatric disorders. The placenta is a driver of immune changes during pregnancy, modulating the maternal immune response to perinatal infections (4). Aims &amp; Objectives To investigate: 1) whether SARS-CoV2 infection during pregnancy is associated with expression of immune and inflammation-related genes in the placenta; 2) whether genes that are differentially expressed in the placenta after gestational SARS-coV-2 infection are in turn associated with postpartum depression. Method Placental samples were collected from 141 pregnant women enrolled in Generation C, a CDC- funded cohort study (4/2020-2/2022) at the Mount Sinai Health System, New York City. Gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed through SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, PCR test results, and electronic medical records (EMR). Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores (EPDS) at 6-weeks postpartum were extracted from EMR. An EPDS score of 11 is a previously validated cut-off for postpartum depression (5). Placental expression of 347 immune/inflammation related genes from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (6) was profiled with RNA-sequencing. First, we conducted differential gene expression analysis by gestational SARS-CoV-2 status using the Limma R package to fit linear regression models adjusted for maternal age, gestational age at delivery, and infant sex. Next, we interrogated the relationship between the differentially-expressed genes from the previous analysis (predictor variable) and EPDS scores around 6 weeks postpartum (continuous outcome variable) with linear regression analysis adjusted for gestational age, Distressed Communities Index scores (a measure of economic wellbeing of communities) based on participant zip code, lifetime history of anxiety/depression, pre- pregnancy BMI, and timing of EPDS assessment. Results 10 (7%) participants had an EPDS score of 11 or higher. 24 (17%) participants had gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the placenta, gestational SARS- CoV-2 infection was associated with downregulated expression of PTGER2 (logFC=-0.50, adjusted p=0.022) and of 37 additional genes (p&amp;lt;0.05). Linear regression analysis of these 38 genes to examine the effect of placental immune gene expression on maternal EPDS scores at 6-weeks postpartum revealed 4 genes (FZD5, CXCR6, BANK1, MET) negatively associated (p&amp;lt;0.05) Discussion And Conclusions Gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection was linked to placental down regulation of four genes (FZD5, CXCR6, BANK1, MET), whose expression was in turn inversely associated with EPDS scores (i.e., lower expression associated with higher postpartum depression scores). SARS-CoV-2 infection has been previously associated with lower expression of CXCR6 in lung tissue (7), and lower expression of MET has been linked to depression (8).We also found that gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact placental function, such as expression of PTGER2, the gene encoding the receptor for prostaglandin E2.While these preliminary results are limited by sample size, the results suggest the need for further exploration of these immune-related genes and their potential role in postpartum depression.

De acordo com a Organizacao Mundial da Saude (OMS, 2019), houve um aumento de 18,4% em relacao a ocorrencia de transtornos mentais nos anos de 2005 a 2015. Enfatiza-se que o aumento da ocorrencia de transtornos mentais, tem sido uma das maiores causas de afastamento de trabalho, colocando o cuidado com a saude mental como prioridade de saude e desenvolvimento economico. (APA, 2014). O relatorio da Organizacao Pan-Americana da Saude (OPAS, 2018), destacou que os transtornos mentais sao responsaveis por um terco do numero total de incapacidades nas Americas. O manual diagnostico estatico dos transtornos mentais aponta os transtornos depressivo, transtorno ansiedade, transtorno bipolar, obsessivo compulsivo e psicotico como os mais comuns que atingem os segurados da assistencia social (APA, 2014). Diante desse cenario e importante empenhar esforcos na compreensao dos fatores que contribuiram para esse quadro e buscar formas de prevencao e a promocao da saude mental, afim de evitar os impactos e agravamentos que os transtornos mentais provocam no âmbito social e economico. Objetivo: esse trabalho busca quantificar o numero afastamentos do trabalho no Brasil no quadrienio 2012-2016, em decorrencia dos transtornos mentais e comportamentais. Metodo: o presente constitui-se em um estudo transversal com abordagem quantitativa, feito com base em dados secundarios do 1o Boletim Quadrimestral sobre Beneficios por Incapacidade de 2017 (BRASIL, 2017). Para a definicao clara do que sao transtornos mentais e comportamentais, utilizou-se a Classificacao Internacional de Doencas, 10a revisao, tendo como base os codigos CID - F00-F99, transtornos mentais. Para analise dos dados, utilizou-se o programa Microsoft Excel/Word 2013. Por fim, os dados analisados foram sistematizados em tabelas de distribuicao de frequencia para apresentacao descritiva dos achados. Resultados: segundo os dados analisados os transtornos mentais e comportamentais foram responsaveis por 127.562 afastamentos trabalhistas no ano de 2016, sendo que 57% (72.711) acometeram individuos do sexo feminino. Enfatiza-se que os transtornos mentais forma a terceira causa de incapacidade para o trabalho, correspondendo a 9% da concessao de auxilio-doenca e aposentadoria por invalidez em 2016. Alem disso, os episodios depressivos sao a principal causa de pagamento de auxilio-doenca nao relacionado a acidentes de trabalho, correspondendo a 30,67% do total, seguido de outros transtornos ansiosos (17,9%). Em relacao aos afastamentos ocorridos no periodo (2012-2016), 79% estavam relacionados a stress grave, transtornos de adaptacao, episodios depressivos e outros transtornos ansiosos. Esses dados explicitam a importância da manutencao e promocao da saude mental no ambiente de trabalho. E concomitantemente expoe que um ambiente insalubre e desorganizado e ser danoso ao funcionario. Assim, ratifica-se a importância da cooperacao entre trabalhadores, empresas, sindicatos e a sociedade como um todo, atentar para essa situacao. Conclusao: os resultados deste, explicitam o quantitativo de afastamentos trabalhistas em decorrencia dos transtornos mentais e de comportamento. Sendo os dados apresentados, sobremodo preocupantes e alarmantes. Por fim, vale destacar que somente com o reconhecimento por parte dos trabalhadores e dos empregadores sobre a relacao entre trabalho e o adoecimento mental, e que conseguiremos desenvolver redes de apoio e estruturar acoes efetivas de promocao, reabilitacao e prevencao de agravos em relacao ao adoecimento mental.

Con base en el conocimiento obtenido de la produccion cientifica surgen las primeras normas nacionales e internacionales, politicas publicas y programas de prevencion y promocion de la salud para mantener y mejorar la salud de los trabajadores por medio del control de los factores de riesgo psicosocial. De acuerdo a la NOM-035-STPS-2018, los factores de riesgo psicosocial son aquellos que pueden provocar trastornos de ansiedad, no organicos del ciclo sueno-vigilia, de estres grave y de adaptacion derivado de la naturaleza de las funciones del puesto de trabajo, el tipo de jornada de trabajo y la exposicion a acontecimientos traumaticos severos o a actos de violencia laboral al trabajador por el trabajo desarrollado. El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar los factores de riesgo psicosocial y el estado de salud mental en servidores publicos sindicalizados del municipio de Guadalajara. Metodo Estudio observacional con diseno transversal analitico participando 163 servidores publicos sindicalizados del municipio de Guadalajara siendo seleccionados de manera no probabilistica por conveniencia. Los instrumentos de estudio son: el Cuestionario de factores psicosociales de B. N 2004 (adaptado) comprendiendo los siguientes aspectos: condiciones del lugar de trabajo, carga de trabajo, contenido y caracteristicas de la tarea, exigencias laborales, papel y desarrollo de la carrera, interaccion social y aspectos organizacionales y remuneracion del rendimiento con un alfa de Cronbach de 0.7; y el Cuestionario General de Salud GHQ 28 integrado por sintomas somanticos, ansiedad/insomnio, disfuncion social y depresion con un alfa Cronbach de 0.94. Para el analisis de los datos se utilizo el paquete estadistico SPSS 25 para Mac-Os para obtener datos descriptivos como frecuencias y porcentajes; y razon de momios con un intervalo de confianza de 95 % para determinar asociaciones correspondientes por medio de pruebas como c 2 considerando significativo un valor de p inferior a 0.05 Resultados La muestra estuvo conformada por 163 servidores publicos sindicalizados dentro de los cuales 124 son mujeres y 39 hombres; 90 casados; 64 con licenciatura y con una edad minima de 24, maxima de 65 (µ 40.21 ±8.731). Dentro de las variables laborales, 124 son del turno matutino; 72 administrativos; 112 sin otro empleo; antiguedad en el ayuntamiento con una minima de 3 anos, maxima de 30 anos (µ 12.5 ±6.186). En relacion con las variables de estudio, se encontro una significancia de p = 0.020 entre contenido y caracteristicas de la tarea con ansiedad-insomnio (OR de 6.345. IC 95 % 1.105-36.437) y exigencias laborales con disfuncion social de p =0.024 (OR de 3.341. IC 95 % 1.125-9.917). En relacion con las variables sociodemograficas y los factores de riesgo psicosocial obtuvimos una significancia entre sexo y condiciones de trabajo ( p =0.000), sexo y carga laboral ( p =0.001), escolaridad y exigencias laborales ( p =0.052) y escolaridad con remuneracion del rendimiento ( p =0.013). En relacion con las variables laborales y los factores de riesgo psicosocial se muestra una significancia entre la antiguedad y contenido y condiciones de trabajo ( p =0.030), jornada laboral con carga laboral (p=0.013) y jornada laboral con papel laboral y desarrollo de la carrera (p=0.009). En relacion con las variables sociodemograficas y de salud, encontramos una significancia entre la edad y los sintomas somanticos (p=0.035) y estado civil con disfuncion social (p= 0.027). Discusion de resultados y conclusiones Los resultados obtenidos en el presente estudio se presentaron asociaciones significativas entre las variables de estudio y las variables sociodemograficas y laborales respecto a los factores de riesgo psicosocial y de salud mental por lo cual, se recomienda realizar programas de intervencion sobre promocion de la salud y reduccion de los factores de riesgo psicosocial que recomienda la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS, 2019). En la actualidad, los estudios referentes a los servidores publicos carecen de preponderancia a nivel mundial ya que se ha centrado el interes del estudio de los factores de riesgo psicosocial en el trabajo, en personal medico y de enfermeria por lo cual es necesario realizar investigaciones en la poblacion de estudio.

These profiles, entitled ‘Mental Health Analysis Profiles’ (MHAPs), will be able to inform discussion and reflection and provide an introduction to and a synthesised account of mental health in a given country. Each MHAP follows the same template, and whilst the MhAPs are stand-alone profiles, loose cross-country comparison using the MhAPs is possible and encouraged. The Dutch mental health system is highly institutionalised and has a large number of psychiatric beds compared to other OECD countries. Nonetheless, government reforms have aimed at shifting the axis of the system from bed-based hospital services to more integrated mental health services and community-based services. Structural changes to the Dutch mental health system, together with recent government policies that aim to improve access to mental health services, have led to decreasing the treatment gap for mental disorders but also to increasing the expenditures associated with mental health care up until 2011.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1787/5jz158z60dzn-en", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096016032", "source": "openalex"}

The starting point of this work is thesuicide issue as a global appearance which threatens to endanger publichealth in countries worldwide, and therefore it conditions the needfor introducing multi- sector prevention strategies, as well as continualresearches. Therefore the research subject presents the validationcheck on classical sociological standpoints concerning social causesfor suicide and specifically in the society of Bosnia and Herzegovinaat the beginning of the XXI century, in other words, searching forthe answer to the question-Can Durkheim's classic social study concerningsuicide explain the rate of suicides in Bosnia and Herzegovina(further in the text referred as B&amp;H) at the beginning of the XXIcentury? Specifically, is the classic assumption of social conditioningconcerning suicide valid? In this work I used general scientific methods:hypothetical- deductive, statistic and inductive, as well as a casestudy for data gathering. The research outcomes derive from verifiedclassic assumptions about the causes of suicides in contemporary age,as well as unveiling the socially influenced causes of suicides and thepossible measures for their prevention. The suicide rate in B&amp;H atthe beginning of the XXI century confirms the assumption on social-ly predestined suicide. The veracity of the raised rates of suicide inpeaceful rather than in war conditions was proven. The influence ofthe economic stagnancy and age was also proven to affect the rates ofsuicides in B&amp;H at the beginning of the XXI century, and the assumptionon female resistance to suicide was validated as well.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7251/socen1815025s", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2940444776", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3082525912", "title": "QUALITY OF LIFE AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS OF KIDNEY TRANSPLANT PATIENTS IN ETHIOPIA", "text": "Introduction: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred replacement treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It provides better quality of life (QoL) besides many other benefits. World Health Organization defines QoL as an individual’s awareness of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and relate to their goals, hopes, standards and concerns. Several studies on QoL of patients who had KT are done using standardized qualitative and quantitative methodologies around the world. We haven’t come across publication on QoL after KT from Africa. This study was done to determine the quality of life and associated factors of kidney transplant patients in Ethiopia, Eastern Africa. Methodology: The study was conducted at Ethiopian Ministry Health’s National kidney transplant center located at Saint Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa Ethiopia. It was an institution-based cross-sectional study design. A validated questionnaire KTQ-25 was used for data collection on 97 kidney transplant patients. The study was conducted from Jan 28, 2019 to April 5, 2019. Descriptive analyses of demographic and QoL variables were conducted. Also demographic and patient characteristic variables included in and bivariate analyses were conducted using student t-test and one way analysis of variance or ANOVA were used to determine relationships between demographics, and QoL. Results and Discussion: The mean of QoL in this study was 6.06 ∓ 0.79, the maximum score was obtained in appearance dimension and the minimum score was obtained in fear dimension. In comparing the quality of life scores based on the socio-demographic factors, no statistically significant difference was observed. In comparing the quality of life scores based on health-related and functional characters a statistical difference was observed between the quality of life score based on the time after transplant (p=0.035) and the duration returning to their job after transplant (p=0.031). P-value < 0.05 is considered as statistical significance. Published studies couldn’t be found about quality of life in kidney transplant patients as many worldwide and couldn’t come across with such studies in Africa. Despite this fact QoL in Ethiopia is good measuring a mean score of 6.068 + 0.79 which is higher than that of Rebollo in Spain (5.9 ∓1.18), Oveilly study in US (4.5 ∓1.2), Iran (4.9 ∓1.27) and Chinese (4.8 ∓1.43) which has been reported with the same questionnaire. Conclusions: Even though Kidney transplantation was started only four years back, Ethiopian kidney transplant patients’ quality of life level is better. Time after transplant and the duration to return to their job after transplant has a statistically significant association with quality of life. Having a counseling session for those who score low in quality of life domains is recommended.

Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in public concern over use of deadly force, particularly when that force is used against people of color. Due to the relative low frequency of deadly force incidents, little is known about when such force is used, or who it is used on. Recent studies have found a racial disparity between white and black subjects of deadly force, with black subjects significantly over represented as a proportion of the population. This study further expands our understanding of police use of deadly force, specifically the situational context of its use against white and black subjects. We use 100 random cases from the Washington Post Fatal Force data set and conduct a content analysis on this sample to identify data on multiple possible situational factors. This exploratory study found several important differences between situations involving a white or black subject of a deadly police shooting. Black subjects are on average seven years younger than white subjects. Black subjects are statistically more likely to be killed following contact initiated by an officer, such as a traffic or pedestrian stop. White subjects are more likely to be killed following contact initiated by dispatchers or courts, such as a call for service or when serving a warrant. Differences were also found related to the reasons for contact, the location of the incident, and the forms of resistance from the subject. This study provides validation to claims that police use deadly force differently between black and white subjects, and implicates police officer training and discretion in the racial disparity of use of deadly force.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15760/etd.7015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2979721445", "source": "openalex"}

Esse é um fenômeno complexo que tem crescido significativamente em todo o mundo, de modo mais acentuado em jovens. Diversos pesquisadores apontam uma maior vulnerabilidade a ideações, tentativas e suicídios da população de certos grupos sociais, como a de Lésbicas, Gays, Bissexuais e Transexuais (LGBT) se comparado aos seus pares cis-heterossexuais. Essa maior propensão a esse fenômeno é descrita por tais pesquisadores como sendo resultante do estigma, violência e preconceito sofrido por esses sujeitos em razão da sua sexualidade/identidade de gênero desviante. Assim, visando compreender a relação do Estado com esses fatores de riscos específicos ao suicídio da população LGBT, o objetivo deste artigo é analisar se a garantia de direitos promovida pelo Estado repercute na redução das ideações, tentativas e suicídios na população Jovem LGBT. Esse trabalho foi produzido a partir de uma pesquisa de abordagem qualitativa, já quanto aos objetivos foi uma pesquisa exploratória e em relação aos procedimentos é uma pesquisa bibliográfica e documental. Foi evidenciado através da presente pesquisa que o Estado ao garantir/negar direitos a população LGBT ele contribui para a diminuição/aumento do estigma social dirigido a tal população. Desse modo, tais leis/decisões judiciais de garantia/negação, podem influenciar, significativamente, nos índices de ideações, tentativas e suicídios na população jovem LGBT.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3090218644", "title": "Relación entre el estilo de crianza parental y los problemas internalizantes en los hijos", "text": "1. Introduccion o motivacion de la tesis La presente tesis se centra en la posible influencia de los estilos educativos parentales en el desarrollo de los problemas internalizantes en los hijos. En concreto, este trabajo de investigacion se basa en la ansiedad y la depresion, considerandose caracteristicos tanto de los adultos como de los ninos y adolescentes. En este sentido, basandonos en la literatura, diversos autores indican que determinados comportamientos y caracteristicas familiares afectan a estos problemas en la infancia (Chorot, Valiente, Magaz, Santed y Sandin, 2017; Yap y Jorm, 2015). Segun la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS, 2017) la depresion y la ansiedad son considerados los problemas mas frecuentes de salud mental que afectan a la capacidad de trabajo y la productividad. No obstante, su complejidad para ser percibidos no supone que esten menos presentes durante la infancia (Lopez, Alcantara, Fernandez, Castro y Lopez, 2010). Con la finalidad de mejorar el desarrollo de los ninos, asi como su bienestar, es necesario indagar y profundizar en este campo para conocer que determinados factores familiares estan mas relacionados con estos problemas internalizantes, con el objetivo de prevenirlos y actuar sobre ellos. Por tanto, a partir de estas inquietudes, se han planteados estos objetivos: 1. Realizar una descripcion y diferenciacion de las principales caracteristicas demograficas de los padres y madres (edad, sexo…), determinados aspectos de su vida familiar (horas con el hijo, frecuencia de castigo…) y sus estilos de crianza, estableciendo diferencias entre el estilo de crianza de ambos progenitores. 2. Analizar la relacion entre determinadas caracteristicas de los padres y madres, variables del entorno familiar y los factores del estilo de crianza de los progenitores sobre el desarrollo de la ansiedad y depresion en sus hijos. 3. Realizar un analisis conjunto e interactivo de las variables demograficas, del entorno familiar y el estilo de crianza, elaborando para ello un modelo de crianza relacionado con la ansiedad y la depresion en los hijos, basado en el analisis de regresion multiple. 4. Determinar si se muestran diferencias en las variables demograficas, del entorno familiar y el estilo de crianza percibido por dos grupos de ninos que han presentado puntuaciones bajas y de riesgo en la variable ansiedad y depresion. 5. Establecer cuales son las variables demograficas, del entorno familiar y factores del PCRI que estan relacionados con la presencia o ausencia de la ansiedad y la depresion, desarrollando un modelo capaz de predecir la pertenencia a un grupo con puntuaciones bajas y de riesgo en ansiedad, y otro modelo en depresion. 2. Contenido de la investigacion Teniendo en cuenta los objetivos mencionados anteriormente, se han planteado tres estudios en los que se han utilizado el “Behavior Assessment System for Children” (BASC) (Reynolds y Kamphaus, 2004) y el Cuestionario de Crianza Parental (PCRI-M) de Roa y Del Barrio (2001) adaptado del “Parent-Child Relationship Inventory” (Gerard, 1994), ademas de un “cuestionario de datos sociodemograficos generales de padres y madres y del entorno familiar”. En el primero, compuesto por 554 ninos entre 3 y 13 anos, se llevo a cabo un estudio con un diseno ex post facto prospectivo transversal. Los resultados muestran que existen diferencias entre los progenitores en relacion a los estilos de crianza de empleados con sus hijos. Tambien, se ha senalado una relacion significativa entre la depresion y la ansiedad en los ninos y la mayoria de los factores del estilo de crianza parental, asi como algunas caracteristicas familiares y variables demograficas. Ademas, se establece un modelo capaz de predecir el 31% de la varianza respecto a la depresion en los ninos, compuesto por la disciplina de ambos progenitores, la satisfaccion con la crianza y el apoyo de las madres, la distribucion de rol y frecuencia de rina del padre y el orden que ocupa el hijo. En relacion con la ansiedad, se construye un modelo capaz de predecir el 16% de la varianza en los ninos, compuesto por la satisfaccion con la crianza y el grado de implicacion de los progenitores, la disciplina y las horas con el hijo de la madre, y el apoyo, la distribucion de rol y la autonomia del padre. En el segundo estudio, 180 ninos fueron seleccionados, los cuales cumplieron un conjunto de criterios especificos como presentar un alto riesgo (90 ninos) o bajo riesgo (90 ninos) para la ansiedad. En este estudio se aplico un diseno ex post facto retrospectivo transversal con un grupo cuasi-control. Los resultados han demostrado que existen diferencias entre el comportamiento del padre y la madre de los dos grupos de ninos que han presentado puntuaciones bajas y de riesgo en ansiedad. El primer analisis de regresion logistica binomial, compuesto por las variables del PCRI incluidas en el modelo de ansiedad, resulto en un modelo de prediccion para el 83.9% de la muestra. Este se baso en las variables parentales: compromiso y autonomia del padre, y apoyo, satisfaccion con la crianza, compromiso, disciplina y distribucion de rol de la madre. El segundo analisis basado en las variables del PCRI, y demograficas y del entorno familiar resulto en un modelo de prediccion para el 86% de la muestra. Este modelo estaba compuesto por las variables: horas con el hijo que pasa tanto el padre como la madre, autonomia del padre y nivel de estudios, apoyo, satisfaccion en la crianza, compromiso y disciplina de la madre. En el tercer y ultimo estudio, se escogieron 140 ninos que cumplian un conjunto de criterios como tener puntuaciones de alto riesgo (70 ninos) para la depresion o tener bajas puntuaciones en esta variable (70 ninos). Al igual que en el segundo estudio, se aplico un diseno ex post facto retrospectivo transversal con un grupo cuasi-control. Los resultados de este estudio basado en la depresion han indicado que existen diferencias entre las variables y el estilo de crianza percibido por dos grupos de ninos. El analisis de regresion logistica binomial compuesto por las variables del PCRI incluidas en el modelo de depresion mostro una prediccion para el 89.3% de la muestra, basado en el apoyo, satisfaccion de la crianza, comunicacion y autonomia del padre, y compromiso y disciplina de la madre. El segundo analisis basado en las variables del PCRI, y demograficas y del entorno familiar resulto en un modelo de prediccion para el 95.1% de la muestra. Este modelo estaba compuesto por las variables: castigo, satisfaccion con la crianza, comunicacion del padre, y apoyo, compromiso, comunicacion, disciplina, autonomia de la madre, ademas de la implicacion de los progenitores, edad y sexo del hijo. 3. Conclusion Los resultados obtenidos en los tres estudios planteados confirman que existen diferencias entre la crianza que manifiestan los padres y madres de ninos con problemas internalizantes, en concreto con ansiedad y depresion. Por lo tanto, se han apreciado diferencias entre el grupo de baja puntuacion y riesgo tanto en ansiedad como en depresion. En este sentido, podemos concluir que, aunque en algunos casos coincidan el estilo de crianza y la caracteristica familiar que suele estar detras de un nino con un nivel alto de depresion y ansiedad, en otros casos puede ser diferente. Asi, la depresion, segun nuestros datos, parece estar mas asociada a una interaccion negligente o negativa por parte de los progenitores, mientras que la ansiedad podria relacionarse mas con un exceso de control sobre los hijos. Esto supone que los resultados obtenidos son un buen punto de partida para plantear estrategias, donde se analicen y apliquen mecanismos protectores y preventivos que orienten sobre algunos aspectos concretos de la practica educativa diaria, que permitan prevenir problemas internalizantes en los hijos y promover estilos de crianza mas competentes y positivos en los padres. 4.

Despite the Roma marginalized communities in Slovakia encounter adverse health conditions that negatively affect their work integration and educational prospects, a little attention is paid to exploring the determinants of mental health of this vulnerable group. The aim of the paper is to explore socio-economic determinants of mental well-being of marginalized Roma communities in Slovakia by utilizing regression analysis of the EU-SILC MRC 2018 module survey data about the living conditions of the marginalized Roma communities. The results of the analysis show that there is a significant impact of the poor housing conditions, and dissatisfaction with the financial situation on the self-perceived feelings of anxiety and depression, and nervousness among the inhabitants of the marginalized Roma communities. At the same time, possessing social capital in terms of being satisfied with relationships with the family relatives, friends, and other people around, decreases the probability of feelings of anxiety and nervousness which refers to the benefits of social capital for copying with hardships. Based on the intersectionality theoretical framework and social ecosystem approach to social inclusion of disadvantaged groups, these findings call for an awareness of policy makers of a crucial part of the social inclusion, including the integration of this cohort at the labour market.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.53465/er.2644-7185.2024.1.65-78", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4393157973", "source": "openalex"}

Проведен обзор современной российской и зарубежной, преимущественно англоязычной, литературы, посвященной расстройствам аутистического спектра и их распространенности в мире с целью оценки развития и прогрессирования первазивных расстройств. Учитывались публикации не старше 5 лет в специализированных медицинских журналах и руководствах. Была описана актуализированная концепция аутизма в раннем и подростковом возрасте. Приемлемые дизайны научных работ для нашего обзора включали обсервационные описательные и аналитические исследования по типу «случай — контроль» и когортные исследования. Результаты. В настоящее время аутизмом страдает каждый сотый житель планеты. Отмечается неуклонный рост этой патологии по данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения. В обзоре представлены сравнительные данные в разных странах, в том числе с самыми высокими и наиболее низкими показателями аутизма. Кроме того, представлен отчет по мониторингу расстройств аутистического спектра в Российской Федерации, который выявил динамику увеличения численности пациентов по сравнению с 2021 годом на 17%, прирост составил 6771 человек, причем наибольший прирост больных приходится на отдаленные части страны, где, к сожалению, отсутствуют специалисты по данному направлению. Заключение. Несмотря на то, что в зарубежной практике инклюзивного образования детей с особыми образовательными потребностями накоплен большой опыт и этой проблеме посвящено много публикаций, данный потенциал нельзя использовать в современной российской школе без адаптации и учета особенностей отечественной образовательной системы. Кроме того, в настоящее время инклюзивное обучение детей с расстройствами аутистического спектра является остро дискутируемой научной и практической проблемой и имеет как сторонников, так и противников. Также до сих пор не существует достаточного количества научных исследований, которые оценивали бы эффективность и успешность инклюзивного обучения детей с расстройствами аутистического спектра. Таким образом, эволюция взглядов на природу аутизма в отечественной и зарубежной детской психиатрии предполагает эндогенный генез. Надо отметить, что в деонтологическом аспекте подобный подход, возможно, имеет свои преимущества, но в терапии и прогнозе не лишен недостатков. Objective. A review of modern Russian and foreign, mainly English-language, literature on autism spectrum disorders and their prevalence in the world was carried out. Publications no older than 5 years, published in specialized medical journals and manuals, were taken into account. An updated concept of autism in early childhood and adolescence was described. Eligible observational study designs for our review included observational descriptive and analytical case-control studies and cohort studies. Objective. Currently, every hundredth inhabitant of the planet suffers from autism and there is a steady increase in this problem according to the World Health Organization. The review provides comparative data across countries, highlighting countries with the highest/lowest rates of autism. In addition, a report on monitoring autism spectrum disorders in the Russian Federation was presented, which revealed the dynamics of an increase in numbers compared to 2021 by 17%, the increase amounted to 6,771 people and the main percentage of the country’s demographic development, in relation to natural population growth, falls on its remote regions. parts where, unfortunately, there are no specialists in this area. Conclusion. Despite the fact that a lot of experience has been accumulated in the foreign practice of inclusive education of children with special educational needs, and many publications are devoted to this problem, this potential cannot be used in a modern Russian school without adapting and taking into account the characteristics of the domestic educational system. In addition, at present, inclusive education of children with autism spectrum disorders is a hotly debated scientific and practical problem and has both supporters and opponents. Also, there is still not a sufficient number of scientific studies that would evaluate the effectiveness and success of inclusive education for children with autism spectrum disorders. Thus, the evolution of views on the nature of autism in domestic and foreign child psychiatry concludes to be of endogenous origin. It should be noted that in the deontological aspect, such an approach may have its advantages, but in therapy and prognosis it is not without its disadvantages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.51793/os.2023.26.10.004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4388717141", "source": "openalex"}

Available professional literature reveals that hypercortisolemia caused by CD may negatively impact the mood and social life. However, data on QoL of adult patients after CD treatment in childhood are scarce. Aim of the study: To study the QoL of adult patients treated for CD in childhood.Eighteen out of 29 adult patients diagnosed in childhood with CD and/or treated at one center participated in a survey and completed WHO Quality of Life-BREF questionnaire. The influence of selected prognostic factors for the QoL has been analyzed. Patients data were compared with a control group with the same age and sex.Participants (10 women and 8 men) were at the mean age of 28.93 years (19.75-40.33). No significant difference in the QoL was noted between analyzed patients and controls. Patients with hypopituitarism had lower results in domain 4 in comparison with patients without hypopituitarism (p = 0.31) and lower results in domain 2 in comparison with the control group (p = 0.045). Patients with a higher age at disease onset had lower results of the QoL in domain 1 (p = 0.031).During long-term follow-up the QoL of patients after CD treatment in childhood is not significantly different wit QoL of healthy controls. Further studies are needed to expand the knowledge of factors that may contribute to the QoL in CD patients who were treated in childhood.Jakość życia (QoL) dorosłych pacjentów po leczeniu choroby Cushinga (CD) oceniano w wielu badaniach.

The spectrum of clinical presentation of rare inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) is broad and ranges from single organ involvement to multisystemic diseases. With the aim of overcoming the limited knowledge about the natural course, current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the project has established the first unified patient registry for IMDs that fully meets the requirements of the European Infrastructure for Rare Diseases (ERDRI). Results : In collaboration with the European Reference Network for Rare Hereditary Metabolic Disorders (MetabERN), the Unified European registry for Inherited Metabolic Diseases (U-IMD) was established to collect patient data as an observational, non-interventional natural history study. Following the recommendations of the ERDRI the U-IMD registry uses common data elements to define the IMDs, report the clinical phenotype, describe the biochemical markers and to capture the drug treatment. Until today, more than 1100 IMD patients have been registered. Conclusion: The U-IMD registry is the first observational, non-interventional patient registry that encompasses all known IMDs. Full semantic interoperability for other registries has been achieved, as demonstrated by the use of a minimum common core data set for equivalent description of metabolic patients in U-IMD and in the patient registry of the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network (ERKNet). In conclusion, the U-IMD registry will contribute to a better understanding of the long-term course of IMDs and improved patients care by understanding the natural disease course and by enabling an optimization of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-101208/v3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4246706739", "source": "openalex"}

For the Russian Federation, the problem of suicidal behavior of the population is an urgent problem. There are regions in the country with an ultra-high suicide index (more than 60 cases per 100 thousand population). They are located in the North of the country and in most cases are ethnic entities. In this regard, a systematic study of the regional and ethno-cultural features of the suicidal situation in the country is required. Research methods: Within the framework of the study, a clinical and epidemiological analysis of the frequency of suicides in the districts of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) over the past 5 years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020) was applied. An average suicide index for five years was revealed for each district and for the Vilyuisk group of districts. Research results: 1. The average suicide index for five years in the Republic of Sakha Yakutia was 25 per 100 thousand population. This indicator is more than 2.5 times higher than the global average and 2 times higher than the Russian indicators. 2. Areas with an ultra–high level of committed suicides (more than 60 cases per 100 thousand population) have been identified – these are Anabarsky, Srednekolymsky and Eveno-Bytantaysky. The highest suicide rate was detected in the Srednekolymsky district – 93.8 cases of suicide per 100 thousand population. 3. Five districts with a high suicide rate have been identified (from 40 to 59 cases per 100 thousand population). 4. 22 districts with moderate suicide rates were identified (20-39 cases per 100 thousand population). 5. 3 districts and a city with low suicide rates have been identified (0-19 cases of suicide per 100 thousand population). 6. The average suicide index for the Vilyui group of districts was 32. This indicator is 1.3 times higher than the republic’s index. Conclusion: 1. In areas with extremely high suicide rates, mainly representatives of the indigenous peoples of the North live. 2. Ultra-high suicidal activity indicates insufficient socio-economic development in the above-mentioned areas. 3. The basic psychological need of indigenous peoples – the affiliation need remains unsatisfied. 4. The high suicidal activity of representatives of indigenous peoples indicates their alienation from the culture of their people. 5. Relatively high suicide rates in the Vilyuisk group of districts may be caused by a violation of the ecological balance in the «man – environment» system due to negative anthropogenic impact. 6.

Today, there is a need to support such categories of people as children and youth, servicemen, convicts and the elderly. The need to unite the efforts of all services that ensure the viability of military units was identified. The study of suicide in the armed forces has shown that suicide prevention is comprehensive and can only be addressed through the joint efforts of physicians, psychologists, social workers, commanders of all levels and officers of educational institutions. It has been found that suicide is usually carried out of desperation, in protest to preserve self-esteem, as a result of obscuration of the mind to avoid pain or revenge. Poverty, unemployment, loss of loved ones and problems in family relationships are also areas at risk of voluntary death and, most importantly, experts do not have the full amount of accurate statistics on the number of \"successful\" attempts to leave this world.

Methods: For the study, 400 children (200 from rural areas and 200 from urban areas) studying in standard IX & X were selected to participate in the study. The standardized questionnaire of healthy living was used as a tool for the study. The quantitative data collected from the questionnaire were then analyzed and interpreted using the inferential t-test with a significance of p<0.05 standard deviation and mean, in accordance with the accomplishment analysis. Findings: The results of the study revealed that the urban children had a significantly better understanding of Healthy living than Rural with a performance of 17.51\u00062.17 and 15.97\u00062.28 respectively (t = 6.89, p<0.05). Further details of the test revealed that in Personal Health (t = 6.27, p<0.05), rural children had a significantly better performance with mean scores (6.66) as compared to urban children with mean scores (5.86), In Environmental Health (t = 13.35, p<0.05) and in Family Health (t = 5.98, p<0.05), urban students had significantly better performance with mean scores (5.93) & (5.72) respectively, as compared to rural children with mean scores (4.31) and (5.00) in Environmental Health and Family Health. In conclusion, it is evident from the results that place of residence had an impact on the understanding of Healthy living Aspect of Physical Education Subject. Also, the way of life, activity levels, food habits, and the facilities available, the day to day experiences and responsibilities to carry out play a significant role in the differences among children from different settings. Novelty: This questionnaire will help the physical educators to assess the students’ understanding regarding the healthy living aspect and plan their strategy or teaching pedagogy regarding health education through physical education.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2327361110", "title": "Caring for the patient with acute psychosis", "text": "FigureIn this article, we discuss how to recognize the event sequence that frequently takes place during a psychotic episode, measures to take when a patient with psychosis experiences anxiety, strategies to help patients with psychosis establish and maintain control of their behavior, how to monitor physical health in the patient with schizophrenia, effective communication techniques when a patient exhibits thought disturbances, and appropriate interventions to use when a patient expresses delusions or has hallucinations. What's schizophrenia? Schizophrenic spectrum is a group of psychotic reactions in which the patient experiences loose association of thoughts, dulled or blunted affect, anhedonia, ambivalence, and impaired social relationships. Schizophrenia is characterized by ideas of reference, delusions, and hallucinations (see Common symptoms of schizophrenia). Many causative factors have been suggested for this psychiatric disorder, including cortical atrophy, life stress, faulty family interactions, and low socioeconomic status. But prevailing notions about schizophrenia's etiology point to hereditary contributions of various genes, which predispose a person to an increased number of and sensitivity to dopamine-regulated neurons. In the active phase of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms are prominent. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: delusions hallucinations disorganized speech grossly disorganized behavior negative symptoms such as apathy level of everyday functioning in work and self-care markedly below expectation continuous disturbance of premorbid or acute symptoms lasting 6 months or more schizoaffective, depressive, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features ruled out the disturbance isn't attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance or another medical condition. Table: Common symptoms of schizophreniaAntipsychotic medications remain the mainstay of treatment for psychotic disorders. Atypical antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, and ziprasidone, have become the first line of therapy. These medications have a more favorable adverse reaction profile and they address both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Because schizophrenia is a chronic illness, patients require long-term integrated treatment. For the majority of patients, the most effective treatment is a combination of antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy. Understanding the breakdown There are four stages of a schizophrenic breakdown. During the first stage, patients experience a kind of euphoria with high energy. They may feel quite good temporarily as if they're on a mission or quest and their life has been given some greater meaning. This phase usually lasts a few days during which the patient doesn't get much sleep, calls friends and family at all hours of the day and night, and may be difficult to live with. The second stage includes what are termed ideas of reference—everything refers to the patient and there isn't anything that doesn't have special and deep meaning. There's a subtle shift between the euphoric sense of purpose and the patient's belief that everything that's happening has some personal significance. Words spoken on TV are specific messages to the patient, not general advertising. Little glances and conversations between people on the street aren't to each other, but are secret codes to the patient. The third stage is associated with what's known as the destructuring of perception. Events are either super strong or too weak for the patient to perceive, and there's a breakdown in the sensory processing apparatus. Have you ever seen the world through a kaleidoscope? People and places that were once predictable and familiar become disorienting and unfamiliar; the world is on a tilt. This is what happens to the patient experiencing psychosis. In the fourth and final stage, patients aren't able to inhibit extraneous or irrelevant stimuli—everything comes flooding in on them. This is no longer a euphoric state, but a very frightening one. At this point in their breakdown, patients often exhibit full-blown delusions and hallucinations. Generally, patients who experience such a break or exacerbation of illness are hospitalized in a community mental health center for a short stay, usually averaging 5 to 7 days. Outpatient treatment is also recommended. During this hospital stay, psychotropic medications are administered and schizophrenia will usually be brought under control within 2 to 4 weeks. Measures will be taken to reduce the patient's anxiety and care for the patient's physical needs until he or she is well enough to assume these responsibilities. A therapeutic, interpersonal relationship between nurse and patient helps the patient tolerate symptoms when acutely ill. The relationship also serves as a basis for further interaction as the patient gets better. Reducing anxiety Reducing the patient's anxiety is one of the most important initial measures you can take. The patient having an acute psychotic episode is intensely frightened. Fear is the prevailing problem in the initial phase of treatment; the more intense the fear, the more intense the psychotic symptoms. You can assume that the more the patient is talking through delusions, the more intense the hallucinations, the more frightened and anxious he or she is. The best approach to a patient whose psychosis appears to be increasing is to reduce his or her anxiety. You can do this by bringing the patient back to your reality. You might say, “I think I'm making you more anxious” or “Talking about this seems to make you more anxious.” For example, if a patient says, “I'm Jesus Christ, I'm God”—a grandiose delusion—you shouldn't respond by interpreting that the delusion is a response to the patient's insecurity. Rather, you want to respond to the process: the patient is getting more anxious, which is fueling the psychosis. You might say, “I think right now you're getting more anxious. Why don't we stop this discussion and sit here quietly for a minute” as opposed to “It sounds like what you're saying or feeling is...” There are times when sitting with the patient silently is the best response. You aren't overstimulating the patient, but you're giving him or her a sense of security—the patient isn't alone and he or she can rely on your reality for a while. To review, techniques that can help reduce anxiety include sharing your reality, responding to the process rather than interpreting, and staying with the patient quietly. Helping patients gain control In addition to reducing anxiety, you'll want to help patients establish and maintain control of their behavior. If you're working with a newly admitted patient experiencing psychosis, you need some capacity to relate to that individual and these skills must be learned. You must learn to speak to the patient's concern without hemming him or her in and without pressuring too much, yet you have to set firm limits. The symptoms of psychosis usually wax and wane; that is, if the patient is having auditory hallucinations or ideas of reference, the intensity of those symptoms—and the patient's capacity to distance him- or herself from them, control them, or resist them—probably varies throughout the day and day to day. So a patient who can't help him- or herself at one point during the hospital stay may be able to at another time, particularly if you encourage him or her to do so. This vacillation in self-control means that extremes are to be avoided. To treat patients with psychosis as if they have no capacity to control themselves is an error. To treat them as if everything is under their control is also an error, but for you to exhort them to manage whatever degree of control they can maintain is quite a reasonable expectation. You must remember that the patient with psychosis is responding to an internal state of mind over which you have little or no control. In fact, the patient is experiencing things that the observer isn't experiencing. You might say, “We know you may be terribly frightened, but we want you to know that you're safe here. These fears are symptoms of your illness, and we're going to protect you. We aren't going to let you get out of control if that should be a concern to you. And we would like you to warn us if you're concerned about getting out of control.” When you make that sort of unilateral statement, the patient is often comforted. If patients sense, in the midst of their terror, which is often inexpressible, that you understand to some degree what they're experiencing, they're often reassured. If patients fear that they may lose control of their impulses—usually violent impulses—they may be relieved to know that you aren't frightened that they have those concerns, and there are sufficient personnel that if they act out their impulses, you'll assist them to regain control. Most patients with psychosis, even though they may seem out of touch with reality, have excellent memories for what goes on during an acute episode. They remember what you do for them; what you don't do for them; and whatever you may do to them, which they may interpret negatively. Although they may be mute and unresponsive, patients with psychosis remember what's said. Keep this in mind when you work with these patients. In review, to help patients establish and maintain control, you should speak to patients' concerns, set firm limits, encourage patients to control themselves as much as they're able, and ensure them of their safety. Monitoring physical health Monitoring the physical health of patients with psychosis is also necessary. You must make sure that patients are having their daily needs met—eating, toileting, and resting sufficiently. Patients may ignore some of these functions during a psychotic episode. Be alert to signs of physical illness, such as lassitude or lethargy. Not all of the patient's physical symptoms may be manifestations of the psychiatric problem. You should actively intervene when the patient is behaving in ways detrimental to his or her health. Although an intervention principle is to allow the patient to control as much of his or her life as possible, there are instances when a psychiatric disorder can seriously interfere with the patient's well-being. An instance might be when a patient is unable to voluntarily decide to rest for the sake of his or her own health. Because of the patient's ambivalence, he or she might walk into the room in preparation for taking a nap, then walk back out, walk in, and walk back out. You have the difficult challenge of deciding at which point you need to take responsibility for the patient's well-being, with the ultimate goal of gradually transferring that control back to the patient as he or she achieves some level of readiness. In this instance, it would be appropriate for you to take the patient gently, but firmly by the arm and walk with him or her to the room. After you're there, you would assist the patient to sit on the bed and then lie down. You might say, “Now you'll rest. I'll stay with you while you rest or I'll check back with you to make sure you're resting. But now you'll rest.” To review, monitoring the patient's physical health includes meeting basic needs, attending to urgent health concerns, recognizing signs of illness, and preparing for the patient's indecision related to matters affecting his or her physical well-being. Communicating effectively The ability to communicate effectively is important when caring for patients who are experiencing an acute psychotic episode. It's impossible to provide a nurse with a script of therapeutic words, phrases, or sentences; instead, it's preferable for you to use your own personal style to operationalize a number of therapeutic principles (see Five therapeutic principles). If you're extroverted and sociable, then use it to greatest effect without overstimulating the patient. If you're introverted and soft-spoken, then use silence to allow the patient to reveal his or her feelings. Consider these strategies to communicate effectively (see Suggestions for communication). Listen for themes. When interviewing a patient with psychosis, it's often difficult to understand his or her story. If the patient is talking but is difficult to follow, you can listen for themes. Try to understand the most important theme in the patient's conversation. For example, the patient might be repetitively speaking about “decapitated babies, bloody knives, zombies, and empty graves.” Rather than asking questions about these things, it's better to simply ask the patient, “Are you feeling frightened?” Often, a patient who's rambling will respond that he or she is feeling frightened. Speak simply and concretely. One of the most important things to keep in mind when caring for a patient with psychosis is to speak simply and concretely so that the patient is able to follow. A long paragraph with many abstract ideas will be difficult for the patient to understand and respond to because it's too much stimulation. Accompany simple language with simple gestures. Rather than orienting the patient to his or her room using complex instructions about the call bell, TV remote device, or bed controls, you might say simply, “Come and sit” while gesturing with an open hand and an inviting facial expression. Anticipate the patient's experience. Sensitive communication is particularly helpful when a patient experiences thought blocking (the patient has many thoughts but can't choose one to say), expresses a delusion, or appears to be having hallucinations. When a patient is having tremendous difficulty with thought blocking, letting him or her know that you understand what's happening is often a relief. The patient who can't complete a sentence is very embarrassed and feels that something strange is happening to him or her that no one can understand. So it's immensely helpful for the patient to know that you can anticipate what he or she is experiencing, even if just a little bit. If the patient is experiencing delusions, one of the key principles of effective communication is letting him or her know when you don't understand. Communication can proceed most effectively if you're clear on what has been understood and what hasn't. It's important that you don't disagree with the patient's delusion; don't attempt to rationalize or argue with him or her. What you can say is, “I don't share that fear, but I understand that's the way you see things now.” In that way, you provide some consensual validation of the patient's reality without taking a punitive or disrespectful attitude toward his or her experience. If the patient is experiencing hallucinations, to intervene constructively you need to remember, first and foremost, that hallucinations, although not real for you, are experienced as very real for the patient. In most cases, hallucinations are threatening and ominous. It's useful for you to reassure the patient who's hallucinating. Any areas in which you have some control over protecting the patient should be pointed out. You might say, “I won't let anyone hurt you. I will protect you. I will stay with you.” You can share your perception of reality by saying, “I don't see, smell, or hear what you're experiencing, but I can see how it's upsetting you.” It's critical for you to realize that whenever a patient is experiencing perceptual distortions, other sensory input can be equally distorted and become equally frightening. Avoid touching patients who are actively hallucinating without telling them that you're going to touch them. Patients who are hallucinating may interpret sensory input in a way other than you intended. For patients experiencing auditory hallucinations, some of the time it's blatant enough that they'll respond to the voices. Often, you can pick this up through subtle behavior. You see the patient moving his or her head or lips as if responding to something in the environment. You should then ask, “Are you hearing voices?” If the answer is yes, then say, “What are the voices telling you?” It's important to know the content of auditory hallucinations: there's a difference between voices making benign statements and voices telling the patient to harm him- or herself or someone else (command hallucinations). When a patient hears auditory imperative or command hallucinations, stay with the patient and constantly observe him or her. In review, to communicate effectively, you should use your own style, listen for themes, speak simply and concretely, indicate when you don't understand, avoid disagreeing with delusions, share your perception of reality, and remain with the patient having auditory command hallucinations. Awareness and sensitivity needed Care of the patient with acute psychosis requires your awareness of the sensory-perceptual problems he or she is experiencing and being able to apply that awareness to specific situations. Care also requires you to be sensitive to the patient's feelings and preserve as much of his or her dignity as possible. Doing so will positively influence patients' progress during the rehabilitative phase of their illness. consider thisFigureMr. M talked nonstop about fulfilling his messianic mission. He repeatedly emphasized that in the second millennium, he would exalt the 12 tribes of Israel and the saved would number only 2,000. Often, he stopped midsentence and asked, “Do you understand?” To which I replied, “No, I don't understand.” Frustrated, Mr. M, said, “Of course, you wouldn't understand. You don't have superior, Godly intelligence.” Then he grabbed my legal pad and pencil, and wrote the numerals 2, 12, and 2,000 while continuing to rant. At this point, I said, “What I do understand is that you wrote the numbers 2, 12, and 2,000 on my paper.” Mr. M stopped ranting and said, “Yes, I wrote 2, 12, and 2,000 on your paper. Would you like to see my drawings? They're in my room.” Analysis: This patient was talking through his delusion at a rapid pace, anxiously wanting to be understood. When I finally validated something we could both agree on, he ceased his ranting and invited me to see his artwork. Five therapeutic principles Show acceptance without value judgment. Observe the patient's verbal and nonverbal cues. Focus on the patient's feelings. Be honest and direct. Actively listen. Suggestions for communication Listen for themes. Speak simply and concretely. Anticipate the patient's experience. Ask if the patient is hallucinating; if so, ask if he or she is hearing voices and what they're saying. Avoid disagreeing with delusions or asking detailed questions about them. Notice the patient's nonverbal cues; look for incongruence with what he or she says. Stay with the patient who's having auditory imperative or command hallucinations. consider thisFigureMs. R stood in a corner of the day room waiting her turn for morning snacks, which included peanut butter and sliced apples. When she finally approached, I asked her pleasantly if she would like a piece of apple. She responded with a deep and furious growl, “I don't want an apple unless there's a snake wrapped around it.” Instead of trying to interpret Ms. R's imagery, I simply said, “I'm not going to harm you with this apple slice. Apples are good for us...see,” and I bit into the apple slice. Ms. R reluctantly took two apple slices and some peanut butter. Analysis: Rather than rush to interpret Ms. R's response as an allusion to the Genesis narrative about Eve, the serpent, forbidden fruit, original sin, and guilt, I responded to the process. Ms. R was fearful and I spoke to her fear. Epilogue: Eight days later, as she was preparing for discharge, Ms. R sat next to me and said, “I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you that day you offered me the apple. I know I scared many of the other patients, including my roommate. I was scared, too. I saw the snake as vividly as I see you now.” on the webFigure American Psychiatric Association: http://www.psychiatry.org/schizophrenia Cleveland Clinic: http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/psychiatry-psychology/schizophrenia-acute-psychosis Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/basics/definition/con-20021077 National Alliance on Mental Illness: http://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia National Institute of Mental Health: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mental_health/management/schizophrenia/en", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.nme.0000462645.52688.23", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2327361110", "source": "openalex"}

Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a psychosocial intervention recommended by the World Health Organization to address distress experienced by adults affected by humanitarian crises. We are investigating its application for the first time in a high income country. Methods In a pilot randomised controlled trial, PM+ will be delivered to AS&amp;Rs in contact with NGOs in Liverpool City Region, UK, by lay therapists who have lived experience of forced migration. Following systematic review and stakeholder engagement, PM+ has been adapted to the local context, and lay therapists have been trained in its delivery. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of five 90-minute sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups by lay therapists to AS&amp;Rs experiencing emotional distress and functional impairment, compared with each other and with usual support offered by local NGOs. Distress and impairment at baseline will be measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). We aim to recruit 105 participants, 35 per arm. Primary health outcomes are anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months, measured by HADS. Secondary outcomes include subjective wellbeing, functional status, progress on identified problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder and service usage. Longer term impact will be assessed at 6-months post baseline, on the same parameters. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in relation to the following elements: recruitment and retention of lay therapists and study participants; fidelity of delivery of PM+; and suitability of the study measures, including any linguistic or cultural barriers.

In pregnant women, anxiety during the pandemic is related to the threat of COVID-19 to the lives of mothers and babies as well as concerns about unmet prenatal care needs, relationship tensions, and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, data on the prevalence of anxiety levels of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic are still quite limited. The purpose of this study is to find out the level of anxiety of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Denpasar City, Bali, Indonesia. This research is a descriptive research with cross sectional approach conducted on 140 pregnant women who examined their pregnancy at several health centers in Denpasar during February - November 2020 by using a google form containing questions about maternal characteristics and hamilton rating scale for anxiety (HRS-A) questionnaire to measure maternal anxiety levels. The data is analyzed using SPSS 22 program and presented in the form of frequency and percentage tables and graphs. The results showed that 55% of mothers did not experience anxiety, 28.6% of mothers experienced mild anxiety, 12.9% of mothers experienced moderate anxiety and 3.6% of mothers experienced severe anxiety. In general, anxiety in pregnant women can be influenced by the pregnant mother’s characteristics such as age, recent education, occupation, income, pregnancy trimester and maternal gravida status whose prevalence will be further explained in this study.

The article reflects on the domestication of articles 5 and 16 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the status of exploitation, violence and abuse in conventional and traditional mental healthcare in Ghana. Since the enactment of the Ghanaian new and progressive mental health law in 2012, specific measures have been put in place to advance the protection of persons within the mental healthcare setting: mental healthcare workers, including traditional and faith-based practitioners, have been trained on human rights; guidelines have been published; and programmes such as the QualityRights initiative have been launched. A normative analysis, combined with literature review, interviews and field visits, help to uncover barriers impeding implementation of the law and reveal gaps that remain, which automatically leaves room for exploitation, violence and abuse. The paradigm shift from a rather paternalistic approach in mental healthcare to one that promotes and respects autonomy and dignity is slow. There is still much to be desired. This article argues that there is a need to reassess or further define domestic legal provisions allowing for involuntary treatment and restraints, establish a stronger human rights oversight body, strengthen cooperation between the formal and informal mental healthcare providers, and create a legal forum where persons whose rights have been infringed can seek redress. Ultimately, these advancements could ensure that the provided right, namely to be free from exploitation, violence and abuse in mental healthcare, translates into actual change.&#x0D; &#x0D; TITRE ET RÉSUMÉ EN FRANCAIS:&#x0D; Santé mentale et exploitation, violence et abus: l’incorporation en droit interne des articles 5 et 16 de la Charte africaine des droits de l’homme et des peuples et son incidence sur le système conventionnel et traditionnel des soins de santé mentale au Ghana&#x0D; RÉSUMÉ:&#x0D; Cette contribution examine la question des traitements inhumains et dégradants dans la pratique des soins de santé mentale à travers une analyse de l’interaction entre le droit à la santé et le droit de ne pas être soumis à l’exploitation, à la violence et aux abus. L’article se penche sur l’incorporation en droit interne des articles 5 et 16 de la Charte africaine des droits de l’homme et des peuples et sur l’état des lieux de l’exploitation, de la violence et des abus dans les soins de santé mentale conventionnels et traditionnels au Ghana. Depuis que la loi sur la santé mentale au Ghana a été promulguée en 2012, des mesures spécifiques ont été mises en place pour renforcer la protection des personnes impliquées dans le système des soins de santé mentale: des agents de santé mentale, notamment les tradi-thérapeutes et guérisseurs religieux, ont suivi une formation sur les droits de l’homme; des directives ont été publiées; et des programmes tels que l’initiative « Quality Rights » ont été mis en œuvre. Cette contribution se fonde sur une analyse normative et doctrinale, d’entretiens et de visites de terrain pour appréhender les obstacles à la mise en œuvre de la loi et de révéler les lacunes qui subsistent. Ces dernières continuent à causer l’exploitation, la violence et les abus. Le changement de paradigme, c’est-à-dire d’une approche paternaliste en matière de santé mentale vers une approche qui favorise et respecte l’autonomie et la dignité, est plutôt lent. Il reste donc fort à faire. Cette contribution postule qu’il est nécessaire de réévaluer ou de définir les dispositions légales nationales permettant un traitement et des contraintes involontaires, de mettre en place un organe de protection des droits de l’homme plus efficace, de renforcer la coopération entre les prestataires formels et informels de soins de santé mentale et de créer un forum juridique où les victimes des violations des droits de l’homme peuvent demander réparation.

A Bayesian Network was developed and applied to establish conditional dependence relationships among variables for each individual subject studied. These conditional dependencies represented the different states that patients could have adopted in relation to suicidal behavior (SB). The clinical sample included 650 mental health patients with mood and anxiety symptomatology. Results mainly indicated that variables within the Bayesian Network are part of each patient’s state of psychological vulnerability, having the potential to impact such states, and that variables coexist and are relatively stable over time. These results have enabled us to offer a tool to detect states of psychological vulnerability associated with suicide risk. If we accept that suicidal behaviors (vulnerability-ideation-suicidal attempts) exist in constant change and are unstable, we can investigate what happens to individuals at specific moments as doorways toward intervening in a timely manner so as to prevent such behaviors. Future testing of the tool developed in this study is needed, not only in specialized mental health environments, but also in other places with high rates of mental illness such as primary healthcare facilities and educational institutions (schools and universities), among others.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.12078/v1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4232639436", "source": "openalex"}

The urgency of the problem of affective pathology and, above all, depression, due to a number of factors: the growing prevalence of depression, reaching 10.0 % in the population, the high risk of chronic such conditions, their maladaptive impact on social functioning, efficiency and quality of life, the burden of economic costs etc. According to epidemiological indicators in Ukraine over the past 10 years, the incidence of affective disorders has increased by 6.13 %, and the prevalence – by 13.16 %. Impaired thinking and executive functions, decreased concentration and difficulty making decisions are key diagnostic signs of depression. Cognitive impairment (CI) has a cumulative effect on the functionality of patients with depression and is associated with a longer duration of depressive episodes, which indicates the need for its diagnosis and treatment. At the present stage, there are no systematic ideas about the specifics of disorders of executive functions in the presence of different types of depressive disorders (DD), which determines the relevance of the study in this direction. The aim of the study. Describe the executive functions in patients with CI in the presence of DD. Materials and methods. The study included 362 patients with CI in the presence of DD, which were stratified into three groups of comparisons by the mechanism of DD: 123 patients with recurrent depressive disorders (RDD), 141 patients with bipolar affective disorder (BAD) and 98 people with prolonged depressive reaction (PDR). The predominant numbers (38.12 %) of patients with CI in the presence of DD were in adulthood (30-44 years). There were more young people (18-29 years) among patients with PDR (21.43 %, DC = 8.19) and among patients with BAD (31.21 %, DC = 9.82), and middle-aged people (45-59 years) (37.40 %, DC = 1.54) and the elderly (60-74 years) (17.07 %, DC = 4.78) – among patients with RDD. A set of research methods was used: clinical-psychopathological, psychodiagnostic and statistical. Results. Peculiarities of executive functions in patients with CI in the presence of DD were established: the moderate and severe disorders of visual-motor coordination (39.84 % and 19.51 %, respectively) and impaired visual-spatial functions (13.72 %), moderate and severe violations of executive functions (54.47 % and 13.01 %, respectively), moderate, severe and weak violations of the executive function of the lexical system (39.84 %, 32.52 % and 23.58 %, respectively) were present in patients with RDD; the moderate violations of verbal performance (58.54 %); moderate and severe violations of visual-motor coordination (41.13 % and 26.24 %, respectively), executive functions (65.96 % и 21.38 %, respectively), executive functions of the lexical system (47.52 % и 39,01 %, respectively) and verbal productivity (58.16 % and 21.28 % respectively) were found in BAD; absence and weak impairments of visual-motor coordination (45.92 % and 36.73 %, respectively), executive functions (23.47 % and 66.33 %, respectively), executive functions of the lexical system (31.63 % and 45.92 %, respectively) and verbal productivity (26.53 % and 58.16 %, respectively) were presented in patients with PDR. Conclusions. The study revealed the features of executive functions in patients with cognitive impairment in the presence of depressive disorders, which should be taken into account in the algorithm of their psychosocial rehabilitation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.25040/lkv2020.03.046", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3094717525", "source": "openalex"}

Robert Musil und die Krise der Moderne", "text": "Musil stellt in seinem Essay Das Unanständige und Kranke in der Kunst von 1911 die These auf, dass Kunst zwar als psychisch krank Geltendes zum Ausgangspunkt wählen könne, das Dargestellte jedoch weder unanständig noch krank sei. Mit dieser These provoziert Musil im zeitgenössischen Kontext zweifach: Die Grenzen zwischen «psychisch krank» und «psychisch gesund» werden – zumindest in der Kunst und Literatur – irrelevant. Ja, mehr noch: Kunst (Literatur) transformiert, was in Wissenschaft (Soziologie, Psychologie/Psychopathologie/Psychiatrie, Jurisprudenz) und Gesellschaft als psychisch krank gilt, in etwas, das jenseits der Dichotomie von «krank» und «gesund» liegt und sich insofern arbiträren Beurteilungen («entweder» – «oder») entzieht. Gerade im psychisch Kranken, der anders denkt, anders fühlt, anders wahrnimmt und anders handelt als die Norm, in seiner Alterität steckt für Musil ein Entwicklungspotential des Menschen, das die normierte und normierende Gesellschaft ignoriert und/oder aus Angst vor dem Unbekannten ausgrenzt, indem sie es moralisch verurteilt und kriminalisiert. Insofern ist das erkenntnisleitende Interesse Musils im Essay genuin ethisch; der Erkenntnisgewinn besteht Musil zufolge in der Pluralität von Optionen im Denken, Fühlen und Handeln. Provokant ist nicht nur Musils These selbst, sondern auch und sogar noch provokanter ist der Testfall, an dem Musil seine These exemplifiziert: dem des Sexualmörders Moosbrugger im Mann ohne Eigenschaften. Während beispielsweise ein Psychologe Urteile über den psychischen Zustand eines Menschen eindeutig, das heisst nicht arbiträr und damit wissenschaftlich valide, trifft oder – so Musil – eher meint treffen zu können, beginnen diese im Medium der Literatur, als Dargestelltes, zu oszillieren. Vorliegender Beitrag analysiert Musils Argumentation im Essay mit Bezug auf den Testfall Moosbrugger im Kontext der zeitgenössischen Psychologie und Psychiatrie, zeigt, worin die Spezifik von Musils in seinem Essay formulierte These besteht, und erörtert ihre Validität sowie die Folgen für die Kunst.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.24445/conexus.2020.03.008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3109394754", "source": "openalex"}

As curative care is prioritized, public mental health is inundated with deep-seated problems, primarily due to the lack of funding. From an ethical perspective, such underlying issues in public mental health exist regardless of income levels; they are, however, further exacerbated by the lack of resources and awareness in LAMICs. Ironically, the ethics of public mental health have received much less attention than that of psychiatric research. We therefore use a public health ethics framework to broaden the ethical perspective in public mental health and examine it from a low-resource setting viewpoint. Next, we examine public mental health from a social justice perspective.

From Le libere donne di Magliano (1953), by Tuscan psychiatrist and writer Mario Tobino, many writings produced around the years of the Basaglia reform and in the following decades have openly engaged with the dark present and past of psychiatric hospitals. However, while the shocking personal testimonies and photographic and audio-visual records of internment that supported and promoted the Basaglia reform are being reassessed today as tangible acts of memory, less attention has been given to the literary representations of asylums and their role as a medium of memory for a twenty-first-century readership. This has become clear in the years around the thirtieth anniversary of the Law 180/78, when the contemporary representations of the Italian teatro di narrazione significantly dealt with the theme of the internment, seeking to debunk the cultural myths surrounding psychiatric hospitals and their patients. This thesis seeks to address this gap by arguing that the literary discourse on mental hospitals in Italy has focused on the intricate relationship between cultural perceptions of mental disorders, personal experience of treatment and internment, and their legacy on the country’s collective memory. I structure my analysis within the intersection of two main theoretical frameworks: the first refers to the recent psychiatric and historical assessments of the Italian psychiatric confinement, and the second draws from theoretical conceptualisations of the relationship between literary genres and collective memory. To do this, I consider three literary genres that have played a significant role in this debate, each within their specific conventions: the memoir, the novel and narrative theatre. After introducing the discourse on the perception of mental confinement through a review of its representations in different media, I discuss the memoir in depth, focussing on Tobino’s three published diaries, Alda Merini’s L’altra verità. Diario di una diversa (1986) and Fabrizia Ramondino’s Passaggio a Trieste (2000). This is followed by a thorough analysis of the relationship between the novel and the psychiatric institution through the reading of Tobino’s Per le antiche scale. Una storia (1972), Italo Calvino’s La giornata d’uno scrutatore (1963) and Luca Masali’s La vergine delle ossa (2010). Finally, I discuss Ascanio Celestini’s La pecora nera. Elogio funebre del manicomio elettrico (2006), Renato Sarti’s Muri. Prima e dopo Basaglia (2008) and Marco Paolini’s Ausmerzen. Vite indegne di essere vissute (2012), in the context of narrative theatre. Through my analysis of these texts and theatrical performances, I show how the manicomio gradually acquires the status of lieu de mémoire in contemporary Italian writing. Depicting, criticising and remembering the asylum, contemporary literary writings have responded to its disappearance as a physical space by rethinking it as a metaphorical means of understanding the present. Progressively challenging a literary tradition which struggled to give voice to the experience of mental disorder, these depictions have recognized persistent forms of social exclusion in contemporary Italy and highlighted the pressing need for a new culture of representing internment.&lt;/p&gt;", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17136245", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4256225895", "source": "openalex"}

This is followed by a thorough analysis of the relationship between the novel and the psychiatric institution through the reading of Tobino’s Per le antiche scale. Una storia (1972), Italo Calvino’s La giornata d’uno scrutatore (1963) and Luca Masali’s La vergine delle ossa (2010). Finally, I discuss Ascanio Celestini’s La pecora nera. Elogio funebre del manicomio elettrico (2006), Renato Sarti’s Muri. Prima e dopo Basaglia (2008) and Marco Paolini’s Ausmerzen. Vite indegne di essere vissute (2012), in the context of narrative theatre. Through my analysis of these texts and theatrical performances, I show how the manicomio gradually acquires the status of lieu de mémoire in contemporary Italian writing. Depicting, criticising and remembering the asylum, contemporary literary writings have responded to its disappearance as a physical space by rethinking it as a metaphorical means of understanding the present. Progressively challenging a literary tradition which struggled to give voice to the experience of mental disorder, these depictions have recognized persistent forms of social exclusion in contemporary Italy and highlighted the pressing need for a new culture of representing internment.&lt;/p&gt;", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17136245.v1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4375801344", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2581700379", "title": "Children's responses to violence: resisting misunderstanding", "text": "I have found that when young people begin to acknowledge their own history of responses to, and resistance against violence an awareness of their pre-existing capacities takes precedence over a focus on deficiencies. There is liberation in the knowledge that they are active rather than passive agents, and did not ask for, nor deserve violence. To neglect the full range of contextual and interactional details surrounding violence is to risk completely misunderstanding the child. Theories or assessments which do not take into account the context of a young person who has suffered, particularly violence of human design, will likely become part of the dominant discourse that blame and pathologize youths. The consequence of theories that assume the experience of violence is not important have a direct impact on the social responses that young people receive from professionals, family members, and their other important social relationships. Further, such omissions tend to benefit perpetrators and create less safety for young people over all. A more fulsome explanation of what this means will be provided throughout this thesis. Another issue of concern when working with youth is that dominantly, professionals and members of society use language that minimizes violence and abuse. For example, we call harassment and assault “bullying” which minimizes the representation of violence as well as the harm done to the victim. We use language for sexualized assault such as “date-rape,” which presents the motive of rape as somehow connected to romance, as if it was a simple misunderstanding rather than a calculated attack. We mutualize beatings as “conflict,” which presents the victim as having a role in the conflict and being responsible for the conflict and the corresponding solution. Perpetrators of violence are often excused and victims blamed. Through my narrative and discourse analysis of three accounts provided by young people who were victims of violence and adversity, I have demonstrated their ever-present resistance and capacities through their micro interactions with perpetrators. Victims of violence always respond and resist; at all ages (Coates & Wade, 2007; Wade, 1997). Violence is interactional—it requires at least one victim and offender. In order to understand what has occurred, a detailed account is required from each person, inclusive of the social responses that were received. This research challenges the dominant discourse of victim blaming and the secondary assault of pathology, while emphasizing the Response-based and social constructionist views of interaction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3990/1.6046148", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2581700379", "source": "openalex"}

Thus, little is known about the gene expression profile in suicides with SUD. The identification of altered biological processes in the brain of suicides with SUD is crucial in the comprehension of the SUD and suicidal behavior comorbidity. This dissertation describes the evaluation of gene expression differences in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of suicides and non-suicides with and without SUD.Sixty-six brain tissue samples were collected and classified in the following groups: i) 23 suicides with SUD, ii) 20 suicides without SUD, iii) 9 non-suicides with SUD and iv) 14 non-suicides without SUD. The results of this study suggest that suicides with SUD have a gene expression profile in the prefrontal cortex different from that of individuals with only one of these conditions, presenting differences in the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and glutamatergic neurotransmission.We performed a re-analysis of the gene expression data of 38 suicides focused on dual diagnosis and suicide. Dual diagnosis is the concurrence of at least one SUD and one or more mental disorders in a given individual. Although this comorbidity is highly prevalent and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, its neurobiology has not been elucidated. In addition, patients with dual pathology have a higher suicide risk compared to patients with only one disorder.The objective of this re-analysis was to evaluate the differences in the gene expression profile in the prefrontal cortex of suicides with dual pathology compared to suicides with a single disorder. Our results suggest an alteration in the expression of genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission, GABAergic neurotransmission and neurogenesis in suicides with dual diagnosis compared to suicides with a single disorder and suicides without mental comorbidities.The observed differences in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex between suicides with and without SUD, as well as suicides with dual diagnosis and a single disorder may contribute to the phenotypic and clinical discrepancies observed among these patients. The identification of molecular characteristics in the brain of individuals with suicidal behavior and psychiatric comorbidities will allow the design of preventive and therapeutic measures aimed at the adequate treatment of each comorbidity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/cmvjb", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4242086790", "source": "openalex"}
