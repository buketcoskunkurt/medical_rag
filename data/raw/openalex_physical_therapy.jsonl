It aims to identify the source countries of medical travelers, to understand their reasons for seeking out-of-country care, the type of services they obtained, and their level of satisfaction with the experience. Cost, physician and facility reputation and hospital accreditation were ranked as the most important factors in choosing out-of-country care. Wait times at home or lack of access to care were important motivations for international medical travel. Patient assessment of treatment outcomes is as high as might be found in similar assessments in high-income country facilities. Certain forms of treatment sought by respondents (i.e. organ transplantation) raise specific ethical concerns. Also of concern is that the present health systems in all four countries fail to adequately meet the health needs of their population (notably poorer groups). Evidence and inference strongly suggest that access to health care for poorer groups will worsen in these countries as medical tourism increases, at least in the short term, raising generic ethical and policy challenges over the extent to which access to essential health care by poorer persons is compromised by the public subsidization or promotion of medical tourism.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1468018110380003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1971581404", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure. Data Availability: Data are available from the public sources cited in the text.

Our goal was to identify the risk factors related to self-injury among depressed British Columbian youth. Ultimately, the goal of the study was to develop a profile that would allow health care workers and parents to identify depressed youth who may self-injure. -- P.17.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.24124/2007/bpgub494", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4251948765", "source": "openalex"}
