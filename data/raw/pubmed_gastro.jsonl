The following recommendations target patients presenting with acute GI bleeding: For patients on warfarin, we suggest against giving fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K; if needed, we suggest prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) compared with fresh frozen plasma administration; for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), we suggest against PCC administration; if on dabigatran, we suggest against the administration of idarucizumab, and if on rivaroxaban or apixaban, we suggest against andexanet alfa administration; for patients on antiplatelet agents, we suggest against platelet transfusions; and for patients on cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for secondary prevention, we suggest against holding it, but if the ASA has been interrupted, we suggest resumption on the day hemostasis is endoscopically confirmed. The following recommendations target patients in the elective (planned) endoscopy setting: For patients on warfarin, we suggest continuation as opposed to temporary interruption (1-7 days), but if it is held for procedures with high risk of GI bleeding, we suggest against bridging anticoagulation unless the patient has a mechanical heart valve; for patients on DOACs, we suggest temporarily interrupting rather than continuing these; for patients on dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention, we suggest temporary interruption of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor while continuing ASA; and if on cardiac ASA monotherapy for secondary prevention, we suggest against its interruption. Evidence was insufficient in the following settings to permit recommendations. With acute GI bleeding in patients on warfarin, we could not recommend for or against PCC administration when compared with placebo. In the elective periprocedural endoscopy setting, we could not recommend for or against temporary interruption of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for patients on a single P2Y12 inhibiting agent. We were also unable to make a recommendation regarding same-day resumption of the drug vs 1-7 days after the procedure among patients prescribed anticoagulants (warfarin or DOACs) or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor drugs because of insufficient evidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35297395/"}

The integration of \"advanced endoscopy\" within the practice of hepatology is nowadays referred to as \"endo-hepatology\". In essence, endo-hepatology consists of two pillars: one focusing primarily on disorders of the liver parenchyma, vascular disorders, and portal hypertension, which is mainly captured via EUS, while the other targets the hepatobiliary tract via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and advanced imaging. Applications under the umbrella of endo-hepatology include, amongst others, EUS-guided liver biopsy, EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement, coil and glue embolisation of gastric varices as well as cholangioscopy.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has been defined as a purely \"functional\" type of renal failure that often occurs in patients with cirrhosis in the setting of marked abnormalities in arterial circulation, as well as overactivity of the endogenous vasoactive systems.<sup>4,5</sup> In 2007, the International Club of Ascites (ICA) classified HRS into types 1 and 2 (HRS-1 and HRS-2).<sup>5</sup> HRS-1 is characterised by a rapid deterioration of renal function that often occurs because of a precipitating event, while HRS-2 is a moderate and stable or slowly progressive renal dysfunction that often occurs without an obvious precipitant. Clinically, HRS-1 is characterised by acute renal failure while HRS-2 is mainly characterised by refractory ascites. Nevertheless, after these two entities were first described, new concepts, definitions, and diagnostic criteria have been developed by nephrologists for renal dysfunction in the general population and hospitalised patients. In particular, the definitions and characterisation of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease have been introduced/refined.<sup>6</sup> Accordingly, a debate among hepatologists of the ICA led to a complete revision of the nomenclature and diagnosistic criteria for HRS-1, which was renamed HRS-AKI.<sup>7</sup> Additionally, over recent years, greater granularity has been gained regarding the pathogenesis of HRS; it is now increasingly recognised that it is not a purely \"functional\" entity with haemodynamic derangements, but that systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and bile salt-related tubular damage may contribute significantly to its development. That is, HRS has an additional structural component that would not only make traditional diagnostic criteria less reliable, but would explain the lack of response to pharmacological treatment with vasoconstrictors plus albumin that correlates with a progressive increase in inflammation. Because classification, nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and pathogenic theories have evolved over the years since the traditional classification of HRS-1 and HRS-2 was first described, it was considered that all these novel aspects be reviewed and summarised in a position paper. The aim of this position paper authored by two hepatologists (members of ICA) and two nephrologists involved in the study of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, is to complete the re-classification of HRS initiated by the ICA in 2012 and to provide an update on the definition, classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of HRS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302175/"}

Under increasing time pressure, physicians rely more on technology than face-to-face time gathering data to make clinical decisions. As a result, they find it more challenging to understand the illness context and fully address patient needs. Patients experience dissatisfaction and a diminution of their role in the care process. For patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, stigma leads to greater care dissatisfaction, as there is no apparent structural basis to legitimize the symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that practical communication skills can improve the patient-provider relationship (PPR) and clinical outcomes, but these data are limited. The Rome Foundation convened a multidisciplinary working team to review the scientific evidence with the following aims: a) to study the effect of communication skills on patient satisfaction and outcomes by performing an evidence-based review; b) to characterize the influence of sociocultural factors, health care system constraints, patient perspective, and telehealth on the PPR; c) to review the measurement and impact of communication skills training on these outcomes; and d) to make recommendations to improve communication skills training and the PPR. Evidence supports the fact that interventions targeting patient-provider interactions improve population health, patient and provider experience, and costs. Communication skills training leads to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes. The following are relevant factors to consider in establishing an effective PPR: addressing health care system constraints; incorporating sociocultural factors and the role of gender, age, and chronic illness; and considering the changing role of telehealth on the PPR. We concluded that effective communication skills can improve the PPR and health outcomes. This is an achievable goal through training and system change.

In the field of medicine, the main trade-off was the creation of many medical specialties that commonly treat patients in advanced stages of disease. However, now that we are immersed in the post-genomic era, how should we reevaluate medicine? Genomic medicine has evoked a medical paradigm shift based on the plausibility to predict the genetic susceptibility to disease. Additionally, the development of chronic diseases should be viewed as a continuum of interactions between the individual's genetic make-up and environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and emotions. Thus, personalized medicine is aimed at preventing or reversing clinical symptoms, and providing a better quality of life by integrating the genetic, environmental and cultural factors of diseases.

Mechanical simulators and VR simulators are frequently used early in training, whereas ex vivo and in vivo animal models are more commonly used for advanced endoscopy training. Multiple studies and systematic reviews show that simulation-based training appears to provide novice endoscopists with some advantage over untrained peers with regard to endpoints such as independent procedure completion and performance time, among others. Data also suggest that simulation training may accelerate the acquisition of specific technical skills in colonoscopy and upper endoscopy early in training. However, the available literature suggests that the benefits of simulator training appear to attenuate and cease after a finite period. Further studies are needed to determine if meeting competency metrics using simulation will predict actual clinical competency. Simulation training is a promising modality that may aid in endoscopic education. However, for widespread incorporation of simulators into gastroenterology training programs to occur, simulators must show a sustained advantage over traditional mentored teaching in a cost-effective manner.

OBJECTIVES Describe the history of pediatric gastroenterology's development in Cuba since its inception at the National Gastroenterology Institute in the early 1970s, its contributions, and efforts to extend it to pediatric hospitals throughout Cuba. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION This is a historical review based on document analysis. Institutional sources from the National Gastroenterology Institute and Ministry of Public Health were reviewed, as well as international and national literature on the history of pediatric gastroenterology and unpublished texts since its emergence in 1972. DEVELOPMENT Although pediatric gastroenterology has not been formally recognized as a medical specialty in Cuba, there have been important achievements in establishing a network of specialized health care services for digestive diseases of children and adolescents. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and other auxiliary diagnostic modalities have been introduced for children and play a major role in clinical trials and research. This article describes the international context that promoted the specialty's development in Cuba. Reference is made to specialized training from its initial stages in 1972, its consolidation as an emerging discipline in Cuban medicine, and its diffusion in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Professional development and specialized training to meet health human resource needs in pediatric hospitals are described, as well as Cuban participation in the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. National and international milestones, publications, awards and recognitions that indicate advances despite difficulties are also presented. CONCLUSIONS Since 1972, there have been major strides in the development of pediatric gastroenterology practice in Cuba. The establishment of a national network of specialized services in pediatric hospitals throughout Cuba has provided quality health care for digestive diseases of childhood. Pediatric gastroenterology's development and achievements in healthcare and research are such that it deserves official recognition as a medical specialty Cuba.

Both types of conditions may impair the nutritional status of patients - In the case of motility disorders, because deficient gastrointestinal motility may impair appropriate food digestion and absorption; in DGBI because development of gastrointestinal symptoms may impair appropriate patient nutrition. In both cases, different studies have shown that patients start restrictive diets on their own, without supervision of a dietician, which leads to nutritional deficits in many cases. Likewise, psychological factors like stressful situations or anxiety may trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients, mainly in those with DGBI. Recent studies comparing a patient-centered approach that includes medical treatment, dietary modifications, and behavioural interventions with gastroenterologist-only standard care have shown a greater proportion of improved symptoms, psychological status, and quality of life, as well as reduced costs in patients allocated to the multidisciplinary treatment arm. In conclusion, there is growing evidence in favour of dietary and behavioural interventions by specialized professionals, coupled with appropriate medical evaluation and treatment by a gastroenterologist.

Because patients with chronic diseases account for substantial use of health care resources, payers and health systems are focusing on maximizing the value of care for these patients. Because chronic liver diseases impose a major health burden worldwide affecting the health and lives of many individuals and families as well as substantial costs for individuals and payers, hepatologists must understand how they can improve their practices. Hepatologists practice a high-intensity cognitive subspecialty, using complex and costly procedures and medications. High-value patient care requires multidisciplinary coordination, labor-intensive support for critically ill patients, and effective chronic disease management. Under current fee-for-service reimbursement, patient values, medical success, and financial success can all be misaligned. Many current attempts to link health outcomes to reimbursement are based on compliance with process measures, with less emphasis on outcomes that matter most to patients, thus slowing transformation to higher-value team-based care. Outcome measures that reflect the entire cycle of care are needed to assist both clinicians and administrators in improving the quality and value of care. A comprehensive set of outcome measures for liver diseases is not currently available. Numerous researchers now are attempting to fill this gap by devising and testing outcome indicators and patient-reported outcomes for the major liver conditions. These indicators will provide tools to implement a value-based approach for patients with chronic liver diseases to compare results and value of care between referral centers, to perform health technology assessment, and to guide decision-making processes for health authorities.

The state-of-the-art and my personal journey.", "text": "In this paper, I reviewed the emerging field of endoscopic surgery and present data supporting the contention that endoscopy can now be used to treat many foregut diseases that have been traditionally treated surgically. Within each topic, the content will progress as follows: \"lessons learned\", \"technical considerations\" and \"future opportunities\". Lessons learned will provide a brief background and update on the most current literature. Technical considerations will include my personal experience, including tips and tricks that I have learned over the years. Finally, future opportunities will address current unmet needs and potential new areas of development. The foregut is defined as \"the upper part of the embryonic alimentary canal from which the pharynx, esophagus, lung, stomach, liver, pancreas, and part of the duodenum develop\". Foregut surgery is well established in treating conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), achalasia, esophageal diverticula, Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, gastric-outlet obstruction, and obesity. Over the past decade, remarkable progress in interventional endoscopy has culminated in the conceptualization and practice of endoscopic foregut surgery for various clinical conditions summarized in this paper. Regarding GERD, there are now several technologies available to effectively treat it and potentially eliminate symptoms, and the need for long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors. For the first time, fundoplication can be performed without the need for open or laparoscopic surgery. Long-term data going out 5-10 years are now emerging showing extended durability. In respect to achalasia, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) which was developed in Japan, has become an alternative to the traditional Heller's myotomy. Recent meta-analysis show that POEM may have better results than Heller, but the issue of post-POEM GERD still needs to be addressed. There is now a resurgence of endoscopic treatment of Zenker's diverticula with improved technique (Z-POEM) and equipment; thus, patients are choosing flexible endoscopic treatment as opposed to open or rigid endoscopy options. In regard to BE, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) which is well established in Asia, is now becoming more mainstream in the West for the treatment of BE with high grade dysplasia, as well as early esophageal cancer. In combination with all the ablation technologies (radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, hybrid argon plasma coagulation), the entire spectrum of Barrett's and related dysplasia and early cancer can be managed predominantly by endoscopy. Importantly, in regard to early gastric cancer and submucosal tumors (SMTs) of the stomach, ESD and full thickness resection (FTR) can excise these lesions <i>en-bloc</i> and endoscopic suturing is now used to close large defects and perforations. For treatment of patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), endoscopic gastro-jejunostomy is now showing better results than enteral stenting. G-POEM is also emerging as a treatment option for patients with gastroparesis. Obesity has become an epidemic in many western countries and is becoming also prevalent in Asia. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is now becoming an established treatment option, especially for obese patients with body mass index between 30 and 35. Data show an average weight loss of 16 kg after ESG with long-term data confirming sustainability. Finally, in respect to endo-hepatology, there are many new endoscopic interventions that have been developed for patients with liver disease. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided liver biopsy and EUS-guided portal pressure measurement are exciting new frontiers for the endo-hepatologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643356/"}

These evidence-based guidelines, developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology with international collaboration, are the first to specifically address the endoscopic management of these conditions, aiming to support patients, clinicians, and others in making informed decisions. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology formed a guideline panel with a balanced representation to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Cochrane Gut Group supported the guideline-development process, including conducting literature searches and performing systematic reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used, including developing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, which underwent public comment. The panel formulated 19 conditional recommendations for adult patients with nonvariceal, nonpeptic ulcer bleeding due to malignant tumors, MWTs, Dieulafoy's lesions, and gastric antral vascular ectasia. For patients with active bleeding from malignant tumors, the panel suggested topical hemostatic agents over conventional endoscopic hemostatic therapy; it also suggested the administration of oncologic therapy after the endoscopic intervention. In patients with active bleeding from MWTs (oozing and spurting), the panel suggested endoscopic band ligation or endoscopic through-the-scope clip over epinephrine injection alone. For nonbleeding MWTs with visible vessels, adherent clots, flat pigmented spots, or clean-based ulcers, the panel suggested against endoscopic hemostatic therapy. For Dieulafoy's lesions, the panel suggested mechanical modalities with endoscopic band ligation or through-the-scope clip, contact thermocoagulation, or injection of sclerosants over epinephrine injection alone. For patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia, the panel suggested endoscopic band ligation over argon plasma coagulation.

We executed a consensus-based international strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Four general coordinators, six field coordinators, and 12 experts participated in the study. SWOTs were provided for the following fields: neurogastroenterology, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and upper gastrointestinal diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; pancreatology and biliary diseases; endoscopy; gastrointestinal oncology; and hepatology. The GASTROSWOT analysis highlights the following in the current state of the field of gastroenterology: the incidence and complexity of several gastrointestinal diseases, including malignancies, are increasing; the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patient care on several levels; and with the advent of technical innovations in gastroenterology, a well trained workforce and strategic planning are required to optimise health-care utilisation. The analysis calls attention to the following in the future of gastroenterology: artificial intelligence and the use of big data will speed up discovery and smarter health-care provision in the field; the growth and diversification of gastroenterological specialties will improve specialised care for patients, but could promote fragmentation of care and health system inefficiencies; and furthermore, thoughtful planning is needed to reach an effective balance between the need for subspecialists and the value of general gastroenterology services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35247318/"}

Population-based studies have been frequent and follow-up studies have been able to describe the temporal trends and changes in phenotypes. Our ability in Scandinavia to follow up defined groups of patients over time has been crucial to learn the natural history of many gastrointestinal and liver diseases and often in a population-based setting.

As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, extrapulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 have emerged, especially in the digestive system. While the respiratory mode of transmission is well known and is probably the principal mode of transmission of this disease, a possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenarios. In this review article, we summarize four different aspects in published studies to date: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19; (b) microbiological and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the digestive endoscopy room.

Insufficient resources have been allocated to develop AU units in many GI units where AUs are performed. The equipment is obsolete and there are no adaptations to the needs of the GI specialist to provide good medical care. Thus, due to all the above, the AU does not hold the position it deserves in our specialty. This probably stems from a lack of impulse and/or support to the technique, which has underestimated its usefulness and has limited the implementation of resources in the GI units. For the AU to overcome these obstacles, it needs to be considered as a process or a series of activities based on scientific evidence and the experience of professionals that achieves a result that covers the patients' needs with minimal risk.

Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) suffer from a high symptom burden and a deteriorated quality of life (QOL), with uncertain prognosis and limited treatment options. Caregivers of these patients also bear an emotional and physical burden similar to that of caregivers for patients with cancer. Despite the proven benefits of nonhospice PC for other serious illnesses and cancer, there are no evidence-based structures and processes to support its integration within the routine care of patients with ESLD and their caregivers. In this article, we review the current state of PC for ESLD and propose key structures and processes to integrate nonhospice PC within routine hepatology practice. Results found that PC is highly underutilized within ESLD care, and limited prospective studies are available to demonstrate methods to integrate PC within routine hepatology practices. Hepatology providers report lack of training to deliver PC along with no clear prognostic criteria on when to initiate PC. A well-informed model with key structures and processes for nonhospice PC integration would allow hepatology providers to improve clinical outcomes and QOL for patients with ESLD and reduce health care costs. Educating hepatology providers about PC principles and developing clear prognostic criteria for when and how to integrate PC on the basis of individual patient needs are the initial steps to inform the integration. The fields of nonhospice PC and hepatology have ample opportunities to partner clinically and academically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167615/"}

A survey was distributed through the friends of United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Young Talent Group network to physicians working in a UEG member or associated states who regularly performed ERCPs. Of 1035 respondents from 35 countries, 649 were eligible for analysis: 228 trainees, 225 trainers, and 196 individuals who regularly performed ERCP but were neither trainees nor trainers. The mean age was 43 years, with 72.1% identifying as male, 27.6% as female, and 0.3% as non-binary. The majority (80.1%) agreed that a structured training regimen is desirable. However, only 13.7% of trainees and 28.4% of trainers reported having such a structured program in their institutions. Most respondents (79.7%) supported the concept of concentrating training in centers meeting specific quality metrics, with 64.1% suggesting a threshold of 200 annual ERCPs as a prerequisite. This threshold revealed that 36.4% of trainees pursued training in lower-volume centers performing <200 ERCPs annually. As many as 70.1% of trainees performed <50 annual ERCPs, whereas only 5.0% of trainers performed <50 ERCPs annually. A low individual trainee caseload (<50 ERCPs annually) was more common in lower-volume centers than in higher-volume centers (82.9% vs. 63.4%). The first pan-European survey investigating ERCP training conditions reveals strong support for structured training and the concentration of training efforts within centers meeting specific quality metrics. Furthermore, this survey exposes the low availability of structured training programs with many trainees practicing at lower-volume centers and 71% of all trainees having little hands-on exposure.

Feeding involves a process of sequential, neurosensory, and neuromotor interactions of reflexes and behaviors facilitating ingestion. Swallowing involves anterograde bolus movement during oral-, pharyngeal-, and esophageal phases of peristalsis into stomach. During these events, coordination with airway protection is vital for homeostasis in clearing any material away from airway vicinity. Neurological-airway-digestive inter-relationships are critical to the continuum of successful feeding patterns during infancy, either in health or disease. Neonatal feeding difficulties encompass a heterogeneous group of neurological, pulmonary, and aerodigestive disorders that present with multiple signs posing as clinical conundrums. Significant research breakthroughs permitted understanding of vagal neural pathways and functional aerodigestive connectivity involved in regulating swallowing and aerodigestive functions either directly or indirectly by influencing the supra-nuclear regulatory centers and peripheral effector organs. These neurosensory and neuromotor pathways are influenced by pathologies during perinatal events, prematurity, inflammatory states, and coexisting medical and surgical conditions. Approaches to clarify pathophysiologic mapping of aerodigestive interactions, as well as translating these discoveries into the development of personalized and simplified feeding strategies to advance child health are discussed in this review article.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28044203/"}

The workshop aimed to provide a roadmap to help strategically guide research efforts during the next decade. Attendees were a diverse group of internationally recognized leaders in basic and clinical FBD research. This document summarizes the results of their deliberations, including the following general conclusions and recommendations. First, the high prevalence, economic burden, and impact on quality of life associated with FBDs necessitate an urgent need for improved understanding of FBDs. Second, preclinical discoveries are at a point that they can be realistically translated into novel diagnostic tests and treatments. Third, FBDs are broadly accepted as bidirectional disorders of the brain-gut axis, differentially affecting individuals throughout life. Research must integrate each component of the brain-gut axis and the influence of biological sex, early-life stressors, and genetic and epigenetic factors in individual patients. Fourth, research priorities to improve diagnostic and management paradigms include enhancement of the provider-patient relationship, longitudinal studies to identify risk and protective factors of FBDs, identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes in symptom severity and treatment response, and incorporation of emerging \"-omics\" discoveries. These paradigms can be applied by well-trained clinicians who are familiar with multimodal treatments. Fifth, essential components of a successful program will include the generation of a large, validated, broadly accessible database that is rigorously phenotyped; a parallel, linkable biorepository; dedicated resources to support peer-reviewed, hypothesis-driven research; access to dedicated bioinformatics expertise; and oversight by funding agencies to review priorities, progress, and potential synergies with relevant stakeholders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29288656/"}

A Delphi consensus was performed with experts from various disciplines who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 41 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus was reached for all the statements. The panel agreed with the definition and prevalence of esophageal and OD types. The role of endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, EndoFLIP, barium swallow and other imaging tests in evaluating esophageal dysphagia has reached overall strong agreement. Videofluoroscopic swallow study, alongside fiber-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, as the methods of choice for the instrumental assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction is a strong recommendation. Regarding treatment, a weak recommendation was achieved for the use of PPIs, calcium-channel blockers, nitrates, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, antidepressants or peppermint oil for the treatment of hypercontractile esophagus. A strong recommendation exists for endoscopic and surgical treatment of achalasia, while a weak recommendation is provided for other esophageal motility disorders. Regarding OD, a weak recommendation was achieved for swallow therapy, to improve swallowing mechanics, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life.

As the entire field of gastroenterology continues towards less invasive, safer and more effective means of diagnosing and treating diseases, digestive endoscopy will continue to expand the ways in which this unique and minimally invasive technology can be applied to the benefit of patients. In line with this trend, there will be a decline in simple diagnostic standard endoscopies. Development of new techniques, such as CT colonography and capsule endoscopy will actually increase the demand for digestive endoscopy. The trend of future digestive endoscopy will continue to move from diagnostic to therapeutic modalities. Future gastroenterologists will be trained and expected to become micro-surgeons of the gastrointestinal tract working in multispecialty teams along with their colleagues: surgeons and radiologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21429447/"}

As such, any observed phenotypic changes including organ development, aging, and the occurrence of disease could be driven by epigenetic mechanisms in the presence of stable cellular DNA sequences. Indeed, with the exception of rare mutations, the human genome-sequence has remained remarkably stable over the past centuries. In contrast, substantial changes to our environment as part of our modern life style have not only led to a significant reduction of certain infectious diseases but also seen the exponential increase in complex traits including obesity and multifactorial diseases such as autoimmune disorders. It is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms operate at the interface between the genetic code and our environment, and a large body of existing evidence supports the importance of environmental factors such as diet and nutrition, infections, and exposure to toxins on human health. This seems to be particularly the case during vulnerable periods of human development such as pregnancy and early life. Importantly, as the first point of contact for many of such environmental factors including nutrition, the digestive system is being increasingly linked to a number of \"modern\" pathologies. In this review article, we aim to give a brief introduction to the basic molecular principals of epigenetics and provide a concise summary of the existing evidence for the role of epigenetic mechanisms in gastrointestinal health and disease, hepatology, and nutrition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26628441/"}

The 'Mother' of Paediatric Gastroenterology was Australian Charlotte ('Charlo') Anderson who established one of the world's first pediatric gastroenterology units in Melbourne in the early 1960s. Her earlier work in Birmingham had identified gluten as the component of wheat responsible for celiac disease and helped separate maldigestion (cystic fibrosis) and mucosal malabsorption. The first comprehensive textbook of Paediatric Gastroenterology was edited by Charlotte Anderson and Valerie Burke in 1975. Rudge Townley succeeded Charlotte Anderson in Melbourne and went on to further develop small bowel biopsy techniques making it a safe, simple, and quick procedure that led to much greater understanding of small bowel disease and ultimately the discovery of Rotavirus by Ruth Bishop et al. and subsequently to Rotavirus immunization. Australian Paediatric Gastroenterology subsequently developed rapidly with units being established in all mainland capital cities by the end of the 1970s. The Australian Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (AuSPGHAN) was established in the 1980s. Australians have contributed significantly in many areas of gastroenterology in infants, children, and adolescents including celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, liver disease, transplantation, gastrointestinal infection, allergy, indigenous health, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal motility, and the development of novel tests of gastrointestinal function and basic science. There have also been major contributions to nutrition in cystic fibrosis, end-stage liver disease, and intestinal failure.

This review considers recent advances in technology such as high-resolution manometry (HRM) with esophageal pressure topography (EPT), HRM with impedance, high frequency ultrasound, and endoscopic functional luminal impedance planimetry (Endo-FLIP) that provide new opportunities to identify the pathophysiologic basis of esophageal symptoms and disease. As experience with these new devices increases researchers are developing new methodologies that maximize their utility in clinical practice. For example, application of HRM to assess motility and function during and after a test meal can identify the causes of swallowing problems, reflux and other postprandial symptoms and intra-operative application of Endo-FLIP may help surgeons perform antireflux surgery.

Though multidisciplinary care models integrating addiction medicine, hepatology, and social workers, with established training for health professionals on ALD-related stigma can address this treatment gap, numerous barriers exist, which include a lack of addiction providers, insufficient training in addiction amongst primary care and non-addiction medicine providers, limited knowledge and negative beliefs regarding AUD pharmacotherapy, and negative attitudes of clinicians towards patients with AUD. In this issue of Digestive Disease and Sciences, Jagdish et al. implemented a one-hour educational intervention for gastroenterology fellows at a tertiary academic care center consisting of a formal lecture presentation created in collaboration with an addiction medicine specialist. By sharing their work in increasing confidence in addiction medicine-guided training for gastroenterology fellows and highlighting perceived attitudes of providers charged with caring for this vulnerable patient population, progress can be made for health professional trainees in screening, diagnosis, and initial management of AUD to improve access to multidisciplinary, life-saving care for patients with ALD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40512451/"}

Despite its proved clinical utility for staging gastrointestinal (and lung) cancers, and its use in delineating the nature of \"submucosal\" tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, EUS has continued to evolve. Within the past 10 years, the safety and efficacy of EUS as a means of guiding tissue acquisition via fine-needle aspiration has been demonstrated, increasing its utility in gastrointestinal oncology. Newer indications currently under clinical investigation include the use of EUS as a delivery mechanism for novel immune-based and viral-based \"chemo\" therapeutic agents for patients with pancreatic cancer. Finally, the role of EUS as a reliable method to guide therapy to control the often refractory abdominal pain in patients with pancreatic cancer and/or chronic pancreatitis is being verified in clinical trials. The following is a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in interventional EUS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10599631/"}

Histories of trauma are especially common in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) illness. Trauma reactions can arise in GI settings, but healthcare providers may not recognize these reactions or know how to respond effectively. We aimed to increase awareness and understanding of the relationship between trauma and GI symptoms, trauma reactions in a healthcare setting, strategies for responding to patients in emotional distress, and opportunities to reduce risk of retraumatization in a GI setting. Within a larger initiative to enhance behavioral healthcare access and engagement in a GI setting, patient and stakeholder interviews were conducted, and a needs assessment survey was administered. Interview and survey findings informed development of innovative solutions to the identified need for improved trauma services and resources using an iterative, team-based approach. Programs and resources were developed and implemented to increase recognition of the impact of trauma, improve responses to trauma reactions during encounters with patients (e.g., clinical and procedure visits, telephone calls), and provide support to patients receiving GI care. Trauma-focused programming specific to the needs of patients with GI conditions is desired by patients, providers, and staff.

A questionnaire comprised of clinical vignettes with multiple-choice questions was distributed to both aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive pediatric gastroenterologists. Vignettes focused on management of commonly encountered general gastroenterology and aerodigestive issues, such as gastroesophageal (GE) reflux, aspiration, and feeding difficulties. Tests of equal proportions were used to compare rates of testing and empiric therapy within and across groups. Multivariate analysis was used to assess differences in response rates between aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive providers. A total of 88 pediatric gastroenterologists from 18 institutions completed the questionnaire. There were 35 aerodigestive gastroenterology providers and 53 nonaerodigestive gastroenterology providers. The nonaerodigestive group included 31 general gastroenterologists and 22 providers with self-identified subspecialty gastroenterology expertise. Aerodigestive specialists were more likely than nonaerodigestive gastroenterologists to pursue testing over empiric therapy in cases involving isolated respiratory symptoms (P < .05); aerodigestive providers were more likely to recommend pH-impedance testing, videofluoroscopic swallow studies, and upper gastrointestinal barium study (P < .05 for each test) depending on the referring physician. For vignettes involving infant GE reflux, both groups chose empiric treatments more frequently than testing (P < .001), although aerodigestive providers were more likely than nonaerodigestive providers to pursue testing like upper gastrointestinal barium studies (P < .05). Although some practice patterns were similar between groups, aerodigestive providers pursued more testing than nonaerodigestive providers in several clinical scenarios including infants with respiratory symptoms and GE reflux.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33387591/"}

Building positive resources can bolster patients with GI disorders against comorbid psychological and psychiatric distress. Positive psychology interventions can be implemented within gastroenterology practice.

The present analysis is aimed at delineating four different means to combine results of multiple tests and discuss their applicability and limitations. In serial testing, the overall test outcome is rated as being positive if the outcome is positive in all individual tests applied in series. Serial testing increases the overall specificity at the expense of decreasing sensitivity. In parallel testing, the overall test outcome is rated as being positive if the outcome is positive in any of the multiple tests. Parallel testing increases the overall sensitivity at the expense of decreasing specificity. In majority testing, the overall test outcome follows the rating by the majority of testers. Majority testing avoids the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity associated with serial and parallel testing and leads to relatively high overall values for both test characteristics. For majority testing to function well, however, it requires many independent testers, which can render this method costly and impractical in the clinical setting. Sequential testing applies to situations in which the output of a previous test provides the input for a later test. Sequential testing generally results in an overall test with lower sensitivity and specificity values than any of the individual tests and should be avoided if possible. All methods to improve test performance by combining the results of multiple tests have limitations and need to be regarded with skepticism. In the long run, the best solutions are provided by improvements of the individual test or performance by the individual diagnostician/reviewer through training and acquisition of new skills.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29111998/"}

One-third of patients believed their wait time was too long, with 9% rating their wait time as 'far too long'; 96.4% believed that maximal wait time should be less than three months, 78.9% believed it should be less than one month and 40.3% believed it should be less than two weeks. Of those working or attending school, 22.6% reported missing at least one day of work or school because of their symptoms in the month before their appointment, and 9.0% reported missing five or more days in the preceding month. A total of 20.2% of respondents reported being very worried about having a serious disease (ie, scored 6 or higher on 7-point Likert scale), and 17.6% and 14.8%, respectively, reported that their symptoms caused major impairment of social functioning and with the activities of daily living.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether integration of digestive health services can contain resource use among gastrointestinal (GI) inpatient admissions. This is a cohort study of 2934 inpatient cases admitted to a referral academic medical center between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2000, with a primary diagnosis of an esophageal disorder, appendicitis, abdominal hernia, intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, biliary tract disease, liver disease, a pancreatic disorder, or GI hemorrhage. Cases were grouped by admitting service (DHSC vs. other nonintegrated inpatient services). Total cost, length of stay, and 30-day readmission rate were adjusted for differences in baseline patient characteristics and compared. DHSC admission was associated with significant cost savings (P = 0.0363) and reduced length of stay (P < 0.0001). Cost savings were attributable to patients admitted for liver disease (P = 0.0077), GI hemorrhage (P = 0.0031), and diverticulitis (P = 0.0497); reductions in length of stay were seen for patients with liver disease (P = 0.0314), GI hemorrhage (P = 0.0212), diverticulitis (P = 0.0017), esophageal disorders (P = 0.0006), and abdominal hernia (P = 0.0458).

Barriers to pursuing GI fellowship have not been studied at the resident level. We aimed to determine multiple barriers that may prevent internal medicine (IM) residents from pursuing GI fellowship. Our multi-center team distributed an IRB-approved electronic survey to residents in IM residency programs nationwide. Multiple rounds of emails with survey description and link were sent to program directors and coordinators to forward to their residents. Four-point Likert barrier scales were used where \"not a barrier\" was analyzed as \"no\" and \"somewhat a barrier\" to \"extreme barrier\" was analyzed as \"yes.\" Frequencies and Chi-square tests (p < 0.05) were used to compare barriers by gender. The mean age was 29.9 years. 287 (52.9%) were female. Compared to males, female residents were more likely to report concerns regarding maternity/paternity leave, child care during or after training, fertility, and delaying pregnancy as significant barriers to applying for GI fellowship (Fig. 1). Lack of mentorship, lack of same-sex mentorship, lack of gender diversity, and compensation inequality were greater concerns compared to males (Fig. 1). Financial obligations, job availability, debt burden, family obligations, and paternity/maternity leave were significant barriers for trainees with 1 or more children compared to trainees with no children (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). In a gender-based sub-analysis, female married trainees perceived paternity/maternity leave, childcare, delayed pregnancy, and lack of same-sex mentors to be greater barriers compared to male married trainees (p < 0.05). Our study revealed several gender-specific, parental, and marital-based barriers that may prevent IM residents from pursuing fellowship training in GI. Potential interventions for female trainees include structured mentorship pathways, better resources for parental leave, and interventions to reduce stress/burnout and improve work-life balance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39762595/"}

However, there is an increased risk for medical complications and morbidity surrounding transfer from pediatric to adult hepatology and transplant services. Health care transition (HCT) is the process of moving from a child/family-centered model of care to an adult or patient-centered model of health care. Successful HCT requires a partnership between pediatric and adult providers across all disciplines resulting in a transition process that does not end at the time of transfer but continues throughout early adulthood. Joint consensus guidelines in collaboration with the American Society of Transplantation are presented to facilitate the adoption of a structured, multidisciplinary approach to transition planning utilizing The Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition TM for use by both pediatric and adult specialists.

Responses to 63 questions from 106 paediatric IBD centres were collected. Eighty-four percentage of centres reported to fulfil the revised Porto criteria in the majority of patients. In luminal Crohn disease (CD), exclusive enteral nutrition is used as a first-line induction therapy and immunomodulators (IMM) are used since diagnosis in the majority of patients. Infliximab (IFX) is mostly considered as first-line biological. Sixty percentage of centres have experience with vedolizumab and/or ustekinumab and 40% use biosimilars. In the majority of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients 5-aminosalicylates are continued as concomitant therapy to IMM (usually azathioprine [AZA]/6-MP). After ileocaecal resection (ICR) in CD patients without postoperative residual disease, AZA monotherapy is the preferred treatment.

A self-administered 16-question (5-minute) online survey assessing practice patterns for performance of pediatric endoscopy procedures was distributed to all registered North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition programs. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text comments. Respondents from 82.9% of North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition centers completed this survey. Responses revealed that esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy are performed at the vast majority of centers (>90%), with most performing >50/year. Therapeutic endoscopy procedures are performed less frequently in the pediatric population, with 18.97% reporting that ERCP is not performed at their institution. Where ERCP is performed, 91.38% reported <25/year. Endoscopic ultrasound is not performed at more than half (53.33%) of institutions. Approximately 71.67% of respondents do not believe their institution's current arrangement for performing pediatric therapeutic endoscopy procedures is adequate. Although the range of endoscopic procedures performed in children parallels that performed in adults, there are notable differences in pediatric and adult gastroenterologists' endoscopy training and procedure volumes.

Prescription data from 2013 to 2017 by 761 hepatologists identified in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part D Public Use File were analyzed. Annual prescription volumes were compared for providers with >10 annual prescriptions of a given drug type. Provider characteristics associated with opioid prescriptions were identified through multivariate logistic regression analyses. The proportion of hepatologists prescribing >10 annual opioid prescriptions decreased from 29% to 20.6%. Median annual opioid prescriptions per hepatologist significantly decreased from 24 to 20. Tramadol remained the most prescribed analgesic. Nonopioid analgesic prescription volume did not increase significantly. Provider characteristics associated with increased opioid prescriptions included male sex, practice location in the South and Midwest (vs West), more years in practice, and a greater proportion of beneficiaries who are white or with low-income subsidy claims. Characteristics associated with fewer prescriptions included non-university-based practice, having a greater proportion of female beneficiaries, and later prescription year.

The initial efforts to establish this Foundation, led by Dr Richard McKenna in 1963, were unsuccessful. In 1991, Glaxo Canada (now GlaxoSmithKline) became a founding donor, and with the four founding physicians--Drs Ivan T Beck, Richard H Hunt, Suzanne E Lemire and Alan BR Thomson--the expenses to establish the Foundation were met. A charitable number was obtained in 1995 (0997427-11). The second founding donor was Janssen Canada (now Janssen-Ortho), and public education support came from Astra Canada (now AstraZeneca Canada). The Foundation initially relied on corporate donors, but now approaches physicians, patients and the general public. The objectives of the Foundation are to advance the science of gastroenterology and to provide knowledge of digestive diseases and nutrition to the general public, to enhance the quality of life of persons who are afflicted with these disorders. The major achievements of the Foundation are the provision of one-year operating grants to new investigators, which have allowed them to accumulate early data and subsequently obtain support from other major granting organizations.

We aimed to assess the clinical picture of pediatric CD patients at diagnosis and to validate ESPGHAN non-biopsy criteria. (2) Methods: Patients with suspected CD or undergoing screening from 2004 to 2014 at the University Hospital in Modena, Italy were enrolled. The accuracy of ESPGHAN non-biopsy criteria and modified versions were assessed. (3) Results: In total, 410 patients were enrolled, of whom 403 were considered for analysis. Of the patients considered, 45 were asymptomatic and diagnosed with CD (11.2%) while 358 patients (88.2%) were symptomatic, of whom 295 were diagnosed with CD. Among symptomatic CD patients, 57 (19.3%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, 98 (33%) had atypical symptoms and 140 (47.4%) had both. No difference was found for the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at different ages. The non-biopsy ESPGHAN criteria yielded an accuracy of 59.4% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%; 173 out of 308 EGD (56.2%) could have been avoided.

The results of the study demonstrate that alimentary system diseases are concomitant with changes in the functional activity of the immune system and development of the systemic immune response aimed at the neutralization and elimination of pathogenic agents. Impaired regulatory and efferent lymphocyte capacities, increased synthesis of cytokines, immunoglobulins, heterologous (anti-viral, anti-bacterial or antigliadin), autologous (to parietal cells, microsome mitochondria, tissue transglutaminase) antibodies, formation of immune complexes, autoimmune reactions and secondary immunodeficiency are specific immune mechanisms of the pathological process development, its synchronization and progression in patients with alimentary system diseases. Changes in the immunological status indices are expressed in varying degree depending on the organ involved, etiological factor, clinical course and stage of the disease, as well as treatment used. The immunological status indices have maximal values in cases of chronic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, peptic or duodenal ulcer, cholelithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, gluten-sensitive enteropathy and minimal values in cases of chronic gastritis, gastroesophageal disease, steatohepatitis and irritable bowel syndrome. These data are sufficient for developing an algorithm of immune diagnostics for a number of alimentary system diseases.

These data are not readily available. A method to capture wait time data at the time of consultation or procedure has been developed, which should be applicable to other specialist groups and also allows for assessment of wait time trends over intervals of years. In November 2008, gastroenterologists across Canada were asked to complete a questionnaire (online or by fax) that included personal demographics and data from one week on at least five consecutive new consultations and five consecutive procedure patients who had not previously undergone a procedure for the same indication. Wait times were collected for 18 primary indications and results were then compared with similar survey data collected in 2005. The longest wait times observed were for screening colonoscopy (201 days) and surveillance of previous colon cancer or polyps (272 days). The shortest wait times were for cancer-likely based on imaging or physical examination (82 days), severe or rapidly progressing dysphagia or odynophagia (83 days), documented iron deficiency anemia (90 days) and dyspepsia with alarm symptoms (99 days). Compared with 2005 data, total wait times in 2008 were lengthened overall (127 days versus 155 days; P<0.05) and for most of the seven individual indications that permitted data comparison. Median wait times for gastroenterology services continue to exceed consensus conference recommended targets and have significantly worsened since 2005.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186352/"}

Healthcare workers are at high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastroenterology and hepatology departments and specialists in Spain. This study involves a nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures, and physicians of gastroenterology and hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service. Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of gastroenterology and hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds, and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancelation of elective liver transplant and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in > 80% hospitals, but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of gastroenterology-related complications is expected because of resource diversion. Gastroenterologists have a high prevalence of infection, although they may have been infected during a first phase of lower awareness and protection.

Because practices now are considering reintroduction of elective endoscopy, we conducted a survey of North American practices to identify reactivation barriers and strategies. We designed and electronically distributed a web-based survey to North American gastroenterologists consisting of 7 domains: institutional demographics, impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy practice, elective endoscopy resumption plans, anesthesia modifications, personal protective equipment policies, fellowship training, and telemedicine use. Responses were stratified by practice type: ambulatory surgery center (ASC) or hospital-based. In total, 123 practices (55% ASC-based and 45% hospital-based) responded. At the pandemic's peak (as reported by the respondents), practices saw a 90% decrease in endoscopy volume, with most centers planning to resume elective endoscopy a median of 55 days after initial restrictions. Declining community prevalence of COVID-19, personal protective equipment availability, and preprocedure severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing availability were ranked as the 3 primary factors influencing reactivation timing. ASC-based practices were more likely to identify preprocedure testing availability as a major factor limiting elective endoscopy resumption (P = .001). Preprocedure SARS-CoV-2 testing was planned by only 49.2% of practices overall; when testing is performed and negative, 52.9% of practices will continue to use N95 masks. This survey highlights barriers and variable strategies for reactivation of elective endoscopy services after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that more widespread access to preprocedure SARS-CoV-2 tests with superior performance characteristics is needed to increase provider and patient comfort in proceeding with elective endoscopy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32447019/"}

In these systems, specialists in digestive diseases perform endoscopy without prior consultation. The purpose of this study is to determine if indications for upper endoscopic procedures requested in an open access system conform to national practice guidelines and to establish the yield of diagnostic information relevant for patient care in this system. Procedural indications and results for 3715 upper endoscopic procedures performed in an open access system were recorded in a computer database. The practice guideline \"Appropriate Use of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\" (AUGE) of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy was used to determine appropriateness of procedural indications. Eighty-four percent of procedures were performed for indications listed in the AUGE, and 59% resulted in findings relevant to patient care. Specialists requested endoscopy more frequently for \"approved\" indications than did nonspecialists (p = .004) and more frequently had findings relevant to patient care (p < .001). Findings relevant to patient care are significantly more frequent for some indications listed in the AUGE compared to others (p < .001). Adherence to practice guidelines can and does occur in an open access system. Specialists request endoscopy more frequently for appropriate indications compared to nonspecialists and have a higher yield of information relevant to patient care.

The Working Team of Glaxo-Wellcome Research, UK.", "text": "An international working team of 13 investigators met on two occasions to develop guidelines for standardizing the procedures used to test gastrointestinal muscle tone and sensory thresholds using a barostat. General recommendations were: (1) Use a thin-walled plastic bag that is infinitely compliant until its capacity is reached. Maximum diameter of the bag should be much greater than the maximum diameter of the viscus. (2) The pump should be able to inflate the bag at up to 40 ml/sec. (3) Pressure should be monitored inside the bag, not in the pump or inflation line. (4) Subjects should be positioned so that the bag is close to the uppermost surface of the body. (5) For rectal tests, bowel cleansing should be limited to a tap water enema to minimize rectal irritation. Oral colonic lavage is recommended for studies of the proximal colon, and magnesium citrate enemas for the descending colon and sigmoid. (6) If sedation is required for colonic probe placement, allow at least one hour for drug washout and clearance of insufflated air. Ten to 20 min of adaptation before testing is adequate if no air or drugs were used. (7) The volumes reported must be corrected for the compressibility of gas and the compliance of the pump, which is greater for bellows pumps than for piston pumps. (8) Subjects should be tested in the fasted state. For evaluation of muscle tone: (9) The volume of the bag should be monitored for at least 15 min. For evaluation of sensory thresholds; (10) It is recommended that phasic distensions be > or = 60 sec long and that they be separated by > or = 60 sec. (11) Sensory thresholds should be reported as bag pressure rather than (or in addition to) bag volume because pressure is less vulnerable to measurement error. (12) Tests for sensory threshold should minimize psychological influences on perception by making the amount of each distension unpredictable to the subject. (13) Pain or other sensations should be reported on a graduated scale; not \"yes-no.\" The working team recommends verbal descriptor scales, containing approximately seven steps, or visual analog scales in which subjects place a mark on a straight line marked \"none\" on one end and \"maximum\" on the other end.

This study introduces the large 'Nottingham Test Meal' (NTM) for assessment of gastric motor and sensory function by non-invasive imaging. NTM comprises 400 mL liquid nutrient (0.75 kcal/mL) and 12 solid agar-beads (0 kcal) with known breaking strength. Gastric fullness and dyspeptic sensations were documented by 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Gastric emptying (GE) were measured in 24 healthy volunteers (HVs) by gastric scintigraphy (GS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The contribution of secretion to gastric volume was assessed. Parameters that describe GE were calculated from validated models. Inter-observer agreement and reproducibility were assessed. NTM produced moderate fullness (VAS ≥30) but no more than mild dyspeptic symptoms (VAS <30) in 24 HVs. Stable binding of meal components to labels in gastric conditions was confirmed. Distinct early and late-phase GE were detected by both modalities. Liquid GE half-time was median 49 (95% CI: 36-62) min and 68 (57-71) min for GS and MRI, respectively. Differences between GS and MRI measurements were explained by the contribution of gastric secretion. Breaking strength for agar-beads was 0.8 N/m(2) such that median 25 (8-50) % intact agar-beads and 65 (47-74) % solid material remained at 120 min on MRI and GS, respectively. Good reproducibility for liquid GE parameters was present and GE was not altered by agar-beads. The NTM provided an objective assessment of gastric motor and sensory function.

Monitoring with graphic assessment of respiratory activity detected early phases of respiratory depression, resulting in a timely decrease in the propofol infusion without significant hypoxemia, hypercapnia, hypotension, or arrhythmias. Satisfaction scores were extremely high (median score 92 of 100) and 9 of 10 patients met discharge criteria at 15 minutes after discontinuation of the propofol infusion. With the use of monitoring by graphic assessment of respiratory activity, propofol infusion by a second qualified gastroenterologist for prolonged upper endoscopic procedures is safe and results in high levels of patient satisfaction with rapid recovery times.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10922104/"}

Most common conditions included dyspepsia (16%), a family history of colon cancer (16%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (16%). Seventy-nine (44%) of all first visits became HRCs and 80 (45%) required a diagnostic test (100% abdominal ultrasound) that was reviewed on the same day. Performing a test on the same day significantly increased the percentage of HRCs (57% vs. 34%, p < 0.002).

Hospital stay for digestive pathologies parallels that due to cardiovascular causes. Total mortality for GI causes is also very high. The management of GI pathologies is therefore a major task for the National Health System. To the experienced gastroenterologist it is clear that a large number of hospitalisation is linked to a lack of careful outpatient follow-up of diseases such as cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis and peptic ulcer. One year of activity of our Gastro-entero-Hepatology outpatient service is examined. The management of the majority of GI diseases is organized in working teams of physicians and surgeons following cohorts of patients suffering of a specific disease. During the year 2000 not only a statistically significant higher number of patients has been examined (p<0.05), in comparison with 1994, but also the hospitalisation rate was lowered resulting in a very significative cost-containment. The specialization of outpatient activities into working teams offers advantages in terms of more appropriate medical care and cost reduction, partly due to a less frequent hospitalisation. The obvious counterpart was an increase of request of such form of follow-up from patients, resulting in longer delay to the access.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11323569/"}

A pilot survey in Western Australia.", "text": "Access to specialists is mediated by general practitioners in many countries. In these settings, specialists rely on information in referral letters when deciding which cases to schedule for their clinics. Two-hundred and seven consecutive referral letters to gastroenterologists were scored for the amount of information relayed to the specialist, using a published schedule. The 'quality' scores for these referral letters were compared for four groups of patients: patients diagnosed with histological lesion, those with no histological lesion, those who failed to attend clinic, or those who had a diagnosis unknown. Forty-two referral letters were generated with a range of quality scores. Four gastroenterologists were asked to identify which letters described patients 'likely' to have a significant or benign colorectal condition, and whether they could triage the cases for their clinic given only the information in the letters. It was not possible to differentiate which letters related to patients in each of the four categories (P = 0.6). Patients who failed to attend were more symptomatic than those with a histological lesion (35.4 versus 28.2, mean difference 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.1 to 0.15, P = 0.045). Patients referred 'urgently' were not, on the basis of the referral letters, the most symptomatic group (29.7 versus 27, mean difference 2.7, 95% CI -3.4 to 8.8, P = 0.38). The specialists failed to agree on the proportion of cases that could be triaged for their clinics. The cases that could be triaged contained more information (mean 66.38 versus 49.86, mean difference 16, 95% CI 1.3-31.7, P < 0.001). There was no evidence for an association between the amount of information relayed and the diagnosis of a histological lesion. However, more information was helpful when deciding which patients to schedule first. By corollary, patients referred with lesser documentation of their clinical presentation may be denied 'urgent' access to the gastroenterology clinic.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19281672/"}

End-oscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has emerged as a valuable tool for locoregional staging. However, it is unclear how different physician specialties perceive the benefit of EUS-FNA for esophageal cancer staging, and thus utilize this modality in clinical practice. A survey regarding utilization of EUS-FNA in esophageal cancer was distributed to 211 thoracic surgeons and 251 EUS-capable gastroenterologists. Seventy-six thoracic surgeons (36%) and 78 gastroenterologists (31%) responded to the survey. Most surgeons (75%) use EUS to stage potentially resectable esophageal cancer 75% of the time. Surgeons using EUS less often are less likely to have access to high-quality EUS services than their peers. Fewer surgeons believe EUS is the most accurate test for T and N-staging (84% and 71%, respectively) as compared with gastroenterologists (97% and 96%, P < 0.01 for both). Most endosonographers (68%) decide whether to dilate a malignant esophageal stricture to complete the staging exam on a case-by-case basis. Surgeons disagree as to whether involvement of celiac lymph nodes should preclude esophagectomy in distal esophageal cancer. While most thoracic surgeons have embraced EUS-FNA as the most accurate locoregional staging modality in esophageal cancer, this attitude is not fully reflected in utilization patterns due to a lack of quality EUS services in some centers. Controversial areas that warrant further study include dilation of malignant strictures to facilitate EUS staging, and the implication of involved celiac lymph nodes on management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18840132/"}

Three AFI experts and 3 AFI non-experts scored images after a training presentation. The IOA was calculated using kappa and accuracy was calculated with histology as gold standard. Seventy-four sets of images were prospectively collected from 63 patients (48 males, mean age 69 years). The IOA for number of AF positive lesions was fair when AFI images were presented. This improved to moderate with corresponding AFI and HRE images [experts 0.57 (0.44-0.70), non-experts 0.47 (0.35-0.62)].

We received 186 responses (42% response rate). Experts and community providers generally agreed on diagnostic testing decisions in Crohn's disease. However, there was a significant disagreement between groups for several decisions (use of 5-aminosalicylate in particular), and there was evidence of 'extreme variation' (defined as DI > 1.0) within groups across a range of decisions.

The aim of this study was to compare the quality of documentation by a medical documentation assistant (MDA) with the usual practice of documentation by the ward physician (WP). Additionally, the effect of introducing a completely changed organizational process was tested. In a prospective study on the ward of a gastroenterology unit two different approaches of medical documentation were compared. In a first six-month period diagnosis and procedures were encoded by WP. In the following six months an MDA was introduced and involved in the encoding process. In the first six months 221 patients (mean age 55 +/- 16,2 years, 55,7 % males) were evaluated, whereas in the following six months 305 patients (mean age 53 +/- 15,4 years, 59,9 % males) were included. The introduction of an MDA improved medical documentation and economical reference numbers: with an increase of diagnosis per case to 7,43 (in first six months 5,53), patient complexity and comorbidity level (PCCL) to 2,5 (in first six months 2,13), case-mix index to 1,04 (in first six months 0,98). Additionally the medial hospitalization time decreased from 11,2 to 8,1 days. The average daily reimbursement increased in the MDA group from 423 Euro to 603 Euro.

A clinical ladder program based on P. Benner's (1984; P. Benner et al., 1996) competency framework has been used for 20 years in a Finnish university hospital; to ensure the nurses' strategic competencies and capability profiles, the Nurse Competence Scale (NCS) was developed for the self-assessment and the superiors' review purposes (R. Meretoja, H. Isoaho, & H. Leino-Kilpi, 2004; R. Meretoja, H. Leino-Kilpi, & A. M. Kaira, 2004). In the gastroenterological endoscopy unit, competent nurses' work role has been expanded to the proficient level. These nurses are working as patient care coordinators in multiprofessional groups. This expanded work role requires mastery of nursing care for the gastroenterological patients and also familiarity of the endoscopy processes and the clinical pathways. These endoscopy nurse coordinators' most important work role is the effective management of situations, and they are also remarkable resources as preceptors and mentors to less experienced nurses and nursing students. This article describes endoscopy nurse coordinators' expanded work role and competence profile in the frame of the clinical ladder program.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010234/"}

Prospective data were collected on all new referrals over a two-month period and 426 new appointments were included, from which data were available on 390. Only six referrals were deemed inappropriate. Sixty-nine patients had a functional disorder, and GPs were less likely to diagnose this group at referral than the gastroenterologist was after the initial consultation. Nineteen per cent of all GP referrals were classified as urgent and 6% of these had a malignancy. Fifty per cent of patients with malignancy were not perceived as meriting an urgent referral by the GP Gastroenterology outpatient facilities are already overstretched and the implementation of the two-week target will add considerable strain to the current resources, with little gain in identifying malignancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11833552/"}

It is pointed out that hormones are part of their secretions, while enzymes are increted by the alimentary glands. These findings, including those of ours, are discussed in the light of the excretory conception of the origin of secretion and the principle of plurality of modern functionalism (A. M. Ugolev).

{"id": "33403481", "title": "Addressing Gender Disparity: Increase in Female Leadership Increases Gender Equality in Program Director and Fellow Ranks.", "text": "Women make up 15% of the total number of practicing gastroenterology (GI) physicians in the US. Despite this disparity, only 33% of the current GI fellows are female. Increasing female GIs is a major goal of all four GI societies. It is known that gender disparity exists in the field of gastroenterology, and women are underrepresented in the leadership ranks and trainee level at academic programs. Whether an increase in female leadership in academic medicine is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship in GI. Data were collected via a standardized protocol from all 173 US gastroenterology fellowship programs up until October 2018 from program websites and supplemented by online surveys completed by program coordinators. Any missing information was collected by calling the program coordinators. Data were collected on gender and academic rank of the program director, associate program director, division chief, chair of medicine, program size, academic center affiliation, number, and academic rank of female faculty and geographic region. The association was assessed using a Chi-square test or independent samples t test. In leadership positions, men were listed as comprising 86% of chairs, 82% of division chiefs, 76% of program directors and 63% of associate program directors. Forty-three percent of programs did not have female representation at any leadership level. The presence of a female program director or female associate program director was associated with an increase in the number of female fellows (4.03 vs 3.20; p = 0.076; 4.26 vs 3.36; p = 0.041), respectively. Overall, the presence of a female in any leadership position led to an increase in the number of female fellows (4.04 females vs 2.87 females; p = 0.007) enrolled in a program. If a GI division chief was male, the program director was more likely to be male as well (81% male vs. 18.8% female). Conversely, having a female division chief was likely to lead to a more equitable program director representation, 54% female to 48% male (p value < 0.0001, OR 5.03 95% CI 2.04-12.3). Furthermore, if either the internal medicine department chair or GI chief was female, the proportion of female program directors increased to 41% as compared to 19% if both were male (p value < 0.0001, OR 2.99 95% CI 1.34-6.6). Women are significantly underrepresented in the number of practicing gastroenterologists, at all levels of leadership in GI fellowship programs, and at the fellow level. Increasing the number of women in fellowship leadership positions is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees. Per our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between female leadership in fellowship programs and the gender of trainees. Increasing female representation in leadership positions would not only address current gender disparity, but it may also increase the number of female future GI trainees.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403481/"}

Some of these tests may also provide helpful information in the assessment of patients with rectal pain or diarrhea, but their sensitivity and specificity are less well established for these symptoms. Tests for which there is consensus regarding their clinical utility include 1) resting anal canal pressure, 2) anal canal squeeze pressure (peak pressure and duration), 3) the rectoanal inhibitory reflex elicited by balloon distension of the rectum, 4) anal canal pressure in response to a cough, 5) anal canal pressure in response to defecatory maneuvers, 6) simulated defecation by means of balloon or radiopaque contrast, 7) compliance of the rectum in response to balloon distension, and 8) sensory thresholds in response to balloon distension. Anal endosonography and pelvic floor electromyography from intra-anal plate electrodes are nonmanometric tests that are also specifically useful in the evaluation of constipation and fecal incontinence. The clinical utility of all anorectal manometric tests is limited by the relative absence of 1) standardization of test protocols and 2) normative data from a large number of healthy individuals. The interpretation of these diagnostic tests is also complicated by the fact that patients are able to compensate for deficits in specific physiological mechanisms maintaining continence and defecation by utilizing other biological and behavioral mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11866256/"}

The incidence of fatty liver disease is highest in China, surpassing the incidence in European countries and the USA. An international consensus panel recently published an influential report recommending a novel definition of fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction. This recommendation includes a switch in name from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and adoption of a set of positive criteria for disease diagnosis that are independent of alcohol intake or other liver diseases. Given the unique importance of this proposal, the Chinese Society of Hepatology (CSH) invited leading hepatologists and gastroenterologists representing their respective provinces and cities to reach consensus on alternative definitions for fatty liver disease from a national perspective.

However, the number of biopsies that need to be taken to reach this number of viable cancer biopsies is without evidence. This study aimed to address this gap by assessing the number of biopsies required to gain at least four viable biopsies containing cancer. A total of 105 consecutive biopsy cases of gastric and oesophageal adenocarcinoma were retrieved from files. Only definite cancer diagnoses were included; missed cancers or unproven cases were not considered. The cases were reviewed and the number of biopsies taken, and the number containing viable tumour was recorded. In total, 667 biopsies were taken, of which 471 had viable tumour (70.6%). Seventy of 105 cases (67%) had four viable tumour biopsies, but only 47 of 105 (45%) had five viable tumour biopsies. In order to have a >90% chance of having four viable tumour biopsies, seven needed to be taken, while 10 or more were required for a >90% chance of five viable tumour biopsies. Mathematically, using a 0.7 probability for a single biopsy, eight biopsies would be required for a 94% chance of at least four viable tumour biopsies. In our large upper GI cancer centre, many biopsy cases do not contain sufficient material for adequate HER2 assessment. In order to meet the four-biopsy requirement for adequate HER2 assessment in >90% of cases, at least eight biopsies need to be taken, while 10 biopsies would be required for the 5-cancer biopsy threshold.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30592780/"}

For gastroenterologists managing patients, especially those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the PA process is time-consuming and further complicated by 2 additional factors: step therapy requirements and failure of payers to recognize updated IBD treatment pathways. These factors often lead to PA denials and cause treatment delays, which in turn can lead to disease progression, ongoing patient suffering, and ultimately an increase in both direct and indirect total costs. In this manuscript, the PA process, PA models, tips and available resources to navigate the PA process, and future advocacy efforts are discussed with the intent to help gastroenterology practices optimize PA outcomes and improve the care provided to patients with IBD and other gastrointestinal disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30753551/"}

Unfortunately, there is a paucity of evidence exploring transition services within the neurogastroenterology and motility (NGM) field. The overall aim of this article, endorsed by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, is to promote a discussion about the role of transition services for patients with NGM disorders. The AYAs addressed herein are those who have: (a) a ROME positive disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), (b) a primary or secondary motility disorder (including those with motility disorders that have been surgically managed), or (c) an artificial feeding requirement (parenteral or enteral tube feeding) to manage malnutrition secondary to categories (a) or (b). The issues explored in this position paper include the specific physical and psychological healthcare needs of patients with NGM disorders; key healthcare professionals who should form part of a secondary care NGM transition service; the triadic relationship between healthcare professionals, caregivers, and patients; approaches to selecting patients who may benefit most from transition care; methods to assess transition readiness; and strategies with which to facilitate transfer of care between healthcare professionals. Key areas for future research are also addressed, including the construction of NGM-specific transition readiness questionnaires, tools to assess post-transfer healthcare outcomes, and educational programs to train healthcare professionals about transition care in NGM.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39038114/"}

The ENS or \"human little brain in the gut\" is easily accessible for study in GI surgical or biopsy samples. This mini review is focused on the use of human gut specimens in translating laboratory data on ENS and enteric neuropathies in neurogastroenterology and motility from mice to humans. Availability of viable human gut samples, in combination with technological advances in innovative recording techniques and new in vitro models provide powerful ways to study neural activity and secretomotor function or monitor motility in health and disease with exquisite sophistication and precision. Electrophysiological recordings, optical recordings with voltage-sensitive dyes, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (in adult or fetal gut) is used to study neural activity in human ENS in health and disease. 'First in man patch clamp recordings' is possible in isolated networks of human myenteric ganglia, opening the door for patch-seq. The human ENS at single cell resolution (snRNA-seq) revealed cell-diversity, similarities and differences between human and mouse in vitro. Visceral afferent recordings are used for mechanosensation and pain signaling in humans. Stem cell therapies may hold future promise for patients with enteric neuropathies. A greater focus on the human ENS and enteric neuropathies (i.e. IBS, FD, postoperative ileus, CIPO, chronic constipation, Hirschsprung Disease, infection, gastroparesis, Parkinson's disease, IBD, visceral pain) is one important step for consideration in developing potential therapeutics before proceeding to more expensive and complex clinical trials in patients to treat GI Disorders and Diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40296281/"}

Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03). More women reported feeling pressured to mentor because of their gender (39.5% vs 0.9% of men, P < 0.0001).

Gastric carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are leading malignancies, while colorectal cancer is less frequent. Bile duct stones often have Ascaris eggs in the centre, and they prevail in incidence over gall-bladder stones. The majority of digestive cancers are detected at a very late stage. The Vietnamese Association of Gastroenterology aims to contribute to the development of modern gastroenterology (GE) in Vietnam, to study and apply recent advances in imaging technology, such as fibre-optic diagnostic and therapeutical endoscopy, ultrasonography, laparoscopic surgery etc. and to do further work in molecular biology. For this purpose, besides our self-reliance, we need, and ask for, support and assistance from the Japanese Society of GE (JSGE), the Asian Pacific Association of GE (APAGE) and the Organisation Mondiale de GE (OMEGE). At the same time, we suggest a choice be made among the different technologies, bearing in mind their cost-effectiveness, and to give preference to measures for the primary prevention and early detection of the diseases.

The reform of the training curriculum for internal medicine and the reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient services in gastroenterology threatens the existence of internal medicine and gastroenterology in Germany, too. The capacity for training in internal medicine and gastroenterology is reduced by a decrease in the number of hospital beds in academic and community training centres. The concentration on gastrointestinal endoscopy in outpatient gastroenterology will be a result of an increasing demand for gastrointestinal endoscopy services and the decreasing number of gastroenterology clinics, respectively. Therefore, clinical gastroenterology as a core service in gastroenterology will be steadily eliminated. This development will diminish clinical gastroenterology to gastrointestinal endoscopy by eliminating the clinical services for chronic gastroenterological conditions such as, e.g., IBD, chronic hepatitis, reflux disease, IBS and functional dyspepsia. In this way gastroenterology looses its central role in health care services in specialised internal medicine. In 2003 the American Gastroenterological Association position paper: \"Training the Gastroenterologist of the Future: the Gastroenterology Core Curriculum\" was published. It has emphasised the role of clinical gastroenterology in medical training and medical services, too. Clinical gastroenterology consists of an array of several disciplines, e.g., GI physiology, GI research, infectious diseases, hepatology, oncology and gastrointestinal endoscopy, which all contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency in health care service. Financial incentives and better prospects of leading positions for young gastroenterologists in clinical gastroenterology have to be accomplished in order to nourish clinical gastroenterology in Germany.

To this end, we address the history of NAFLD histopathology, which begins in 1980 with Ludwig's seminal studies, although previous studies date back to the 19th century. Moreover, the principal milestones in the definition of genetic NAFLD are summarized. Next, a specific account is given of the evolution, over time, of our understanding of the association of NAFLD with metabolic syndrome, spanning from the outdated concept of <i>\"NAFLD as a manifestation of the Metabolic Syndrome\"</i>, to the more appropriate consideration that NAFLD has, with metabolic syndrome, a mutual and bi-directional relationship. In addition, we also report on the evolution from first intuitions to more recent studies, supporting NAFLD as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This association probably has deep roots, going back to ancient Middle Eastern cultures, wherein the liver had a significance similar to that which the heart holds in contemporary society. Conversely, the notions that NAFLD is a forerunner of hepatocellular carcinoma and extra-hepatic cancers is definitely more modern. Interestingly, guidelines issued by hepatological societies have lagged behind the identification of NAFLD by decades. A comparative analysis of these documents defines both shared attitudes (e.g., ultrasonography and lifestyle changes as the first approaches) and diverging key points (e.g., the threshold of alcohol consumption, screening methods, optimal non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis and drug treatment options). Finally, the principal historical steps in the general, cellular and molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD are reviewed. We conclude that an in-depth understanding of the history of the disease permits us to better comprehend the disease itself, as well as to anticipate the lines of development of future NAFLD research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32824337/"}

With the growing burden of this disease in gastroenterology practices, the identification and treatment of those at risk of developing adverse outcomes (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver-related death) has become urgent. In recent years, the development of noninvasive tests (NITs) to identify \"at-risk MASH\" patients have provided cost-effective algorithms to identify these patients. Although treatment has historically been limited to lifestyle modification, recent FDA approval of resmetirom for noncirrhosis MASH with stages 2 and 3 fibrosis has provided a new opportunity in the United States to provide these patients with novel treatment options. Other new effective treatment regimens are on the horizon. Given that gastroenterology and hepatology practices in the United States heavily rely on advanced practice providers (APPs) to manage patients with MASLD, the APP Committee of the Global NASH/MASH Council has curated the essentials of day-to-day MASH management for our busy gastrohepatology providers and their APP colleagues. The goal of this document is to equip and mobilize more GI providers with the requisite competencies for the management of at-risk MASH, given the rapidly evolving MASH treatment landscape.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39889206/"}

The goal of this study was to investigate the value of combined triple endoscopy delivered by the Aero Program through analysis of institutional charges, direct costs, operating room efficiency metrics, and parent satisfaction. Program evaluation. Finance, satisfaction, efficiency, and quality-of-care metrics were evaluated within and outside of the Aero Program through retrospective queries of electronic health records, administrative databases, and parent surveys at our institution. Mean anesthesia time in the Aero Program was 54 minutes (49-60; 95% confidence interval), which was significantly less (P < .0001) than the estimated 89 minutes of having the three procedures done separately. Average charges and average direct costs for triple endoscopy were 38.8% and 41.9% less than the sum of the averages for separate procedures, respectively. Parent satisfaction was high for the Aero Program care. As organizations move toward greater coordination of care for complex patients, multidisciplinary programs must demonstrate their value by delivering cost-effective care.

Many authorities view the disease as inexorably progressive with a high probability of advancing over time to cirrhosis and occasionally hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, therefore, likely to be responsible for causing death. Others regard chronic hepatitis C as having a variable outcome, the majority of infected persons not dying from the disease, but more likely from the comorbid conditions that so often accompany infection by this agent, or from more common medical conditions. Disagreements probably derive from the manner of conduct of the study and the populations studied. Efforts to determine natural history are handicapped by the primary characteristics of the disease, namely that its onset rarely is recognized and its course is prolonged exceedingly. Thus, different outcomes have come from retrospective rather than from prospective studies, but both have concluded that at least 20% of chronically infected adults develop cirrhosis within 20 years. More recent studies that used a retrospective/prospective approach, focusing largely on young infected individuals, have produced different results. Among these young people, particularly young women, spontaneous resolution of the viral infection is more common than previously thought and cirrhosis has been identified in 5% or fewer of them. The major failing for all groups studied, young and old, is that natural history studies have rarely exceeded the first 2 decades, so that outcome beyond this time is not known, other than through modeling.

Several congenital or acquired disorders may cause either selective or global malabsorption in both children and adults, such as cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coeliac disease (CD) and other enteropathies, lactase deficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and gastric or small bowel resections. Early recognition of malabsorption is key for tailoring a proper diagnostic work-up for identifying the cause of malabsorption. A patient's medical and pharmacological history is essential for identifying risk factors. Several examinations such as endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies, non-invasive functional tests and radiological imaging are useful in diagnosing malabsorption. Because of its high prevalence, CD should always be looked for in cases of malabsorption with no other obvious explanations and in high-risk individuals. Nutritional support is key in the management of patients with malabsorption; different options are available, including oral supplements, enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients with short bowel syndrome, teduglutide proved effective in reducing the need for parenteral nutrition, thus improving the quality of life of these patients. Primary care physicians play a central role in the early detection of malabsorption and should be involved in multidisciplinary teams for improving the overall management of these patients. In this European consensus, involving ten scientific societies and several experts, we have dissected all the issues around malabsorption, including the definitions and diagnostic testing (Part 1), high-risk categories and special populations, nutritional assessment and management, and primary care perspective (Part 2).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40129317/"}

Pancreatic disease and surgery are the main causes of PEI. However, other conditions and upper gastrointestinal surgery can also affect the digestive function of the pancreas. PEI can cause symptoms of nutritional malabsorption and deficiencies, which affect the quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. These guidelines were developed following the United European Gastroenterology framework for the development of high-quality clinical guidelines. After a systematic literature review, the evidence was evaluated according to the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology, as appropriate. Statements and comments were developed by the working groups and voted on using the Delphi method. The diagnosis of PEI should be based on a global assessment of symptoms, nutritional status, and a pancreatic secretion test. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), together with dietary advice and support, are the cornerstones of PEI therapy. PERT is indicated in patients with PEI that is secondary to pancreatic disease, pancreatic surgery, or other metabolic or gastroenterological conditions. Specific recommendations concerning the management of PEI under various clinical conditions are provided based on evidence and expert opinions. This evidence-based guideline summarizes the prevalence, clinical impact, and general diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for PEI, as well as the specifics of PEI in different clinical conditions. Finally, the unmet needs for future research are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39639485/"}

An EndoVators Summit, partially supported by a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health, (NIH) was held at the ASGE Institute for Training and Technology from November 19 to 20, 2017. The summit brought together over 70 thought leaders in simulation research and simulator development and key decision makers from industry. Proceedings opened with a historical review of the role of simulation in medicine and an outline of priority areas related to the emerging role of simulation training within medicine broadly. Subsequent sessions addressed the summit's purposes: to review the current state of endoscopy simulation and the role it could play in endoscopic training, to define the role and value of simulators in the future of endoscopic training and to reach consensus regarding priority areas for simulation-related education and research and simulator development. This white paper provides an overview of the central points raised by presenters, synthesizes the discussions on the key issues under consideration, and outlines actionable items and/or areas of consensus reached by summit participants and society leadership pertinent to each session.

Obscure GI bleeding (OGIB) is defined as loss of blood with no source identified after upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Whether an obscure site of bleeding is clinically evident or silent, it constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Gastroenterology and radiology provide the essential diagnostic tools used to evaluate suspected OGIB, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Small bowel series and conventional enteroclysis have a limited role in OGIB. Computed tomographic (CT) enterography and CT enteroclysis are noninvasive techniques with promising results in evaluation of small bowel disease and silent OGIB. CT angiography is a useful triaging tool for diagnosing or excluding active GI hemorrhage, localizing the site of bleeding, and guiding subsequent treatment. Tagged red blood cell scanning is the most sensitive technique for detection of active GI bleeding and allows imaging over a prolonged period, making it useful for detecting intermittent bleeding. Capsule endoscopy has emerged as an important tool for investigating OGIB, but it may soon have competition from double-balloon enteroscopy, a diagnostic technique that can also facilitate therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20083596/"}

Total body weight loss (TBWL) is an important approach, as its effects are amplified in the liver, with 10% TBWL resulting in a 50% loss of liver triglycerides and improvement in all aspects of NASH histology. Lifestyle changes are the first step in addressing TBWL, but uncommonly result in the range required to improve liver histology in NASH (7%-10%). Weight loss medications (WLMs) are an effective additional tool because they can provide TBWL in the 7%-10% range, have a well-characterized clinical profile, have clear guidelines, and meet approved criteria for their use (body mass index greater than 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) for most NASH patients. Use of WLMs requires shared decision making with the patient, which hepatologists, due to their understanding of the natural history of NASH, are uniquely positioned to provide. WLMs do present the challenge of incorporating new medications into the hepatology clinic, but this will be necessary with all medications to manage NASH. WLMs provide a practical intervention that can be incorporated into hepatology clinics and can be offered to most NASH patients. NASH-specific medicines in clinical trials offer partial histological responses, and TBWL will likely enhance this. Conclusion: WLMs provide the hepatologist with effective and welcome clinical intervention beyond the diagnosis and staging of NASH and provide patients with a sense of empowerment about the treatment of their liver disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30991446/"}

Two cohorts were generated, one representing referrals placed by <i>gastroenterology to otolaryngology</i> and a second representing referrals placed by <i>otolaryngology to gastroenterology</i>. The ICD-10 codes in both cohorts were reviewed and 13 distinct \"reason for referral\" categories were defined. The rates of referral for each category were then calculated for each of the referral cohorts. Otolaryngology referred to gastroenterology at a greater rate than gastroenterology referred to otolaryngology, despite seeing fewer total patients than gastroenterology. For referrals from gastroenterology to otolaryngology, the three most frequent referral reasons were oral cavity/oropharyngeal pathology (28.3%), dysphagia (28.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (GERD/LPRD) (11.3%).

Most physicians would now recommend some form of cancer surveillance both for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the most popular modality being clinical examination plus sigmoidoscopy at 6-12 month intervals, with colonoscopy or barium enema every two years. As regards GI cancer detection, endoscopy is now the modality of choice both for gastric cancer and colo-rectal cancer. Finally, the majority of respondents confirm that they frequently encounter ethical problems both in connection with routine practice and research. By and large ethical committees were felt to be ineffective, and guidance on ethical matters (absent in many centres!) rarely takes a structured form. This last finding possibly lends weight to the O.M.G.E.'s intention to provide such guidance via its newly founded Ethical Committee.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6147011/"}

Almost certainly because this rapid evolution has outpaced the ability of the body to adapt to a number of environmental and behavioral changes, there has been a parallel emergence of several chronic inflammatory diseases, among which are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The ability to treat these conditions has progressively improved in the last 50 years, particularly in the last couple of decades with the introduction of biological therapy targeting primarily soluble mediators produced by inflammatory cells. A large number of biologics are now available, but all of them induce similarly unsatisfactory (<50%) rates of clinical response and remission, and most of them lose efficacy over time, requiring dose escalation or switching from one biologic to another. So, treatment of IBD still needs improvement that will occur only if different approaches are taken. A reason why even the most recent forms of IBD therapy are unsatisfactory is because they target only selected components of an exceedingly complex pathophysiological process, a reality that must be honestly considered if better IBD therapies are to be achieved. Brand new approaches must integrate all relevant factors in their totality - the \"omes\" - and identify the key controllers of biological responses. This can be accomplished by using systems biology-based approaches and advanced bioinformatics tools, which together represent the essence of network medicine. This review looks at the past and the present of IBD pathogenesis and therapy, and discusses how to develop new therapies based on a network medicine approach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32428668/"}

Two studies suggest that when clinicians utilized the guidelines, the majority of their IBD patients were appropriately screened and treated for metabolic bone disease. The aim was to study whether physicians who say they use the AGA Guidelines are, in fact, following the recommendations, and to assess the barriers preventing the use of the guidelines in the management of osteoporosis in their IBD patients. In all, 1000 physicians were selected from the AGA membership list and mailed a survey inquiring into awareness and implementation of the guidelines on osteoporosis in IBD patients. The barriers to implementation of the guidelines were also assessed. The sum of 21 self-reported clinical practices (absence = 0, presence = 1) was used to evaluate adherence to the guidelines. A value of 0 implied no adherence while a score of 21 meant complete adherence. Of 304 responders, 27 fellows, 8 retirees, and 11 incomplete responses were not included in the analysis; thus, 258 respondents were the subject of this analysis. Slightly less than half of the responders used the guidelines in decision-making (126, 49%) or in the management (110, 42%) of their IBD patients. Using the scoring system described above, clinicians self-reporting use of the guidelines had a significantly higher clinical practice score than those who did not use the guidelines (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P < 0.0001). Only 18% (12 of 68) of clinicians whose practice was comprised of <or=25% IBD patients used the guidelines compared to 60% (113/187) physicians who cared for more IBD patients (chi-square test; P < 0.0001). Physicians who saw more IBD patients (>25%) were also more likely (97/187 = 52%) to assess and treat osteoporosis in their IBD patients. Conversely, only 16% (11/68) of physicians who saw <or=25% IBD patients treated osteoporosis (chi-square test; P < 0.0001). The main reason physicians (n = 115) gave for not utilizing the guidelines was because they felt that IBD should be the focus of the visit (48, 42%); 34 (30%) reported that osteoporosis should be managed by another physician. Other barriers cited were lack of time (13, 11%), cost (10, 9%), and lack of knowledge (10, 9%). Most of the responding physicians do not utilize the AGA Guidelines on metabolic bone disease in IBD patients. The physicians who self-reported utilizing the guidelines were actually adhering to the recommendations.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been recognized for over a century in patients with predisposing conditions causing intestinal stasis, such as surgical alteration of the small bowel or chronic diseases, including scleroderma and is associated with diarrhea and signs of malabsorption. Over 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that increased numbers of small intestine bacteria might also account for symptoms in the absence of malabsorption in IBS and related disorders. This SIBO-IBS hypothesis stimulated significant research and helped focus the profession's attention on the importance of microbe-host interactions as a potential pathophysiological mechanism in IBS. However, after two decades, this hypothesis remains unproven. Moreover, it has led to serious unintended consequences, namely the widespread use of unreliable and unvalidated breath tests as a diagnostic test for SIBO and a resultant injudicious use of antibiotics. In this review, we examine why the SIBO hypothesis remains unproven and, given the unintended consequences, discuss why it is time to reject this hypothesis and its reliance on breath testing. We also examine recent IBS studies of bacterial communities in the GI tract, their composition and functions, and their interactions with the host. While these studies provide important insights to guide future research, they highlight the need for further mechanistic studies of microbe-host interactions in IBS patients before we can understand their possible role in diagnosis and treatment of patient with IBS and related disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38798120/"}

These are based on the cost documentation of 200 representative hospitals, coopted by InEK (§ 21-KHEntG-dataset). Since DRGs represent cost averages, one half of German hospitals would be expected to report an annual income surplus, the other half a deficit. In spite of sustained cost reductions two thirds of public University Hospitals, but only 29 % of non-University hospitals, report annual deficits. The German Society for Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) has obtained the § 21-cost-dataset from 74 InEK-hospitals and 7 Mio anonymized cases since 2012 in order to appeal for individual DRG-corrections to InEK. In the current project this database was used to investigate whether the cost of care at University Hospitals is appropriately reflected in three representative DRGs and OPS codes (operation and procedure codes): Liver cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, endoscopic procedure-tiers, and an endoscopic intervention after patient transfer from one hospital to another. The analysis reveals that the higher patient complexity, severity and cost at University Hospitals cannot be corrected by modification or further differentiation of individual DRGs within the existing G-DRG-system. Even in DRGs for which a differentiation would be possible and economically appropriate it is often not permitted. A further rise of the systematic deficit of German University Hospitals (currently 300 Mio. Euro annually) can only be prevented by introducing either a case-based DRG-System-Surcharge for University Hospitals or by separation of a University Hospital U-DRG-System from the general G-DRG-System.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32698232/"}

There is a need for a preventive strategy that can utilize biomarkers in order to stratify patients into appropriate screening or surveillance programs. Biomarkers are clinical variables associated with clinical outcomes. In cancer biology, the best biomarkers are germline adenomatous polyposis coli mutations, which are highly predictive of colon cancer. In other areas, such as Barrett's esophagus, despite early excellent success in identifying the importance of p16, p53, and aneuploidy in esophageal adenocarcinoma pathogenesis, useful biomarkers are still not widely used in clinical practice. New molecular biomarkers may be identified in the next decade, such as epigenetic methylation patterns and genetic polymorphisms. In the meantime, clinicians must rely on robust, inexpensive methods such as standard histopathology. Dysplasia is still the mainstay of cancer prediction in most inflammatory disorders of the GI tract and is an independent marker of cancer risk.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19417749/"}

Cases were analysed by specialty and grade of surgeon performing the procedure. Proportion of cases to which subspecialty fellows were exposed. Two hundred and sixty-two women (11.5%) underwent bowel surgery out of 2280 women undergoing major surgery for gynaecological cancer. This included ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer in 186 women (71%). Of these 262 cases, 238 operations (91%) were performed by a gynaecological oncologist, 20 (7.5%) were performed jointly with the gastrointestinal surgeons and four (1.5%) were performed solely by the gastrointestinal surgeons. A gynaecological oncology subspecialty fellow performed 21 (8%) and assisted in an additional 204 operations (78%). Perioperative morbidity and mortality statistics in addition to overall survival outcomes were comparable to the published literature. A significant proportion of major surgical operations performed within a gynaecological oncology centre require gastrointestinal procedures. The majority of these procedures can be performed by gynaecological oncologists with an acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality rate. Subspecialty training has the potential to allow trainees significant exposure to these procedures.

This update is restricted to addressing the age to start and stop CRC screening in average-risk individuals and the recommended screening modalities. Although there is no literature demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals under age 50 improves health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related mortality, sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is based on the increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50, emerging data that the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in individuals ages 45 to 49 approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and modeling studies that demonstrate the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms and costs. For individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to start or continue screening should be individualized and based on prior screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, and personal preference.

The effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system are now increasingly well understood. This article aims to review the current data on the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system with particular emphasis on preexisting digestive diseases and its implications on nutrition practices. Evidence has shown that Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas and hepatobiliary system resulting in different GI manifestations. Several preexisting digestive diseases have been investigated. These studies have revealed that these special patient population groups are generally not at an increased risk to contract COVID-19, but are susceptible to develop increasing severity of disease. Aside from medical therapy, optimizing nutritional care has a beneficial role in this group of patients. GI manifestations of COVID-19 in addition to preexisting digestive diseases have an impact on patient's nutrition. Digestion, absorption and transport of nutrients may be impaired. To date, there are no existing guidelines on the nutritional management of patients for this particular at-risk group. Most nutrition practices are based only on observations and clinical experience. Basic prepandemic nutrition care principles are primarily followed but often individualized based on clinical judgment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34334686/"}

Assessment of these phenomena in man can be undertaken by using a wide variety of invasive and noninvasive techniques, some well established and others requiring further validation. By using such techniques, alterations in both sensory and motor function have been reported in the FGIDs; various combinations of such dysfunction occur in different regions of the digestive tract in the FGIDs. Our understanding of the origins of this gut sensorimotor dysfunction is gradually increasing. Thus, inflammatory, immunologic, and other processes, as well as psychosocial factors such as stress, can alter the normal patterns of sensitivity and motility through alterations in local reflex activity or via altered neural processing along the brain-gut axis. In this context, a potential role of genetic factors, early-life influences, enteric flora, dietary components, and autonomic dysfunction also should be considered in the disease model. A firm relationship between sensorimotor dysfunction and the production of symptoms, however, has been difficult to show, and so the clinical relevance of the former requires continuing exploration.

We also evaluated how AGIR impacts survival, the need for transplantation (Tx) and the development of liver disease (LD). We conducted a systematic literature search to identify studies published from January 1999 to the present and 947 patients were identified. PN alone was weakly associated with higher probability of weaning from PN (OR = 1.1, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and of surviving (OR = 1.05, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Adjusting for age, the probability of weaning off PN but of not surviving remained significantly associated with PN alone (OR = 1.08, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Finally, adjusting for age and primary diagnosis (gastroschisis), any association was lost. The prevalence of TX and LD did not differ by groups.

The aim of our study was to examine the impact of this clinic in the management of patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). Patients with the diagnosis of BE seen in the outpatient departments or in the endoscopy unit were referred to this clinic. Guidelines were introduced modelling the American College of Gastroenterology recommendation. Patients were assessed based on their comorbidity and willingness to undergo surveillance. Reflux symptom control and acid suppression was addressed. All patients were invited to undergo high-resolution enhanced magnification endoscopy (EME) and targeted biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to form a management plan. During the appointment in the clinic, patients were given an option to fill a questionnaire that inquired about the information given to them regarding BE. One hundred and forty-three patients (92 men, mean age: 62 years) with a diagnosis of BE were seen in the specialist clinic. In 16 patients surveillance was stopped. In 25 patients treatment was changed due to poor control of reflux symptoms. Sixty-five patients (51%) answered the questionnaire. Seventy-five patients (58%) underwent high resolution EME. Twelve patients, had a histological upgrade after EME, in spite of a short mean screening interval (5.5 months). The 'Barrett's specialist clinic' introduced a more structured approach in our institution and changed the way these patients were managed. Our results indicate the need for local guidelines and Barrett's specialist clinics in the UK, and perhaps in the rest of the Western world, wherein the burden of this condition is increasing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16643175/"}

We aimed to clarify the use of PPIs in the evaluation and treatment of children and adults with suspected EoE to develop updated international consensus criteria for EoE diagnosis. A consensus conference was convened to address the issue of PPI use for esophageal eosinophilia using a process consistent with standards described in the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II. Pediatric and adult physicians and researchers from gastroenterology, allergy, and pathology subspecialties representing 14 countries used online communications, teleconferences, and a face-to-face meeting to review the literature and clinical experiences. Substantial evidence documented that PPIs reduce esophageal eosinophilia in children, adolescents, and adults, with several mechanisms potentially explaining the treatment effect. Based on these findings, an updated diagnostic algorithm for EoE was developed, with removal of the PPI trial requirement. EoE should be diagnosed when there are symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field (or approximately 60 eosinophils per mm<sup>2</sup>) on esophageal biopsy and after a comprehensive assessment of non-EoE disorders that could cause or potentially contribute to esophageal eosinophilia. The evidence suggests that PPIs are better classified as a treatment for esophageal eosinophilia that may be due to EoE than as a diagnostic criterion, and we have developed updated consensus criteria for EoE that reflect this change.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009819/"}

Although the structured fields of electronic health records have provided a convenient foundation on which to begin such efforts, it was well understood that a substantial portion of relevant information is confined in the free-text narratives documenting care. Unfortunately, extracting meaningful information from such narratives is a non-trivial task, traditionally requiring significant manual effort. Today, computational approaches from a field known as Natural Language Processing (NLP) are poised to make a transformational impact in the analysis and utilization of these documents across healthcare practice and research, particularly in procedure-heavy sub-disciplines such as gastroenterology (GI). As such, this manuscript provides a clinically focused review of NLP systems in GI practice. It begins with a detailed synopsis around the state of NLP techniques, presenting state-of-the-art methods and typical use cases in both clinical settings and across other domains. Next, it will present a robust literature review around current applications of NLP within four prominent areas of gastroenterology including endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreaticobiliary, and liver diseases. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of open problems and future opportunities of this technology in the field of gastroenterology and health care as a whole.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32107677/"}

GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and \"human-AI teaming\" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use.

Since GI fellowships vary considerably in opportunities for specialized esophageal motility (EM) training, novel educational technology may be leveraged to provide standardized EM curriculum to train GI fellows in esophageal manometry. GI fellows participated in an online EM learning program at a single academic center from 2017 to 2022. Fellows answered case-based questions and were provided with evidence-based, corrective feedback related to core EM learning objectives. The primary outcome was change in knowledge and comfort in interpretation and clinical application of EM studies. Sixty-nine fellows actively participated in the online EM curriculum. 65 fellows completed a pre-curriculum test, and 54 fellows completed a post-curriculum test. There was a cumulative improvement between pre-curriculum test and post-curriculum test scores from 70 to 87%, respectively (p < 0.001).

On the other hand, the less invasive approach such as lifestyle/behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy (Orlistat, Phenteramine, Phentermine/Topiramate, Locaserin, Naltrexon/Buproprion, and Liraglutide) have very limited efficacy, especially in the morbidly obese patients. Despite our best efforts, the epidemic of obesity continues to rise and pose enormous costs on our healthcare system and society. Bariatric endoscopy is an evolving field generated to combat this epidemic through minimally invasive techniques. These procedures can be performed in an ambulatory setting, are potentially reversible, repeatable, and pose less complications than their invasive surgical counterparts. These modalities are designed to alter gut metabolism by means of space occupation, malabsorption, or restriction.

The present article details the minimum hygiene requirements for reprocessing of endoscopes and endoscopic devices, regardless of the reprocessing method (automated washer-disinfector or manual cleaning) and the endoscopy setting (endoscopy suite, operating room, elective or emergency procedures). These minimum requirements are mandatory for patient safety. Both advanced diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopies should be carried out in an environment that is safe for patients and staff. Particular attention is given to contaminants. Procedural errors in decontamination, defective equipment, and failure to follow disinfection guidelines are major factors contributing to transmission of infection during endoscopy. Other important risk factors include inadequate cleaning, use of older endoscopes with surface and working channel irregularities, and contamination of water bottles or irrigating solutions. Infections by multidrug-resistant organisms have become an increasing problem in health-care systems worldwide. Since 2010, outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography have been reported from the USA, France, Germany, and The Netherlands. In many endoscopy units in Asia and the Middle East, reprocessing procedures have lagged behind those of Western countries for cultural reasons or lack of financial resources. This inconsistency in standards is now being addressed, and the World Endoscopy Organization has prepared this position statement to highlight key points for quality assurance in any endoscopy unit in any country.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27696514/"}

This is unacceptable in any circumstances in 2018. It occurs due to a number of conspiring factors including lack of appreciation of the clinical presentation requiring urgent endoscopic intervention; misapprehension of the urgency of timing required of such an intervention predicated on the severity of the gastrointestinal (GI) bleed; lack of application of a paediatric-specific validated score predicting for such endoscopic intervention; lack of skill in endo-haemostatic intervention techniques by paediatric endoscopists; poor training in such techniques among paediatric endoscopists; paucity of cases with lack of exposure of the paediatric endoscopist regularly to enable skills to be maintained, once acquired; reluctance of adult endoscopists in many centres to support paediatric GI bleeding services. In essence then the paediatric GI community urgently needs to identify centres of excellence to whom these children should be transferred.

To assess the utility of three LLMs (ChatGPT-4.0, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Pro) as a reference point for patients with IBD. In this comparative study, two gastroenterology experts generated 15 IBD-related questions that reflected common patient concerns. These questions were used to evaluate the performance of the three LLMs. The answers provided by each model were independently assessed by three IBD-related medical experts using a Likert scale focusing on accuracy, comprehensibility, and correlation. Simultaneously, three patients were invited to evaluate the comprehensibility of their answers. Finally, a readability assessment was performed. Overall, each of the LLMs achieved satisfactory levels of accuracy, comprehensibility, and completeness when answering IBD-related questions, although their performance varies. All of the investigated models demonstrated strengths in providing basic disease information such as IBD definition as well as its common symptoms and diagnostic methods. Nevertheless, when dealing with more complex medical advice, such as medication side effects, dietary adjustments, and complication risks, the quality of answers was inconsistent between the LLMs. Notably, Claude-3-Opus generated answers with better readability than the other two models.

To support this, we have developed quality standard recommendations for the management of ALD, based on evidence and consensus expert opinion, with the aim of improving patient care. A multidisciplinary group of experts from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology ALD Special Interest Group developed the quality standards, with input from the British Liver Trust and patient representatives. The standards cover three broad themes: the recognition and diagnosis of people with ALD in primary care and the liver outpatient clinic; the management of acutely decompensated ALD including acute alcohol-related hepatitis and the posthospital care of people with advanced liver disease due to ALD. Draft quality standards were initially developed by smaller working groups and then an anonymous modified Delphi voting process was conducted by the entire group to assess the level of agreement with each statement.

Analysis was limited to the 1,249 responses from physicians who spent at least 1 day per week in patient care. These physicians frequently managed patients with HCV, and nearly three quarters treated patients with interferon. To prevent transmission, the large majority of physicians recommended measures to avoid blood exposures, were uncertain or disagreed about the importance of sexual contact, and did not caution patients about casual contact. More than 70% of physicians told their patients to stop or minimize alcohol consumption. In the management of a patient with antibody to HCV but normal serum aminotransferase activities, 87% of physicians would have ordered a supplemental test, and if HCV were confirmed, 46% would have obtained a liver biopsy, but only 15% would have treated the patient with interferon. For a patient with chronic HCV infection and elevated serum aminotransferase activities, more than 90% of physicians would have obtained a liver biopsy and approximately 60% would have treated with interferon. Physicians who are most familiar with the management of patients with HCV generally agreed with the recommendations of the Consensus Development Conference Panel regarding prevention of transmission, minimizing alcohol consumption, and managing patients with typical presentations.

It has a significantly steeper learning curve than that for other standard gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy, due to greater technical difficulty and higher risk of complications. Yet, GI fellows have limited exposure to ERCP during standard-three-year-GI-fellowships because ERCP is much less frequently performed than esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy. This led to adding an optional year of training in therapeutic endoscopy. Yet many graduates from standard three-year-fellowships without advanced training intensely pursue independent/unsupervised ERCP privileges despite inadequate numbers of performed ERCPs and unacceptably low rates of successful selective cannulation of desired (biliary or pancreatic) duct. Hospital credentialing committees have traditionally performed ERCP credentialing, but this practice has led to widespread flouting of recommended guidelines (<i>e.g</i>., planned privileging of applicant with 20% successful cannulation rate, or after performing only 7 ERCPs); and intense politicking of committee members by applicants, their practice groups, and potential competitors. Consequently, some gastroenterologists upon completing standard fellowships train and learn ERCP \"on the job\" during independent/unsupervised practice, which can result in bad outcomes: high rates of failed bile duct cannulation. This severe clinical problem is indicated by publication of ≥ 12 ERCP competency studies/guidelines during last 5 years. However, lack of mandatory, quantitative, ERCP credentialing criteria has permitted neglect of recommended guidelines. This work comprehensively reviews literature on ERCP credentialing; reviews rationales for proposed guidelines; reports problems with current system; and proposes novel criteria for competency. This work advocates for mandatory, national, written, minimum, quantitative, standards, including cognitive skills (possibly assessed by a nationwide examination), and technical skills, assessed by number performed (≥ 200-250 ERCPs), types of ERCPs, success rate (approximately ≥ 90% cannulation of desired duct), and letters of recommendation by program director/ERCP mentor. Mandatory criteria should ideally not be monitored by a hospital committee subjected to intense politicking by applicants, their employers, and sometimes even competitors, but an independent national entity, like the National Board of Medical Examiners/American Board of Internal Medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31367151/"}

Some of these techniques initially were reported more than a decade ago; however, with further device development and refinement in techniques there is potential for expanding the application of these techniques and new technologies to a broader group of interventional gastroenterologists. Lack of formalized training, devices, and prospective data regarding their use in addition to a scarcity of guidelines on implementation of these technologies into clinical practice are contributing factors impeding the growth of the field of interventional EUS.

This article is a White Paper generated from the conference, discusses the published literature pertaining to the topic of interventional EUS, and outlines a proposed framework for the implementation of interventional EUS techniques into clinical practice. Three primary areas of interventional EUS are addressed: (1) EUS-guided access; (2) EUS-guided tumor ablation; and (3) endohepatology. There was general agreement among participants on several key components. The introduction of these novel interventions requires better tools, more data on safety/outcomes, and improved training for endoscopists. Participants also agreed that widespread implementation and use of these techniques will require support from Gastrointestinal Societies and other key stakeholders including payers.

CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination.

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, conduct an evidence synthesis, and develop recommendations on the pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe UC. The AGA guideline panel made 14 recommendations. In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA recommends the use of infliximab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, ustekinumab, ozanimod, etrasimod, risankizumab, and guselkumab, and suggests the use of adalimumab, filgotinib, and mirikizumab over no treatment. In patients who are naïve to advanced therapies, the AGA suggests using a higher-efficacy medication (eg, infliximab, vedolizumab, ozanimod, etrasimod, upadacitinib, risankizumab, and guselkumab) or an intermediate-efficacy medication (eg, golimumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, filgotinib, and mirikizumab) rather than a lower-efficacy medication (eg, adalimumab). In patients who have previously been exposed to 1 or more advanced therapies, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists, the AGA suggests using a higher-efficacy medication (eg, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and ustekinumab) or an intermediate-efficacy medication (eg, filgotinib, mirikizumab, risankizumab, and guselkumab) rather than a lower-efficacy medication (eg, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ozanimod, and etrasimod). In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA suggests against using thiopurine monotherapy for induction of remission, but suggests using thiopurine monotherapy over no treatment for maintenance of (typically corticosteroid-induced) remission. The AGA suggests against using methotrexate monotherapy, for induction or maintenance of remission. In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA suggests the use of infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab in combination with an immunomodulator over corresponding monotherapy. However, the AGA makes no recommendation in favor of, or against, the use of non-TNF antagonist biologics in combination with an immunomodulator over non-TNF biologic alone. In patients with UC who are in corticosteroid-free clinical remission for at least 6 months on combination therapy of TNF antagonists and an immunomodulator, the AGA suggests against withdrawal of TNF antagonists, but makes no recommendation in favor of, or against, withdrawing immunomodulators. In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, who have failed 5-aminosalicylates, and have escalated to therapy with immunomodulators or advanced therapies, the AGA suggests stopping 5-aminosalicylates. Finally, in adult outpatients with moderate-severe UC, the AGA suggests early use of advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step-up after failure of 5-aminosalicylates. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal use of these medications and identified several knowledge gaps and areas for future research. This guideline provides a comprehensive, patient-centered approach to the pharmacological management of patients with moderate-to-severe UC.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39572132/"}

Magnetic resonance enterography is a method for non-invasively diagnosing and following various GI conditions, predominantly inflammatory bowel disease. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound uses gas-filled microbubbles providing superb temporal resolution most notably in the arterial phase, which aids in differentiating lesions. Elastography is a new technique which assesses stiffness of liver for evaluating fibrosis. These new techniques provide more accurate diagnoses and information, often limiting ionizing radiation exposure from other modalities.

Thanks to the availability of sensitive technologies for breath analysis, this empiric approach has recently gained increasing attention in the context of hepatology, following the good results obtained in other fields of medicine. After the first studies that led to the identification of selected VOCs for pathophysiological purposes, subsequent research has progressively turned towards the comprehensive assessment of exhaled breath for potential clinical application. Specific VOC patterns were found to discriminate subjects with liver cirrhosis, to rate disease severity, and, eventually, to forecast adverse clinical outcomes even beyond existing scores. Preliminary results suggest that breath analysis could be useful also for detecting and staging hepatic encephalopathy and for predicting steatohepatitis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, clinical translation is still hampered by a number of methodological limitations, including the lack of standardization and the consequent poor comparability between studies and the absence of external validation of obtained results.

Whereas not all gastroenterology units have the same resources to develop dedicated IBD facilities and services, there are steps that can be taken by any unit to optimise patients' access to interdisciplinary expert care. A series of pragmatic recommendations relating to IBD unit optimisation have been developed through discussion among a large panel of international experts. Suggested recommendations were extracted through systematic search of published evidence and structured requests for expert opinion. Physicians [n = 238] identified as IBD specialists by publications or clinical focus on IBD were invited for discussion and recommendation modification [Barcelona, Spain; 2014]. Final recommendations were voted on by the group. Participants also completed an online survey to evaluate their own experience related to IBD units. A total of 60% of attendees completed the survey, with 15% self-classifying their centre as a dedicated IBD unit. Only half of respondents indicated that they had a defined IBD treatment algorithm in place. Key recommendations included the need to develop a multidisciplinary team covering specifically-defined specialist expertise in IBD, to instil processes that facilitate cross-functional communication and to invest in shared care models of IBD management. Optimising the setup of IBD units will require progressive leadership and willingness to challenge the status quo in order to provide better quality of care for our patients.

However, diagnostic accuracy and procedural outcomes vary significantly depending on the endoscopist's skill and experience, leading to potential missed lesions and inconsistent patient care. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into endoscopic practice offers a promising solution to address these limitations and enhance diagnostic precision. This review explores the current applications of AI in endoscopy, focusing on image analysis, lesion detection, classification, and workflow optimization, while evaluating the impact on clinical practice and identifying implementation challenges. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore databases for studies published between January 2010 and December 2024. Keywords included \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Endoscopy,\" \"Gastrointestinal Diseases,\" \"Image Analysis,\" and \"Lesion Detection.\" Studies were selected based on their focus on AI applications in endoscopy with quantitative or qualitative data on performance and clinical impact. AI demonstrates exceptional capabilities in polyp detection, achieving detection rates that often surpass those of human practitioners, with systems such as GI Genius showing high sensitivity and specificity. Convolutional neural networks excel in real-time lesion identification and classification, differentiating between benign and malignant growths with remarkable precision. AI also optimizes endoscopic workflows through automated reporting and advanced training tools. Although AI integration shows promise for enhancing endoscopic diagnostic accuracy and procedural efficiency, successful implementation requires careful consideration of current limitations, including reliance on industry-sponsored studies, and addressing challenges in data quality, clinical workflow integration, and regulatory considerations. Future developments in advanced algorithms, personalized medicine, and telemedicine may further advance endoscopic practice and improve patient outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840824/"}

In fact, bacterial infections may be a triggering factor for the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, kidney failure, and development of acute-on-chronic liver failure. Moreover, infections are a very common cause of repeated hospitalizations, impaired health-related quality of life, and increased healthcare costs in cirrhosis. Bacterial infections develop as a consequence of immune dysfunction that occurs progressively during the course of cirrhosis. In a significant proportion of patients, infections are caused by gram-negative bacteria from intestinal origin, yet gram-positive bacteria are a frequent cause of infection, particularly in hospitalized patients. In recent years, infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are becoming an important clinical problem in many countries. The reduction of the negative clinical impact of infections in patients with cirrhosis may be achieved by a combination of prophylactic measures, such as administration of antibiotics, to reduce the occurrence of infections in high-risk groups together with early identification and management of infection once it has developed. Investigation on the mechanisms of altered gut microflora, translocation of bacteria, and immune dysfunction may help develop more effective and safe methods of prevention compared to those that are currently available. Moreover, research on biomarkers of early infection may be useful in early diagnosis and treatment of infections.

{"id": "32022720", "title": "ACG Clinical Guideline: Chronic Pancreatitis.", "text": "Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is historically defined as an irreversible inflammatory condition of the pancreas leading to varying degrees of exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. Recently however, the paradigm for the diagnosis has changed in that it breaks with the traditional clinicopathologic-based definition of disease, focusing instead on diagnosing the underlying pathologic process early in the disease course and managing the syndrome more holistically to change the natural course of disease and minimize adverse disease effects. Currently, the most accepted mechanistically derived definition of CP is a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. The most common symptom of CP is abdominal pain, with other symptoms such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes developing at highly variable rates. CP is most commonly caused by toxins such as alcohol or tobacco use, genetic polymorphisms, and recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, although no history of acute pancreatitis is seen in many patients. Diagnosis is made usually on cross-sectional imaging, with modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography and pancreatic function tests playing a secondary role. Total pancreatectomy represents the only known cure for CP, although difficulty in patient selection and the complications inherent to this intervention make it usually an unattractive option. This guideline will provide an evidence-based practical approach to the diagnosis and management of CP for the general gastroenterologist.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32022720/"}

Over half a century original studies, reviews and guidelines covering the topics of acute and chronic pancreatitis as well as pancreatic cancer have assumed a prominent role on its pages. Already in the first edition of the Journal Haemmerli and Hefti have summarized the Zurich experience with chronic pancreatitis and provided a detailed state-of-the-art review for the year 1963. 50 years later the current guidelines of the German Society of Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) have been published in the same Journal and allow to summarize the scientific progress over this period. Back then chronic pancreatitis was regarded as a rare disorder (tenfold less common than e. g. acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer). This misconception had little to do with actual prevalence but with highly insensitive diagnostic tests, particularly in the area of diagnostic imaging. While pathogenetic factors for chronic pancreatitis, including a possible genetic disposition, were largely known in 1963, our understanding of their cellular mechanisms has very much improved. The greatest progress in diagnostic options was achieved by the introduction of novel imaging techniques such as ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound, ERCP, CT and MRCP. In terms of therapy the notion that a blockage of pancreatitic secretion is an effective pharmacological option has been abandoned and endoscopic intervention and surgical treatment have been newly developed as alternatives.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23585264/"}

The current recommendations for gastroesophageal varices include pharmacological treatment, endoscopic treatment, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, and splenectomy with devascularization surgery. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprises of a group of medical experts and specialists across a range of disciplines, providing personalized and targeted patient care tailored to each individual's condition, circumstances, and expectations. Patients referred to the MDT clinic since its establishment in September 2014 were prospectively enrolled and followed-up for at least 12 months. Patient baseline characteristics, treatment methods, outcome and survival were compared to non-MDT patients retrieved from a prospectively maintained database with propensity score matching. Propensity-score matching (PSM) was carried out to balance available covariates, resulting in 58 MDT patients vs. 111 non-MDT patients. Overall survival and variceal rebleed was compared between the two groups. The rate of variceal rebleed was significantly higher in the non-MDT group, while no difference in overall survival was observed. This study is the first to investigate the role of a multidisciplinary team in the management of gastroesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension.

Although MASLD serves as an umberlla term, its subtype of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with a prevalence of 5-7%, can lead to adverse liver outcomes including cirrhosis and liver mortality. However, prevalence rates for MASLD/MASH vary by country and region of the world. With the increasing rates of type 2 diabetes and obesity, MASLD/MASH is increasing and is currently among the top causes of hepatocellular carcinoma and an indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Therefore, the care model is shifting to prevention given this large clinical, economic and humanistic burden of this liver disease. As in other noncommunicable diseases, interventional priorities for policymakers should be focused on building infrastructure that supports physical activity and healthy food choices as well as access to approved treatments for MASLD. At the same time, identifying individuals at risk for adverse outcomes using non-invasive tests and developing individual care plans that address the needs of each patient with MASLD, including their mental and physical health, should be a focus for healthcare providers. Furthermore, raising awareness among patients, the public and healthcare providers continues to be a crucial need. This report will provide recommendations for policymakers to provide the needed interventions to reverse the current trajectory of this liver disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40960268/"}

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of GI bleeding is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing high healthcare utilization and costs. Radiologic techniques including computed tomography angiography, catheter angiography, computed tomography enterography, magnetic resonance enterography, nuclear medicine red blood cell scan, and technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy (Meckel scan) are frequently used to evaluate patients with GI bleeding and are complementary to GI endoscopy. However, multiple management guidelines exist which differ in the recommended utilization of these radiologic examinations. This variability can lead to confusion as to how these tests should be used in the evaluation of GI bleeding. In this document, a panel of experts from the American College of Gastroenterology and Society of Abdominal Radiology provide a review of the radiologic examinations used to evaluate for GI bleeding including nomenclature, technique, performance, advantages, and limitations. A comparison of advantages and limitations relative to endoscopic examinations is also included. Finally, consensus statements and recommendations on technical parameters and utilization of radiologic techniques for GI bleeding are provided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38857483/"}

Characteristics associated with guideline adherence among US gastroenterologists have not been assessed. Assess awareness and adherence of US gastroenterologists with national guidelines for colonoscopy screening and surveillance and predictors of adherence to guidelines. A Web-based survey was administered to gastroenterologists in various practice settings across the USA. A total of 306 gastroenterologists completed the survey; 86 % reported awareness of the guidelines. Low-volume colonoscopists (<20/month) were less likely to be aware of the guidelines (OR 0.26, p = 0.03) compared to high-volume colonoscopists (>100/month). Those completing training before 1990 were less likely to report following guidelines (OR 0.37, p = 0.01). Adherence with guidelines was then assessed via clinical scenarios. Compared to physicians finishing training in 1991-2010, less adherence was seen in those finishing before 1990 (OR 0.75, p < 0.001) or currently in training (OR 0.72, p = 0.004). Compared to the Western USA, less adherence was seen in the Midwest (OR 0.69, p = 0.001), Northeast (OR 0.63, p < 0.001), and South (OR 0.59, p < 0.001). Lower adherence was seen among non-academic physicians (OR 0.72, p = 0.001) and low-volume colonoscopists (OR 0.52, p < 0.001). There is poor adherence with colonoscopy screening and surveillance guidelines among US gastroenterologists. Poor adherence was associated with being in training or finishing training before 1990, practicing in the South, non-academic settings, and low colonoscopy volume.

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and relied on the following sources of evidence: (1) a systematic review examining the desirable and undesirable effects (ie, benefits and harms) of CADe-assisted colonoscopy, (2) a microsimulation study estimating the effects of CADe on longer-term patient-important outcomes, (3) a systematic search of evidence evaluating the values and preferences of patients undergoing colonoscopy, and (4) a systematic review of studies evaluating health care providers' trust in artificial intelligence technology in gastroenterology. The panel reached the conclusion that no recommendation could be made for or against the use of CADe-assisted colonoscopy in light of very low certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes, desirable and undesirable (11 fewer colorectal cancers per 10,000 individuals and 2 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 10,000 individuals), increased burden of more intensive surveillance colonoscopies (635 more per 10,000 individuals), and cost and resource implications. The panel acknowledged the 8% (95% CI, 6%-10%) increase in adenoma detection rate and 2% (95% CI, 0%-4%) increase in advanced adenoma and/or sessile serrated lesion detection rate.

The current paradigm is to seed a biocompatible support material (scaffold) with a desired cell population to generate viable replacement tissue. Although this technique has now been extended by the three-dimensional (3D) printing of geometrically complex scaffolds, the overall approach is hindered by relatively slow turnover and negative effects of residual scaffold material, which affects final clinical outcome. Methods recently developed for scaffold-free 3D bioprinting may overcome such obstacles and should allow for rapid manufacture and deployment of \"bioprinted organs.\" Much work remains before 3D bioprinted tissues can enter clinical use.

Gastroenterology has been one of the casualties of this exercise and few companies currently retain a specific gastrointestinal research programme. Acid-peptic disease has been the victim of its own success, since the availability of a range of extremely effective drugs largely satisfies current medical needs. A safe, convenient and effective monotherapy able to eradicate Helicobacter pylori would be a commercially viable alternative to antisecretory drugs, leading to further expansion of the anti-ulcer market. The irritable bowel syndrome is probably too diverse a target for logical research: inflammatory bowel disease is probably too small a market to be attractive. Potentially effective drugs to treat these and other gastrointestinal diseases could emerge from broader research programmes, provided that companies retain the expertise and desire to develop such agents for gastrointestinal indications. Cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs undoubtedly represents a commercially attractive target, but new anti-tumour drugs are more likely to arise from generic research rather than programmes specifically directed at tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. The changing view of the pharmaceutical industry towards the development of gastrointestinal drugs is likely to have a negative impact on both fundamental and clinical research in gastroenterology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8580264/"}

Logistic regression analyses assessed for associations between clinico-demographic variables and adverse clinical endpoints (previous surgery [ever] and/or recent inpatient admission over a 16 month observation period). Of 256 IBD patients, 162 responded (response rate 63%); 95 (59%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 63 (40%) ulcerative colitis (UC), four indeterminate colitis; 53% were female.

We performed this study to document this difficulty and to determine whether sigmoid colectomy prevents it. Data were acquired from a single endoscopist's prospective database. Colonoscopies performed in women were grouped according to history of hysterectomy and/or sigmoid colectomy. Groups were compared for colonoscopy completion rate, medication used, and time of examination. Participation of fellows and rate of complications were recorded. Patients with a history of abdominal-perineal resection of the rectum were excluded. From 1989 to 2006, a total of 4116 colonoscopies were performed in women: 993 had undergone hysterectomy (24.1%), of whom 108 (10.9%) had also undergone sigmoid colectomy. There were 3123 exams in woman who had their uterus (75.9%); 320 (10.2%) had undergone sigmoid colectomy. Patients who still had a sigmoid colon but had a history of hysterectomy had significantly lower colonoscopy completion rates (89.2%) and significantly longer mean examination time (28.9 +/- 12.3 minutes), and more of them required sedation with benzodiazepines (88.7%) than the other groups (P < .05).

Among the forefront of these innovations are large language models (LLMs), a subset of artificial intelligence designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language at an unprecedented scale. This systematic review describes the role of LLMs in improving diagnostic accuracy, automating documentation, and advancing specialist education and patient engagement within the field of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Core databases including MEDLINE through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central registry were searched using keywords related to LLMs (from inception to April 2024). Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) any type of studies that investigated the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) studies published in English, and (3) studies in full-text format. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did not report the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) case reports and review papers, (3) ineligible research objects (eg, animals or basic research), and (4) insufficient data regarding the potential role of LLMs. Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions was used to evaluate the quality of the identified studies. Overall, 21 studies on the potential role of LLMs in gastrointestinal disorders were included in the systematic review, and narrative synthesis was done because of heterogeneity in the specified aims and methodology in each included study. The overall risk of bias was low in 5 studies and moderate in 16 studies. The ability of LLMs to spread general medical information, offer advice for consultations, generate procedure reports automatically, or draw conclusions about the presumptive diagnosis of complex medical illnesses was demonstrated by the systematic review. Despite promising benefits, such as increased efficiency and improved patient outcomes, challenges related to data privacy, accuracy, and interdisciplinary collaboration remain. We highlight the importance of navigating these challenges to fully leverage LLMs in transforming gastrointestinal endoscopy practices.

{"id": "39708000", "title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on Management of Portal Vein Thrombosis in Patients With Cirrhosis: Expert Review.", "text": "Portal vein thromboses (PVTs) are common in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with advanced portal hypertension and mortality. The treatment of PVTs remains a clinical challenge due to limited evidence and competing risks of PVT-associated complications vs bleeding risk of anticoagulation. Significant heterogeneity in PVT phenotype based on anatomic, host, and disease characteristics, and an emerging spectrum of therapeutic options further complicate PVT management. This Clinical Practice Update (CPU) aims to provide best practice advice for the evaluation and management of PVT in cirrhosis, including the role of direct oral anticoagulants and endovascular interventions. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with PVTs identified on Doppler ultrasound should undergo cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate for malignancy, and document the degree of lumen occlusion, clot extent, and chronicity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboemboli or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT with evidence of intestinal ischemia require urgent anticoagulation to minimize ischemic injury. If available, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and hepatology, interventional radiology, hematology, and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Consider observation, with repeat imaging every 3 months until clot regression, in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia and recent (<6 months) thrombosis involving the intrahepatic portal vein branches or when there is <50% occlusion of the main portal vein, splenic vein, or mesenteric veins. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Anticoagulation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia who develop recent (<6 months) PVT that is >50% occlusive or involves the main portal vein or mesenteric vessels. Patients who have increased benefit of recanalization include those with involvement of more than 1 vascular bed, those with thrombus progression, potential liver transplantation candidates, and those with inherited thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Anticoagulation is not advised for patients with cirrhosis with chronic (>6 months) PVT with complete occlusion with collateralization (cavernous transformation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are all reasonable anticoagulant options for patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Decision making should be individualized and informed by patient preference and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class. Direct oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients with compensated Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B cirrhosis and offer convenience as their dosages are independent of international normalized ratio monitoring. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response to treatment. If clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in nontransplantation patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may be considered for selected patients with cirrhosis and PVT who have additional indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, such as those with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding. Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may also be considered for transplantation candidates if recanalization can facilitate the technical feasibility of transplantation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39708000/"}

For each vignette, raters identified the most likely Rome IV diagnosis(es) and selected which diagnostic test(s) (if any) they typically would obtain. The survey was re-administered within 3 months. Inter-rater and intra-rater weighted percent agreement was determined. Linear mixed modeling identified sources of variability in diagnostic testing. Thirty-four raters completed the initial survey of whom thirty-one (91%) completed the repeat survey. Overall inter-rater agreement on Rome IV diagnoses was 68% for initial and repeat surveys whereas intra-rater agreement was 76%. In contrast, overall inter-rater agreement on diagnostic testing was <30% for both initial and repeat surveys and intra-rater agreement was only 57%. Between-physician differences accounted for 43% of the variability in the number of tests selected. Rater identified use of Rome criteria in clinical practice was associated with 1.1 fewer diagnostic tests on average (95% CI 0.2-2.0, p = 0.015). Higher intra-rater agreement was noted for diagnostic testing in faculty when compared to fellows (p = 0.009). In a multicenter evaluation among pediatric gastroenterology physicians, pediatric Rome IV diagnostic agreement was higher than that reported for previous Rome versions, and higher than agreement on diagnostic testing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35279913/"}

Big Data in health care are defined as large datasets that are collected routinely or automatically, and stored electronically. With the rapidly expanding volume of health data collection, it is envisioned that the Big Data approach can improve not only individual health, but also the performance of health care systems. The application of Big Data analysis in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology research has also opened new research approaches. While it retains most of the advantages and avoids some of the disadvantages of traditional observational studies (case-control and prospective cohort studies), it allows for phenomapping of disease heterogeneity, enhancement of drug safety, as well as development of precision medicine, prediction models and personalized treatment. Unlike randomized controlled trials, it reflects the real-world situation and studies patients who are often under-represented in randomized controlled trials. However, residual and/or unmeasured confounding remains a major concern, which requires meticulous study design and various statistical adjustment methods. Other potential drawbacks include data validity, missing data, incomplete data capture due to the unavailability of diagnosis codes for certain clinical situations, and individual privacy. With continuous technological advances, some of the current limitations with Big Data may be further minimized.

As part of our health system's efforts to provide more cost-effective care under risk-based contracts, we implemented an e-consult program where referring providers submit patient-specific clinical questions electronically via an electronic referral system. A GI consultant then reviews the patient's record and provides a written recommendation back to the referring physician. For our program evaluation, we conducted chart reviews of each e-consult to understand how the program was being used and surveyed the participating providers and consultants. From September 2015 to March 2016, we received 144 e-consults, with most questions concerning GI symptoms or abnormal hepatology labs. Only 36% of e-consults recommended an in-person GI consult or procedure. In our survey of participating providers, referring providers strongly agreed that the GI e-consults promoted good patient care (88%) and were satisfied with the program (84%). The majority of GI consultants felt strongly that e-consults were useful for referring providers and their patients, but that current reimbursement and time allotted were not adequate. We report on the implementation of a GI e-consult program within an ACO, showing that many clinical questions could be answered using this mechanism.

Of these, 73 articles met the inclusion criteria. These articles were evaluated using previously published criteria for equivalency. Of the included articles, 33% stated an a priori research aim of equivalency, 92% reported differences of <20% between \"equal\" interventions, 34% set an equivalency boundary and tested it appropriately, and 19% performed a sample size calculation for equivalency. Overall, 12% of the reviewed articles met all 5 criteria. Fifty-two percent of our sample inappropriately used a failed superiority test (i.e., a P value > 0.05) as statistical \"proof\" of equivalency. Nonsurgical trials and those published between 1996 and 2002 were more likely to meet criteria than were surgical trials (P = 0.07) or trials published before 1996 (P = 0.003).

Thirty patients with histologically diagnosed CLO, 15 age and sex matched patients with oesophagitis (grade 1-3), and 15 healthy volunteers were studied by dual probe, 18 hour pH monitoring and analysis of the bile acid content of oesophageal refluxate. Total acid exposure and acid exposure in the upright and supine postures were greater in CLO subjects than in oesophagitis patients and controls. Furthermore, the number of reflux episodes lasting more than five minutes and the duration of the longest reflux episode were significantly greater in the CLO subjects than the oesophagitis and control subjects. Nine subjects with CLO and oesophagitis, however, were not identified as refluxers, although six had a bile acid concentration in their oesophageal aspirate higher than the 95th centile value of the controls. There was no correlation between the oesophageal pH and the bile acid contents of refluxate.

Two recent national surveys, focused on common DGBIs, highlighted two main issues. Despite the high incidence of DGBIs there is a lack of awareness and appropriate training to effectively treat these conditions and a lack of specific referral centers in each region. Indeed, specific training and a multidisciplinary approach are required to properly manage these patients, but these are not always available. As a result, NGE lacks attractiveness for many young gastroenterologists. We believe that NGE has great potential to emerge among the various sub-branches of gastroenterology. However, its growth is limited by lack of specific training, knowledge, accessibility, diagnostic capabilities, multidisciplinary integration, and financial investments in research. To bridge this gap, it would be helpful to overcome these limits through an increase in specific training concerning DGBIs among students, residents, physicians and general practitioners.

Endoscopic screening with esophageal capsule endoscopy and, to a lesser extent, ultrathin upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may replace conventional endoscopy. In addition to standard treatments for esophageal varices, removable esophageal stents with expansile pressure may be utilized in refractory variceal hemorrhage. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be performed by hepatologists. Advances in argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy may result in novel treatment options for portal hypertensive gastropathy. Single-fiber cholangioscopy will allow for directed endoscopic screening for cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis in high-risk individuals. Minilaparoscopy will allow a macroscopic assessment of the liver surface as well as the ability to target specific regions for histopathology, and treatment including radiofrequency ablation of liver cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may provide the potential to directly measure portal vein pressure and this may have a future role in titration and optimization of pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension. EUS and fine needle aspiration may be used for staging hepatocellular and bile duct cancer. Finally, natural orifice transluminal surgery and endoscopic ultrasound-guided angiography may allow for targeted therapies traditionally outside the realm of the hepatologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17415347/"}

We determined the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on GI symptoms, volume consumed, and GMA induced by the caloric meal satiety test (CMST) and water load satiety test (WLST) in DGP. Forty-five patients with DGP underwent CMST and WLST at baseline and 24 weeks after CSII with CGM. Subjects ingested the test meals until they were completely full. Visual analog scales were used to quantify pre- and postmeal symptoms, and GMA was recorded with cutaneous electrodes and analyzed visually and by computer. KEY RESULTS: At baseline and 24-week visits, nausea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, and fullness were immediately increased after CMST and WLST (Ps < 0.01). The meal volumes ingested were significantly less than normal controls at both visits in almost one-third of the subjects. After the CMST, the percentage 3 cycle per minute GMA increased and bradygastria decreased compared with WLST (Ps < 0.05). After treatment for 24 weeks meal volumes ingested, postmeal symptoms and GMA were no different than baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: (a) Satiety test meals elicited symptoms of nausea, bloating, and abdominal discomfort; (b) CMST stimulated more symptoms and changes in GMA than WLST; and (c) CSII with CGM for 24 weeks did not improve symptoms, volumes ingested, or GMA elicited by the two satiety test meals in these patients with diabetic GP. Satiety tests in diabetic gastropresis are useful to study acute postprandial symptoms and GMA, but these measures were not improved by intensive insulin therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31574209/"}

A prospective survey of patients before screening or surveillance colonoscopy at university hospital, community hospital, and ambulatory procedure center endoscopy units was performed from 2011 to 2012. Among the 417 participants, 20% (85/417) researched their physician's rating. The rates of familiarity with CQM were 88 % (353/402) for adequate bowel preparation, 30% (118/398) for adenoma detection rate (ADR), 26% (102/397) for cecal intubation rate, and 21% (82/394) for greater-than-6-min withdrawal time. Ninety-six percent (366/386) believed that colonoscopists' reporting of ADR to other physicians was important or very important. In selecting a colonoscopist, primary care provider referral was ranked as the first or second-most important of four factors in 87% (339/391). Even among patients who responded \"it is very important\" to report CQM to other doctors and patients, none ranked CQM as the most important factor in selecting a colonoscopist. Patient awareness of CQM, other than adequate bowel preparation, was low. Quality measure reporting is important to patients, but primary care provider referral was the most important factor in colonoscopist selection. This suggests that primary care providers, as well as patients, are important to include in educational strategies regarding quality metrics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25070055/"}

Although the diagnostic criteria for Hirschsprung disease are well established, those for other forms of dysganglionosis remain ill-defined. Appropriate tissue sampling, handling, and expert interpretation are crucial to maximize diagnostic accuracy and reduce interobserver variability. The absence of validated age-related normal values for neuronal density, along with the lack of correlation between clinical and histological findings, result in significant diagnostic uncertainties while diagnosing quantitative aberrations such as hypoganglionosis or ultrashort Hirschsprung disease. Intestinal neuronal dysplasia remains a histological description of unclear significance.

Since the start of the pandemic, our increased understanding of transmission has facilitated the implementation of practices to promote patient and health care worker (HCW) safety. Simultaneously, there has been increasing recognition of the potential harm associated with delays in patient care, as well as inefficiency of endoscopy units. With widespread vaccination of HCWs and the general population, a re-evaluation of AGA's prior recommendations was warranted. In order to update the role of preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2, the AGA guideline panel reviewed the evidence on prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections in individuals undergoing endoscopy; patient and HCW risk of infections that may be acquired immediately before, during, or after endoscopy; effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in reducing risk of infections and transmission; patient and HCW anxiety; patient delays in care and potential impact on cancer burden; and endoscopy volumes. The panel considered the certainty of the evidence, weighed the benefits and harms of routine preprocedure testing, and considered burden, equity, and cost using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel made a conditional recommendation against routine preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy. The panel placed a high value on minimizing additional delays in patient care, acknowledging the reduced endoscopy volumes, downstream impact on delayed cancer diagnoses, and burden of testing on patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34029569/"}

The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity remains a difficult task because of the lack of reliable markers for use in general clinical practice. To incriminate any given drug in an episode of liver dysfunction is a step-by-step process that requires a high degree of suspicion, compatible chronology, awareness of the drug's hepatotoxic potential, the exclusion of alternative causes of liver damage and the ability to detect the presence of subtle data that favors a toxic etiology. This process is time-consuming and the final result is frequently inaccurate. Diagnostic algorithms may add consistency to the diagnostic process by translating the suspicion into a quantitative score. Such scales are useful since they provide a framework that emphasizes the features that merit attention in cases of suspected hepatic adverse reaction as well. Current efforts in collecting bona fide cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity will make refinements of existing scales feasible. It is now relatively easy to accommodate relevant data within the scoring system and to delete low-impact items. Efforts should also be directed toward the development of an abridged instrument for use in evaluating suspected drug-induced hepatotoxicity at the very beginning of the diagnosis and treatment process when clinical decisions need to be made.

Patients with moderate to severe CD are at high risk for needing surgery and hospitalization and for developing disease-related complications, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. Optimal management of outpatients with moderate to severe luminal and/or fistulizing (including perianal) CD often requires the use of immunomodulator (thiopurines, methotrexate) and/or biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators) to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe CD are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Since the last iteration of these guidelines published in 2013, significant advances have been made in the field, including the regulatory approval of 2 new biologic agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized updating clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. The review addressed the following focused questions (in adult outpatients with moderate to severe luminal CD): overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, comparative efficacy of a top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up treatment strategy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of mesalamine), and the role of corticosteroids and mesalamine for induction and/or maintenance of remission.

Presentations were divided into esophageal, antral duodenal, and colorectal modules. Each module included oral presentations by experts in the respective fields, leading to thought-provoking discussions. There were 2 breakout sessions with small group discussions on select topics, focusing on defining scientific insights into the diagnosis and management of pediatric functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders in a systematic, segment-based approach. The field of neurogastroenterology has made remarkable progress in the last decade. The current report summarizes the major learning points from the symposium highlighting the diagnosis and promising therapies on the horizon for pediatric neurogastrointestinal and motility disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32287151/"}

A survey analysis.", "text": "The decrease in available GI fellowship positions appears to be associated with a disproportionate decrease in the quality of applicants. Thus, the aims of this study were: 1) to determine the current interest in advanced training of nonprimary care internal medicine residents at university medical centers, and 2) to identify the reasons why fellowship-bound residents are not pursuing GI. Postage prepaid survey cards were distributed directly to the campus mailboxes of 1862 internal medicine residents at 61 university medical centers at the beginning of their second postgraduate year of training. E-mail questionnaires were then sent to 144 residents planning fellowship training and careers in academia other than in GI/hepatology. A total of 592 residents (32% response) returned completed survey cards. Overall, 392 (66%) indicated that they will pursue fellowship training and approximately 60% wanted to remain in academia. However, <10% indicated an interest in GI/hepatology. E-mail replies were then obtained from 122 residents (87% response) planning academic careers but not in GI. The major reasons for disinterest in GI/hepatology include the perception that jobs are not widely available, that the field is intellectually unchallenging, as well as that is too procedure-oriented. The majority of residents at university training programs plan advanced training and want to pursue careers in academia, but not in GI/hepatology. Efforts to attract highly qualified residents to GI must emphasize the improved job market, especially as it exists in academia; must advertise research opportunities; and must de-emphasize the procedural nature of this subspecialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10710074/"}

A similar proportion of inpatients had digestive diagnoses, but the four disorders listed above decreased markedly in the second half of the 19th century, so that by the turn of the century the commonest diseases were typhlitis (appendicitis), hemorrhoids and other anal problems. By the 1990s, digestive diseases accounted for only 5% of total admissions, hepatobiliary diagnoses being the commonest group. Some cancers such as gastric and esophageal showed little change, while colorectal increased markedly. Some newly recognized diseases, such as peptic ulcer, waxed and then waned, while colitis and regional enteritis came and have continued to increase.

If science is allowed to proceed at its current rate, expectations can hardly be underestimated.

For the next few decades, the global eradication of viral hepatitis will be on the agenda. For the treatment of inherited and acquired metabolic, toxic and immune liver disease, targeted drugs, genes and antisense oligonucleotides will be added to our therapeutic repertoire. The completion of the human genome project in 2003 will have far-reaching consequences: the widespread use of prenatal diagnosis, using DNA chip technology, may be expected to cause a dramatic decrease in the incidence of inherited diseases. Liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and inborn errors of metabolism may be treated by gene transfer or gene repair therapy. Although eventually these developments may decrease the need for organ transplantation, this by no means is the case yet and no solution is available for an increased demand and a decreased supply of organs. In the long run, diseases caused by multi-drug-resistant infectious agents and diseases associated with the abuse of alcohol and drugs are expected to become major problems. The future of university-based research is uncertain. The staggering costs of research and limited career possibilities may force universities to the limited task of higher education, with as a result biotech companies, shareholders and corporate finance ruling the scientific waves in the next century.

Our goal was to describe the effectiveness of this program from a trainees perspective. Areas covered: We describe the training model, learning experiences, and outcomes of one-month apprenticeship-based training in NGM at a center of excellence, using a detailed individual observer account and data from 12 consecutive trainees that completed the program. During a one-month training period, 302 procedures including; breath tests (BT) n = 132, anorectal manometry (ARM) n = 29 and esophageal manometry (EM) n = 28, were performed. Post-training, all trainees (n = 12) knew indications for motility tests, and the majority achieved independence in basic interpretation of BT, EM and ARM. Additionally, in a multiple-choice NGM written-test paper, trainees achieved significant improvements in test scores post-training (P = 0.003).

It encompasses two main subtypes: lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. This position paper from the Brazilian Federation of Gastroenterology aims to review current evidence on the diagnosis and management of MC in Brazil, emphasizing the need for standardization across the country's healthcare systems. A comprehensive review of the latest scientific literature, clinical guidelines, and consensus statements was performed, focusing on randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies. The evidence was analyzed by a panel of gastroenterologists and pathologists specializing in MC. The recommendations were based on the consensus of the group, approved by the majority of the panel members. Histological examination with biopsies from multiple segments of the colon remains essential for the accurate diagnosis of MC, as endoscopic findings are often non-specific. Budesonide is the first-line treatment for inducing remission in most patients. However, alternatives such as immunosuppressants and biologics are available for those who are refractory to or intolerant of budesonide. Non-pharmacological interventions, including dietary and lifestyle modifications, can complement medical treatment. The need for long-term follow-up is highlighted due to the high recurrence rates and the impact of MC on the quality of life. Standardizing the diagnosis and treatment of MC in Brazil is crucial, given the significant regional disparities in healthcare access. This position paper provides evidence-based recommendations to optimize care and improve patient outcomes across diverse clinical settings in Brazil. Further research is needed to address the gaps in understanding the epidemiology and management of MC in underserved regions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39776129/"}

The variable gender was extracted for all authors and race was extracted for first, second, senior, corresponding authors, and principal investigator (PI) using predictive tools and manual verification. Data on authorship, trial characteristics, and sponsorship were collected. A total of 438 clinical trials involving 5517 authors were analyzed. Females constituted 26.3% of authors, 17.1% of first authors, 6.1% of senior authors, and 24.2% of PIs, with nonwhite individuals representing 12.3% of first authors, 5.9% of senior authors, and 18.8% of PIs.

The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between gastroenterologists and GPs in regional hospitals and their referring primary care centers in Catalonia (Spain). A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was carried out using anonymous questionnaires between January and April 2008. A total of 314 surveys were administered (261 GPs and 53 gastroenterologists). The overall relationship was considered highly deficient or insufficient by 62.3% of gastroenterologists (95% CI, 47.9-74.9) and by 55.6% of GPs (95% CI, 49.3-61.7). More than half (56.6%) of the gastroenterologists did not know any GPs, or only a very few, and the situation was the same for 80.4% of GPs. Sixty-four percent of gastroenterologists considered that the quality of care for digestive diseases in primary care was highly deficient or insufficient while 21.1% of GPs considered that the care provided by gastroenterologists was highly deficient or insufficient. The perception of healthcare in both primary and specialized settings was substantially better when there was good interaction between gastroenterologists and GPs. Practitioners acknowledge that the degree of interaction between different levels of healthcare is insufficient. Moreover, gastroenterologists consider that the management of digestive diseases in primary care is deficient. Establishing a personal relationship between the two types of practitioners substantially improves mutual assessment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20675017/"}

{"id": "37737818", "title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Epidemiology, Evaluation, and Management of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: Expert Review.", "text": "Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a disorder caused by the failure of the pancreas to deliver a minimum/threshold level of specific pancreatic digestive enzymes to the intestine, leading to the maldigestion of nutrients and macronutrients, resulting in their variable deficiencies. EPI is frequently underdiagnosed and, as a result, patients are often not treated appropriately. There is an urgent need to increase awareness of and treatment for this condition. The aim of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review was to provide Best Practice Advice on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of EPI. This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: EPI should be suspected in patients with high-risk clinical conditions, such as chronic pancreatitis, relapsing acute pancreatitis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cystic fibrosis, and previous pancreatic surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: EPI should be considered in patients with moderate-risk clinical conditions, such as duodenal diseases, including celiac and Crohn's disease; previous intestinal surgery; longstanding diabetes mellitus; and hypersecretory states (eg, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinical features of EPI include steatorrhea with or without diarrhea, weight loss, bloating, excessive flatulence, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and protein-calorie malnutrition. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Fecal elastase test is the most appropriate initial test and must be performed on a semi-solid or solid stool specimen. A fecal elastase level <100 μg/g of stool provides good evidence of EPI, and levels of 100-200 μg/g are indeterminate for EPI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Fecal elastase testing can be performed while on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Fecal fat testing is rarely needed and must be performed when on a high-fat diet. Quantitative testing is generally not practical for routine clinical use. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Response to a therapeutic trial of pancreatic enzymes is unreliable for EPI diagnosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Cross-sectional imaging methods (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound) cannot identify EPI, although they play an important role in the diagnosis of benign and malignant pancreatic disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Breath tests and direct pancreatic function tests hold promise, but are not widely available in the United States. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Once EPI is diagnosed, treatment with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is required. If EPI is left untreated, it will result in complications related to fat malabsorption and malnutrition, having a negative impact on quality of life. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: PERT formulations are all derived from porcine sources and are equally effective at equivalent doses. There is a need for H2 or proton pump inhibitor therapy with non-enteric-coated preparations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: PERT should be taken during the meal, with the initial treatment of at least 40,000 USP units of lipase during each meal in adults and one-half of that with snacks. The subsequent dosage can be adjusted based on the meal size and fat content. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Routine supplementation and monitoring of fat-soluble vitamin levels are appropriate. Dietary modifications include a low-moderate fat diet with frequent smaller meals and avoiding very-low-fat diets. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Measures of successful treatment with PERT include reduction in steatorrhea and associated gastrointestinal symptoms; a gain of weight, muscle mass, and muscle function; and improvement in fat-soluble vitamin levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: EPI should be monitored and baseline measurements of nutritional status should be obtained (body mass index, quality-of-life measure, and fat-soluble vitamin levels). A baseline dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan should be obtained and repeated every 1-2 years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37737818/"}

These guidelines are intended to help guide all medical professionals treating adult patients with FI (e.g., general practitioners, surgeons, gastroenterologists, other healthcare workers) and any patients who are interested in information regarding the diagnosis and management of FI. These guidelines have been created in cooperation with members from the United European Gastroenterology (UEG), European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP), European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) and the European Society for Primary Care Gastroenterology (ESPCG). These members made up the guideline development group (GDG). Additionally, a patient advisory board (PAB) was created to reflect and comment on the draft guidelines from a patient perspective. Relevant review questions were established by the GDG along with a set of outcomes most important for decision making. A systematic literature search was performed using these review questions and outcomes as a framework. For each predefined review question, the study or studies with the highest level of study design were included. If evidence of a higher-level study design was available, no lower level of evidence was sought or included. Data from the studies were extracted by two reviewers for each predefined important outcome within each review question. Where possible, forest plots were created. After summarising the results for each review question, a systematic quality assessment using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach was performed. For each review question, we assessed the quality of evidence for every predetermined important outcome. After evidence review and quality assessment were completed, recommendations could be formulated. The wording used for each recommendation was dependent on the level of quality of evidence. Lower levels of evidence resulted in weaker recommendations and higher levels of evidence resulted in stronger recommendations. Recommendations were discussed within the GDG to reach consensus. These guidelines contain 45 recommendations on the classification, diagnosis and management of FI in adult patients. These multidisciplinary European guidelines provide an up-to-date comprehensive evidence-based framework with recommendations on the diagnosis and management of adult patients who suffer from FI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35303758/"}

The classical features are incomplete relaxation of a frequently hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and a lack of peristalsis in the tubular esophagus. These motor abnormalities lead to dysphagia, stasis, regurgitation, weight loss, or secondary respiratory complications. Although major strides have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of this rare disorder, including a probable autoimmune mediated destruction of inhibitory neurons in response to an unknown insult in genetically susceptible individuals, a definite trigger has not been identified. The diagnosis of achalasia is suggested by clinical features and confirmed by further diagnostic tests, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), manometry or barium swallow. These studies are not only used to exclude pseudoachalasia, but also might help to categorize the disease by severity or clinical subtype. Recent advances in diagnostic methods, including high resolution manometry (HRM), might allow prediction of treatment responses. The primary treatments for achieving long-term symptom relief are surgery and endoscopic methods. Although limited high-quality data exist, it appears that laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is superior to endoscopic methods in achieving long-term relief of symptoms in the majority of patients.

Duodenal chromogranin A cell density is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of IBS. The pathogenesis of IBS seems to be multifactorial, with the following factors playing a central role in the pathogenesis of IBS: heritability and genetics, dietary/intestinal microbiota, low-grade inflammation, and disturbances in the neuroendocrine system (NES) of the gut. One hypothesis proposes that the cause of IBS is an altered NES, which would cause abnormal GI motility, secretions and sensation. All of these abnormalities are characteristic of IBS. Alterations in the NES could be the result of one or more of the following: genetic factors, dietary intake, intestinal flora, or low-grade inflammation. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease-associated IBS (IBD-IBS) represent a considerable subset of IBS cases.

The value of EUS is directly proportional to the training, skill and experience of the endosonographer. In a recent series, the lowest annual number of examinations requested per year might be around 200-250 procedures. For achieving competence in all the fields of EUS, they recommended a minimum of 150 supervised cases, 75 of them being devoted to pancreaticobiliary diseases and 50 to fine needle aspiration (FNA). Many studies have yet confirmed the importance of the learning curve to improve the EUS accuracy. The accuracy of EUS staging of esophageal cancer was significantly improved over an 8-year period for T staging from 64% to 90% but not for N staging. Considering pancreaticobiliary diseases, some series reported the influence of training on accuracy of EUS-guided FNA of pancreatic masses. Even if the exact type and modalities for EUS training remained to be determined, the usefulness of a period of training in a center performing more than 200 procedures per year is confirmed. Improving cognitive EUS learning and technique required theoretical teaching and practical teaching with observation during live demonstration and echoendoscope hands-on in humans with an expert supervision or with different simulator models. In France, formal EUS training has been underway since 1991, with a two-year intensive program including 4 weeks of theoretical training and 20 one-day practical sessions per year. This program was updated in 2004 to include 3 weeks of theoretical course work including numerous video sessions and 1 week of practical sessions. Theoretical courses are given primarily by gastroenterologists and EUS experts, but also by pathologists, surgeons, anatomists and radiologists. Practical sessions include 4 days of live demonstrations and computed-based simulator (EUS mentor; Simbionix, Tel Hashomer, Israel) and one day with a swine model. Simulators, either computed-based simulator, Erlangen model, or live pigs are believed to shorten the learning phase of EUS. The live pig model was chosen for EUS credentialing because it appears to be similar in many respects to the human anatomy, especially for the pancreas, portal and mesenteric vessels, celiac axis, left kidney and spleen. In addition, for trainees, it often appears more exciting and stimulating than virtual model. However, EUS training on a swine model is recognized to be the more expansive way for EUS teaching. Between the pre and post-test, EUS fellows significantly improved their competence for the visualization of anatomical structures i.e. vena cava, mesenteric/splenic vein, celiac axis, pancreas and bile duct. At the end of the day-session, trainees were mostly able to recognize and follow these anatomical structures with both endoscopes. Interventional EUS learning was also assessed. A significant decrease in procedural duration and a significant increase in FNA precision were demonstrated for the puncture of a hilar liver lymph node.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17921934/"}

AI helps to predict severity and patterns of fibrosis, steatosis, activity of NAFLD, and survival of HCC by using pathological data. Despite of these high potentials of AI application, data preparation, collection, quality, labeling, and sampling biases of data are major concerns. The selection, evaluation, and validation of algorithms, as well as real-world application of these AI models, are also challenging. Nevertheless, AI opens the new era of precision medicine in hepatology, which will change our future practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33709606/"}

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine or deep learning and large language models, provide interesting mechanisms for facilitating care advancement. The complexity and diversity of data, as well as genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, all contribute to individualized recommendations intuitively made by clinicians for patients with liver disease. AI tools provide the opportunity to train on high-volume data and simulate the clinician's subconscious thought processes in decision making. With tremendous growth in hepatology-focused AI, critical efforts are needed to consider multicenter efforts and enabling collection of clean data that are as free as possible of bias. Prospective evaluation of AI tools seamlessly integrated into workflows, especially through clinical trials, as well as patient partner and clinical stakeholder engagement, will be key to building trust in the individualized predictions provided.

Completion of ordered testing, including laboratories and imaging, is an important aspect of successful outpatient care of patients with liver disease. Whether the completion of orders from telehealth encounters differs from in-person visits is unknown. Completion of ordered laboratories and imaging from hepatology encounters at our center from 2021 to 2022 were evaluated and compared between video telehealth and in-person visits. Laboratory completion was evaluated at 14 days, 30 days, and 90 days, and imaging completion was assessed at 1 year. Telehealth encounters were significantly less likely to have laboratories completed at all evaluated time points (14 d: 40.7% vs 90.9%; 30 d: 50.9% vs 92.2%; 90 d: 63.9% vs 94.3%, P < 0.001 for all). Among telehealth encounters, encounters in patients more remote from the center were less likely to have laboratories completed. Imaging ordered at telehealth encounters was also less likely to be completed within 1 year (62.5% vs 70.1%, P < 0.001), including liver ultrasounds (59.1% vs 67.6%, P = 0.001), which persisted when limited to encounters for cirrhosis (55.8% vs 66.4%, P = 0.01). Telehealth encounters were significantly less likely to have ordered laboratories and imaging completed compared with in-person visits, which has important clinical implications for effective outpatient care of patients with liver disease.

Medical education of care-givers in training carries the obligation and liability to oversee the care of the IBD patient and insure that safe and optimal care. This review addresses medicolegal issues that can arise in the care of the patient with IBD. Clinicians who provide optimal care for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) must employ appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic options and also adhere to standards of care and ethical principles. Ethical and medicolegal issues can arise from the failure to adhere to the standards of medical care, clinical research and education.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and en bloc endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) have been performed as curative treatments for many early-stage GI lesions in recent years. The technologies have been widely accepted in many Asian countries because they are minimally invasive and supply thorough histopathologic evaluation of the specimens. However, before engaging in endoscopic therapy, an accurate diagnosis is a precondition to effecting the complete cure of the underlying malignancy or carcinoma in situ. For the past few years, many new types of endoscopic techniques, including magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI), have emerged in many countries because these methods provide a strong indication of early lesions and are very useful in determining treatment options before ESD or EMR. However, to date, there is no comparable classification equivalent to \"Kudo's Pit Pattern Classification in the colon\", for the upper GI, there is still no clear internationally accepted classification system of magnifying endoscopy. Therefore, in order to help unify some viewpoints, here we will review the defining optical imaging characteristics and the current representative classifications of microvascular and microsurface patterns in the upper GI tract under ME-NBI, describe the accurate relationship between them and the pathological diagnosis, and their clinical applications prior to ESD or en bloc EMR.

This paper provides a comprehensive, up to date, systematic review in the management of duodenal fistula, classifying the various strategies in the management of duodenal fistula A review was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane library databases using the Cochrane systematic reviews methodology. A final population of 42 studies reported on 349 patients, with a median (range) number of patients per study of two (1-68). The manuscripts were broadly divided in to \"non-interventional\" and \"interventional\". The interventional group was subdivided in to \"minimally invasive\" and the \"open surgical approach\". A total of 147 patients were treated conservatively (non-interventional group), with a median duration of 28 days (range 13-42 days) with 13 (9%) deaths recorded in this group. No deaths were reported in the 8 reports on minimally invasive approach.166 patients had open surgical approach with a mortality rate of 30% (50 patients). In the absence of randomised controlled trials, no one interventional modality can be considered superior. Initial multidisciplinary conservative approach with sepsis control and nutritional augmentation should be for 6 weeks. It would seem reasonable, in those fistulae that fail to close spontaneously, to attempt a low risk \"minimally invasive\" intervention where necessary expertise is available. More risky open surgical approaches should clearly be reserved for those that fail and are best performed in specialist centres.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23375490/"}

He became the first doctor in Britain to specialise in pancreatology. His collaboration with colleagues in Britain and in Europe, through the evolution of specialist societies, encouraged the coordination of basic science, medicine, pathology, radiology and surgery, to further research in, and management of, pancreatic disease. Academic recognition by Manchester University resulted in his being appointed its first Professor of Gastroenterology and originator of a gastrointestinal research unit.

Our primary outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission, and our secondary outcome was endoscopic improvement. We performed a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to appraise certainty of evidence. After excluding JAK inhibitors as potential first-line treatment (in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration), low-certainty evidence supports clinically important benefit with infliximab, ozanimod, risankizumab, and guselkumab over adalimumab and mirikizumab for achieving remission with induction therapy in biologically naïve patients with moderate-to-severe UC, with risankizumab and ozanimod being ranked the highest for induction of clinical remission. With the inclusion of JAK inhibitors as first-line therapy, upadacitinib was more efficacious compared with all other medications except ozanimod and risankizumab, with low- to moderate-certainty evidence.

An ideal test should identify the underlying cause(s) and provide guidelines for treatment. Unfortunately, there is no such single test. But several techniques are available that could provide comprehensive information regarding the changes in defecation dynamics. Among these, anorectal manometry offers the most useful test for clinicians. Manometry may provide objective evidence for impaired rectal sensation, poor rectoanal coordination, weak anal sphincters or changes that support a diagnosis of obstructive defecation. Other tests such as the balloon expulsion test may serve as screening tools for patients with constipation. In a patient with fecal incontinence, anal endosonography may localize the sphincter defect and aid surgical reconstruction. The pudendal nerve latency test may provide a pathophysiological basis for a weak anal sphincter. Imaging techniques such as defecography may provide useful information regarding rectal prolapse or levator ani dysfunction. Ideally, the clinician should utilize these tests either to confirm a clinical suspicion or to provide new information that could aid management.

In contrast, a disease-modifying agent should, by definition, be aimed at globally addressing 'decompensated cirrhosis'. To be defined as a disease-modifying agent in decompensated cirrhosis, interventions need to demonstrate an unequivocal benefit on the course of disease in well-designed and adequately powered randomised clinical trials with hard endpoints (i.e. patient survival). These trials also need to define the target population, dosage and timing of administration, factors guiding treatment, temporary or permanent stopping rules, transferability to daily clinical practice, cost-effectiveness, and global treatment access. By eliminating the underlying cause of cirrhosis, aetiologic treatments can still influence the course of decompensated disease by halting or slowing down disease progression or even inducing reversion to the compensated state. In contrast, there remains an unmet clinical need for disease-modifying agents which can antagonise key pathophysiological mechanisms of decompensated cirrhosis, such as portal hypertension, gut translocation, circulatory dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and immunological dysfunction. However, in the last few years, the repurposing of \"old drugs\" that have already been prescribed for more limited indications in hepatology or for other diseases has provided a few candidates, including human albumin, statins, and poorly absorbable oral antibiotics, which are under further evaluation in large-scale randomised clinical trials.

The three cholangioscopy techniques are described: the \"dual-operator\" and \" single-operator\" mother-baby approaches using dedicated instruments, and the \"direct\" technique using currently available ultrathin gastroscopes. The mother-baby method is standardized and reproducible, while direct cholangioscopy is technically demanding and its safety requires further evaluation. As well as direct visualization of the bile ducts, cholangioscopy has the further advantage of allowing targeted biopsy. Image quality is still suboptimal for single-operator cholangioscopy, while the other techniques have achieved adequately detailed imaging. The costs of mother-baby cholangioscopy are high and its application in clinical practice should be restricted to selected cases (i.e. indeterminate biliary strictures/intraluminal lesions, difficult biliary stones) and to the setting of tertiary care centers. Peroral pancreatoscopy may find an indication in situations where other imaging modalities (mainly EUS) are inconclusive (i.e. delineation of main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia extension, sampling of indeterminate main pancreatic duct strictures). Intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) has a poorer performance than EUS in the staging of pancreatic malignancies and can increase the risk of pancreatitis. A promising indication for IDUS could be the evaluation of indeterminate biliary strictures and ampullary tumors. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) of the bile ducts is a difficult and expensive technique. Appropriate training needs to be established, since interpretation of images is challenging. pCLE can be an important diagnostic tool in the setting of indeterminate biliary strictures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26147492/"}

However, data on cost-effectiveness predate current international guidelines. To compare cost-effectiveness based on contemporary data between the surveillance strategies of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). We constructed a Markov decision model to simulate the clinical course of IBD patients. We compared the 2 surveillance strategies for a base case of a 40-year-old colitis patient who was followed for 40 years. AGA surveillance distinguishes 2 groups: a high-risk group with annual surveillance and an average-risk group with biannual surveillance. BSG surveillance distinguishes 3 risk groups with yearly, 3-year, or 5-year surveillance. Patients could move from a no-dysplasia state with colonoscopic surveillance to 1 of 3 states for which proctocolectomy was indicated: (1) dysplasia/local cancer, (2) regional/metastasized cancer, or (3) refractory disease. After proctocolectomy, a patient moved to a no-colon state without surveillance. Direct costs of medical care, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. BSG surveillance dominated AGA surveillance with $9846 per QALY. Both strategies were equally effective with 24.16 QALYs, but BSG surveillance was associated with lower costs because of fewer colonoscopies performed. Costs related to IBD, surgery, or cancer did not affect cost-effectiveness. The model depends on the accuracy of derived data, and the assumptions that were made to reflect real-life situations. Study conclusions may only apply to the U.S. health care system. The updated risk-profiling approach for surveillance of IBD colorectal carcinoma by the BSG guideline appears to be more cost-effective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25088918/"}

Our aim was to develop a consult care pathway consisting of clinical features related to IBD that should prompt appropriate consultation. A scoping literature review was performed to identify clinical features that should prompt consultation with an IBD specialist. A panel of 11 experts was convened over 4 meetings to develop a consult care pathway using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Items identified via scoping review were ranked and were divided into major and minor criteria. Additionally, a literature and panel review was conducted assessing potential barriers and facilitators to implementing the consult care pathway. Of 43 features assessed, 13 were included in the care pathway as major criteria and 15 were included as minor criteria. Experts agreed that stratification into major criteria and minor criteria was appropriate and that 1 major or 2 or more minor criteria should be required to consider consultation. The greatest barrier to implementation was considered to be organizational resource allocation, while endorsements by national gastroenterology and general medicine societies were considered to be the strongest facilitator. This novel referral care pathway identifies key criteria that could be used to triage patients with IBD who would benefit from IBD specialist consultation. Future research will be required to validate these findings and assess the impact of implementing this pathway in routine IBD-related care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36271884/"}

Approximately 40% of patients seen in gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology practices in the United States are 60 years or older. Adapting care delivery models, curating data on shifting risk-benefit decisions with geriatric syndromes, understanding appropriate assessments, and focusing on tailored implementation strategies are challenges that are actively confronting us as we provide care for a burgeoning population of older adults. Limited availability of geriatric specialists results in an onus of specialists caring for older adults, such as gastroenterologists, to innovate and develop tailored, comprehensive, and evidence-based care for adults in later life stages. In this article, we present the 5M framework from geriatrics to achieve age-friendly healthcare. The 5Ms are medications, mind, mobility, multicomplexity, and what matters most. We apply the 5M framework to 2 chronic conditions commonly encountered in clinical GI practice: inflammatory bowel diseases and cirrhosis. We highlight knowledge gaps and outline future directions to expand evidence-based care and advance the creation of age-friendly GI care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35080513/"}

We aimed to determine the adequacy of CD screening in an academic gastroenterology (GI) practice. Consecutive initial visits to a tertiary academic GI practice were surveyed over a 3-month period as a fellow-initiated quality improvement project. All electronic records were reviewed to look for indications for CD screening according to published guidelines. The timing of screening was noted (before or after referral), as well as the screening method (serology or biopsy). Data were analysed to compare CD screening practices across subspecialty clinics. 616 consecutive patients (49±0.6 years, range 16-87 years, 58.5% females, 94% Caucasian) fulfilled inclusion criteria. CD testing was indicated in 336 (54.5%), but performed in only 145 (43.2%). The need for CD screening was highest in luminal GI and inflammatory bowel disease clinics, followed by biliary and hepatology clinics (p<0.0001); CD screening rate was highest in the luminal GI clinic (p=0.002). Of 145 patients screened, 4 patients (2.4%) had serology consistent with CD, of which 2 were proven by duodenal biopsy. Using this proportion, an additional 5 patients might have been diagnosed in 191 untested patients with indications for CD screening. More than 50% of patients in a tertiary GI clinic have indications for CD screening, but <50% of indicated cases are screened. Case-finding techniques therefore are suboptimal, constituting a gap in patient care and an important target for future quality improvement initiatives.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28069744/"}

His synthetizering role is stressed, analysing the professor's views on the clinical and theoretical medicine, on the medical practice and teaching in the medicine. Author performs it from the points of view of practising pathologist who considered the clinical pathology as the most important. After these introductory thoughts the role of pathologist is outlined in the gastroenterological diagnostics. Before the introduction of modern fiberoptic endoscopy, the pathologist met with some forms of the gastroenterological diseases at most during the processing work of surgically removed specimens or even more in the autopsy room, but in the latter cases only their end stage could be demonstrated. The introduction of so-called blind exfoliative cytology by the gastric lavage was a great leap forward. Advanced gastric carcinoma were detected mostly by this method but some early gastric cancer could be also discovered occasionally. The more and more wide-spread use of modern fiberpotic endoscopy was of decisive importance because by this way the aimed forceps biopsy could be performed completed with a new form of gastric cytology, with abrasive smears. The specificity and sensitivity of the latter method achieves or surpasses the 90%. Nowadays, not only the stomach carcinomas but their possible precancerous conditions and changes as chronic gastritis can be diagnosed on morphological basis. The history of different gastritis classifications is also surveyed emphasised author's own pathogenetic conceptions which can be included well in our now accepted modern Sydney-classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7885686/"}

Patients (N = 102) made 103 telephone calls, averaging 8.7 minutes, for symptoms (56%), procedure-related concerns (19%), and medications (18%). Physicians usually referred the patient to the clinic or emergency room (40%) or provided discussion and reassurance (36%). Patients' perceptions differed from physicians' perceptions: patients believed their problems to be more severe and more disabling and requests were more reasonable than perceived by the physician. Furthermore, their interactions with physicians (physician helpfulness, satisfaction with the recommendation, and likeability of the physician) were more positive than believed by physicians. Physicians believed phone calls from patients with functional disorders were less serious and less reasonable, that these patients were less disabled, and also that these patients were less liked than patients with an organic diagnosis. In this study, physicians carried a lower perception of the importance of telephone requests, the impact of the disorder, and their perceived helpfulness to patients than did patients making these requests.

Among other cellular processes, fibroblasts are now thought to contribute to the coordination of immune responses in a range of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. Although the pathologic roles of myofibroblasts, inflammatory fibroblasts, and cancer-associated fibroblasts in disease are reasonably well understood, the mechanisms behind their activation remain to be uncovered. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, several interleukins and tumor necrosis factor superfamily members have been identified as possible mediators driving the acquisition of inflammatory and fibrotic properties in fibroblasts. In addition to cytokines, other microenvironmental factors such as nutrient and oxygen availability are likely contributors to this process. In this respect, the phenomenon of low cellular oxygen levels known as hypoxia is common in a plethora of GI diseases. Indeed, the cross talk between hypoxia and inflammation is well-documented, with an abundance of studies suggesting that oxygen-sensing enzymes may have regulatory effects on inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-κB. However, the impact that this has in GI fibroblasts in the context of chronic diseases has not been fully uncovered. Here we discuss the role of fibroblasts in GI diseases, the mediators that have emerged as regulators of their functions and the potential impact of hypoxia in this process, highlighting areas that require further investigation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39873349/"}

We completed an OVID MEDLINE search using the terms gastroenterology, endoscopy, digestive system, inflammatory bowel disease, functional, hepatology, liver, telemedicine, telehealth, videoconferencing, remote consultation, video clinic and telephone clinic. Patients showed positive attitudes towards telecare and, in several reports, would elect to have telecare consults in the future. Telecare reduces travel time and out-of-pocket costs for patients and the need for patients to take time off work. Generally, patients engaging with telecare show equivalent health outcomes to patients engaging with traditional models of care. Patients from ethnic minority groups or lower socio-economic backgrounds, or who are older, are less likely to complete a 'successful' telecare consult. Telecare is a useful model of care to allow gastroenterology centres to function within the context of COVID-19 isolation and beyond. It has significant benefits for patients who face geographical and financial barriers to accessing healthcare.

Of 59 155 patients identified with liver disease, 17 906 developed HE and 11 676 cirrhosis patients underwent minor invasive procedures. In the HE cohort, there was no immediate change in the rate of ammonia tests with recommendations, but the overall rate decreased by 0.002 tests per hospitalisation per week (95% CI -0.00413 to -0.000009). With recommendations, we observed an increase in the rate of 0.242 (95% CI 0.010 to 0.474 transfusions/hospitalisation), but no significant difference in the rate change nor in the rate of platelet and vitamin K transfusions. There was no significant change in the rate of platelet and vitamin K transfusions. Hospitalisations under hepatology or gastroenterology services also did not have a change in rates of low-value care overall, except for ammonia tests where the rate decreased by 0.012 tests (95% CI -0.0177 to -0.00626 tests/hospitalisation) per week after recommendations. The CWC recommendations were associated with a reduction in the rate of serum ammonia tests, but not with transfusion of blood products. Thus, there remains an opportunity to reduce low-value care and application of clinical guidelines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40122575/"}

All these diseases are believed to be found in 30-50% of adults. It is very difficult to find a healthy person taking into account such an approach to the problem. As a matter of fact, gastroesophageal disease was invented by merging two different diseases: esophagitis and reflux esophagitis plus such a prevalent symptom as heartburn. All this leads to the hyperdiagnosis of this disease. The irritable bowel syndrome also includes two conditions: that of the irritable large intestine and dyskinesia of the small one. They are very different. The application of the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia leads to the practical disappearance of the diagnosis of chronic gastritis. At that symptoms of the dyskinetic form of functional dyspepsia coincide with minor symptoms of gastric carcinoma, which can lead to late diagnostics of this oncological disease. In this connection, it is necessary to narrow the limits of these diseases because their actual prevalence is much lower than that found in medical literature.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15560407/"}

The first is chronic hepatitis. Here, we discuss the relevance of occult forms of hepatitis B virus infection in the development of cryptogenic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the role of genotyping in hepatitis B is analysed, indicating that patients with genotype A have a better prognosis than those with genotype D. The treatment of hepatitis B virus infection is also reviewed, and it has been suggested that research should be directed towards the development of new anti-viral agents to suppress virus replication. The natural history of hepatitis C virus infection is considered, emphasizing the need to know the progression of fibrosis in these patients. The chapter also suggests that treatment of hepatitis C virus infection with pegilated interferon and ribavirin is currently relatively effective. New therapeutic strategies will be required in the future, the most important challenge being the development of a hepatitis C virus vaccine. The second section is on chronic cholestasis. The role of anti-mitochondrial antibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis is considered. The possible infectious agents implicated as potential triggers of primary biliary cirrhosis are also discussed, suggesting that several infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Other aetiopathogenic factors, for example organic compounds, drugs and chemicals, are indicated. It is possible that, in the near future, the precise sequence and molecular basis by which infectious agents or xenobiotics may initiate the cascade of the autoimmune response will be defined. One of the most important challenges in primary sclerosing cholangitis concerns the mechanisms that may induce the development of this disease. Up until now, genetic factors have been suggested, recent data reporting a clear-cut association between primary sclerosing cholangitis and the tumour necrosis factor-alpha(2) allele. The third part of this chapter includes recent progress achieved in hepatocellular carcinoma, discussing developments in the knowledge of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinomas appear so far to be genetically heterogeneous neoplasms, and this heterogeneity may correlate with the variety of aetiological factors involved. The risk factors and primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of the condition are also analysed. Finally, the development of new therapeutic strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma is evaluated by evidence-based studies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12473301/"}

However, patients expect and deserve a response that is appropriate, effective, efficient and safe. The huge variety of variables which can influence the evolution of such cases warranting intensive monitoring, and the coordination and optimization of a range of human and technical resources involved in the care of these high-risk patients, requires their admission in hospital units with conveniently equipped facilities, as is done for heart attack and stroke patients. Little information of gastroenterology emergencies as a function of structure, processes and outcome is available at the organizational level. Surveys that have been conducted in different countries just assess local treatment outcome and question the organizational structure and existing resources but its impact on the outcome is not clear. Most studies address the problem of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the out-of-hours endoscopy services in the hospital setting. The demands placed on emergency (part of the overall continuum of care) are obvious, as are the needs for the efficient use of resources and processes to improve the quality of care, meaning data must cover the full care cycle. Gastrointestinal emergencies, namely gastrointestinal bleeding, must be incorporated into the overall emergency response as is done for heart attack and stroke.

A triangulated, mixed-method approach (qualitative and quantitative) was used to determine the nature and extent of knowledge gaps and barriers in the care of patients with CD. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nine gastroenterologists, four gastroenterology nurses and nine patients with CD. Based on this exploratory research, a survey was designed and launched nationally (37 gastroenterologists, 36 gastroenterology nurses). Findings indicated that Canadian gastroenterologists and gastroenterology nurses lacked clarity regarding their roles and responsibilities across the continuum of CD care, and face communication gaps within the health care team, undermining their effectiveness. Gastroenterologists identified challenges in optimal diagnosis due to unclear testing and diagnostic criteria. They recognized knowledge gaps when treating patient subgroups and in prescribing biological therapies. Furthermore, gastroenterologists self-identified gaps in skill, knowledge, and confidence in monitoring disease progression and effectively assessing response to therapy. When managing patients with CD, gastroenterologists expressed challenges with patient issues outside their domain of medical expertise, particularly with the skills needed to facilitate effective patient communication and education that would enhance adherence to recommended treatments. Educational initiatives should address diagnostic and treatment guidelines, as well as enhancement of clinical performance gaps in health care team processes and the patient-professional therapeutic relationship.

We then utilize data published annually by the NRMP to demonstrate that in the decade since its rebirth, the GI Match has been remarkably successful in terms of attracting the participation of applicants and programs. We show that previous misguided concerns of an oversupply of GI physicians were not realized, and that GI fellowship positions remain highly competitive for internal medicine applicants.

Our aim was to provide guidance on standardizing biopsy collection protocols, identifying optimal evaluative indices, and defining thresholds for histologic response and remission after treatment. An international, interdisciplinary expert panel of 19 gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal pathologists was assembled. A modified RAND/University of California, Los Angeles appropriateness methodology was used to address relevant issues. A total of 138 statements were derived from a systematic review of the literature and expert opinion. Each statement was anonymously rated as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate using a 9-point scale. Survey results were reviewed and discussed before a second round of voting. Histologic measurements collected using a uniform biopsy strategy are important for assessing disease activity and determining therapeutic efficacy in UC clinical trials. Multiple biopsy strategies were deemed acceptable, including segmental biopsies collected according to the endoscopic appearance. Biopsies should be scored for architectural change, lamina propria chronic inflammation, basal plasmacytosis, lamina propria and epithelial neutrophils, epithelial damage, and erosions/ulcerations. The Geboes score, Robarts Histopathology Index, and Nancy Index were considered appropriate for assessing histologic activity; use of the modified Riley score and Harpaz Index were uncertain. Histologic activity at baseline should be required for enrollment, recognizing this carries operational implications. Achievement of histologic improvement or remission was considered an appropriate and realistic therapeutic target. Current histologic indices require validation for pediatric populations.

Fifty-five patients were investigated for obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (25 women, mean age 65.6 years), the cause of which remained unknown despite previous gastroscopy and colonoscopy. The patients were divided into two groups: occult-obscure (anemia without macroscopic blood loss) and overt-obscure (macroscopic bleeding). Findings at enteroscopy, therapeutic procedures, and complications were recorded. Patients were followed to establish the impact of the procedure on subsequent management and clinical outcome. Enteroscopy demonstrated a potential site of bleeding in 38 patients (69%), and 38% of lesions found were within the reach of the gastroscope. The most common lesions were small intestinal angiodysplasia. Seventy-five percent of patients with positive findings had alterations to their management.

We also examined whether inflammatory bowel disease topics addressed in @MondayNightIBD are aligned with entrustable professional activities (EPA) set forth by national gastroenterology societies. @MondayNightIBD CME sessions from February 2020 (date the handle was accredited to provide CME) to May 2021 were analyzed. Preactivity and postactivity knowledge was assessed for average score improvement using the Student t test and Cohen d effect size. Postactivity surveys examined for learners' perceptions of whether activities met educational goals and affected willingness to change clinical practice using descriptive percentages. In addition, activities from April 2019 (date of @MondayNightIBD inception) to May 2021 were assessed for whether they address EPA set forth by national gastroenterology societies. Learners' knowledge improved after @MondayNightIBD activities with average preactivity correct answers of 58% to a postactivity average of 79% ( P < 0.001). Greater than 95% of learners found that activities met learning objectives and enhanced knowledge. A total of 92% of learners were committed to practice change because of their @MondayNightIBD participation. Finally, 78% of EPA set forth by a national gastroenterology society have been covered by @MondayNightIBD since its inception. @MondayNightIBD is a Twitter-based CME activities platform for gastroenterologists and other clinicians that is embraced by learners, improves knowledge, and encourages practice change. Topics covered during @MondayNightIBD are aligned with EPA set forth by national gastroenterology societies. @MondayNightIBD is a successful model of social media medical education and a novel approach to effectively provide evidence-based CME.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623175/"}

Because prior studies have focused mainly on pediatric providers, understanding these issues from the perspective of the adult hepatologist may provide novel insights and identify key barriers to care in this population. We conducted a national survey of adult transplant hepatologists to assess factors that may affect the transition of recipients from pediatric care to adult care. More than half of transplant hepatologists from all United Network for Organ Sharing regions (236/408 or 57.8%) completed the survey, and they reported that only 46.1% of patients arrived at their first adult clinic with both adequate knowledge of their condition and a parent/guardian. Moreover, 32.4% reported having no transition strategy, and only 15.5% reported having a formal transition program. The respondents reported that the greatest barriers to optimal care were patients' poor adherence and their limited knowledge and management of their condition. Those who reported participating in a formal transition program were less likely to report an inability of patients to discuss the impact of their condition on their overall daily life, fitness, and sexuality as a barrier to transition (odds ratio = 0.40, 95% confidence interval = 0.16-1.00). Our survey suggests that a formalized transition process is uncommon in adult transplant hepatology clinics and that improving patient knowledge, understanding specific components of effective transition programs, and incorporating input from adult providers in designing such programs may improve this process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25378291/"}

The purposes of this study were (1) to compare a sample drawn from the membership of a national Crohn's and Colitis Foundation to published clinic-based and population-based IBD samples, (2) to describe current patterns of health care use, and (3) to determine if unexpected variations exist in how and by whom IBD is treated. Mailed survey of 4453 members of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada. The questionnaire, in members stated language of preference, included items on demographic and disease characteristics, general health behaviors and current and past IBD treatment. Each member received an initial and one reminder mailing. Questionnaires were returned by 1787, 913, and 128 people with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis, respectively. At least one operation had been performed on 1159 Crohn's disease patients, with risk increasing with duration of disease. Regional variation in surgical rates in ulcerative colitis patients was identified. 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine was used by 24% of patients with Crohn's disease and 12% of patients with ulcerative colitis (95% CI for the difference: 8.9%-15%). In patients with Crohn's disease, use was not associated with gender, income or region of residence but was associated with age and markers of disease activity. Infliximab was used by 112 respondents (4%), the majority of whom had Crohn's disease. Variations in infliximab use based on region of residence and income were not seen. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated that they depended most on a gastroenterologist for their IBD care. There was significant regional variation in this. However, satisfaction with primary physician did not depend on physician type (for example, gastroenterologist versus general practitioner). This study achieved the goal of obtaining a large, geographically diverse sample that is more representative of the general IBD population than a clinic sample would have been. We could find no evidence of significant regional variation in medical treatments due to gender, region of residence or income level. Differences were noted between different age groups, which deserves further attention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12791168/"}

Over a three-week audit period, participants recorded indications, and the expected (E) and reported (R) findings for each procedure. Thereafter, participants recorded compliance with reporting, the ease of use and value of the PAGE program, and their willingness to perform another audit. Over 15 to 18 months, 173 participants completed PAGE-Endo (6168 procedures) and 111 completed PAGE-Colo (4776 procedures). Most respondents noted that PAGE was easy to use (99%), beneficial (88% to 95%), and that they were willing undertake another audit (92% to 95%). In PAGE-Endo, alarm features were prevalent (55%), but major reported findings were less common than expected: esophagitis (E 29.9%, R 14.8%), esophageal stricture (E 8.3%, R 3.6%), gastric ulcer (E 17.0%, R 4.7%), gastric cancer (E 4.3%, R 1.0%) and duodenal ulcer (E 11.5%, R 5.7%). In PAGE-Colo, more colonoscopies were performed for symptom investigation (55%) than for screening (25%) or surveillance (20%). There were marked interprovincial variations with respect to sedation, biopsies and technical aspects of colonoscopy. Secure, real-time data entry with review of aggregate and individual data in the PAGE program provided an acceptable, straightforward methodology for accredited practice audit activities.

A post hoc analysis of data from two multicenter studies (NCT02002650 and NCT03057769) was conducted. Patients aged 18-90 years with native papilla undergoing ERCP were eligible for this study. Only procedures involving trainees in centers strictly following \"10-min criteria\" for initial cannulation were enrolled. Primary outcome was CSR by trainees. From December 2013 to October 2017, 20 trainees in four centers were involved in initial cannulation in 1044 patients with native papilla. Primary CSR by trainees was 61.0% (436/715), 31.5% (70/222) and 44.9% (48/107) in patients with common bile duct stone (CBDS), biliary stricture (BS) and other indications, respectively (P < 0.001).

Concerning the history of illness, symptoms such as retrosternal pain and heartburn are often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Morphological changes of the mucosa can be diagnosed by flexible endoscopy and radiographic examinations. Investigation with 24-h pH monitoring, manometry, and pharmacological tests is necessary for the diagnosis of functional disorders. Additionally, dysphagia can be associated with multiple internal diseases, including muscular diseases such as dermatomyositis, progressive systemic sclerosis, as well as lupus erythematosus. Difficulties in swallowing associated with hypo- and hyperthyroidism can also be interpreted as muscular lesions. Metabolic disorders such as alcoholism, and diabetes mellitus can be the cause of dysphagia. Increasing importance in the differential diagnosis of dysphagia is attached to infections of the upper GI tract. Especially in immunocompromised patients, infections of Candida albicans, mycobacterias, herpes, varicella zoster, and cytomegaloviruses can produce dysphagia and odynophagia. The differential diagnosis of the \"angina-like chest pain\" has to differentiate between cardiac disease and a noncardiac genesis. Therefore, besides the cardiac diagnostic investigation, endoscopy, radiography, and manometry are often indicated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8467728/"}
{"id": "31701137", "title": "Is Crohn's Disease a Rightly Used Eponym?", "text": "In 1932 Burrill B. Crohn, a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, described, together with two surgical colleagues, a series of 14 patients with an inflammatory condition of the terminal ileum. All patients were operated on by Dr Albert Berg, the Chief Surgeon of the hospital, whose name did not appear on the initial publication. The 'new' disease was called 'regional ileitis', but was rapidly referred to as 'Crohn's disease'. From earlier accounts and publications it has become clear that the condition had already existed for many centuries and was 'discovered' several times before 1932, most notably by Giovanni Morgagni in 1769, Antoni Lesniowski in 1903 and Thomas K. Dalziel in 1913. 'Crohn's disease' might reasonably be known by another eponym. Nevertheless, the 1932 publication of Crohn was pivotal, as were his later contributions to the knowledge of 'his' disease. Therefore the worldwide use of the eponym is rightly to be continued. Present researchers and clinicians with an interest in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] might learn from the complicated story summarised in this contribution. Apart from an interesting historical overview, there are some lessons for today: the importance of thorough clinical observation and pattern recognition, the need for communication between colleagues and multidisciplinary approaches, and the need for broad access to valuable data, past or present, regardless of the journal or language of publication. It should ultimately bring us some humility, despite great achievements in treating this chronic disease, which defies all our efforts yet to find a cure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31701137/"}

We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of 278 inpatient GI consultation requests evaluated from 1 July 2005 to 31 May 2007. A questionnaire assessing multiple aspects of the requesting health-care providers' knowledge and documentation of patient information was completed by first-year GI fellows. Completeness of the consultation was evaluated by the GI consultation attending physician. The most frequent consultation requests pertained to patients with GI hemorrhage (52.5%) and were made by first-year residents (56.8%). In 15% of requests, health-care providers lacked basic knowledge about the patients for whom consultations were sought. Conversely, in 17% of consultations, pertinent information could not be located in patients' paper medical chart/electronic medical record. The strongest predictors for a complete consultation were requesters' knowledge of patients' past medical history (P < 0.001), documentation of patients' current illness (P < 0.001), and presence of the providers' admission note in the paper medical chart (P = 0.002). Consultations requested between 5 and 10 PM were assessed to be more complete (P = 0.02), and more incomplete consultations occurred in the first 3 months of the academic year (P = 0.04). In 16% of inpatient GI consultation requests analyzed, crucial patient data were missing or were unknown by the requesting provider. Several aspects of requesting providers' knowledge and documentation of patient information were strongly associated with completeness of inpatient GI consultations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20203634/"}

Conceived at a time when there was little central authority, either on a national or on a hospital/medical school level, its links were forged by the personal relationships of its directors. The process of growth remained informal and flexible enough for the directors to meet the special requirements of their own community and hospital. YAGP provided an important model for improving medical care and education in community hospitals since it addressed personnel needs, contributed to the education of physicians, and fostered clinical research in digestive diseases. YAGP evolved its own standards and its own accreditation mechanism, but faltered when the Accreditation Committee on Graduate Medical Education provided national rather than local criteria. Increased controls by hospitals and medical schools led to more formal ties and programs, and YAGP ceased to matter. Still, there may be lessons from what was in its time an innovation, on a local and state level rather than on a national level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8648049/"}

Once extracts of secretin and cholecystokinin-pancreozymin became available from Sweden in the 1930s, it became possible for the biochemist Franklin Hollander and the surgeon David Dreiling to develop pancreatic secretion tests into practical procedures for the diagnosis of benign and malignant diseases of the pancreas and biliary tree, and produce physiological studies of the mechanisms of ion transport. With more purified hormones, it became possible to measure maximum (alkaline) bicarbonate output of the pancreas analogous to the maximal acid response of the stomach to an augmented histamine test, and to determine whether patients with duodenal ulcer had decreased neutralization of gastric acid in the duodenum. Clinical studies were also directed to the pathophysiology of acute relapsing and chronic pancreatitis and carcinoma.

The aim of this study was to validate a microtip pressure transducer for intraluminal GB pressure measurements. In vitro precision and accuracy was within 0.2 mmHg, (SD) and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmHg (mean +/- SD), respectively. Pressure rise rate was 24.8 +/- 5.5 mmHg s-1. Zero drift was in the range 0.3 +/- 0.4 to 0.8 +/- 0.9 mmHg (mean +/- SD). GB pressure was investigated in 16 patients with acute cholecystitis treated with percutaneous ultrasonically guided cholecystostomy. Basal intraluminal GB pressure was 8.9 mmHg (2.1-12.2 mmHg; n = 9, open cystic duct) and 1.8 and 5.8 mmHg (n = 2, closed cystic duct). There was no significant difference between two different measurements in the same patients (n = 5).

Cystic duct opening pressure was 10.4, 11.2 and 16.8 mmHg (n = 3). Pressure-volume responses showed that the GB up to a certain volume could accommodate increases in intraluminal volume with only slight changes in intraluminal pressure (n = 4). Except for the zero drift, this piece of equipment seemed to fulfil the requirements of being able to measure pressure in the GB. In vivo measurements showed a good clinical reproducibility of the method, and also that respiration and patient posture influenced the pressure measurements. Further, a GB pressure-volume relationship was demonstrated, and the possibility of a cystic duct opening pressure was described.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8964132/"}

In recent years, its pathophysiology has come to be much better understood, and new therapeutic approaches have been developed. These advances were taken into consideration and assessed for their relevance to clinical practice in the framework of a new interdisciplinary S3 guideline. A systematic search of the literature retrieved a total 5573 articles, from which 243 were selected on the basis of criteria relating to their form and content, individually assessed, and summarized in evidence tables. The recommendations formulated in this way were discussed in a Delphi procedure and a consensus conference, then accordingly modified and finalized. Variable symptom constellations are caused by disturbances of gastrointestinal regulation at multiple levels. The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome requires both chronic bowel symptoms that interfere with everyday life and the exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses. Its treatment is based on general therapeutic principles, dietary recommendations, psychological components, and symptomatic medication. Bulking agents, laxatives, spasmolytics, loperamide, and probiotic agents are recommended (with variable recommendation strengths), as are--for selected patients--antidepressants, 5-HT4 agonists, 5-HT3 antagonists, and topical antibiotics. The first German S3 guideline on irritable bowel syndrome translates up-to-date scientific knowledge as represented in current publications into concrete recommendations for diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice.

Important epidemiological data and family risk factors have been reported from all the Nordic countries, original twin studies mainly from Denmark and Sweden, and relationships to cancer and surgery mostly from Sweden. In collaboration with the industry, development of medical compounds was for a long time in the front line of international research, and the Scandinavian countries participated in the clinical breakthrough of biologic treatment. At present, many Nordic centers are working in the forefront of IBD research. An increasing number of young investigators have entered the scene along with the extended distribution of University clinics and research laboratories in these countries. This presentation of IBD gives a brief overview in the fields of clinical epidemiology and molecular biology. Many areas are covered by International collaborations with partners from Nordic centers. IBD was a topic focused by the founders of Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology. After 50 years one may state that the journal's history reflects important pieces of scientific knowledge within these diseases. The early scope of Johannes Myren for IBD was shown through his work in the original World Association of Gastroenterology (OMG), and after 50 years we can clearly support the view that global perspectives in IBD are increasingly important.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25855003/"}

In 1989, the Hepatology Committee was started. In the early 1990s H for hepatology was included in ESPGHAN. Hepatology Summer schools were held from 1995 and later monothematic conferences met the needs of many young ESPGHAN members. The role of ESPGHAN members in the progress of diagnostic and therapeutic measures in hepatitis B and C will be elucidated (Chapter 6.1) as well as the role of other ESPGHAN members in the understanding of immunological hepatic disorders of childhood (Chapter 6.2). During childhood, many metabolic hepatic disorders threaten the life and health of children making orchestrated measures in diagnostic and therapeutic efforts necessary (Chapter 6.3). The pathophysiology of cholestasis was cleared by the detection of bile salt transporters, which were identified by ESPGHAN members in the Netherlands, France, United Kingdom and Germany (Chapter 6.4). Finally liver transplantation for acute fulminant and chronic end stage liver disease was established as a meanwhile standard treatment option (Chapter 6.5). Immunosupression in liver transplantation was improved and standardized through the cooperation of many ESPGHAN member driven studies (Chapter 6.6).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29596181/"}

In the hands of a gastroenterologist ultrasound has become an equally important diagnostic tool as endoscopy. The constantly evolving technique with its possibility of higher resolution by use of \"harmonic imaging\" and signal enhancement with contrast medium is the reason for a practically relevant review of the situation. Practical references will be given for diagnostics of the liver and portal system including the spleen. The significance of the sonographic diagnosis of \"fatty liver\" is critically discussed. The overall importance of ultrasound to distinguish different aetiologies of diffuse liver diseases is relatively low. Nevertheless, it is a very sensitive means to detect complications of liver cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunts and typical changes in blood vessel morphology can be diagnosed by colour duplex sonography and used as indirect signs of advanced damage to liver parenchyma. In addition, ultrasound has its value in the confirmation or exclusion of dilated bile ducts as well as in the detection and differentiation of circumscribed liver lesions. The characterisation of focal liver lesions by ultrasound is sufficient in typical cases. The use of ultrasound contrast media (signal enhancers) raises the rate of differentiation and can avoid the uncritical and sequential application of radiological imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). If in doubt about the nature of a lesion, a histological diagnosis remains indispensable. The examination of the spleen and its feeding vessels is regularly done in cases of diffuse parenchymal liver disease when searching for its complications, e. g., portal hypertension. Focal spleen lesions can be observed especially in the context of lymphoma (infiltration) and other bone marrow diseases. Through the application of contrast media, changes of vascularisation (e. g., infarcts) can be visualised and traumatic lesions can be diagnosed more precisely.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16981073/"}
{"id": "26417980", "title": "Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Guideline.", "text": "This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). Main Recommendations MR1. ESGE recommends immediate assessment of hemodynamic status in patients who present with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), with prompt intravascular volume replacement initially using crystalloid fluids if hemodynamic instability exists (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR2. ESGE recommends a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy that aims for a target hemoglobin between 7 g/dL and 9 g/dL. A higher target hemoglobin should be considered in patients with significant co-morbidity (e. g., ischemic cardiovascular disease) (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR3. ESGE recommends the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Outpatients determined to be at very low risk, based upon a GBS score of 0 - 1, do not require early endoscopy nor hospital admission. Discharged patients should be informed of the risk of recurrent bleeding and be advised to maintain contact with the discharging hospital (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR4. ESGE recommends initiating high dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI), intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80 mg then 8 mg/hour), in patients presenting with acute UGIH awaiting upper endoscopy. However, PPI infusion should not delay the performance of early endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR5. ESGE does not recommend the routine use of nasogastric or orogastric aspiration/lavage in patients presenting with acute UGIH (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR6. ESGE recommends intravenous erythromycin (single dose, 250 mg given 30 - 120 minutes prior to upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) in patients with clinically severe or ongoing active UGIH. In selected patients, pre-endoscopic infusion of erythromycin significantly improves endoscopic visualization, reduces the need for second-look endoscopy, decreases the number of units of blood transfused, and reduces duration of hospital stay (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR7. Following hemodynamic resuscitation, ESGE recommends early (≤ 24 hours) upper GI endoscopy. Very early (< 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy may be considered in patients with high risk clinical features, namely: hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) that persists despite ongoing attempts at volume resuscitation; in-hospital bloody emesis/nasogastric aspirate; or contraindication to the interruption of anticoagulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR8. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with spurting or oozing bleeding (Forrest classification Ia and Ib, respectively) or with a nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) receive endoscopic hemostasis because these lesions are at high risk for persistent bleeding or rebleeding (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR9. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with an adherent clot (Forrest classification IIb) be considered for endoscopic clot removal. Once the clot is removed, any identified underlying active bleeding (Forrest classification Ia or Ib) or nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) should receive endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR10. In patients with peptic ulcers having a flat pigmented spot (Forrest classification IIc) or clean base (Forrest classification III), ESGE does not recommend endoscopic hemostasis as these stigmata present a low risk of recurrent bleeding. In selected clinical settings, these patients may be discharged to home on standard PPI therapy, e. g., oral PPI once-daily (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR11. ESGE recommends that epinephrine injection therapy not be used as endoscopic monotherapy. If used, it should be combined with a second endoscopic hemostasis modality (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR12. ESGE recommends PPI therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with adherent clot not receiving endoscopic hemostasis. PPI therapy should be high dose and administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80 mg then 8 mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR13. ESGE does not recommend routine second-look endoscopy as part of the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). However, in patients with clinical evidence of rebleeding following successful initial endoscopic hemostasis, ESGE recommends repeat upper endoscopy with hemostasis if indicated. In the case of failure of this second attempt at hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) or surgery should be considered (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR14. In patients with NVUGIH secondary to peptic ulcer, ESGE recommends investigating for the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the acute setting with initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is detected. Re-testing for H. pylori should be performed in those patients with a negative test in the acute setting. Documentation of successful H. pylori eradication is recommended (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR15. In patients receiving low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis who develop peptic ulcer bleeding, ESGE recommends aspirin be resumed immediately following index endoscopy if the risk of rebleeding is low (e. g., FIIc, FIII). In patients with high risk peptic ulcer (FIa, FIb, FIIa, FIIb), early reintroduction of aspirin by day 3 after index endoscopy is recommended, provided that adequate hemostasis has been established (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417980/"}

To assess comfort levels and knowledge of CLD among recently graduated medical students METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to incoming categorical Internal Medicine (IM) interns at a single academic institution during a 2-year period. The survey consisted of 38 Likert-like questions evaluating comfort levels and self-assessed knowledge for several general medicine and liver diseases, as well as 12 multiple-choice questions to objectively test knowledge. Wilcoxon ranked sum and Fisher's exact test were then used. There was a 100% (n = 65) completion rate. Only 14 (22%) of those surveyed reported exposure to a hepatology rotation in medical school. Highest mean comfort levels (1 = not at all comfortable, 5 = very comfortable) were for managing congestive heart failure (3.59) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3.77). Mean comfort levels for various liver diseases were significantly lower (2.22-3.03, all p < 0.01). Mean self-rated knowledge (1 = no knowledge, 5 = strong knowledge) was also low (2.14-3.13). Although 98% agreed that hepatology is critical to IM training, only 42% agreed that their hepatology education during medical school was adequate. Recently graduated medical students are less comfortable managing liver diseases compared to other general medical conditions.

Nevertheless, graft rejection or numerous adverse events associated with overimmunosuppression or underimmunosuppression cannot be completely avoided. The ImmuKnow assay measures cell-mediated immunity and is able to discern between conditions of overimmunosuppression and underimmunosuppression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ImmuKnow assay in the evaluation of the immune function in pediatric liver transplant recipients and to assess its correlation with the patients' clinical and biochemical status. Eighty-nine whole blood samples were collected from 23 liver transplant recipients that were 1 to 18 years old. The net state of immune function was determined by the quantitative measurement of the intracellular adenosine 5-triphosphate level in CD4+ lymphocytes after phytohemagglutinin stimulation. Comprehensive clinical data were correlated with the ImmuKnow assay results. In 23 of the 28 samples collected during clinical quiescence, ImmuKnow results were correlated with the clinical status, expressing the patient's moderate immune function. However, a correlation between measured therapeutic drug levels and clinical quiescence was found in only 18 of the 28 samples. In 6 patients who suffered from clinical complications, ImmuKnow measurements showed a wide range of deviations, expressing the unstable immunological status of these patients. In conclusion, the ImmuKnow assay correlates with the clinical status of liver-transplanted children. It serves as a reliable and unique parameter of the cellular immune function. We conclude that the ImmuKnow assay, together with existing clinical tools, may allow for the immune monitoring of pediatric liver recipients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18508374/"}

One hundred and eighty-eight gastroenterologists responded (46%). Experts endorsed more 'best practices' than non-experts (93% vs. 85%; P = 0.002). Non-experts were more likely to endorse incorrectly bolus dosing vs. continuous infusion of intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; 92% vs. 64%; P = 0.005) and to select standard-channel vs. large-channel endoscopes in high-risk bleeding (100% vs. 85%; P = 0.04).

The most visible and, perhaps, controversial of these is natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), but other equally important changes are emerging as investigators around the globe vie with one another in the demonstration of increasingly audacious procedures. As is to be expected, we are also already seeing a backlash from more conservative scholars attempting to temper what they believe to be the surgical equivalent of irrational exuberance. However, by far the most common attitude among gastroenterologists toward these changes is one of indifference. In this piece, we discuss the circumstances that led to the development of NOTES and other innovative procedures, the peril that lies in ignoring them, and the true promise that they hold for our specialties.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19806084/"}

While MASLD can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in this population. This heightened risk is largely driven by the strong association between MASLD and CVD risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Therefore, addressing metabolic health is a fundamental component of MASLD management. Gastroenterologists play a key role in identifying metabolic risk factors, recommending lifestyle, and pharmacologic interventions, in consultation with specialists or multidisciplinary care teams when appropriate. This review provides a practical framework for integrating metabolic health optimization into routine MASLD care, equipping gastroenterologists with the necessary tools to improve both liver-related and overall patient outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40549660/"}

An anonymous online survey was distributed targeting registered dietitians and gastroenterologists involved in CF care through three international listservs (CF Nutrition, CF DIGEST, and PEDGI) over a 6-week period. SurveyMonkey was used, and informed consent was obtained. A total of 131 respondents participated in this survey, including 80 registered dietitians and 51 gastroenterologists (41 pediatric and 10 adult gastroenterologists). Most respondents (82%) were from the United States, and two-thirds had ≥5 years of experience in CF. A significant number of registered dietitians reported the nonavailability of gastroenterologists for collaboration and there was greater availability of gastroenterologists in pediatric centers. Barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration included lack of CF expertise and dedicated time among the gastroenterologists and difficulties in coordinating the gastroenterology clinics. More gastroenterologists than registered dietitians perceived that they worked collaboratively with the other discipline in various domains (clinical care, quality improvement, research, presentations, and publications). Both disciplines had mutual respect and interest to further the collaboration. There is an increased need for gastroenterologist participation and collaboration (particularly in adult centers) in CF alongside registered dietitians to enhance comprehensive patient care. Future efforts should focus on training more gastroenterologists in CF and facilitating easier access to gastroenterologists for the CF population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39377560/"}
{"id": "21304497", "title": "GI training: where are we headed?", "text": "Gastroenterology (GI) fellowship training slots are not expected to increase over the next 10 years despite a 9% estimated US population growth. There is also no expected increase in the number of hours worked per gastroenterologist; instead, this number will probably decrease slightly, as GI will have continued growth in the percentage of women and of men in dual career families. The current trend of \"sub-specialization\" within GI is likely to continue, although this will not be formally recognized by further extension of the length of training or by additional board requirements. Current sub-specialties include hepatology, inflammatory bowel disease, motility, small bowel imaging, and interventional endoscopy. Most \"sub-specialty\" GI training will be incorporated within the 3-year fellowship, with the probable exception of interventional endoscopy, which will likely take an additional training year. End points for training and criteria for credentialing in the future will focus more on quality measures in both procedural and cognitive aspects of GI. Hopefully, this move to \"competency evaluation with quality measures\" will eliminate undertrained endoscopists such as the non-gastroenterologist performing occasional colonoscopy or the gastroenterologist performing occasional ERCP. Post-graduate GI training is also undergoing transformation, partly due to a decrease in industry support of graduate medical education, which has previously been heavily relied upon. The expected wider use of web-based training by the technology-comfortable younger generation of physicians may partly fill this gap. Despite the challenges facing GI training at both the fellowship and post-graduate level, GI is expected to remain a popular specialty choice. It is likely that sub-specialization within GI will continue to grow in both academic and private practices due in part to an increasing focus on quality patient outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21304497/"}

Following a systematic literature search, 451 publications were included. Consensus was obtained by agreement within the working groups, two Delphi processes and a guideline conference. Targeted management of diverticular disease requires a classificatory diagnosis. A new classification was created. In addition to the clinical examination, intestinal ultrasound or computed tomography is the determining factor. Interval colonoscopy is recommended to exclude comorbidities. A low-fiber diet, obesity, lack of exercise, smoking and immunosuppression have an adverse impact on diverticulosis. This can lead to diverticulitis. Antibiotics are no longer recommended in uncomplicated diverticulitis if no risk factors such as immunosuppression are present. If close monitoring is ensured, uncomplicated diverticulitis can be treated on an outpatient basis. Complicated diverticulitis should be treated in hospital, involving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, where necessary abscess drainage, and surgery, if possible laparoscopically. In the case of chronic relapsing diverticulitis, the risk of perforation decreases with each episode, so that surgery is no longer recommended after the second episode but only following individual assessment. New findings on diverticular disease call into question the overuse of antibiotics and excessive indications for surgery.

Information was obtained on the demographic characteristics and responses to six case vignettes prepared to examine communication patterns. We determined possible influences of conscious sedation and the benignity or severity of findings on communication practices. Sixty-one surveys (76%) were completed and analyzed. Endoscopists immediately inform patients of normal results. For abnormal results, 92% would immediately inform nonsedated patients versus 79% that would inform sedated patients (p < 0.008). Analysis of responses to the case vignettes indicated that 82% of endoscopists would immediately reassure the patient about a benign appearing (< 1 cm) polyp, but only 70% would do so for a polyp > 2 cm (p < 0.01). In contrast, when presented with a frank malignancy, 94% would inform the patient. Eighty-four percent of endoscopists would telephone results of a benign pathology report, but only 34% would telephone report a dysplastic lesion (p < 0.001). There was no correlation between the response rate and various demographic parameters such as physician age, type of, or length of time in practice. Gastroenterologists usually report normal findings immediately, but are less likely to do so after use of sedation or encountering abnormal findings.

To best address patient questions and concerns, we must first understand who uses probiotics and why. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the endoscopy suite of an academic hospital from June to October of 2019. Surveys were anonymous and contained a combination of multiple choice, free text and Likert scale questions. Participants privately completed a paper survey in English or Spanish and the results were reviewed with them by study personnel to clarify responses. Descriptive statistics were generated and multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to compare characteristics of probiotic users versus non-users. During the 5-month study period, 600 patients were approached and 537 (90%) agreed to participate. Among participants, 89% completed at least 24 survey items and were included in the analysis. Overall, 27% of patients reported probiotic use. Bloating, rather than diarrhoea, was the main gastrointestinal symptom associated with use of probiotics (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.44 for bloating; aOR 1.03, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.94 for diarrhoea). Frequent reasons cited for taking probiotics were the beliefs that they improved overall health and longevity (54%) and that they improved gastrointestinal symptoms (45%). Probiotic use is common among general gastroenterology patients, many of whom believe that probiotics confer general rather than specific gastrointestinal health benefits. Symptoms-especially bloating-and not sociodemographic factors seem to motivate probiotic use.

Specifically, digestive cancers grow anatomically near adipose tissue. During their interaction with cancer cells, adipocytes are reprogrammed into cancer-associated adipocytes and secrete adipokines to affect tumor cells. Moreover, the liver is the central metabolic hub. Adipose tissue and the liver cooperatively regulate whole-body energy homeostasis via adipokines. Obesity, the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy, is currently considered a global epidemic and is related to low-grade systemic inflammation characterized by altered adipokine regulation. Obesity-related digestive diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal cancer, colon polyps and cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis-related diseases, cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and diabetes, might cause specific alterations in adipokine profiles.

It has become apparent that the cardinal feature of achalasia, impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, can occur in several disease phenotypes: without peristalsis, with premature (spastic) distal esophageal contractions, with panesophageal pressurization, or even with preserved peristalsis. Furthermore, despite these advances in diagnostics, no single manometric pattern is perfectly sensitive or specific for idiopathic achalasia and complimentary assessments with provocative maneuvers during HRM or interrogating the esophagogastric junction with the functional luminal imaging probe during endoscopy can be useful in clarifying equivocal or inexplicable HRM findings. Using these tools, we have come to conceptualize esophageal motility disorders as characterized by obstructive physiology at the esophagogastric junction, smooth muscle esophagus, or both. Recognizing obstructive physiology as a primary target of therapy has become particularly relevant with the development of a minimally invasive technique for performing a calibrated myotomy of the esophageal circular muscle, the POEM procedure. Now and going forward, optimal management is to render treatment in a phenotype-specific manner: e.g. POEM calibrated to patient-specific physiology for spastic achalasia and spastic disorders of the smooth muscle esophagus, more conservative strategies (pneumatic dilation) for the disorders limited to the sphincter.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29702296/"}

Its composition and function are shaped by host-microbiota and intra-microbiota interactions. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that target bacteria and have the potential to modulate bacterial communities. To summarise phage biology and the clinical applications of phages in gastroenterology METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies. Phages induce bacterial cell lysis, integration of viral DNA into the bacteria and/or coexistence in a stable equilibrium. Bacteria and phages have co-evolved and their dynamic interactions are yet to be fully understood. The increasing need to modulate microbial communities (e.g., gut microbiota, multidrug-resistant bacteria) has been a strong stimulus for research in phages as an antibacterial therapy. In gastroenterology, phage therapy has been mainly studied in infectious diseases such as cholera. However, it is currently being explored in several other circumstances such as treating Clostridioides difficile colitis, targeting adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Crohn's disease or eradicating Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer. Overall, phage therapy has a favourable and acceptable safety profile. Presently, trials with phage therapy are ongoing in Crohn's disease. Phage therapy is a promising therapeutic tool against pathogenic bacteria in the fields of infectious diseases and gastroenterology. Randomised, placebo-controlled trials with phage therapy for gastroenterological diseases are ongoing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31696976/"}

However, its interpretation is highly subjective and the potential variability may compromise its accuracy and reliability. Here we studied the potential inter-observer variations on the interpretation of capsule endoscopy. Two residents and one specialist in gastroenterology independently reviewed 58 capsule endoscopy studies in the same sequential order. The gastric transit time, small bowel transit time, and the most significant small bowel lesion were independently recorded. The consensus transit time was determined by the joint review of the three gastroenterologists. The 'gold standard' for small bowel diagnoses was based on final surgical, endoscopic findings or consensus diagnosis. Clinically significant and relevant small bowel lesions were found in 32 (55%) cases by consensus review. The overall mean accuracy in determining gastric emptying time, small bowel transit time and small bowel lesion was 89%, 76% and 80%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the accuracy between the residents and specialist on small bowel transit time (P<0.05) and small bowel diagnosis (P<0.05). The mean kappa values on small bowel diagnosis among the three viewers was 0.56 (range, 0.52-0.59). Among various small bowel diagnoses, small bowel bleeding was more accurately identified than other pathology.

(i) Drug prescribing is associated with a patient's prognosis and disease status, called indication for treatment. These patient disease characteristics can drive drug channeling in risk populations and create confounded drug-effect associations. (ii) Drug exposure is the result of the 'natural' experiment of pharmacotherapy over time. Reliable information on the time-sequence of events in relation to drug exposure is required to evaluate both beneficial and adverse effects of drug therapy. (iii) Postmarketing surveillance studies provide intensive learning about drug effects when large spectra of patients with various medical backgrounds, prognoses, co-morbidity, and the like, are exposed to the drug.

{"id": "22476586", "title": "Advances in the current treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.", "text": "Current treatment strategies for autoimmune hepatitis are complicated by frequent relapse after drug withdrawal, medication intolerance, and refractory disease. The objective of this review is to describe advances that have improved treatment outcomes by defining the optimum objectives of initial therapy, managing relapse more effectively, identifying problematic patients early, and incorporating the new pharmacological interventions that have emerged as frontline and salvage therapies. Initial corticosteroid treatment should be continued until serum aminotransferase, γ-globulin, and immunoglobulin G levels are normal, and maintenance of this improvement for 3-8 months before liver tissue assessment. Improvement to normal liver tissue is the ideal histological result that justifies drug withdrawal, but it is achievable in only 22 % of patients. Minimum portal hepatitis, inactive cirrhosis, or minimally active cirrhosis is the most common treatment end point. Relapse after drug withdrawal warrants institution of a long-term maintenance regimen, preferably with azathioprine. Mathematical models can identify problematic adult patients early, as also can clinical phenotype (age ≤ 30 years and HLA DRB1 03), rapidity of treatment response (≤ 24 months), presence of antibodies to soluble liver antigen, and non-white ethnicity. The calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) can be effective in steroid-refractory disease; mycophenolate mofetil can be corticosteroid-sparing and effective for azathioprine intolerance; budesonide combined with azathioprine can be effective for treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients.

This cross-sectional study utilized the Global Disease Burden Study 2019 to estimate the incidence, mortality rate, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life disability, years of life lost, and changes in the burden of digestive diseases across Chinese provinces from 1990 to 2019. The analysis of disease burden primarily examines the characteristics of sub-disease distribution, time trends, age distribution, and sex distribution. Additionally, we compared provincial age-standardized DALYs for digestive diseases with the expected rates based on the socio-demographic index (SDI). In 2019, there were 499.2 million cases of digestive system diseases in China, resulting in 1,557,310 deaths.

The aim was to assess the availability and benefit of clinical psychology in paediatric gastroenterology across the UK and Germany. A retrospective assessment of referrals (n = 936 referrals) to clinical psychology was performed at our tertiary paediatric gastroenterology centre between 2010 and 2018. The availability of clinical psychologists and outcome of psychology intervention for children with functional abdominal pain were also assessed. Access to clinical psychology across the UK and Germany was assessed using an online questionnaire. We observed a substantial rise in the number of clinical psychology referrals between 2010 and 2018. Increasing demand was not matched by sufficient increase in availability of clinical psychology, leading to longer waiting times. A major benefit of clinical psychology intervention was highlighted with 95% of patients (n = 20) reporting a significant reduction in symptoms. Of the 12 centres who responded, 11 centres have direct access to clinical psychology with a mean of 13% of patients requiring psychology referrals annually.Conclusion: Despite evidence of its benefit and increasing demand, there is insufficient access to clinical psychological services, highlighting the urgent need to address this important issue. What is known: • The biopsychosocial pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders involves a disordered brain-gut interaction, which emphasizes the close link between psychological factors and altered gut function. • Psychological intervention, as an adjunct to medical treatment, improves outcomes in paediatric patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disease such as functional gastrointestinal disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases What is new: • There is a rising number of referrals from paediatric gastroenterology to clinical psychology in our centre which is not met by a sufficient increase in the availability of clinical psychologists.

The aims of this article are to report the findings of a multidisciplinary group of experts focusing on issues in AI research and applications related to gastroenterology and endoscopy, to review the current status of the field, and to produce recommendations for investigators developing and studying new AI technologies for gastroenterology. A multidisciplinary meeting was held on September 28, 2019, bringing together academic, industry, and regulatory experts in diverse fields including gastroenterology, computer and imaging sciences, machine learning, computer vision, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health. Recent and ongoing studies in gastroenterology and current technology in AI were presented and discussed, key gaps in knowledge were identified, and recommendations were made for research that would have the highest impact in making advances and implementation in the field of AI to gastroenterology. There was a consensus that AI will transform the field of gastroenterology, particularly endoscopy and image interpretation. Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, the use of computer vision in endoscopy has the potential to result in better prediction and treatment outcomes for patients with gastroenterology disorders and cancer. Large libraries of endoscopic images, \"EndoNet,\" will be important to facilitate development and application of AI systems. The regulatory environment for implementation of AI systems is evolving, but common outcomes such as colon polyp detection have been highlighted as potential clinical trial endpoints. Other threshold outcomes will be important, as well as clarity on iterative improvement of clinical systems. Gastroenterology is a prime candidate for early adoption of AI. AI is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to a clinical implementation phase in gastroenterology. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in gastroenterology over the next decade will have a significant and positive impact on patient care and clinical workflows. Ongoing collaboration among gastroenterologists, industry experts, and regulatory agencies will be important to ensure that progress is rapid and clinically meaningful.

French Club of Digestive Motility.", "text": "The aim of this multicentre inquiry was to evaluate the prevalence of sexual abuse among IBS patients consulting a gastroenterologist, in comparison to healthy controls and patients with organic digestive diseases. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; Rome Criteria) were included by eight university hospitals (n = 196; 41.2 +/- 20.6 years; sex ratio (M/F) = 0.23). Control groups were: (i) patients consulting for the follow-up of non-neoplastic organic digestive diseases (n = 135; 41.5 +/- 17.0 years; 1.21); (ii) patients attending ophthalmology units (n = 200; 43.8 +/- 20.7 years; 0.81); (iii) healthy subjects seen in centres of the National Health System (n = 172; 40.3 +/- 16.3 years; 0.83). Each patient filled in an anonymous questionnaire, without help. Prevalence of sexual abuse in the various groups was compared by the chi 2 test. Sixty-two instance of sexual abuse (55 females, 7 males) were recorded among the 196 IBS patients (31.6%); 8 cases of verbal aggression, 4 of exhibitionism, 11 of sexual harassment, 22 sexual touches, 17 rapes. The prevalence of sexual abuse was 14.0% for the patients with organic digestive diseases (P = 0.0005 vs. IBS), 12.5% among ophthalmology patients (P < 0.0001) and 7.6% in healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Sexual abuse was accompanied by physical abuse in 23 IBS patients and 19 patients from control groups (not significant). Twenty-six IBS patients reported isolated physical abuse (14.7%) versus 40 from control groups (8.8%; P = 0.041). There was a significant trend towards more severe attacks of abuse among IBS patients than in others. This study confirms the high prevalence of sexual abuse among IBS patients consulting in Gastroenterology. Some of these patients would benefit from appropriate therapy. (In the majority of cases, this will be psychotherapy.)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9160196/"}

The discovery that HLAs are associated with several diseases led to appealing developments both in basic biomedical research and in clinical medicine, and offered the opportunity to improve the understanding of pathogenesis and classification of diseases, as well as to provide diagnostic and prognostic indicators. The aim of this article is to review the association between HLA alleles and autoimmune digestive disease and its current relationship with modern HLA nomenclature and clinical practice. Articles dealing with the association between HLAs and autoimmune digestive disease (including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis) were searched for using Pubmed and SCOPUS databases from earliest records to January 2008. The review has provided two sections. In the first, we explain the basic principles of HLA structure, function, and nomenclature, as an introduction to the second section, which describes current associations between HLA alleles and digestive diseases. The clinical implications of each HLA association are critically discussed. Actually, a clinical role for HLA typing is suggested for only a few conditions, e.g., celiac disease. The knowledge of current HLA nomenclature and of its association with some digestive diseases such as celiac disease can be useful in clinical practice for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. This can avoid improper HLA typing as well as stressing the need for further studies on other possible clinical applications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19098870/"}

We examined 4 digestive diseases from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 STUDY: Appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, inguinal and femoral hernia, and gallbladder and bile duct disease. Using demographic and epidemiologic data from the GBD 2010 STUDY, we calculated the potential decrease in burden of digestive diseases if quality surgical services were available universally and accessible at first-level hospitals. The lowest case fatality rates for each age and sex grouping from all GBD regions were assumed to reflect the best possible state of full surgical coverage and treatment. These best scenario rates were applied to the GBD 2010 results from all LMIC regions to estimate surgically avertable burden. Overall, 4.8 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) or 65% of burden related to the 4 digestive diseases are avertable potentially with first-level surgical care in LMICs. Sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest avertable burden in absolute DALYs (1.7 million) and avertable proportion (83%). Intestinal obstruction accounted for the largest portion of avertable burden among the 4 digestive diseases (2.2 million DALYs; 64% avertable). Improving the capacity of surgical services at first-level hospitals is essential for averting the burden of digestive diseases in LMICs. Practicable strategies for scaling up surgical capacities in rural districts are available potentially, which must be given due attention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444219/"}

Although the disease is asymptomatic in about 70-80 % of patients, it represents, at least in Western countries, one of the most important gastrointestinal diseases in terms of direct and indirect health costs. Pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown. However, it is the result of complex interactions between colonic structure, intestinal motility, diet and genetic factors. Whilst efficacious preventive strategies remain to be identified, fibre supplementation in the diet is recommended. Why symptoms develop is still unclear. Results of recent experimental studies on irritable bowel syndrome speculated that low grade inflammation of colonic mucosa, induced by changes in bacterial microflora, could affect the enteric nervous system, which is crucial for normal gut function, thus favouring symptom development. This hypothesis could be extrapolated also for diverticular disease, since bacterial overgrowth is present, at least in a subgroup of patients.

Here we report the COIs generated and recorded for patients with HBV or HCV infection at different stages of the disease. In the first phase of VBMH study, COIs were identified, based on current international guidelines and literature, using a modified Delphi method and a RAND 9-point appropriateness scale. In the second phase, COIs were tested in an observational, longitudinal, prospective, multicentre study based in Lombardy, Italy. Eighteen COIs were identified for HBV and HCV patients. Patients with CLD secondary to HBV (547) or HCV (1391) were enrolled over an 18-month period and followed for a median of 4 years. The estimation of the proposed COIs was feasible in the real-word clinical practice and COI values compared well with literature data. Further, the COIs were able to capture the impact of new effective treatments like direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in the clinical practice. The COIs efficiently measured clinical outcomes at different stages of CLDs. While specific clinical practice settings and related healthcare systems may modify their implementation, these indicators will represent an important component of the tools for a value-based approach in hepatology and will positively affect care delivery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31654608/"}

{"id": "23691732", "title": "Exploring implications of Medicaid participation and wait times for colorectal screening on early detection efforts in Connecticut--a secret-shopper survey.", "text": "Routine colorectal screening, decreases in incidence, and advances in treatment have lowered colorectal cancer mortality rates over the past three decades. Nevertheless, it remains the second most common cause of cancer death amongst men and women combined in U.S. Most cases of colon cancer are diagnosed at a late stage leading to poor survival outcomes for patients. After extensive research of publically available data, it would appear that the state of Connecticut does not have available state-wide data on patient wait times for routine colonoscopy screening. Furthermore, there are no publicly available, or Connecticut-specific, reports on Medicaid participation rates for colorectal screening amongst gastroenterologists (GI) in Connecticut. In 2012, the American Cancer Society report on Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates confirmed barriers to health-care access and disparities in health outcomes and survival rates for colon cancer patients based on race, ethnicity, and low socioeconomic status. Given this information, one could conjecture that low Medicaid participation rates among GIs could potentially have a more severe impact on health-care access and outcomes for underserved populations. At present, funding and human resources are being employed across the state of Connecticut to address bottlenecks in colorectal cancer screening. More specifically, patient navigation and outreach programs are emerging and expanding to address the gaps in services for hard-to-reach populations and the medically underserved. Low Medicaid participation rates and increased wait times for colonoscopy screening may impair the efficacy of colorectal cancer patient navigation and outreach efforts and potentially funding for future interventions. In this study, we report the results of our secret-shopper telephone survey comprising of 93 group and independent gastroenterologist (GI) practices in different counties of Connecticut. Reviewing online resources and yellow pages, researchers compiled a county-specific list of GI practices throughout Connecticut and conducted a secret-shopper survey by telephone. A standard script and set of questions was formulated and used for each telephone call to GI practices. Data was analyzed in context of statistics available to the public at large from the U.S. Census Bureau. Overall, 46% of all 93 practices and 62% of individual GIs from all 93 practices state-wide reported Medicaid participation. About 35% of surveyed practices were independent practices; 41% of these reported Medicaid participation. About 65% of surveyed practices were group practices; 49% of these reported Medicaid participation. Approximately, 85% of all practices are in Fairfield, Hartford, orNew Haven counties. Of all three counties, New Haven reported the highest Medicaid participation rate by practices; 62% of all practices in New Haven reported participation. Fairfield reported the lowest Medicaid participation rate by practices; 29% of all practices in Fairfield reported participation. When Medicaid participation rates were calculated for total number of gastroenterologists from all practices in a given county (as opposed to participation rates by number of practices), Medicaid participation rates were 80% and 44% for New Haven and Fairfield, respectively. Of all practices in Hartford, only 50% reported Medicaid participation, whereas 67% of the total number of gastroenterologists (as opposed to practices) reported Medicaid participation. According to a recent national survey, 47% of gastroenterologists reported stopping accepting new Medicaid patients. Overall minimum and maximum wait times were reported to be the highest for Hartford, but wait times were long even for smaller counties, reflecting a possible imbalance in supply and demand or inefficiency in allocating the available resources. Only a limited number of gastroenterology practices in Connecticut accept Medicaid patients, notably in selected counties, but in all counties, and this may add to access barriers. It is yet unclear whether these disparities are significant enough to create a supply-demand imbalance and thus, have a significantly negative impact on health outcomes for the underserved. Nevertheless, with the high unemployment rates and impending implementation of mandated state-wide health-care reform as outlined in the Affordable Care Act, the Medicaid population in the state of Connecticut will increase, increasing future demand for services. In addition, based on the survey findings, longer wait times for colonoscopy screening are reported for the many of GI practices in Connecticut for Medicaid-insured as well as non-Medicaid patients. Longer wait times may have an impact on patient compliance, especially for the underserved populations that are hard to reach and ensure follow-up, contributing to potential delayed diagnosis. A Medicaid-associated disparity in this area will serve to exacerbate the problem for the underserved compared to those relatively well served. Those currently not seeking screening are at even higher risk of contributing to the higher mortality rate, and we need to find out how best to ensure that we can more uniformly apply screening and have the capacity to do so.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691732/"}

We sought to appraise the quality of health economic analyses in digestive diseases, and to identify predictors of study quality. We performed a systematic review to identify digestive disease health economic analyses published since 1980. We assessed these studies using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES), a validated quality-scoring instrument (score range = 0-100; >75 = high quality). We conducted regression analysis to identify predictors of high quality. Of 186 identified analyses, 29% were high quality, 71% failed to address potential model biases, 52% failed to disclose conflicts of interest, and 74% failed to describe methods for deriving the model assumptions. Four factors predicted high quality in logistic regression: (1) one or more authors had an advanced degree in health services or a related field (odds ratio for high quality, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-9.3); (2) the study used decision-analysis software package (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.7); (3) the study was federally funded (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.1); and (4) the study cited the National Panel on Cost Effectiveness guidelines (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.2).

However, high-resolution manometry (HRM) and EPT require increased equipment costs over conventional systems and evidence demonstrating a significant diagnostic advantage of EPT over CLT is limited. Our aim was to investigate whether the inter-rater agreement and/or accuracy of esophageal motility diagnosis differed between EPT and CLT. Forty previously completed patient HRM studies were selected for analysis using a customized software program developed to perform blinded independent interpretation in either EPT or CLT (six pressure sensors) format. Six experienced gastroenterologists with a clinical focus in esophageal disease (attendings) and six gastroenterology trainees with minimal manometry experience (fellows) from three academic centers interpreted each of the 40 studies using both EPT and CLT formats. Rater diagnoses were assessed for inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy, both for exact diagnosis and for correct identification of a major esophageal motility disorder. The total group agreement was moderate (κ=0.57; 95% CI: 0.56-0.59) for EPT and fair (κ=0.32; 0.30-0.33) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between attendings was good (κ=0.68; 0.65-0.71) for EPT and moderate (κ=0.46; 0.43-0.50) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between fellows was moderate (κ=0.48; 0.45-0.50) for EPT and poor to fair (κ=0.20; 0.17-0.24) for CLT. Among all raters, the odds of an incorrect exact esophageal motility diagnosis were 3.3 times higher with CLT assessment than with EPT (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.4-4.5; P<0.0001), and the odds of incorrect identification of a major motility disorder were 3.4 times higher with CLT than with EPT (OR: 3.4; 2.4-5.0; P<0.0001). Superior inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy of esophageal motility diagnoses were demonstrated with analysis using EPT over CLT among our selected raters.

While it would seem that most gastroenterologists and endoscopists agree with these guidelines, different studies have shown that in clinical practice, the concept of dysplasia is not fully understood, and therefore, the guidelines are not always followed. According to some studies, the reason why gastroenterologists do not follow the recommendations is inadequate education. The main advance in recent years in this subject is in endoscopic diagnosis of dysplasia. The magnification and chromoendoscopy allow targeted biopsies to be taken. Some studies indicate that nontargeted biopsies are not useful in ruling out dysplasia. It is also important to realize that most dysplasia is visible in conventional colonoscopy. In colonoscopy, it is not only significant to detect dysplasia-associated lesions or masses; the endoscopist should also be trained to detect, in the course of conventional exploration, subtle changes in colour or in mucosal surfaces that imply dysplasia. Adherence to guidelines had been extensively assessed in other disease conditions (asthma, hypertension, etc.). According to our knowledge there are no such data regarding CRC surveillance in UC. Some barriers that may affect physicians include: (i) knowledge (lack of awareness or lack of familiarity); (ii) attitudes (lack of agreement, lack of self-efficacy, lack of outcome expectancy, or the inertia of previous practice) and (iii) behaviour (external barriers). In conclusion, we need new guidelines for CRC surveillance in UC, which must take into account the advances in risk factors of dysplasia and new technologies to study colon dysplasia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16961747/"}

The knowledge of and compliance with these guidelines in Germany is unknown. In order to assess the knowledge and compliance with acute pancreatitis guidelines, a structured questionnaire was sent out to the 190 members of the ALGK (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Leitender Gastroenterologischer Krankenhausärzte), a professional organisation of gastroenterology chairmen, who, in their respective institutions, are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis. University hospitals were excluded to cover the entire severity spectrum of the disease and to avoid a referral bias. The questionnaire was responded by 182 (96 %) members. To a large extent (acceptance > 2/3 of the consultants), guideline recommendations were complied with. There was, nevertheless, disagreement regarding the prophylactic use of antibiotics (acceptance < 2/3 of the consultants), as to when a contrast-enhanced computed tomography was indicated, and the timing of cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis. The choice of pain therapy for patients with acute pancreatitis also remained equivocal. Based on the high response rate which excludes a non-responder bias, the results of our study reflect the current status of the diagnosis and therapy of acute pancreatitis in Germany and to what extent international guidelines are known and complied with.

Consequently, training approaches are shifting towards competency based medical education, which incorporates robust assessment methods and credible standards of physician proficiency. However, current gastroenterology and hepatology training in the US continues to utilize procedural volume and global impressions without standardized criteria as markers of competence. In particular, efforts to optimize competency based training in gastrointestinal (GI) motility are not underway, even though GI motility disorders account for nearly half of outpatient gastroenterology visits. These deficiencies compromise the quality of patient care. Thus, there is a great need and opportunity to shift our focus in GI motility training towards a competency based approach. First, we need to clarify the variable rates of learning for individual diagnostic tests. We must develop integrated systems that standardize training and monitor physician competency for GI motility diagnostics. Finally, as a profession and society, we must create certification processes to credential competent physicians. These advances are critical to optimizing the quality of GI motility diagnostics in practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27061311/"}

Forty community-based gastroenterologists participated in the QI study; 20 were assigned to educational intervention and control groups, respectively. At baseline, randomly selected charts of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were retrospectively reviewed for the gastroenterologists' performance of 8 PQRS IBD measures and 4 NQS-related measures. The intervention group participated in a series of accredited continuing medical education (CME) activities focusing on QI. Follow-up chart reviews were conducted 6 months after the CME activities. Independent t tests were conducted to compare between-group differences in baseline-to-follow-up rates of documented compliance with each measure. The analysis included 299 baseline charts and 300 follow-up charts. The intervention group had significantly greater magnitudes of improvement than the control group for the following measures: assessment of IBD type, location, and activity (+14 %, p = 0.009); influenza vaccination (+13 %, p = 0.025); pneumococcal vaccination (+20 %, p = 0.003); testing for latent tuberculosis before anti-TNF-α therapy (+10 %, p = 0.028); assessment of hepatitis B virus status before anti-TNF-α therapy (+9 %, p = 0.010); assessment of side effects (+17 %, p = 0.048), and counseling patients about cancer risks (+13 %, p = 0.013).

During that period, research dollars have increased threefold (1.5-fold when corrected for inflation), whereas the number of grants supported by those dollars has increased only 1.5-fold. This increase is similar to that of the entire National Institutes of Health. A greater percentage of grantees now have multiple grants and the cost of multiple grants is greater on a per grant basis. One-half of the funds support the research of only one-fourth of the grantees. The number of competing applications sent to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases compared with those sent to the National Institutes of Health shows a smaller increase (26% vs. 40%), whereas more funds are being provided per grant.

Trainees were trained in performing mucosotomy, submucosal dissection, creating submucosal tunnel, identifying gastroesophageal junction, myotomy, and closure of mucosal incision in a step-by-step fashion. Trainees' performance on each step was evaluated by the mentor based on several key points in each step. The short form 36 (SF36) was obtained before and certain times after the primary POEM procedure was performed. Sixty-two patients, 26 males and 36 females with a mean age of 59 years, who underwent POEM were enrolled. A checklist included all related items for each step was established. All trainees obtained competence within 6 cases for each step. 61/62 (98.3%) patients had a significant improvement in the Eckardt's score post POEM: 9.3 ± 1.5 prior to POEM and 2.6 ± 1.2 after the POEM (P = 0.001) and a decrease in mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LES): pre- and post-procedure mean LES pressures were 28.5 ± 11.4 and 12.1 ± 4.5 mmHg, respectively (P = 0.001). The SF-36 questionnaire demonstrated a significant improvement in quality of life and comparable with those without trainees in other studies. This preliminary study showed for the first time that training for POEM can be performed in a step-by-step fashion, learning mucosal incision, submucosal dissection, myotomy, and mucosal incision closure from an expert interventional endoscopist without increasing adverse events.

In terms of subjective well-being and QOL, the scores of the four dimensions of \"satisfaction and interest in life,\" \"melancholy and cheerful mood,\" \"control of emotional behavior\" and \"relaxation and tension\" in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In the dimension of \"body pain\" of QOL, the score of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Among patients in a general hospital with digestive diseases and mild-to-moderate depression, music therapy under the framework of PERMA shows significant positive effects in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms and improving subjective well-being and specific QOL dimensions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39345078/"}

Among refractory digestive diseases, Crohn's disease and liver cirrhosis may be two main diseases where stem cell therapy can be applied for anti-inflammation and regeneration of tissue. Currently, with respect to these two diseases, clinical trials using hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue have shown some evidence of clinical benefits to immune modulation, suppression of inflammation and regeneration of functional cells. However, for the development of practical stem cell therapy, we need more data on underlying mechanisms, effective subpopulation of stem cells and its sources, and effective parameters for monitoring and estimation. With technical advances, the research on embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells will also contribute to the new therapeutic strategies for digestive regenerative medicine. In the future, a variety of stem cell therapies may be therapeutic options for refractory digestive diseases, but many technical challenges remain to be solved.

The guideline method within the DGVS as well as between medical professional societies varies greatly. In particular, the levels of evidence as well as the grades of recommendations are often applied very differently. Most guidelines in Germany use the grades of the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), which were first published in 1992. Some newer guidelines, e.g., the ulcerative colitis guideline of the DGVS or the guidelines of the German Diabetes Association, try to circumvent problems of this method. They adopted variations of the very simple AHCPR grades. Sometimes these new grading methods have serious shortcomings too. They may not be reproducible, ignore important parts of the consensus process, can only be applied to therapeutic interventions, or they do not adequately distinguish between the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. Meanwhile, an enormous number of different and partially contradictory methodologies for the grading of guideline recommendations are being used. In the GRADE working group several renowned clinical epidemiologists came together to develop a uniform grading systematic that avoids the problems of earlier guideline methods. With GRADE first the quality of evidence is assessed in a systematic manner. The quality of each study plays an important role in this process. Hence randomised trials of poor quality can end up with a lower overall quality rating than well performed observational trials. The strength of recommendation is based on the balance between the expected benefit and harm of the intervention in the respective population for which the recommendations of the guideline are made. The quality of evidence is only one factor contributing to the strength of recommendation. The GRADE method can be more cumbersome in its application compared to older methods. Nevertheless, more and more organisations are adopting GRADE for their guidelines and recommendations. Possibly the DGVS guidelines could benefit from this new system too.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17924306/"}

However, the short, medium-term, and long-term outcomes of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases without COVID-19 will be affected by the ability to develop locally adapted strategies to meet their service needs in the COVID-19 setting. To mitigate risks for patients with GI diseases, it is useful to differentiate three phases: (i) the acute phase, (ii) the adaptation phase, and (iii) the consolidation phase. During the acute phase, service delivery for patients with GI disease will be curtailed to meet competing health-care needs of COVID-19 patients. During the adaptation phase, GI services are calibrated towards a \"new normal,\" and the consolidation phase is characterized by rapid introduction and ongoing refinement of services.

His conclusions about the cells of origin of liver cancer remain concordant with the newer concepts in the field after nearly half a century. Studies in the field of chronic hepatitis became a long saga, involving the first classification of this syndrome by \"the Gnomes\" in 1968, histochemical investigations of viral antigens, lymphocyte subsets and adhesion molecules, and a quarter century later, the creation of a new classification presently in use. Cholestasis was a broadening field in diagnostic entities and involved the study of liver lesions, comprising pathways of bile regurgitation (including reversed secretory polarity of hepatocytes) and so-called ductular reaction. The latter topic has a high importance for the various roles it plays in modulating liver tissue of chronic cholestasis into biliary cirrhosis, and as the territory of hepatic progenitor cells, crucial for liver regeneration in adverse conditions and in development of liver cancer. Study of the embryology of intrahepatic bile ducts helped to clarify the strange appearance of the ducts in \"ductal plate configuration\" in several conditions, including some forms of biliary atresia with poor prognosis and all varieties of fibrocystic bile duct diseases with \"ductal plate malformation\" as the basic morphologic lesion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19642165/"}

A core group of five CE and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experts established an Internet-based, three-round Delphi consensus but did not participate in the voting process. The core group built illustrated questionnaires, including SB-CE still frames of U-I lesions from patients with documented CD. Twenty-seven other experts were asked to rate and comment on the different proposals for the ND of the most frequent SB U-I lesions. For each round, we used a 6-point rating scale (varying from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'). The consensus was reached when at least 80 % of the voting members scored the statement within the 'agree' or 'strongly agree' categories. A 100% participation rate was obtained for all the rounds.

Out of group A, 12 (25%) patients presented a positive response (both gastroesophageal reflux and typical pain during exercise). Out of group B, 6 (28.5%) patients responded positively, too. The diagnostic advantage of exertional pHmetry, compared to prolonged pHmetry, amounts to 21.7%. Exertional pHmetry, repeated on the following day, showed that occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and pain are reproducible in all patients, with occurrence at the same threshold of the first test in 11 (61.1%) out of 18 patients. Endo-esophageal electrical stimulation is employed in the diagnosis of chest pain by motility disturbances: the technique is the same one of cardiological transesophageal atrial pacing. 6 healthy subjects and 21 patients with non-cardiac chest pain negative to other esophageal investigations (7 with and 14 without gastroesophageal reflux disease) were submitted to the test. 9 (43%) out of 21 patients showed a positive response, while in 2 patients (9%) we observed manometric changes without pain, and 10 (48%) showed a negative response.

Alternative payment models (APMs) aim to realign financing to support high-value services. The 2 main components of gastroenterologic care, procedures and chronic care management, call for a range of APMs. The first step for gastroenterologists is to identify the most important conditions and opportunities to improve care and reduce waste that do not require financial support. We describe examples of delivery reforms and emerging APMs to accomplish these care improvements. A bundled payment for an episode of care, in which a provider is given a lump sum payment to cover the cost of services provided during the defined episode, can support better care for a discrete procedure such as a colonoscopy. Improved management of chronic conditions can be supported through a per-member, per-month (PMPM) payment to offer extended services and care coordination. For complex chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, in which the gastroenterologist is the principal care coordinator, the PMPM payment could be given to a gastroenterology medical home. For conditions in which the gastroenterologist acts primarily as a consultant for primary care, such as noncomplex gastroesophageal reflux or hepatitis C, a PMPM payment can support effective care coordination in a medical neighborhood delivery model. Each APM can be supplemented with a shared savings component. Gastroenterologists must engage with and be early leaders of these redesign discussions to be prepared for a time when APMs may be more prevalent and no longer voluntary.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122765/"}

Genetic variants that have the greatest effect on the management of patients with IBD involve the metabolism of thiopurines. Variation in drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes also requires attention so as to avoid drug interactions in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and PPIs. Few genotyping tests are currently used in the clinical management of patients with nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases, owing to a lack of data from clinical trials showing their effectiveness in predicting nonresponse or adverse outcomes. However, pharmacogenetics could have a beneficial role in enabling pharmacotherapy for nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases to be targeted to the individual patient.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22310916/"}

The online databases MEDLINE® (1950-2012) and EMBASE® (1980-2012) were searched for English-language articles that reported original data from clinical trials or observational studies on prognostic models in ALF patients. Studies were included if they developed a new model or modified existing prognostic models. The studies were evaluated based on an existing framework for scoring the methodological and reporting quality of prognostic models. Twenty studies were included, of which 18 reported on newly developed models, 1 on modification of the Kings College Criteria (KCC) and 1 on the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). Ten studies compared the newly developed models to previously existing models (e.g. KCC); they all reported that the new models were superior. In the 12-point methodological quality score, only one study scored full points. On the 38-point reporting score, no study scored full points. There was a general lack of reporting on missing values. In addition, none of the studies used performance measures for calibration and accuracy (e.g. Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, Brier score), and only 5 studies used the AUC as a measure of discrimination. There are many studies on prognostic models for ALF but they show methodological and reporting limitations.

Answers could be accompanied by personal remarks. The response rate was satisfactory: 75%, 70% and 100% respectively for the three groups. More than 80% of the questions were answered. Nearly all of the centers participate in a network. Two thirds of the reference centers have organized a therapeutic committee that includes private units and general hospitals.

The positive experiences that were most often described were the success of training sessions especially in relation to equal access, and becoming acquainted with other participants. Most networks did not seem to be interested in screening. For reference centers the number of participating practitioners was too low. The main difficulty was felt to be overcentralization of the public hospital. Most networks are independent and meetings take place in the evening. Most responses were in favor of parity and equal access to diagnosis and therapeutic means within the networks. This only occurred in one third of the networks and if these measures were implemented it would increase network participation and effectiveness. Two thirds of the responses were also favourable to extending therapeutic trials to networks. Public and private hepatologists have similar opinions about hepatitis networks.

However, uncertainties remain, particularly concerning the optimal diagnostic work-up and the most effective management. To address this issue, experts from 5 Italian Societies conducted a Delphi consensus process, which included a review of the current literature and voting process on 27 key statements. Recommendations and quality of evidence were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus for each statement was defined as ≥ 80 % agreement. Diagnostic Approach: The consensus supports a symptom-based diagnostic strategy for GERD, focusing on the exclusion of alarm symptoms and/or multiple risk factors for Barrett's esophagus or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) as well as non-GERD causes in cases of extra-esophageal symptoms. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended in patients with alarm features or in patients unresponsive to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In addition, the consensus recommends esophageal pH-metry or impedance-pH recording in patients with reflux-like symptoms not responding to medical treatments, in those with extra-oesophageal symptoms, prior to anti-reflux endoscopic or surgical procedures, in patients with belching disorders and to diagnose functional heartburn (FH) and reflux hypersensitivity (RH) in PPI-refractory patients. Treatment Approach: The consensus strongly supports a standard 4-8 weeks course of PPIs for patients with heartburn and regurgitation but without alarm symptoms and an 8 weeks treatment for those with erosive oesophagitis. Twice daily dose PPIs is recommended only if a concomitant Barrett oesophagus is present, in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) or when there is no response or an incomplete response to once daily dose. Bedtime histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RAs) as add-on therapy is suggested in patients with persistent nocturnal symptoms and in those with objective evidence of nocturnal acid reflux on pH monitoring despite PPI treatment, while prokinetic agents are advocated as add-on therapy in patients with concomitant symptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying. Moreover, the consensus voted for the use of potassium competitive acid blockers (P-CABs), antacids, alginate-containing formulations, neuromodulators in treating visceral hypersensitivity, complementary and alternative medicine and anti-reflux surgery in patients with refractory GERD. Finally, the consensus voted against surgical anti-reflux therapy in patients with extra-esophageal symptoms of GERD, who do not respond to PPI therapy and against the use of ensoscopic procedures [i.e., Medigus ultrasonic surgical endostapler (MUSE), radiofrequency energy application (Stretta), anti-reflux mucosectomy (ARMS)] outside clinical trials.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40450492/"}

A 16-question survey (see Survey, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCG/A14) was distributed to practicing gastroenterologists and physicians with a specific interest in GI disorders within a large metropolitan area. All physicians responded that they believed probiotics to be safe for most patients and 98% responded that probiotics have a role in treating gastrointestinal illnesses or symptoms. Currently 93% of physicians have patients taking probiotics most often for irritable bowel syndrome. Commonly used probiotics included yogurt-based products, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (Align), and VSL#3. Most surveyed physicians recommended probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because they believed that the literature supports their usage for these conditions. However, physician practice patterns did not consistently correlate with published, expert-panel-generated recommendations for evidence-based probiotic use. This study suggests most gastrointestinal disease specialists recognize a role for and have used probiotics as part of their therapeutic armamentarium; however, the effective implementation of this practice will benefit from additional supporting studies and the eventual development of clinical practice guidelines supported by the major gastroenterology societies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20216432/"}

The exposure variable was whether the treating gastroenterologist had an IBD focus (>90<sup>th</sup> percentile of IBD visits/total outpatient visits). We used adjusted regression models to evaluate associations between provider IBD focus and process measures (use of mesalamine, corticosteroid, biologic, and narcotic medications and endoscopic or radiographic imaging) and clinical outcomes (time to IBD-related hospitalization and bowel resection surgery). We tested for change in treatment patterns over time by including an interaction term for study era (2004-2012 vs 2013-2020). The study included 772 children treated by 493 providers and 2864 adults treated by 2076 providers. In children, none of the associations between provider focus and process or outcome measures were significant. In adults, care from an IBD-focused provider was associated with more use of biologics, combination therapy, and imaging and endoscopy, and less mesalamine use for Crohn's disease (P < .05 for all comparisons) but not with other process measures. Biologics were prescribed more frequently and narcotics less frequently during the later era (P < .05 for both). Hospitalization and surgery rates were not associated with IBD focus or era.

However, the road towards accepting the role of these spiral bacteria in the pathogenesis of certain diseases of the upper digestive tract was long and marked with repeated false interpretations and misunderstandings, even when--in retrospect--many times several researchers were very near to the discovery. The first observations concerning the presence of bacteria in animal/human stomachs dates from the dawn of medical microbiology, when the bacterial etiology of some other diseases (tuberculosis, cholera, dysentery, syphilis) was ascertained. In spite of many bacteriological, experimental, biochemical and therapeutic observations, the causative role of the microorganism in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer was not recognised even in the case of most elegant demonstrations. Sometimes, head-strong thinking and excessive belief in opinion leaders statements set back the bacterial research. The identification of Helicobacter pylori by Barry J. Marshall and J. Robert Warren in 1983 can not be, in any case, considered as serendipitous: without the endeavour, youthful curiosity, talent and ambition of the former and solid classical knowledge in pathology of the latter, peptic ulcer might be considered even today as an acid-related or psychosomatic disease, as it was during the past century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15977368/"}

The forbidding mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy, approximately 20% just a generation ago, has decreased precipitously in high-volume referral centers. Near zero mortality rates are now common. Morbidity and length of stay have also been reduced. Cardiac and pulmonary complications have been markedly reduced, whereas others such as pancreatic fistula still remain a problem. Modifications of the procedure have been introduced to improve long-term outcome of pancreatic cancer and to lessen digestive sequelae. Total pancreatectomy and large regional excisions did not improve results. However, 5-year survival rates of 20% are now reported by several centers for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and long-term survival rates for other periampullary tumors are approximately 40%. Pylorus-sparing procedures can be performed and may lessen postoperative sequelae.

Over the years, the definition and classification of IBS suffered several conceptual changes. The work of the Rome Committees has largely contributed to the progress in knowledge and awareness of IBS. This paper is an overview of the evolution of diagnosis and classification criteria of IBS. Background: The majority of the complaints causing presentation to the general gastroenterological centers are represented by FGID. IBS is the most frequent among them. IBS is not a uniform condition but includes an array of particular forms called subtypes. Criteria for the identification of the IBS subtypes have suffered several changes in parallel with the accumulation of scientific evidence about this disorder. Classification of IBS subtypes relies on symptoms. Summary: This is a review of the evolution of the criteria for diagnosis and classification of IBS subtypes. Starting with older names given to IBS, some changes in definition and diagnosis have been operated by each edition of the Rome criteria. These changes have led to the better identification of patients with IBS. The management of IBS depends on subtypes and should be individualized. Key Messages: IBS is the main FGID, called also DGBI. It is not a homogenous disorder but a generic name for an array of subtypes with common features but with clinical differences. The diagnosis and classification of IBS subtypes have evolved in time, in accordance with the progress of the knowledge on pathogenesis. It is important for healthcare providers to recognize the subtypes and to use a common nomenclature (that offered by the Rome Committees work).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31851972/"}

The study included 450 UGIH patients admitted to general medical services of 6 teaching hospitals. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality and complications (ie, recurrent bleeding, intensive care unit [ICU] transfer, decompensation, transfusion, reendoscopy, 30-day readmission). Efficiency was measured by hospital costs and length of stay (LOS). Of 450 patients, 40% (177) were cared for by hospitalists with no differences between groups by endoscopic diagnosis, performance of early esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), Rockall risk score, or Charlson comorbidity index. Unadjusted clinical outcomes between hospitalists and nonhospitalists were similar except for 2 outcomes: patients cared for by hospitalists were more likely to receive a transfusion (74% vs. 63%; P = 0.02) or be readmitted within 30 days (7.3% vs. 3.3%; P = 0.05). However, differences in adverse outcomes between providers were not seen after multivariable adjustments. Median LOS was similar for hospitalists and nonhospitalists (4 days; P = 0.69), but patients cared for by hospitalists had higher median costs ($7,359 vs. $6,181; P < 0.01). In multivariable analyses, LOS was similar (5.2 vs. 4.7 days; P = 0.15) and costs remained higher for the hospitalist-led teams (P < 0.03).

Of the 2127 colonoscopies, GI fellows were involved in 385 (18%), whereas 1742 (82%) were performed solely by GI attendings (attending physicians). Multivariate analysis using relative risk (RR) of regression was done. The after starting the GI fellowship period was significantly associated with an increase in ADR (RR 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.30, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and advanced adenoma detection rate (RR 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.38, <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared with the before starting the GI fellowship period. In the after starting the GI fellowship period, the polyp detection rate and ADR for colonoscopies performed by the attending physicians with the fellows were significantly higher than colonoscopies performed solely by the same attendings (58.4% vs 44.5%, <i>P</i> = 0.001, 42.0% vs 32.9%, <i>P</i> = 0.017, respectively). Starting a GI fellowship program significantly increased the polyp detection rate, ADR, and advanced ADR.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257545/"}

{"id": "21734800", "title": "Probiotics in hepatology.", "text": "The paper provides a basic review of intestinal microflora and its importance in liver diseases. The intestinal microflora has many important functions, above all to maintain the microbial barrier against established as well as potential pathogens. Furthermore, it influences the motility and perfusion of the intestinal wall, stimulates the intestinal immune system and therefore also the so-called common mucosal immune system, reducing bacterial translocation and producing vitamins. Immune homeostasis at mucosal level results from a controlled response to intestinal luminal antigens. In liver cirrhosis, there are many changes in its function, mostly an increase in bacterial overgrowth and translocation. In this review, probiotics and their indications in hepatology are generally discussed. According to recent knowledge, these preparations are indicated in clinical practice only for cases of hepatic encephalopathy. Probiotics are able to decrease the permeability of the intestinal wall, and decrease bacterial translocation and endotoxemia in animal models as well as in clinical studies, which is extremely important in the prevention of complications of liver cirrhosis and infection after liver transplantation. Probiotics could limit oxidative and inflammatory liver damage and, in some situations, improve the histological state, and thus non-alcoholic steatohepatitis could be considered as another possible indication.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21734800/"}

It is caused by the fact that its clinical picture and symptomatology are very rich. Beside characteristic symptoms such as: heartburn, eructation, gastric contents reflux, epigastric burning or dysphagia, there may appear extroesophageal symptoms (frequently as single or leading ones). It is generally though that the above symptoms result from the direct effect of gastric contents on throat and larynx and/or through vagus nerve. Direct effect of hydrochloric acid and other gastric juice components on larynx may be the cause of subglottic laryngostenosis, neoplastic transformation and development of squamous cell carcinoma. This, it may be concluded that gastroesophageal reflux disease should be in the sphere of interest of laryngologists as well as gastroenterologists.

It proved to be highly accurate and useful in the staging of gastrointestinal malignancies, as well as in characterizing the nature of subepithelial lesions and disorders of the pancreaticobiliary system. The introduction of linear echoendoscopes facilitated fine needle aspiration because, with linear scanning, it was able to trace the path of the tip of the needle during the puncture process. In addition to being very useful for tissue acquisition for diagnostic purposes, the principles behind endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration paved the way for the development of therapeutic endoscopic ultrasound. Substances could now be delivered by endoscopic ultrasound into targeted areas, an example being an endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block and neurolysis. In addition, the endoscopic ultrasound-guided puncture of fluid collections, abscesses and obstructed biliary and pancreatic ductal systems facilitated the passage of guidewires, thus allowing therapeutic drainage procedures to be performed using the Seldinger technique. This review summarizes the diagnostic capability of endoscopic ultrasound and then moves on to elaborate in detail its therapeutic capability and potential.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18956589/"}

Yet, the effectiveness of transferring and integrating EoE patients from pediatric GI (pGI) to adult GI (aGI) care has not been studied. To address this gap, we assessed loss to follow-up, duration from the last pGI to the first aGI encounters (clinic visit and EGD), and its impact on clinical course and medication non-adherence in EoE patients. We identified 58 EoE patients who initially received pGI care and were transferred to aGI between 2017 and 2023 within our institution's shared electronic medical record environment. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, survival analysis, Cox regression models, and paired comparisons. Loss to follow-up was 16%. The median duration from the last pGI clinic visit to the first aGI clinic visit was 299 days, and that for the last pGI EGD to the first aGI EGD was 730 days. A significantly higher odds of heartburn (McNemar P-value = 0.01) and higher medication non-adherence rates (7% vs. 26%) were noted in 49 patients who established care with the aGI. The endoscopic and histologic severity remained unchanged. In EoE patients, transferring from pGI to aGI care is associated with loss of follow-up, deterioration of symptoms, and medication non-adherence. There is a critical need to develop optimized protocols to ensure a seamless transfer of care for EoE patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40036386/"}

The indices assessed included AIP, TyG, triacylglycerol glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC), the triacylglycerol glucose-waist-to-height ratio (TyG-WHtR), and the triacylglycerol glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI). We used logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses to examine the associations between these indices and the incidence of digestive diseases. A total of 4,453 participants were included in our analysis, 53.3% of whom were female, with an average age of 60 years. The incidence of digestive diseases in middle-aged and older adults was 6.18%. Compared with those in the lowest tertile group, the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for digestive diseases in the highest tertile for AIP, TyG, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR, and TyG-BMI were 1.452 (1.07-1.972), 1.193 (0.873-1.631), 1.349 (1.044-1.743), 1.5 (1.089-2.068), and 1.312 (0.956-1.799), respectively.

Treatment costs are the most important variable for optimizing success when facing scarce human resources, increasing material- and infrastructure costs in general, as well as low revenue flexibility due to flat rates per case in Germany, the so-called Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG). University hospitals treat many patients with particularly serious illnesses. Therefore, their share of complex and expensive treatments, such as liver cirrhosis, is significantly higher. The resulting costs are not adequately reflected in the DRG flat rate per case, which is based on an average calculation across all hospitals, which increases this economic pressure. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to review cost and revenue structures of the management of varices in patients with cirrhosis at a university center with a focus on hepatology. For this monocentric study, the data of 851 patients, treated at the Gastroenterology Department of a University Hospital between 2016 and 2020, were evaluated retrospectively and anonymously. Medical services (e.g., endoscopy, radiology, laboratory diagnostics) were analyzed within the framework of activity-based-costing. As part of the cost unit accounting, the individual steps of the treatment pathways of the 851 patients were monetarily evaluated with corresponding applicable service catalogs and compared with the revenue shares of the cost center and cost element matrix of the German (G-) DRG system. This study examines whether university-based high-performance medicine is efficient and cost-covering within the framework of the G-DRG system. We demonstrate a dramatic underfunding of the management of varicose veins in cirrhosis in our university center. It is therefore generally questionable whether and to what extent an adequate care for this patient collective is reflected in the G-DRG system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38616470/"}

The use of EUS guidance allows the therapeutic area to be targeting more precisely, with a possible clinical benefit and less morbidity. Nevertheless, the risks persist and must be taken into consideration. This review gives an overview of the complications observed with the most established procedures of therapeutic EUS. The PubMed and Embase databases were used to search English language articles on interventional EUS. The studies considered for inclusion were those reporting on complications of EUS-guided celiac plexus block (EUS-CPB), EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN), drainage of fluid pancreatic and pelvic collections, and EUS-guided biliary and pancreatic drainage (EUS-BD and EUS-PD). Variations in methodology and design in most studies made a thorough statistical analysis difficult. Instead, a frequency analysis of complications and a critical discussion were performed. Although EUS-guided celiac plexus injection causes mainly mild and transient complications, growing experience shows that EUS-CPN is not as benign a procedure as previously thought. Most of the major complications have been observed in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The findings show that EUS-guided drainage of fluid collections is a safe procedure. Complications occur more often after the drainage of pancreatic abscesses and necrosis. Although the heterogeneity of studies dealing with pancreatobiliary drainage makes the evaluation of risks after these procedures difficult, complications after EUS-BD and EUS-PD are relatively frequent and can be severe. The technical complexity and the lack of specifically designed devices may account for their complication rates.

The surveys aim to identify points of improvement to inform and educate ERCPists about current evidence-based practice. Two anonymous surveys were conducted among Dutch gastroenterologists in 2013 (n = 408) and 2020 (n = 575) for longitudinal views and attitudes pertaining to post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis and recognition of post-ERCP pancreatitis risk factors. In 2013 and 2020, respectively, 121 and 109 ERCPists responded. In the 2013 survey, 98% of them utilized NSAID prophylaxis and 62% pancreatic duct stent prophylaxis in specific cases. In the 2020 survey, the use of NSAIDs (100%), pancreatic duct stents (78%), and intensive intravenous hydration (33%) increased among ERCPists. NSAID prophylaxis was the preferred prophylactic measure for all risk factors in the 2020 survey, except for ampullectomy, pancreatic duct contrast injection, and pancreatic duct cannulation, for which NSAID prophylaxis and pancreatic duct stent combined was equally favored or preferred. Rectal NSAIDs are the most applied post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis in the Netherlands, followed by pancreatic duct stents and intensive intravenous hydration.

These guidelines differ on several aspects, which create a conundrum for clinicians. The aim of this study was to evaluate preferences and practice patterns in the management of incidental PCs in light of these societal recommendations. An electronic survey distributed to members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE). Main outcomes included practice setting (academic vs. community), preferences for evaluation, management, and surveillance strategies for PCs. A total of 172 subjects completed the study (52% academic-based endoscopists). Eighty-six (50%) and 138 (80%) of the participants responded that they would recommend EUS surveillance of incidental PCs measuring less than 2 cm and 3 cm, respectively. Nearly half of the endosonographers (42.5% community and 44% academic; p = 1.0) would routinely perform FNA on PCs without any high-risk features. More academic-based endoscopists (57% academic vs. 32% community; p = 0.001) would continue incidental PC surveillance indefinitely. There is significant variability in the approach of incidental PCs among clinicians, with practice patterns often diverging from the various GI societal guideline recommendations. Most survey respondents would routinely recommend EUS-FNA and indefinite surveillance for incidental PCs without high-risk features. The indiscriminate use of EUS-FNA and indefinite surveillance of all incidental PCs is not cost-effective, exposes the patient to unnecessary testing, and can further perpetuate diagnostic uncertainty. Well-designed studies are needed to improve our diagnostic and risk stratification accuracy in order to formulate a consensus on the management of these incidental PCs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30426298/"}

In contrast with the heuristic techniques for reasoning with uncertainty employed in many rule-based expert systems, the theory of belief networks is mathematically sound, based on techniques from probability theory. It therefore seems attractive to convert existing rule-based expert systems into belief networks. In this article we discuss the design of a belief network reformulation of the diagnostic rule-based expert system HEPAR. For the purpose of this experiment we have studied several typical pieces of medical knowledge represented in the HEPAR system. It turned out that, due to the differences in the type of knowledge represented and in the formalism used to represent uncertainty, much of the medical knowledge required for building the belief network concerned could not be extracted from HEPAR. As a consequence, significant additional knowledge acquisition was required. However, the objects and attributes defined in the HEPAR system, as well as the conditions in production rules mentioning these objects and attributes, were useful for guiding the selection of the statistical variables for building the belief network. The mapping of objects and attributes in HEPAR to statistical variables is discussed in detail.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8289533/"}

Based on these measurements, a classification system for disorders of anorectal function is proposed. Twenty-nine working group members (clinicians/academics in the field of gastroenterology, coloproctology, and gastrointestinal physiology) were invited to six face-to-face and three remote meetings to derive consensus between 2014 and 2018. The IAPWG protocol for the performance of anorectal function testing recommends a standardized sequence of maneuvers to test rectoanal reflexes, anal tone and contractility, rectoanal coordination, and rectal sensation. Major findings not seen in healthy controls defined by the classification are as follows: rectoanal areflexia, anal hypotension and hypocontractility, rectal hyposensitivity, and hypersensitivity. Minor and inconclusive findings that can be present in health and require additional information prior to diagnosis include anal hypertension and dyssynergia. This framework introduces the IAPWG protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function based on objective physiological measurement. The use of a common language to describe results of diagnostic tests, standard operating procedures, and a consensus classification system is designed to bring much-needed standardization to these techniques.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31407463/"}

FNA cyst drainage was successful in resolving all 4 pancreatic pseudocysts. EUS prompted a surgical procedure in 13 cases (25%), ERCP in 5 cases (10%), and repeat EUS in 5 cases (10%). EUS led to a new diagnosis in 34 of 43 (79%) patients and prompted further intervention in 24 of 51 (47%) procedures. In this large cohort study, we found that EUS and EUS-guided interventions assist in diagnosing and altering clinical management in pediatric patients and should be considered in cases with vexing pancreaticobiliary disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26720768/"}

Over the past decades, the number of endoscopies has increased rapidly. As specialized teams of pediatric gastroenterologists, pediatric intensive care physicians and pediatric endoscopy nurses are available in many medical centers, safe and effective procedures have been established. Therefore, diagnostic endoscopies in children are routine clinical procedures. The most frequently performed endoscopies are esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP). Therapeutic interventions include variceal bleeding ligation, foreign body retrieval and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. New advances in pediatric endoscopy have led to more sensitive diagnostics of common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease; likewise, new diseases, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, have been brought to light.Upcoming modalities, such as capsule endoscopy, double balloon enteroscopy and narrow band imaging, are being established and may contribute to diagnostics in pediatric gastroenterology in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23885793/"}

The paucity of medical treatment underscores the importance of examining every element of the management approach. Data exist supporting an increased prevalence of abuse among individuals with IBS. Importantly, the pathophysiology underlying the link between abuse and IBS is increasingly understood. Treatment recommendations by opinion leaders support an abuse inquiry. However, many clinicians view abuse inquiry as an ethical dilemma. Canadian gastroenterologists were surveyed to determine current practice patterns and to identify barriers to inquiry. Barriers cited by clinicians were explored within an ethical context. Abuse inquiry is not universally practised in Canada. Fifty-four per cent of the membership of Canadian Association of Gastroenterologists responded to the survey. They reported inquiring into abuse histories in approximately 50% of patients with IBS. The frequency of inquiry declined when male patients were considered. The primal barriers cited were time constraints (25%), personal comfort with abuse issues (25%) and lack of resources for addressing the abuse (33%). Importantly, only a minority (10%), cited abuse history as irrelevant to the management of the patient. Physicians identify significant barriers to pursuing an inquiry into abuse. However, a minority cited 'clinical irrelevance' as a primal barrier, the implicit statement being that the abuse history has clinical relevance. This view is consistent with opinion leaders and published treatment recommendations. Therefore, by not inquiring into the abuse history, physicians are not fulfilling their ethical responsibility to the patient. Physicians need to resolve their barriers to inquiry. Furthermore, they need to familiarize themselves with treatment recommendations and include this review in their consultation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12464974/"}

The present article aims to review the current literature about EUS indication, accuracy and safety in pediatric age. Electronic literature searches were conducted using Pubmed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the word pediatric endoscopic ultrasound, pediatric pancreaticobiliary AND/OR EUS, pediatric EUS technique. Main patients and procedures characteristics were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the indication of EUS. Secondary endpoints were the accuracy of the technique and the incidence of complications. Data were extracted from 19 articles. A total of 571 patients were investigated, with a median age of 12,7 years. A total of 634 EUS procedures were performed. The majority of EUS procedures investigated the pancreaticobiliary tract (77,7%). Most studies showed a high positive impact on management with a median value of 81,7%. No major complications were reported. Five studies reported minor complications with a median value of 2%. EUS is safe and has a significant role in the diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary and GI diseases even in children, with a high therapeutic success.

This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37204227/"}

Since 1990, United States News and World Report (USNWR) has published annual rankings of hospitals and subspecialty divisions. It remains unknown if social media presence is associated with the USNWR gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) surgery divisional rankings, or how changes in online presence over time affects division ranking. The objective of this study was to determine if social media presence is associated with USNWR gastroenterology and GI surgery divisional rankings and to ascertain how changes in online presence over time affect division rankings. Social media presence among the top 30 institutions listed in the 2014 USNWR gastroenterology and GI surgery divisional rankings were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients and multivariate analysis, controlling for covariates. Linear and logistic regression using data from 2014 and 2016 USNWR rankings were then used to assess the association between institutional ranking or reputation score with any potential changes in numbers of followers over time. Sensitivity analysis was performed by assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to determine the follower threshold associated with improved or maintained ranking, which was done by dichotomizing changes in followers at values between the 7000 and 12,000 follower mark. Twitter follower count was an independent predictor of divisional ranking (β=.00004; P<.001) and reputation score (β=-.00002; P=.03) in 2014. Academic affiliation also independently predicted USNWR division ranking (β=5.3; P=.04) and reputation score (β=-7.3; P=.03). Between 2014 and 2016, Twitter followers remained significantly associated with improved or maintained rankings (OR 14.63; 95% CI 1.08-197.81; P=.04). On sensitivity analysis, an 8000 person increase in Twitter followers significantly predicted improved or maintained rankings compared to other cutoffs. Institutional social media presence is independently associated with USNWR divisional ranking and reputation score. Improvement in social media following was also independently associated with improved or maintained divisional ranking and reputation score, with a threshold of 8000 additional followers as the best predictor of improved or stable ranking.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31493321/"}

Objective, validated MRI-based scores have been developed to assess the activity of Crohn's disease; these indices are based on the extent and severity of intestinal inflammation, postoperative recurrence and perianal disease. MRI is accurate, safe, reproducible and can allow repeated evaluations of patients without radiation exposure. Evidence that MRI might be valuable in the therapeutic monitoring of patients with Crohn's disease is increasing and, in combination with endoscopy and surgical history, this imaging technique could enable clinicians to assess Crohn's-disease-related intestinal damage.

The aims were to characterize the existing pediatric population undergoing GI procedures at our institution and assess specific risk factors associated with emergent versus nonemergent care. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 2110 patients undergoing GI procedures from January 2012 to December 2014. Emergent procedures were performed on an urgent inpatient basis. All other procedures were considered nonemergent. Health disparity factors analyzed included age, sex, insurance type, race, and language. Logistic regression analysis identified the odds of undergoing emergent procedures for each factor. Most study patients were boys (58.2%), primarily insured by Medicaid (63.8%), white (44.0%), and spoke English (91.7%). Ten percent of all patients had an emergent procedure. Logistic regression analysis showed significant odds ratios (P value) for ages 18 years older (2.16, 0.003), females (0.62, 0.001), commercial insurance users (0.49, <0.0001), African Americans (1.94, <0.0001), and other race (1.72, 0.039). Health disparities in age, sex, insurance, and race appear to exist in this pediatric population undergoing GI procedures.

It was first observed to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations have been increasingly recognized. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diarrhea is the most common GI manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 and can present without or without respiratory symptoms. Patients with GI symptoms have been associated with longer duration of illness and may be associated with more severe illness. Mechanism of diarrhea is thought to be related to direct viral cytotoxicity occurring when the SARS-CoV-3 enters GI cells via the ACE-2 receptor. Inflammatory response and cytokine release likely contributes to symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 can cause hepatic injury. Studies have shown mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes. The pattern of liver abnormalities can be hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed. Patients with severe infection have significantly higher rates of liver injury and worse outcomes. Proposed mechanisms for injury include immune mediated systemic inflammatory response, direct cytotoxicity from viral replication and hypoxia-reperfusion dysfunction. Recent data suggests that GI and hepatic injury may be under-recognized manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with diarrhea and liver disease may have a worse prognosis. The rapidly evolving literature continues to reveal a growing body of information which enables updated guidance for management.

Cross-sectional study in 10 pediatric GI outpatient clinics (private and public) in five countries of Latin America (El Salvador, México, Colombia, Panamá, and Nicaragua). Parents of patients 1 month 4 years of age from outpatient clinics complete/d a diagnostic questionnaire for DGBIs per Rome IV criteria (QPGS-IV, Spanish version). We conducted descriptive analysis, two-sample t-tests and chi-square tests, univariate analyses, and logistic regression to evaluate risk factors. We collected data from 783 children. In total, 34.5% had a DGBI. Overall, functional constipation (FC) was the most common diagnosis (23.4%) in children of all ages (infants, 16.1%, 1-4-years-old, 32.7%). In infants, the second most common DGBI was regurgitation (6.6%) and in 1-4-years-old and cyclic vomiting syndrome (4.1%). The diagnosis of a DGBI was significantly associated with a family history of DGBIs (odds ratio [OR] 2.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-5.57, p = 0.0001). Patients who identified as black (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.28-3.92, p = 0.0021) or mixed race (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.25-2.48, p = 0.0006) were also significantly associated with a higher likelihood of DGBIs. DGBIs are a common diagnosis in pediatric GI clinics of Latin America. Overall, FC was the most common DGBI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39233517/"}

This study outlines methodology adopted by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Guideline Development Group (GDG) for updating IBD colorectal surveillance guidelines. The 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the GRADE handbook, was employed. Thematic questions were formulated using either the 'patient, intervention, comparison and outcome' format or the 'current state of knowledge, area of interest, potential impact and suggestions from experts in the field' format. The evidence review process included systematic reviews assessed using appropriate appraisal tools. An extensive list of potential outcomes was compiled from literature and expert consultations and then ranked by GDG members. The top outcomes were identified for evidence synthesis in three key areas: utility of surveillance in IBD, quality of bowel preparation and use of advanced imaging techniques in colonoscopy for IBD. Risk thresholding exercises determined specific risk levels for different surveillance strategies and intervals. This approach enabled the GDG to establish precise thresholds for interventions based on relative and absolute risk assessments, directly informing the stratification of surveillance recommendations. Significance of effect sizes (small, moderate, large) will guide the final GRADE assessment of the evidence. Ethics approval is not applicable. By integrating clinical expertise, patient experiences and innovative methodologies like risk thresholding, we aim to deliver actionable recommendations for IBD colorectal surveillance. This protocol, complementing the main guidelines, offers GDGs, clinical trialists and practitioners a framework to inform future research and enhance patient care and outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39615897/"}

Pediatric subspecialists are considered essential to these programs. This study evaluated the state of these programs in 2017 by surveying their size, composition, prevalence, and the number of patients that they serve. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Aerodigestive Special Interest Group leadership distributed an 11-question survey to the Pediatric Gastroenterology International Listserv. The mean time of the programs' existence, number of half-day clinics, number of procedure days, number of patients evaluated, and the lead primary specialty were evaluated. Thirty-four programs responded. Twenty-five were based in academic centers. Thirty-one programs were located across the United States. The average time of program existence was 5.3 years (standard deviation [SD] = 4.3; range 1-17 years). Approximately 64.7% were started in the past 5 years. Twelve programs were based in the division of gastroenterology. The average number of gastroenterologists serving aerodigestive programs was 2 (SD = 1.1). The mean number of half-day clinic sessions and procedure days were 2.8 (SD = 2.9) and 2.6 (SD = 2), respectively. New and follow-up visits per year in each program averaged 184 (SD = 168; range 10-750). Pediatric aerodigestive programs are prevalent, proliferating, and serve a large number of complex patients across North America and the world. This survey demonstrated that programs are predominantly based in academic settings. The number of patients cared for by aerodigestive centers varies widely depending on size and age of program.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022094/"}

These methods, collectively known as omics, permit the determination of thousands of molecules (variations within genes, RNAs, proteins, metabolites) within a tissue, cell, or biological fluid. The use of these methods is very demanding in terms of the design of the study, acquisition, storage, analysis, and interpretation of the data. When carried out properly, these studies can reveal new etiological pathways, help to identify patients at risk for disease, and predict the response to specific treatments.
