The rest of the gastrointestinal tract was unremarkable. The mouth, pharynx, glottis, larynx, trachea and bronchi were all structurally normal with no obstructive material. Thus, there was no evidence of airway compromise to suggest that the bezoar had mechanically contributed to death. Rather, elution of the drug had resulted in lethal blood levels. The color of the pharmacobezoar derived from the green color of certain propranolol tablets. Death was therefore attributed to propranolol toxicity with an associated finding of a massive gastro-esophageal pharmacobezoar.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34324154/"}

This study aims to analyze the incidence, management, and outcome of gastro- or duodenojejunostomy leaks after pancreatoduodenectomy based on a single center experience from 2004 to 2020 with a narrative literature review. Of a total of 1494 pancreatoduodenectomies, eight patients with gastrojejunostomy (n=1) or duodenojejunostomy (n=7) leak were identified from the institutional pancreatic database. All leaks were treated operatively. In two patients dismantling of the duodenojejunostomy, distal gastrectomy, and closure of the pyloric and jejunal side, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy ultimately had to be performed after an unsuccessful attempt of gastrojejunostomy and suture of the duodenojejunostomy, respectively. The literature search revealed three more studies specifically addressing this complication after pancreatoduodenectomy (36 patients of a total of 4739 pancreatoduodenectomies). Based on an analysis of the current study and the literature review, the overall incidence of gastro- or duodenojejunostomy leaks after pancreatoduodenectomy was 0.71 % (44/6233 pancreatoduodenectomies). The occurrence of a gastro- or duodenojejunostomy leak was associated with a concomitant postoperative pancreatic fistula in 50 % of the cases, an increased length of hospital stay, and a mortality rate of 15.9 %. Surgical treatment was performed in 84 % of the cases. Gastro- or duodenojejunostomy leak is a rare complication after pancreatoduodenectomy. Prompt diagnosis and early repair is important. In most cases, a surgical intervention is necessary for a good outcome. Under salvage conditions, a bailout strategy may be to temporarily dismantle the gastro- or duodenojejunal anastomosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34131862/"}

These Gastro Retentive Systems have been quite investigated because they can improve the in-vivo performance of many drugs. This paper summarizes current approaches in the research and development of gastro retentive dosage forms from recent literature. Apart from the numerous mechanisms of action involved, a short review of different key parameters is proposed, taking into account the stomach physiology. Most of the current technologies published, patented or marketed are presented. Promising drugs to develop in the near future are mentioned, and the importance of such systems in fixed Dose Combinations is also discussed. The importance of food effect is mentioned, and the impact of the multiple unit systems versus monolithic approach is discussed, especially regarding the dose intake. In conclusion, numerous mechanisms like floating, sinking, effervescence, swelling, bioadhesion, magnetic, etc. have been proposed over the years. While most of the proposed systems show promising dissolution profiles and in-vitro retention, only few of them have also shown success in-vivo. Currently, the polymeric swelling monolithic systems are the most prominent marketed forms. The possibility to combine different mechanisms in order to ensure true gastric retention even in the fasted state should be further investigated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21671821/"}

The reflux is caused by impairment of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Over the past century gastro-esophageal reflux has become the principal gastrointestinal condition of our time. The proton pump inhibitor class of drugs is effective in ameliorating the symptoms of reflux. The cost of investigation of patients in Europe is €100 billion per annum. The cost in days lost from work is €100 billion per annum in Europe. The global cost is 3 times this amount. The proposed device for treating gastro-esophageal reflux is a biodegradable valve that is placed non surgically in the esophago-gastric junction to prevent reflux from the stomach to the esophagus. 50 simulator studies were performed with the patented device to elucidate the most consistent method of insertion and fixation in a human like simulator. The simulator was designed to replicate the normal human gastro-esophageal anatomy and characteristics. Four animal insertions were performed under ethical regulation at Amsterdam Medical Centre, Netherlands. Three cadaveric experiments were performed at Hackensack University Hospital, New Jersey, USA, to verify the positive outcomes of the simulator studies. Successful outcomes of simulator studies and cadaveric experiments allowed the design freeze of a NoReflux device for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38116630/"}

This study aimed to develop a finite element-based model from a unique human cadaver GEJ data reconstructed from an ultramill imaging setup. A pipeline was developed to generate a mesh from an input stack of images. The anatomy of the model was compared to an existing Visible Human finite element GEJ model. Biomechanical simulations were also performed on both models using loading steps of differing levels of calcium to model different levels of contraction. It was found that the ultramill GEJ model is shorter than the Visible Human model (31 vs 48.3 mm), as well as producing lower pressure (1.35 vs 4.36 kPa). The model will be used to investigate detailed pressure development in the GEJ during swallowing under realistic loading conditions.

A multitude of shell polymers were tested with the aim to identify a material that limits the drug release to less than 10% after two hours at a pH of 1 to comply with the European Pharmacopoeia regarding gastro-resistant formulations. In parallel, the core-shell structure of the particles was determined with confocal imaging and their surface morphology with SEM imaging. While the structural analysis revealed significant differences between the different formulations, all investigated shell polymers exhibited a burst drug release followed by a slow release for the remainder of a two hour period. Ultimately, the shell copolymer poly(methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate), in particular for a monomer ratio 1/2, resulted consistently in darunavir release below the 10% upper limit compared to the other tested polymers, where such low releases were inaccessible.

Leaks reported in 1 to 7% of cases are difficult to manage after SG. Leaks can be graded into acute (within 7 days), early (within 1-6 weeks), late (after 6 weeks) and chronic (after 12 weeks) (Asian Journal of Endoscopic Surgery 7:314-6, 2014). Oesophageal stents can be used for acute leaks. Gastro-colic fistula (GCF) is a rare complication following a chronic leak after SG (Asian Journal of Endoscopic Surgery 7:314-6, 2014). We would like to share our experience of a rare and challenging case of GCF after SG leak. Prospectively collected data in our tertiary bariatric centre was retrieved. A 31-year-old female with body mass index (BMI) of 46.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with history of bipolar disorder had an uneventful SG. On sixth day post-operatively, she presented to other unit with lower chest pain and had a computed tomography (CT) scan which was normal. At 6-week follow-up (FU), she had lost 44% excess weight loss (EWL) and complained of epigastric pain and reflux. CT scan showed collection with active leak in SG. This was successfully treated with partially covered stent placement. Imaging confirmed control of leak. Ten days later, endoscopic removal of the stent was successfully done. At 6-month FU, she had 86% EWL. At 1-year FU, she had 102% EWL with complain of reflux despite being on proton pump inhibitor (PPI). There were no nutritional parameter concerns. There was no history of diarrhoea. CT scan showed GCF (Image 1). OGD confirmed the findings and the site was tattooed. Colonoscopy was equivocal, and no clear fistula visualised which would explain the lack of diarrhoea. Operation was planned with colorectal team after multidisciplinary team discussion. At laparoscopy (Video 1), GCF was identified between SG and splenic flexure at the site of the previous leak. Adhesinolysis was done with a combination of blunt, sharp and energy device and the gastric sleeve and the splenic flexure were mobilised. The fistulous tract was isolated, divided and excised with Endo GIA tristapler taking partial lumen of colon. Intra-operative oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) showed no leak and colonoscopy showed no leak or narrowing of the lumen and showed healthy tissue. Post-operative recovery was uneventful. She was closely monitored by the bariatric dietician throughout the journey. At 6-month FU, she regained weight under close supervision, had EWL of 88% and is doing well. SG leaks can add long-term morbidity. Stent can be used successfully to treat SG leak if used judiciously. There should be low threshold for investigating patients with EWL of > 100% for anatomical complications like stricture, fistula or kink in the gastric sleeve. We wanted to make the bariatric fraternity aware of a rare late (> 12 weeks) complication of gastro-colic fistula after successfully treated SG leak. Limited literature is published about this rare complication and its management which ranges from conservative management to stent placement to surgical intervention (Asian Journal of Endoscopic Surgery 7:314-6, 2014; Clinical Case Reports 6:1342-1346, 2008; Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases 6:308-12, 2010).

In 54% of the reflux events detected by impedance without a common cavity, a possible common cavity was obscured by either contractile activity or artefacts of various origin. The types of reflux associated with a common cavity (liquid 60%, mixed 31%, gas 9%) and without a common cavity (liquid 59%, mixed 29%, gas 12%) did not differ, or did the acidity of the reflux episodes (with common cavity: acid 67%; without common cavity: acid 58%). The common cavity is a specific but not a sensitive marker of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Furthermore, common cavities are not specific for a particular type of reflux.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17109688/"}

Smoking a cigarette invariably caused a fall in sphincter pressure, and pH measurements showed an increased tendency for reflux to occur while smoking.

Manometric and radioisotopic studies have been employed to construct such a physiological model. More recently, ad hoc designed studies have led to the identification of other factors that contribute to the regulation of gastric emptying. Antral, intestinal and pyloric motility, fundic tone and antropyloroduodenal coordination appear to be all involved in the regulation of gastric emptying. Nowadays, no single technique can simultaneously measure those parameters. Gastroduodenal manometry can be regarded as the most advanced technique, in studying gastrointestinal motility. Nevertheless, fundic tone, which is an important determinant of gastric emptying, cannot be concurrently recorded.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2067668/"}

Since these histological findings are frequently observed even among those who are H pylori-negative, the causative factors for such histologic events at the human gastro-oesophageal junction remain obscure. A series of recent studies have demonstrated that a high level of salivary nitrite is sustained over several hours after the ingestion of a high nitrate meal, and that the nitrite in swallowed saliva is rapidly converted to nitric oxide by an acid catalyzed chemical reaction at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Eventually, a substantial amount of nitric oxide diffuses from the lumen into the adjacent tissue. Therefore, the human gastro-oesophageal junction is likely to be a region of high nitrosative stress. Considering the life-time exposure of the gastro-oesophageal junction to cytotoxic levels of nitric oxide, this may account for the high prevalence of inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, and subsequent development of neoplasia at this site. Although gastric acid, pepsin, and bile acid have been intensively investigated as a cause of adenocarcinoma at the gastro-oesophageal junction and the distal esophagus, nitric oxide and the related nitrosative stress should also be examined.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17007040/"}

A series of oesophageal function tests were performed, starting 90 minutes after oral intake of ranitidine or placebo. Gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure was measured using a perfused catheter system and a continuous pull-through technique. No changes in sphincter pressure could be demonstrated. Peristaltic amplitude in the body of the oesophagus as well as the duration and velocity of the peristalsis were measured after wet swallows (bolus 5 ml of water). We found no changes in these variables. Intragastric pH was measured and was higher after ranitidine than after placebo (p less than 0.005). Plasma ranitidine concentration did not correlate with intragastric pH. No effect of ranitidine could be demonstrated on the results of a standard acid clearing test.

The equilibrium constant of this colloidal adduct [DAB•SBP]adduct was KeqA = ∝, behaving as the most stable and toxic species. At higher protein concentration (Phase C) it formed conjugate [DAB×SBPgross]conjugate, with KeqC = 3.23×10-2 mg/mL, implicating a moderately strong adsorption.

To investigate whether swallowing of air leads to an increase in size of the intragastric air bubble and to gastro-oesophageal reflux. Multichannel intraluminal impedance measurement was used to quantify the incidence of swallowing of air in 20 healthy volunteers before and after a meal. Radiography was used to measure the size of the intragastric air bubble. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was assessed by concurrent impedance and pH measurement. The rate of air swallowing was correlated to the size of the intragastric air bubble postprandially and to the rate of gaseous gastro-oesophageal reflux. The number of air swallows and the size of the intragastric air bubble did not correlate with the number of liquid acid and non-acid reflux episodes.

The severity of esophageal symptoms and mucosal damage is related to two key factors, (i) the acidity of the refluxate, which depends primarily on the gastric secretory output and its distribution within the stomach, and (ii) the frequency and duration of reflux events which depends on the efficacy of the reflux barrier at the gastro-esophageal junction and the esophageal clearance function. The concept of the acid pocket is an attempt to bring these two factors into a unified patho-mechanism.The acid pocket describes an area of unbuffered, highly acidic, gastric secretion in the proximal stomach adjacent to the esophago-gastric junction (GEJ) which forms in the postprandial period and is the source of acid refluxate into the esophagus. It is observed both in healthy individuals as well as in reflux patients. However, the presence of a hiatus hernia and/or a weak lower esophageal sphincter in patients allows the acid pocket to encroach on the gastro-esophageal junction. This results in very high acid exposure of the squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus, leading to mucosal damage and symptoms. Recently, the acid pocket has been proposed as a target for pharmacological and surgical therapies of GERD. Proton pump inhibitors and related medications reduce its acidity; whereas, alginate preparations, prokinetics, and fundoplication displace it away from the gastro-esophageal junction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30304750/"}

The purpose of this manuscript is an overview on the different pathophysiologic components of GERD, their influence as well as a certain weighing of their involvement in the disease. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) represents together with the muscles and ligamentous structures of the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus the antireflux barrier between esophagus and stomach. The crucial factor in GERD is an increased amount of gastric contents refluxing into the esophagus above the physiologic level. This creates pathologic esophageal acid exposure (EAE) to the mucosa, which may lead to symptoms and damage. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are anatomical components such as LES and diaphragm, and functional components such as LES-incompetence, transient LES relaxations, impaired esophageal motility, gastroduodenal dysfunctions and alterations of the refluxate such as duodeno-gastro-esophageal reflux. The quantitative assessment of these components has been reported in a number of studies demonstrating the importance of LES-incompetence (incidence 80 %) and the role of hiatal hernia (incidence 80 %) in the severity of GERD indicated by excessive esophageal acid exposure and visible damage of the esophageal mucosa. All known pathophysiologic components of GERD can be investigated currently by diagnostic assessment, detecting a LES-incompetence or an increase in transient relaxations, detecting a hiatal hernia with increasing size, detecting increasing exposure to gastric contents in addition to other possible functional associated disorders such as an insufficient esophageal motility and or a delayed gastric emptying, which all can aggravate the disease and the patient's status.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34749847/"}

To describe patterns of gastritis in patients with symptomatic GORD. In 150 patients (126 normally located Z-line, 24 Barrett's oesophagus) with symptoms of GORD, biopsies were taken of the GOJ, corpus, and antrum. Inflammation was assessed using the updated Sydney System. For the 126 patients with a normally located Z-line, biopsies of the GOJ revealed cardiac mucosa in 96, fundic mucosa in 29, and squamous mucosa in one. Inflammation in glandular mucosa at the GOJ was present in 99/125 specimens (79%), including 87/96 (91%) with cardiac mucosa and 12/29 (41%) with fundic mucosa. Inflammation in fundic mucosa was closely related to H pylori and active inflammation was only seen in its presence. Inflammation in cardiac mucosa was less closely linked to H pylori. When H pylori was present in cardiac mucosa (28/96, 29%) active inflammation was usually present (25/28, 89%). However, active inflammation was also found in 34/68 (50%) cardiac mucosa specimens without H pylori. Overall, 28/87 (32%) biopsies with carditis were colonised with H pylori and 59/87 (68%) were not. In H pylori colonised patients, inflammation was seen throughout the stomach, while in non-colonised patients, it was confined to cardiac mucosa. Patients with symptomatic GORD had a high prevalence of carditis. This was of two types, H pylori associated and unassociated. Except on Giemsa staining, the two were morphologically identical, suggesting mediation by a similar immunological mechanism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10562575/"}

The gastric vascular structures were more sensitive to injury with the progression of liver disease than the glandular cells, with marked submucosal edema and thickening of submucosal and subserosal vessels. By transmission electron microscopy, the mucosal microvessels had thickened basement membrane and conspicuous endothelial cells with granular cytoplasm thrown into numerous intraluminal microprojections and with increased number and size of pinocytotic vesicles. When propranolol was administered orally as 20 mg/kg daily doses for two weeks at 6, 10, 14 and 18 weeks p.i., a striking regression of gastro vascular and micro-vascular changes has been observed, particularly with early drug therapy. Based on the present study, it can be concluded that \"structural autoregulation\" of gastric vasculature to the emerging portal hypertension in chronic murine schistosomiasis mansoni, is a dynamic process that could be reversed by propranolol therapy.

This anatomical configuration abolishes normal antireflux mechanisms and places the acid-excreting stomach subject to biliary reflux, moreover, in an adjacent position to the esophagus within the negative-pressure environment of the thorax. Between 1995 and 2002, 27 patients with high-grade neoplasia-as early Barrett's carcinoma-or non-dilatable peptic stricture underwent limited surgical resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction. In 11 of these cases, the reconstruction was performed with gastro-jejuno-duodenal interposition. The long-term functional results of this specially adapted form of interposition reconstruction have been evaluated. The postoperative follow-up period ranged between 24 and 95 months (mean 68 months). Nine patients (9/11=81.8%) have agreed to undergo endoscopy, radiographic contrast-swallow examination, and 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH and bilirubin monitoring. Three out of nine patients (3/9=33%) demonstrated abnormal levels of esophageal acid exposure during the 24-h study period, whilst none had any evidence of bilirubin exposure in the esophageal remnant. Endoscopy revealed that three patients had reflux esophagitis in the remnant esophagus: Los Angeles A=2, C=1. No stomal or jejunal ulceration at the gastro-jejunal anastomosis could be observed. Histopathologic assessment of the squamous epithelial biopsies demonstrated microscopic evidence of inflammation: minor in two cases, moderate in one and major in one case; however, none of them had evidence of columnar metaplasia in the esophageal remnant at a median of 68 months after surgery. The majority of the patients have been doing well since the operation: 8/9 (88%)=Visick I-II.

In alcoholic rats the sensitivity of the antrum to acetylcholine was fourfold less than that of control specimens. It is concluded that, in the rat, moderate doses of ethanol given chronically impair both spontaneous and tonic contractility of the stomach and duodenal muscle without affecting ileal contraction.

Analyses using Northern blot and RT-PCR revealed that HGF mRNA was expressed only in mesenchymes but not in epithelia of the gastro-intestinal tract while expression of c-met (HGF receptor) gene was observed in both tissues.

Analyses of the patterns of gastric and oesophageal pH over time in normal subjects and subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease indicate that the fluctuations in pH are self-similar across different time scales and are consistent with an underlying fractal process. Furthermore, there is a significant statistical association between sequential pH values separated by as much as 2.2 h. We hypothesize that the self-similar, fractal pattern encodes information about gastric acidity and that the oesophagus decodes this information and, when appropriate, may signal the stomach to reduce gastric acidity.

{"id": "15683461", "title": "Melatonin as an organoprotector in the stomach and the pancreas.", "text": "Melatonin was thought to originate primarily from the pineal gland and to be secreted during the night, but recent studies revealed that gastrointestinal (GI) tract presents another, many times larger, source of melatonin that contributes significantly to the circulating concentration of this indole. Melatonin may exert a direct effect on GI tissues but its major influence on GI organs seems to occur indirectly, via the brain-gut axis including peripheral receptors, sensory afferent (vagal or sympathetic) pathways and central nervous system (CNS) acting on these organs via autonomic efferents and neuromediators. This article reviews and updates our experience with the fascinating molecule, as related to GI organs, with special focus on secretory activity of the stomach and pancreas and the maintenance of their tissue integrity. In addition to being released into the circulation, melatonin is also discharged into the gut lumen and this appears to be implicated in the postprandial stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, mediated by melatonin-induced release of cholecystokinin, acting through entero-gastro-pancreatic reflexes. Although exerting certain differences in the mechanism of action on gastric and pancreatic secretory activities, melatonin derived from its precursor L-tryptophan, exhibits similar highly protective actions against the damage of both the stomach and the pancreas and accelerates the healing of chronic gastric ulcerations by stimulating the microcirculation and cooperating with arachidonate metabolites such as prostaglandins, with nitric oxide released from vascular endothelium, and/or sensory nerves and with their neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene related peptide. The beneficial effects of melatonin results in gastro- and pancreato-protection, prevents various forms of gastritis and pancreatitis through the activation of specific MT2-receptors and scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melatonin counteracts the increase in the ROS-induced lipid peroxidation and preserves, at least in part, the activity of key anti-oxidizing enzymes such as superoxide dismutase. It is proposed that melatonin should be considered as the agent exerting an important role in prevention of gastric and pancreatic damage and in accelerating healing of gastric ulcers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15683461/"}

However, improvement in the inflammation was observed only in the antrum, while in the corpus most gastritis parameters worsened significantly.

In the pancreas of adult forms 5 endocrine cell types were seen, namely insulin-, somatostatin-, glucagon-, pancreatic polypeptide (PP)- and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP)-immunoreactive cells. These cell types form scattered islets and were seen sometimes to surround small ducts. GIP-immunoreactivity cells did not occur in glucagon-containing cells. In the mucosa of GIT of adults 18 endocrine cell types were observed, viz. insulin-, somatostatin-, glucagon-, glicentin, PP-, polypeptide YY (PYY)-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-, GIP-, gastrin C-terminus, CCK-, neurotensin N-terminus-, bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide (GRP)-, substance P-, enkephalin-, alpha-endorphin, beta-endorphin-, serotonin- and calcitonin immunoreactive cells. These cells occurred mostly in the intestine. All these cell types were of the open type, except glucagon- and glicentin-immunoreactive cells in the stomach, which seemed to be of the closed type. In the muscle layers and the submucosa, VIP and substance P- immunoreactive nerves and neurons were observed. In the pancreas of the dogfish embryo only 3 endocrine cell types could be demonstrated, namely insulin-, somatostatin- and glucagon-immunoreactive cells. In the mucosa of the GIT of the embryos studied 12 endocrine cell types were detected, viz. insulin-, somatostatin-, glucagon-, PP-, PYY-, VIP, GIP, gastrin C-terminus-, CCK-, neurotensin N-terminus-, enkephalin- and serotonin immunoreactive cells. The number of these cells, except that of PYY-immunoreactive cells, was lower than that of adults and in some cases their distribution did not correspond with that of adults.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6370932/"}

Increased dead space and perfusion of hydrochloric acid 1 N (150 mL over 30 min) were used to induce RA and MA, respectively. Measurements of fundic tone using an electronic barostat, antro-pyloroduodenal phasic motility with perfused manometry and antro-duodenal electric control activity by electromyography were used to evaluate gastroduodenal function. Acidosis increased the fundic tone as reflected by a decrease in barostat volumes from 275+/-83 to 194+/-88 mL for MA and from 278+/-93 to 236+/-106 mL for RA. Pyloric and duodenal basal tones were not affected by either acidosis. A decrease in pyloric contraction amplitude from 95+/-24 to 62+/-26 mm Hg during MA and from 94+/-26 to 64+/-20 mm Hg during RA was observed. Both acidosis altered antral control activity that became dysrhythmic.

Roxatidine acetate hydrochloride (roxatidine), a known histamine H2-receptor antagonist, was used as a reference compound. The pA2 values for Z-300 and roxatidine for the isolated guinea pig atrium were 6.8 and 7.0, respectively. These agents at less than 10(-5) M did not affect the contraction of guinea pig ileum in response to carbachol. Z-300, administered either orally or parenterally, significantly inhibited the basal and histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in rats. Gastric acid secretion stimulated by histamine, pentagastrin or carbachol in Heidenhain pouch dogs was also significantly inhibited by the compound. The effect persisted for greater than 7 hr in the case of histamine-stimulation. Oral Z-300 significantly protected the gastric mucosa from water-immersion stress-, indomethacin-, aspirin- and HCl.ethanol-induced lesions and protected the duodenal mucosa against mepirizole- and cysteamine-induced ulcers. These effects on gastric secretion and lesion formation were, as a whole, stronger than those observed with roxatidine. Z-300, but not roxatidine, significantly accelerated the spontaneous healing of acetic acid ulcers induced in rats and prevented the delay in ulcer healing caused by indomethacin. The mechanism of action of Z-300 on acute lesions and chronic ulcers appears to be mostly related to its potent antisecretory and mucosal-protective activities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1359178/"}

Several case reports and case series have demonstrated the efficacy of the OTSC system for the closure of full-thickness defects. Clinical success is best achieved in patients undergoing closure of a perforation or a leak. Closure of fistulas remains a clinical challenge since fibrosis or necrotic and inflamed tissue surrounding lesions may cause clip failure.

The drugs belonging to the second and third categories, and the drugs required for local action in the stomach, require a specialized delivery system. All the above requirements can be met and effective delivery of the drugs to the absorption window, for local action and for treatment of gastric disorders such as gastro-esophageal reflux, can be achieved by floating dosage systems (FDS). To date, a number of FDS involving various technologies, carrying their own advantages and limitations, were developed, such as single- and multiple-unit hydrodynamically balanced systems (HBS), single- and multiple-unit gas-generating systems, hollow microspheres, and raft-forming systems. Various factors such as gastrointestinal physiology, dosage form characteristics, and patient-related factors control the behavior of FDS.

It is present naturally at low levels in dairy products and occurs ubiquitously, together with other short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), in the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and other mammals as an end-product of the microbial digestion of carbohydrates. It has significant physiological activity in animals. PA is irritant but produces no acute systemic effects and has no demonstrable genotoxic potential. Rats receiving PA at 4% in the diet develop hyperplastic lesions and tumours of the forestomach. Such changes are also reported to have been produced by a variety of other chemicals, mechanical and chemical irritants, parasites, and even various dietary insufficiencies or imbalances. Evidence suggests that repeated or persistent damage to cells of the forestomach epithelium and associated proliferative responses may be a common factor in rodent forestomach tumorigenesis. Although humans do not have a forestomach, the mouth, pharynx and oesophagus are lined with similar epithelium and thus are potential target organs. However, food contact time is considerably less in these organs than in the rodent forestomach. On current evidence, PA cannot be considered a carcinogenic risk to humans; nevertheless, to determine a safe level of dietary exposure it is suggested that no-observable-effect levels should be determined for epithelial cell damage and proliferative responses in the squamous mucosa of laboratory animals, particularly in those parts of the gastro-intestinal tract having a counterpart in humans, such as the pharynx and oesophagus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1628870/"}

It was first shown in mammals that this reflex could be organized by a sympathetic ganglion, the coeliac plexus. The excitation of gastric mechanosensitive fibres leads in this ganglion to the release of a neurotransmitter, which in turn activates ganglionic neurones leading to inhibition of the duodenum contractions. It rapidly became apparent that this reflex presented striking properties since it was organized in the absence of action potentials along the nerve fibres. Then it was shown that the neurotransmitter released in the coeliac plexus was gaseous: nitric oxide (NO). The nature of the mechanism conducting, without action potentials, the excitation along the nerve fibres was recently determined. This mechanism necessitates the integrity of particular areas of the neuronal membrane (the lipid rafts) and the activation in cascade of the following second messenger sequence: ceramide, calcium, NO and guanosine cyclic monophosphate (c-GMP). These results show how studies in biological gastroenterology have led to the rethinking of one of the central dogmas in neuroscience according to which excitation is only conducted along the nerves by the action potential.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20510563/"}

Regardless of type of operation, all wounds were contaminated during operation by aerobic commensals of the skin and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, in particular by Staphylococcus epidermidis, this species not differing significiantly in density from the beginning to the end of operation. This same study revealed that within the operation wound, sites of low or even zero bacterial density were close to sites with a high density. It is suggested that postoperative wound infection is closely related to the density of the different species of bacteria present in the operation wound at closure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/775616/"}

Basic electric rhythms (slow spikes) were classified into normo-peristalsis and anti-peristalsis. The periodical rhythm of normo-peristalsis was partly disturbed after selective vagotomy but was more regular after feeding. Normally, rate changes of normo-peristalsis show typical patterns depending on the types of meals. These distinctive features were observed more clearly in S.V. and S.P.V. dogs. The incidence of normo-peristalsis and anti-peristalsis during fasting was high in normal dogs and low in S.V. dogs by night. A high level of anti-peristalsis occurred at the antrum in S.V. dogs. Thus, the numbers of normo-peristaltic waves reaching the antrum were decreased in S.V. dogs. After feeding, anti-peristalsis decreased in S.V. dogs but increased in normal dogs. Anti-peristalsis tended to occur in succession with a short cycle just like extra-systole. The author noted that sometimes anti-peristalsis was propagated towards both the orad and the pylorus simultaneously. In both S.V. and S.P.V. dogs, the denervated corpus seemed to have similar functions. On the other hand, in both the S.P.V. and normal dogs, the antrum seemed to function similarly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1238835/"}

Hp infection in humans does not interfere with NSAID-induced gastric ulcer healing by omeprazole, therefore, there is no rationale to eradicate the germ. Hp infection induces COX-2 expression resulting in excessive biosynthesis of gastroprotective prostaglandin (PG), which should in turn counteract NSAID-induced gastropathy and contribute to healing of existing ulcers. Some investigators claim that Hp infection acts synergistically with NSAID on ulcerogenesis and propose that Hp should be eradicated, particularly at the onset of long-term NSAID therapy. Our studies in about 6500 dyspeptic patients undergoing upper endoscopy and 13C-urea breath test revealed that about 70% of these patients are Hp positive and 31% of these develop gastro-duodenal ulcers. Of these ulcers, 66% were Hp positive and NSAID negative, 3%--NSAID positive and Hp negative, 8% were both Hp positive and NSAID positive, while 23% ulcers were Hp and NSAID negative. An evidence was obtained for negative interaction between Hp infection and NSAID on risk of gastro-duodenal ulcers suggesting that Hp may attenuate the peptic ulcerogenesis. Our results support the concept 1) the interaction between Hp infection and NSAID on gastro-duodenal ulcerations is antagonistic, 2) the Hp and NSAID are independent risk factors for peptic ulcerations in humans, 3) there is no need for the Hp eradication in NSAID-treated patients, and 4) the rate of ulcer complications (hemorrhage and perforation) remains constant despite the decrease in Hp and ulcer prevalence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12218957/"}

Two types of vesiculated axonal profiles are recognised in the circular muscle layer of the stomach in normal animals: round agranular vesicles which measure between 40 and 60 nm and large granular vesicles measuring 80-120 nm. Animals which received 5-hydroxydopamine treatment show, however, in addition, small dense-cored vesicles measuring 30-60 nm.

Abdominal tuberculosis comprises about 1-3 % of all cases of tuberculosis and about 12% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. It involves the ileocecal region, but involvement of stomach and duodenum are rare sites. Here we present an unusual case of gastric outlet obstruction due to gastric tuberculosis. A 54-year-old Sudanese man presented with a non-bile stain persistent projectile vomiting, and epigastric pain for two years associated with marked loss of weight. There is no fever or cough. He was on antacid, physical examination showed BMI 18 and stable vital signs. He was not pale or jaundiced, there was no cervical lymphadenopathy and chest was clear. Abdominal examination was normal apart of positive succussion splash. The results of haematological tests were normal, ESR was 30 mm/hr, hepatitis B, C and HIV were negative. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed that the stomach was full of fluid and food particles and ulcerated mass in the pylorus extended to the proximal part of the duodenum with severe narrowing of the pylorus. The lesion biopsied and the result revealed active inflammatory cells, cryptitis and multiple lymphoid follicles, no malignancy seen. Sonographic test showed hypodense pyloric mass, enlarged para-aortic and mesenteric lymph nodes and mild pelvic ascites. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed antral hypodense lesions multiple mesenteric lymphadenopathies peritoneal thickening and ascites. Chest X-ray was normal. Intra-operative findings were dilated stomach and pylorus mass with multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal and omental seedlings all over with small nodules on the surface of the liver, gastro-jejunostomy was done.

One hundred and six H. pylori-positive patients with active duodenal ulcers were assigned to either a non-eradication group or an eradication group. The non-eradication group received lansoprazole for 6 wk, followed by an H2-receptor antagonist. The eradication group also received amoxicillin and metronidazole for 1 wk, in addition to lansoprazole, after initial endoscopic examination. In both groups, biopsy specimens were obtained from the ulcer margin in the active stage and from the center of the scar in the scarring stage. Specimens were examined microscopically as well as by rapid urease test to assess the extent of gastric metaplasia and to detect the presence of H. pylori. The extent of gastric metaplasia increased as the ulcers healed. The extent of gastric metaplasia was of a lesser degree in the non-eradication group than in the eradication group at the time of healing, and this tendency became increasingly apparent in the course of follow-up, resulting in reduced defense mechanisms against acidity to promote the recurrence of ulcers. In the eradication group, among those in whom eradication was successful, gastric metaplasia presented a well-developed appearance with abundant intracellular mucus and remained in this condition for a prolonged period, resulting in adequate defense mechanisms against acidity to prevent the recurrence of ulcers. By the eradication of H. pylori, gastric metaplasia becomes well-developed and remains so for a prolonged period. Thus, the eradication of H. pylori appears to play a role in the prevention of ulcer recurrences by developing adequate defenses against acidity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9149187/"}

Changes in blood flow in the gastro-duodenal mucosa, brought about by the local release of vasoactive or cytotoxic mediators, including free-radicals, the eicosanoids thromboxanes and leukotrienes, and the related phospholipid, PAF, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various forms of peptic ulceration and erosive gastritis. Damage to microvessels and vascular endothelium leading to disruption of microcirculation is considered to be an initial event in the development of such lesions. Furthermore, preservation of microcirculation by prostaglandins is likely to make an important contribution to the overall protection of the gastric mucosa by these agents. Studies on the hemostatic mechanisms in the gastric mucosa indicate that bleeding is initially arrested by a coagulation process that is independent of platelet aggregation. Thus, the identification and characterization of microcirculatory events is of major importance in the understanding of pathophysiological processes in the gastric mucosa.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2657287/"}

{"id": "16934271", "title": "A stomach road or \"Magenstrasse\" for gastric emptying.", "text": "Gastric muscle contractions grind and mix solid/liquid meal within the stomach, and move it into the bowels at a controlled rate. Contractions are of two types: slow volume-reducing contractions of the proximal stomach (the fundus), and peristaltic contraction waves in the distal stomach (the antrum). Fundic squeeze maintains gastro-duodenal pressure difference to drive gastric emptying. Emptying is generally assumed to proceed from the antrum to the fundus, so that ingested drugs can take hours to enter the small intestines and activate. Antral contraction waves (ACW), in contrast, generate fluid motions that break down and mix gastric content. Using a computer model of the human stomach, we discover a new function of these contraction waves apart from grinding and mixing. In coordination with fundic contraction, antral contraction waves move liquid content from the fundus along a very narrow path to the duodenum through the center of the antrum. Using physiological data, we show that this gastric emptying \"Magenstrasse\" (stomach road) can funnel liquid gastric content from the farthest reaches of the fundus directly to the intestines within 10 min. Consequently, whereas drugs (tablets, capsules, liquid) released off the Magenstrasse may require hours to enter the duodenum, at low concentration, when released on the Magenstrasse the drug can enter the duodenum and activate within 10 min-at high concentration. This discovery might explain observed high variability in drug initiation time, and may have important implications to both drug delivery and digestion, as well as to other wall-driven emptying of elastic containers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16934271/"}

The hypothesis was examined using the canine model in which gastro-oesophageal flow was stimulated by gastric insufflation of air at 80 ml/min and central nervous depression was produced with the anaesthetic agents thiopentone, nitrous oxide and halothane. Duplicate paired studies were performed in four dogs, either unsedated or anaesthetized. Gastro-oesophageal flow was assessed manometrically by a sleeve catheter assembly and by pH electrode. Gastric compliance was assessed by inflation of a thin-walled, plastic bag. Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, the dominant mechanism of retrograde trans-sphincter flow in unsedated animals, was abolished by general anaesthesia. Retrograde flow of gas across the lower oesophageal sphincter in anaesthetized animals eventually occurred, but only after massive gastric distension and elevation of gastric pressure to lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. The effects observed could not be explained by a direct action of anaesthetic on the lower oesophageal sphincter or on the gastric wall. It is proposed that general anaesthesia results in blockade of the neural pathway responsible for transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation by withdrawal of facilitative higher centre activity. The findings have implications for the use of sedation in experimental studies on factors which control gastro-oesophageal reflux, and clinical application to the risk of tracheal aspiration during general anaesthesia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3250418/"}

Fatty acid release of CCK is chain-length sensitive; dodecanoic acid (C12) induces greater CCK release than decanoic acid (C10). The effect of C12 or C10 on tolerance to subsequent intragastric infusion of liquid was determined in healthy subjects, with and without the CCK(1) receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide. Gastric wall relaxation after either fatty acid was assessed by graded volume distension and by barostat; gastric emptying was measured by gastric aspiration and by a [(13)C]octanoic acid breath technique. C12 released more CCK (mean plasma CCK after vehicle, 4.7 +/- 0.8 pM; C10, 4.8 +/- 0.3 pM; C12, 8 +/- 1.2 pM; P < 0.05 C12 vs. C10 or vehicle) and reduced the volume of water (and of 5 and 25% glucose solutions) delivered at maximum tolerance compared with C10 or vehicle (volume of water tolerated after vehicle, 1,535 +/- 164 ml; C10, 1,335 +/- 160 ml; C12, 842 +/- 103 ml; P < 0.05 C12 vs. C10 or vehicle); this effect was abolished by dexloxiglumide. Intragastric volumes were always similar at the limit of tolerance, and, whereas gastric relaxation occurred to similar degrees after the fatty acids, its duration was longer after C12, which also induced a longer delay in half-gastric emptying [t(1/2)(min) after vehicle, 53 +/- 2; C10, 67 +/- 3; C12, 88 +/- 7; P < 0.05 C12 vs. C10 or vehicle].

We characterized the pharmacology of nicotinic receptors mediating relaxations of the human upper gastric sphincter (clasp and sling fibers) using currently available subtype selective nicotinic antagonists in tissue from organ transplant donors. Donors with either a history of gastro-esophageal reflux disease or histologic evidence of Barrett's esophagus were excluded. Clasp and sling muscle fiber strips were used for one of three paradigms. For paradigm 1, each strip was exposed to carbachol, washed, exposed to nicotinic antagonists then re-exposed to carbachol. In paradigm 2, strips were exposed to a near maximally effective bethanechol concentration then nicotine was added. Strips then were washed, exposed to nicotinic antagonists then re-exposed to bethanechol followed by nicotine. In paradigm 3, strips were exposed to bethanechol then choline or cytisine. 100 μM methyllycaconitine has no inhibitory effects on relaxations, eliminating homomeric α7 subtypes. Subtypes composed of α4β2 subunits are also eliminated because choline acts as an agonist and dihydro-beta-erythroidine is ineffective. Because mecamylamine blocks the relaxations and both choline and cytisine act as agonists in both clasp and sling fibers, the nicotinic receptor subtypes responsible for these relaxations could be composed of α3β4β2, α2β4, or α4β4 subunits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24827539/"}

Transection of the left gastric and gastro-epiploic artery and vein results in compromised perfusion which is seen as the major contributing factor for anastomotic dehiscence. The main objective of this prospective, observational, in-vivo pilot study is to microscopically evaluate gastric tube perfusion with Sidestream Darkfield Microscopy (SDF). Intra-operative microscopic images of gastric-microcirculation were obtained with SDF directly after reconstruction in 22 patients. Quantitative perfusion related parameters were: velocity, Microvascular Flow Index(MFI), Total Vessel Density(TVD), Perfusion Vessel Density(PVD), Proportion of Perfused Vessels(PPV) and De Backer Score(DBS). Dedicated software was used to assess parameters predictive for compromised perfusion. SDF was feasible to accurately visualize and evaluate microcirculation in all patients. Velocity(μm/sec) was significantly decreased towards the fundus (p = 0.001). MFI, PVD and PVD were decreased distal of the watershed - between the right and left gastro-epiploic artery and vein - and in the fundus, compared to the base of the gastric tube(p = 0.0002). No differences in TVD and DBS were observed; because of vessel-dilation in the fundus-area. This suggests that venous congestion results in comprised inflow of oxygen rich blood and plays a role in the development of ischaemia. We present quantitative perfusion imaging with SDF of the gastric tube. Velocity, MFI, TVD and PPV are accurate parameters to observe perfusion decrease. Also, venous congestion is visible in the fundus, suggesting an important role in the development of ischaemia.

Therefore, a large group of the population exposed to total body irradiation (TBI) in the event of a nuclear disaster would be on this or similar medications. We investigated the effect of pantoprazole on TBI-induced lethality in mice. Male CD2F1 mice were exposed to various doses of uniform TBI using a (137)Cs irradiator. Pantoprazole was administered by twice daily subcutaneous injection in saline from 4 days before to 5 days after irradiation. Effects on gastric pH, and gastrointestinal (GI) and hematopoietic toxicity were evaluated. Pantoprazole administration significantly exacerbated 30 day lethality and gastrointestinal toxicity. Median survival after 9.0 Gy TBI was reduced from 22 days to 12 days (p = 0.006). Pantoprazole adversely effected intestinal crypt survival and mucosal surface area. In contrast, equivalent doses of a histamine type-2(H2) receptor blocker (cimetidine) did not alter TBI-induced lethality. The adverse effect of pantoprazole on TBI-induced lethality is highly important because of the widespread use of PPI in the general population, as well as use of these drugs for acid suppression in individuals exposed to radiation. Further studies of the mechanisms underlying the adverse effect of PPI after exposure to TBI are clearly warranted. Until results from such studies are available, other acid-suppressing strategies should be preferred in the context of radiation exposure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24646079/"}

Twelve healthy volunteers (HVs) and 12 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD); with erosive oesophagitis or pathological oesophageal acid exposure completed a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study. On 2 test days participants received 40-mg baclofen or placebo before ingestion of a large test meal.

Mixed model analysis and Wilcoxon rank signed tests assessed differences between participant groups and treatment conditions. In both HVs and GERD patients, baclofen reduced the frequency of postprandial reflux events. The oesophago-gastric insertion angle in GERD patients was reduced (-4.1 ± 1.8, P = 0.025), but was unchanged in healthy controls.

Technical modifications have been introduced in an attempt to reduce conduit morbidity, and the aim of this study was to evaluate their efficacy. Minimally invasive oesophagectomy has been the procedure of choice in our unit since April 2004. Data on patient and surgical variables are entered onto a prospective database. Laparoscopic ischaemic conditioning (LIC) by ligation of the left gastric vessels 2 weeks prior to MIO was introduced in April 2006. Extracorporeal formation of the gastric conduit through a minilaparotomy was offered to patients since January 2008.

As of January 2010, 131 patients had undergone an MIO and GCF was observed in 21 patients (16.0%). Sixty-seven patients had LIC and 9 of them (13.4%) developed GCF (I, 10.4%; II, 0%; III, 3.0%) compared to 12 (18.8%) of 64 patients who did not have LIC (I, 6.3%; II, 7.8%; III, 4.7%).

GCF can be reduced with the incorporation of LIC and an extracorporeally fashioned conduit, with possible elimination of type II conduit tip necrosis.

Delayed solid T1/2 was the most prominent alteration (n=189), and alterations of liquid GE alone were present in only 24 (5%) patients. A good correlation was found between solid T1/2 and TRE (r=0.88), but no correlation between Tlag and TRE, suggesting that these estimates represent independent phases of GE. In 26 patients, all GE parameters of solids and liquids were normal except Tlag (n=8) or TRE (n=18). The lack of significant differences between the different patient subgroups did not allow emptying profiles to be drawn according to patient pathology.

The main outcome measure was perfusion recorded by validated laser Doppler fluximetry, at the fundus (F) and greater curve (G); performed at routine staging laparoscopy and every stage of an MIE. A perfusion coefficient measured as ratio at stage of MIE over baseline was used for statistical analysis. Sixteen patients were recruited before an interim analysis of the trial data. At staging laparoscopy perfusion at F was higher than at G (p = 0.016). In the L cohort, an apparent rise in perfusion at G is observed post intervention (p = 0.176). At MIE, baseline perfusion is comparable for both arms; however, a significant drop is observed at both locations once the stomach is mobilized and exteriorized (p = 0.001). Once delivered at the neck, perfusion coefficient is approximately 38% of baseline levels. However, there was no discernible difference between the L (38.3 ± 12) and N (37.7 ± 16.8) cohorts (p = 0.798). LIC does not translate into an improved perfusion of the gastric conduit tip. The benefits reported from published clinical series suggest that the resistance of the conduit to ischemia occurs through alternative possibly microcellular mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22302533/"}

Gastric tube graft interposition as an oesophageal substitute was evaluated on an animal model. Twenty-three postweaned, 28-day-old-piglets were used as the experimental animals. Isoperistaltic gastric tube interposition based on the right gastroepiploic vessels was performed at 28 days of life. Postoperative evaluation included weekly measurement of weight, clinical assessment for gastrointestinal and respiratory complications and deglutition difficulties. Haemoglobin, serum ferritin, albumin, globulins, total proteins and red cell folate were assayed. Pigs were killed and analysed histopathologically following a maximum observation period of 149 days. Growth of the pigs was normal. Deglutition was not impaired in 16 pigs (89%). Minor leak was diagnosed in three pigs (17%), which was successfully managed conservatively. Anastomotic stricture was seen in two pigs (11%). Graft necrosis was not seen. Gross histology showed the absence of hypertrophy, redundancy and kinking of the interposed gastric tube graft. Microscopically non-erosive oesophagitis was seen in three pigs (17%), ulcerative oesophagitis was seen in two pigs (11%) and submucosal fibrosis was seen in seven pigs (39%). Dysplasia or Barrett's oesophagitis was not observed at the end of animal growth. Gastric tube graft interposition is an immediate ideal oesophageal substitute due to fewer complications, probable absence of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the majority by histology, and absence of dilatation and redundancy of the interpose tube. The oesophageal substitute adequately met the nutritional needs for growth and development in the animal model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11167600/"}

Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase was used to determine ethanol in the portal and hepatic veins and in the contents of the alimentary canal of rats given a diet free from ethanol. Measurable amounts of a substance behaving like ethanol were found. Its rate of interaction with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and its volatility indicate that the substance measured was in fact ethanol. 2. The mean alcohol concentration in the portal blood of normal rats was 0.045mm. In the hepatic vein, inferior vena cava and aorta it was about 15 times lower. 3. The contents of all sections of the alimentary canal contained measurable amounts of ethanol. The highest values (average 3.7mm) were found in the stomach. 4. Infusion of pyrazole (an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase) raised the alcohol concentration in the portal vein 10-fold and almost removed the difference between portal and hepatic venous blood. 5. Addition of antibiotics to the food diminished the ethanol concentration of the portal blood to less than one-quarter and that of the stomach contents to less than one-fortieth. 6. The concentration of alcohol in the alimentary canal and in the portal blood of germ-free rats was much decreased, to less than one-tenth in the alimentary canal and to one-third in the portal blood, but detectable quantities remained. These are likely to arise from acetaldehyde formed by the normal pathways of degradation of threonine, deoxyribose phosphate and beta-alanine. 7. The results indicate that significant amounts of alcohol are normally formed in the gastro-intestinal tract. The alcohol is absorbed into the circulation and almost quantitatively removed by the liver. Thus the function, or a major function, of liver alcohol dehydrogenase is the detoxication of ethanol normally present. 8. The alcohol concentration in the stomach of alloxan-diabetic rats was increased about 8-fold. 9. The activity of liver alcohol dehydrogenase is generally lower in carnivores than in herbivores and omnivores, but there is no strict parallelism between the capacity of liver alcohol dehydrogenase and dietary habit. 10. The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase of gastric mucosa was much decreased in two out of the three germ-free rats tested. This is taken to indicate that the enzyme, like gastric urease, may be of microbial origin. 11. When the body was flooded with ethanol by the addition of 10% ethanol to the drinking water the alcohol concentration in the portal vein rose to 15mm and only a few percent of the incoming ethanol was cleared by the liver.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5481498/"}

However, the potential adverse effects of widespread antibiotic use that this would entail have not been sufficiently studied. An alternative way to decrease gastric cancer mortality is by non-invasive search for precancerous lesions, in particular gastric atrophy; pepsinogen tests are the best currently available alternative. The primary objective of GISTAR is to determine whether <i>H pylori</i> eradication combined with pepsinogen testing reduces mortality from gastric cancer among 40-64-year-old individuals. The secondary objectives include evaluation of <i>H pylori</i> eradication effectiveness in gastric cancer prevention in patients with precancerous lesions and evaluation of the potential adverse events, including effects on microbiome. Individuals are recruited from general population (50% men) in areas with high gastric cancer risk in Europe and undergo detailed lifestyle and medical history questionnaire before being randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. The intervention group undergoes <i>H pylori</i> testing and is offered eradication therapy if positive; in addition, pepsinogen levels are detected in plasma and those with decreased levels are referred for upper endoscopy. All participants are offered faecal occult blood testing as an incentive for study participation. Effectiveness of eradication and the spectrum of adverse events are evaluated in study subpopulations. A 35% difference in gastric cancer mortality between the groups is expected to be detectable at 90% power after 15 years if 30 000 individuals are recruited.

Nitric oxide is an important relaxant of the fundus. We postulated that gastric distensibility, compliance and nitric oxide sensitivity may be altered in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 9 patients with erosive oesophagitis (6 males; median age 55 years) and 16 healthy controls (9 males; median age 36 years) were studied fasting with a gastric barostat. Minimal distending pressure (MDP) and gastric compliance (Deltav/Deltap) were determined by increasing intrabag pressure in 2-mm Hg increments. The pressures required to produce initial sensation and maximum tolerated sensation were recorded. With the intrabag pressure set at MDP +2 mm Hg, 500 microg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate was administered and the percentage change in intrabag volume from initial volume recorded. The MDP was significantly greater in patients than controls (7.5 vs. 6.7 mm Hg median; p = 0.02). Gastric compliance was similar in both groups (57.8 vs. 67.2 ml/mm Hg; p = 0.4). There was no difference between groups in the pressure at first intragastric sensation (11.2 vs. 10.3 mm Hg above MDP; p = 0.5) or in the maximal tolerated pressure (15.8 vs. 14.3 mm Hg above MDP; p = 0.2). The proportional change in gastric volume from baseline in response to glyceryl trinitrate was smaller in patients than controls (66 (3-200) vs. 120 (26-1,053)%; p = 0.02). Gastric MDP may be altered in GERD, but gastric compliance and sensitivity to distension are normal. Major gastric relaxation occurs in response to a nitric oxide donor, but this appears to be diminished in patients with GERD. Upper gut nitrinergic mechanisms may be altered in oesophageal reflux disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10545729/"}

A total of 26 individuals were studied: eight patients after open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for morbid obesity, six patients after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GERD, seven patients after open subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer and five NI. Patients underwent high resolution manometry to identify the location of the lower border of the lower esophageal sphincter (LBLES) and measure gastric pressure 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm below the LBLES, immediately before swallow and after the end of the LES relaxation. A station pull-through pH monitoring was performed in all but NI, from 5 cm below the LBLES to the LBLES in increments of 1 cm in a fasting state and 10 min after a standardized fatty meal. Our results show that: (i) proximal gastric pressures are lower after swallow compared with before swallow in NI; (ii) patients after gastric surgery tend to have higher gastric pressure before and lower after swallow compared with NI and (iii) patients after RYGB with PPGAP have an increased gastric pressure after swallows in the segment where the PPGAP is noticed.

This clinical study evaluated gastric emptying and gastric pH after administration of Fosamax(®) tablets and a novel effervescent ALN formulation with a high buffering capacity. This novel formulation, EX101, was developed to potentially improve gastric tolerance. Gastric pH was monitored by nasogastric probes. Gastric emptying was determined simultaneously by scintigraphic imaging of (99m)Tc-DTPA labelled formulations. Both formulations tested rapidly cleared the oesophagus and there were no statistically significant or physiologically relevant differences in gastric emptying times. Mean pH at time to 50% gastric emptying of the radiolabel was significantly higher in EX101-treated subjects compared to those treated with Fosamax(®). At time to 90% gastric emptying of the radiolabel, mean pH values were comparable. Mucosal exposure to ALN at pH less than 3 is irritating to gastro-oesophageal tissue.

In the small intestine, levels of up to 10(5) bacteria/ml contents are reached. The essential mechanism which maintains this relative sterility of the upper digestive tract is the gastro-intestinal transit and in particular the interdigestive migrating motor complex. In the terminal ileum, a zone subject to relative stasis, the intraluminal bacterial population rises to 10(8)/ml in one third of subjects, with the appearance of enterobacter and strict anaerobes. In the colon, a zone of physiological stasis, the number of microorganisms per ml of contents is 10(8)-10(9) on the right side and 10(10)-10(12) on the left side. The dominant flora is strictly anaerobic and the subdominant flora optionally aero-anaerobic, consist mainly of Enterobacter, Streptococci and Lactobacilli. The balance between the species of microorganisms in the colonic ecosystem and its stability results primarily from microbial antagonisms. The barrier flora, consisting of groups of anaerobes, either prevent the implantation of exogenous microorganisms (drastic barrier) or limit it to the subdominant flora (permissive barrier). The repression of the subdominant flora by the dominant flora prevents the subdominant flora from spreading to the mesenteric ganglia and then the whole body.

We studied these lesser curvature changes by measuring the position and angle of the gastric incisura on still frames captured from videotapes of isolated cat stomachs suspended in physiologic solution. In response to filling with 100 mL Krebs' solution stomachs generated a tonic contraction of the fundus/body segment and gave rise to a peristaltic contraction that spread from the body and through the antrum to the pylorus. In preparations where we left the duodenal cannula open we found that the incisura moves toward the gastro-oesophageal (GO) junction and the angle of the incisura widens as the contraction passes through the stomach and empties its contents. Furthermore, the angle of the incisura is most acute when the full stomach starts contracting in its fundic segment and again when the contraction involves the gastric sinus (the wedge-shaped segment adjacent to the incisura which forms the transition between the body and the antrum of the stomach). In preparations where the duodenal cannula was kept closed, the angle of the incisura becomes most acute when the contraction involves the gastric body and when the luminal pressure peaks. We conclude that changes in the position and angulation of the incisura are part of the mechanical response of the stomach to filling and emptying; unlike the peristaltic contraction along the greater curvature the net movement of the incisura goes in the orad direction. Movements of the incisura profoundly affect the configuration of the stomach and hence the distribution of luminal contents between various gastric segments. The gastric sling muscles are responsible for the formation of the gastric incisura but their role in any movements of the incisura remains to be defined.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9697102/"}

After bilateral transthoracic vagotomy there is a disruption of the cyclic character of the electrical activity in the investigated regions of the gastro-intestinal tract--SP from S and PS are recorded with each SPC. The active phase of the cycle from D is strongly prolonged at the expense of the shorter pause. This lasts for 1-2 days, after which there is a tendency towards shaping the cycles characteristic of the electrical activity of S, PS and D of cats. The pauses, however remain relatively short and the number of SP in the group is much greater. Gradually during the second month the character of the electrical activity of S, PS, and D approaches that prior to the vagotomy, but even until the 6th month after vagotomy the number of SP in the group is greater and the active phase of the cycle is longer. On the background of antagonists of the adrenoreceptors (propranolol--2 mg/kg and dihydroergotamine--300 micrograms/kg), the cyclic character of the electrical activity of S, PS and D is disturbed. The relatively rapid restoration of the cyclic character of cat S, PS and D after vagotomy is assumed to be the result of the organizing role of the intrinsic nervous system. The disturbance of the cyclic character after adrenoblockers demonstrates the significance of the balance between the cholinergic and adrenergic parts of the intrinsic nervous system for the realization of the cyclic character of the electrical activity of S, PS and D of cats.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6133406/"}

The usual site of rupture of stomach is along the greater curvature in the fundic portion. In circumstances in which splenectomy is associated with known or suspected compromise of the blood supply to this portion of the stomach, a method of enfolding the greater curvature is proposed to prevent the development of a gastro-cutaneous fistula.

I.c.v infusion of CRF also increased the mean frequency of proximal duodenal contractions and decreased the percentage of distally propagating contractions in the whole duodenum. The remaining parameters of pyloric and duodenal contractions were not affected. A prior i.c.v. infusion of I-helical CRF9-41 (0.166 nmol kg-1 min-1 for 15 min in a volume of 0.2 mL) blocked the central effects of CRF on gastric emptying time and the duodenal contractions. Central infusion of CRF had no significant effect on the lag phase of gastric emptying. Bilateral truncal vagotomy significantly delayed the gastric emptying time of the solid nutrient meal. However, after vagotomy, i.c.v. infusion of CRF had no effect on gastric emptying time or the spatial and temporal parameters of gastro-pyloro-duodenal contractions. In conclusion, CRF, the mediator of stress response, delays the total gastric emptying time of solid nutrient meals. The delay in gastric emptying may not be due to a change in the spatial and temporal parameters of gastric or pyloric contractions, but mainly due to changes in the parameters of duodenal contractions.

Additionally, Botox A acts by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to smooth muscles and so paralysing the muscles, which is commonly used to relax muscle for treatment of oesophageal achalasia due to overactive smooth muscle and sphincters of gastrointestinal tract. We fabricated in vitro tissue engineered urothelial mucosa with multi-layers of urothelium and smooth muscle layers seeded on SIS scaffold and then used this cell-scaffold construct to cover nuke gastro patch combining with Botox A for gastrocystoplasty in a canine model. To evaluate the demucosalized stomach patch covered with tissue-engineered urothelium for gastrocystoplasty and to determine whether or not injections of Botox A into the re-epithelialized stomach patch can protect the graft from contraction in a canine bladder reconstruction model. Gastrocystoplasty was performed in 10 adult beagles after hemi-cystectomy using five types of stomach patch (n = 2 per group): entire stomach patches (group I); demucosalized patches (group II); demucosalized patches covered with cell-free small intestinal submucosa (SIS) (group III); demucosalized patches with urothelial and smooth muscle cell-seeded SIS (group IV); and demucosalized patches with the cell-seeded SIS combined with injections of Botox A (group V). The bladder volume/pressure and the graft sizes were measured before surgery and again 10 weeks after bladder augmentation. The graft tissues were examined both histologically and using immunohistochemistry. All dogs survived and their gastric grafts were all vital with a good blood supply. Gastric metaplasia of urothelium appeared on the top of stomach mucosa patches in two animals in group I. There was calcification formation at the centre of the graft in one animal in group II. As compared with urothelium that was partially covered over with stomach patches in groups II and III, stratified urothelium completely covered the demucosalized gastric patches in groups IV and V. There was less shrinkage of the stomach grafts in groups I and V, which shrank to half of their original size, than of the stomach grafts in groups II, III, and IV, which shrank significantly to one-quarter of their original sizes. Botox A injections appear to protect the graft contraction in the re-epithelialized stomach flaps.

Surgically proven bowel injuries (13 cases) occurred in the duodenum (three cases), ileum (two cases), jejunum (two cases), colon (three cases), and stomach (three cases). CT findings considered specific of bowel rupture were observed in 5/13 patients including: extraluminal oral contrast or luminal content extravasation (four cases) and discontinuity of hollow viscus wall (one case). In the remaining 8/13 CT findings considered suggestive of bowel injury consisted of: pneumoperitoneum (six), gas bubbles close to the injured hollow viscus (three), thickened (>4-5mm) bowel wall (five), bowel wall hematoma (three), intraperitoneal fluid of unknown source (three). Mesenteric injury (23 cases) were surgically observed at the level of the mesenteric vessels (17 cases), legament of Treitz (two cases), gastro-duodenal artery (one case), transverse (one case) and sigmoid mesocolon (one case). CT finding considered specific of mesenteric laceration was active extravasation of contrast material from the mesenteric vessels (10 cases). CT findings suggestive of mesenteric injury (13 cases) consisted of: mesenteric hematoma (five) and/or high attenuation fluid collections, within the mesenteric root (eight) and folds (four). Helical CT is sensitive in the identification of bowel and mesenteric injury after blunt trauma providing a wide spectrum of findings. However, CT cannot be used as the sole indicator in cases with isolated thichened bowel wall, mesenteric hematoma, bowel hematoma, pneumoperitoneum or gas bubbles. Persistent, active extravasation of intravenous constrast medium from the mesenteric vessels, in isolation or associated with further injuries, requires immediate exploration and repair; disruption of bowel wall and extravasation of oral contrast are definite signs of bowel rupture.

A computer technique was developed allowing on-line digitizing of lower oesophageal sphincter (sleeve device) and intragastric pressures. Basal sphincter tone was slightly reduced by truncal vagotomy, an effect which seemed to be reversed by sectioning of the vagosympathetic trunks in the neck. Balloon distension of the body of the oesophagus, relaxed the sphincter irrespective of the denervation procedures carried out. Distension of the whole stomach with increasing amounts of air induced a dose-dependent relaxatory lower oesophageal sphincter response, which was also closely associated with the subsequent increases in intragastric pressure. Denervation procedures did not alter this dose-response relationship. The importance of intramural mechanisms was illustrated by the abolition of distension-induced effects in most animals studied after transection of the gastro-oesophageal junction distal to the sphincter. Balloon distension of the antrum elicited a smaller but significant sphincter relaxation, but the mechanisms behind this response seemed to be more complex than after insufflation of air.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1397738/"}

Indomethacin inhibited PGI2 generation both in vitro and ex vivo while dexamethasone was ineffective in both instances. APP inhibited PGI2 generation in vitro. The results are discussed in the light of the possible mode of action of glucocorticoids. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is the major cyclo oxygenase metabolite in the rat gastric mucosa and exerts gastroprotective actions. Therefore a correlation between the inhibition of PGI2 synthesis and the induction of gastric damage has been suggested for the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Glucocorticoids inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2) by inducing in the target cells the synthesis of inhibitory proteins, the lipocortins, and consequently reduce the release of eicosanoids in a number of cells and tissues. However, there is a surprising paucity of information on the effect of glucocorticoids on arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in the gastro-intestinal tract. Moreover, the relationship between steroid administration and gastric damage is still controversial.

The authors hypothesized that gastric overdistension effects an increase in pharyngo-esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter activity aimed at inhibiting ingestion. The study comprised 16 mongrel dogs. Under anesthesia, one balloon-tipped catheter was placed in the stomach, another within the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and a third within the pharyngo-esophageal sphincter (PES). The gastric balloon was filled with H(2)O in increments of 10 ml and LES and PES pressures were recorded. The test was repeated after individual gastric, LES, and PES anesthetization. Gastric balloon filling with more than 20 ml of H(2)O showed progressively increasing LES pressure up to 110-120 ml of gastric filling, beyond which the pressure exhibited no further increase upon incrementally increased gastric filling volume. PES pressure increased only with a gastric filling volume exceeding 100-110 ml and continued to increase with increasing gastric filling. Gastric filling as above while the stomach, LES, and PES were separately anesthetized produced no LES or PES pressure response. LES and PES appear to contract on gastric filling; PES responds only to excess gastric filling. It seems that LES and PES response to gastric filling is mediated through a reflex which the authors call the \"gastro-esophagopharyngeal reflex\" (GEPR). Changes in the evoked response would indicate a defect in the reflex pathway. GEPR might thus serve as an investigative tool in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal disorders, although further studies are required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17901845/"}

The aim of this experience was to verify whether there are any immunohistochemical evaluations which may enable one to foresee more precisely the evolution of epithelial gastric dysplasia. Immunophenotypic evaluation was effected in 70 cases of low-grade dysplasia (41 males, average age: 57.4) and in 50 cases of high-grade dysplasia (31 males, average age: 58). These cases were retrospectively selected and the studied samples are represented by gastric biopsies obtained in the course of endoscopy performed for dyspepsia. Epithelial gastric dysplasia diagnosis was done according to Goldstein and Lewin and the clinical subdivision was effected using the criteria of Rugge et al. Four antigens were studied using Abs against pepsinogen C, gastric foveolar M1, intestinal CAR-5 and pancreatic DU-PAN-2 Ags. Epithelial gastric dysplasia is characterized by a progressive reduction of gastric markers with a progressive expression of enteropancreatic antigens. Low-grade dysplasia is characterized by a frequent gastro-enteropancreatic coexpression, and high-grade dysplasia by a frequent enteropancreatic coexpression or by no markers expression. Low-grade dysplasia with greater enteropancreatic markers progresses frequently towards gastric cancer; high-grade dysplasia with enteropancreatic markers only is associated/progresses to gastric cancer, while high-grade dysplasia with gastric markers or gastric-enteropancreatic markers is included in the group with persistent or regressed cases. If confirmed in further studies, such results could modify the evaluation of epithelial gastric dysplasia, not only in terms of histochemical techniques, but also of immunohistochemical techniques.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12063949/"}

Manometric studies of intraluminal pressures in the esophagus have revealed the presence of a high-pressure segment in the distal esophagus, where a mean pressure of 12-13 mm Hg obtains over a length of 3 or 4 cm. In the first two weeks of extrauterine life the LES is between 0.5 and 1 cm long, with a pressure of 3 mm Hg; pressure values in the LES equal adult values at about one month of age, showing that neuromuscular control of the sphincter has been achieved. Gastro-esophageal reflux, however, is very common in the newborn and not enough by itself to cause peptic disease of the esophagus; this requires the concomitance of morphological defects of the esophageal mucosa and/or dynamic-functional disturbances.

Moreover we supervised the regenerative behaviour of the gastric mucosa by means of in vivo autoradiography using 3H-thymidine. The experimental animals were divided into 5 treatment groups. We carried out gastroenterostomy on 9 animals (group I), Billroth's second operation on 7 animals (group II), a duodenal ligature, pyloroplasty and gastro-enterostomy with Braun's anastomosis on 10 animals (group III), a pylorectomy as well as Roux's gastro-enterostomy on 10 animals (group IV) and a laparotomy on 11 control animals (group V). The greatest tumour onset rates with 4 adenocarcinomas each were observed in the groups I and III, and with 5 carcinomas in group II 7 months after the operations. The labelling indices obtained autoradiographically are such that glandular hyperplasias with indices of over 13.3 p.c. and carcinomas with values of about 24.7 p.c. enable an unambiguous distinction from the values of the sound glandular gastric mucosa. Entero-gastric reflux is discussed in this paper as the most important cause of carcinogenesis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4040033/"}

One of these, a type I cell, localised mainly in the piloric portion, shows morphological and histochemical characteristics which are perfectly comparable with those of the enterochromaffin type found in the gastro-intestinal tract of mammals. On the other hand, the four remaining cellular types are more difficult to define; three of these latter are present solely in the pyloric mucose, i.e., (a) type II cells with slightly fluorescent and metachromatic granules, with a positive reaction to the Grimelius test and to proteine test, and completely negative and argentaffin methods, (b) type III cells with non-fluorescent granules, but metachromatic and postive to argentaffin methods, and (c) type IV cells with slightly (argyrophilic) granules, strongly metachromatic and positive to the PAS test and to the tryptophan test, respectively. Types II and IV have been hypothetically correlated with the G and D cells, respectively, of mammals. The fifth cellular type, present solely in the central portion of the stomach has exclusively argyrophilic granules. This latter cellular type is considered similar to the ECL type, mammalian cell.

Nine patients with esophago-gastro-plasty and 6 with esophago-jejuno-plasty, after esophagectomy for cancer, experienced a study of esophageal function. The study consisted of extended esophago-gastro-intestinal manometry, performed both while at digestive rest after a semi-solid meal, and of scintigraphy, performed to investigate gastric emptying. 24-hours esophago-gastric pH-metry was also executed, along with basal and stimulated acidity metering in, patients with gastroplasty. The fundamental alterations, from the manometric point of view in esophago-gastro-plasty, are the absence of phase III of the IMMC interdigestively and in the absence of a motor response when ingesting the meal. Scintigraphically this coincides with a fundamental alteration of gastric tubule emptying. On the contrary, in jejunoplasty the jejunal loop retains adequate motility, both during the interdigestive phase and following a meal. Such strikingly diverse motor behavior explains the higher quality of life of patients with jejunoplasty versus patients in whom the stomach is used to substitute for the esophagus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2067690/"}

In this study we have evaluated the effect of gastric distension on LOS function in 16 patients with untreated idiopathic achalasia and compared it with that in 10 healthy controls. With the subjects sitting, the stomach was distended with a liquid mixture that generated 750 ml CO2. Oesophageal pH and motility were monitored for 10 minutes before and after distension. In normal controls, gastric distension induced a four-fold increase in the rate of LOSRs and gas reflux episodes (as evidenced by oesophageal common cavities), whereas this response was absent in the achalasia patients. Basal LOS pressure did not change in either group. These findings are consistent with the notion that transient LOSRs induced by gastric distension are neurally mediated, probably by the same inhibitory nerves that govern swallow mediated LOS relaxation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2753398/"}

The results were as follows: 1. Migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) appeared less in SVA dogs, while frequency of basic electric rhythm (BER) with spike potentials (SP) per MMC period in the duodenum was normally maintained in SV+A'. 2. Postprandial ectopic excitation occurred in SVA, but less frequently in SV+A' than SV+A. SV+A' dogs showed a slower propagation of BER than control, but percent changes from the control nearly equaled that of antrectomized dogs, while in SV+V it was more slowed. 3. Under insulin hypoglycemia, occurrence of BER with SP was normally maintained in SV+A' dogs, but in SV+A it had apparently decreased, suggesting that the cholinergic nerve fiber was in the peduncle. A comparative study was also made of EMG responses to insulin hypoglycemia among SV+A' dogs.

Twenty-five patients were observed radiologically and clinically for a period of three to 20 months. The study was directed at the morphology of the transposed stomach and of the anastomosis, and particularly at the problem of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Knowledge of the operation site is essential for evaluating the transplant (pleura defect). Radiological examination is the most suitable method for evaluating the cervical extra-thoracic anastomosis in the early post-operative phase (six to ten days). It is also effective at a later stage for the early recognition of fibrotic stenosis which will require treatment. An attempt has been made to define an ideal situation following gastric transposition which will usually correspond with a good clinical result.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6216181/"}

The GILS nozzle was introduced at the pelvic flexure through a sterile enterotomy cuff and plastic sleeve. Water was first added through the GILS nozzle to mix intestinal ingesta to form a slurry and then the effluent was evacuated into the storage container by engaging the vacuum. Comparisons of this technique were made with the standard garden hose lavage technique. The GILS enables removal of 8.1 kg of large intestinal ingesta in less than 20 mins.

An animal model of antireflux surgery has been developed and used to investigate the effects of such surgery upon the emetic reflex and vagal influences on gastric motility. Following surgery, animals responded to a previously subemetic dose of a centrally acting opiate receptor agonist (loperamide), suggesting that fundoplication may sensitize the emetic reflex. A gastric vago-vagal reflex (tonic inhibition of corpus tone) and responses to direct stimulation of vagal motor efferents (both cholinergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic responses) were not significantly affected by antireflux surgery.

The efferent neurons involved at the level of the stomach are nonadrenergic noncholinergic. Deficient proximal gastric relaxation is observed in a portion of patients with functional dyspepsia, while exaggerated relaxation might contribute to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease via triggering of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations. Nitric oxide (NO) is mediating, together with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as parallel cotransmitter, the nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission of the proximal stomach. Evidence for a sequential link between VIP as neurotransmitter and muscular NO generation was obtained when studied in isolated gastric smooth muscle cells; inducible NO synthase seems expressed. The endogenous gastric nitrergic neurotransmitter is not sensitive to superoxide anion generators and NO scavengers, that reduce the relaxation to exogenous NO. This is not due to the release of a nerve-derived hyperpolarizing factor in addition of NO, nor to binding to thiols, but Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase is involved in the protection of endogenous NO versus superoxide anions and scavenging. The release of NO from gastric nitrergic neurons is not sensitive to negative feedback but is inhibited via presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Nitric oxide functionally antagonizes acetylcholine in the smooth muscle cells but does not influence the release of acetylcholine at the cholinergic varicosities. Stimulating or inhibiting the gastric nitrergic neurons might be a target for drug therapy in functional dyspepsia or gastro-esophageal reflux, respectively.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12238240/"}

We aimed to investigate the oesophago-gastro-Roux limb motor activity during fasting and after food intake. Eighteen morbidly obese patients were examined at least 2 years after RYGBP. A high-resolution manometry catheter was positioned to straddle the oesophagogastric junction, the gastric pouch and the proximal Roux limb using transmucosal potential difference measurements. Three patients with vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) were also studied. During the fasting state, the gastric pouch had low or no activity whereas the Roux limb exhibited regular migrating motility complexes (MMCs) being initiated just distal to gastroenteroanastomosis. Median cycle duration was 72 min, and the median propagating velocity of the phase III MMC phase was 2.7 cm/min (n = 8). When patients were asked to eat until they felt comfortably full, intraluminal pressure increased by 6 to 8 cmH₂O without any significant difference between gastric pouch and the Roux limb (n = 9). The increased intraluminal pressure following food intake correlated neither to weight loss nor to meal size or rate of eating. A successful RYGBP is associated with MMC in the Roux limb during fasting. The gastric pouch and the Roux limb behaved as a common cavity during food ingestion. Data do not support the hypothesis that the alimentary limb pressure in response to food intake influences either meal size or weight loss.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25736230/"}

However, polyphenols have very low bioavailability and stability, which make polyphenols a less bioactive compound. Many researchers have indicated that several factors might affect the efficiency and the metabolism (biotransformation) of various polyphenols, which include the gut microbiota, structure, and physical properties as well as its interactions with other dietary nutrients (macromolecules). Hence, this mini-review covers the two-way interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota (interplay) and how polyphenols are metabolized (biotransformation) to produce various polyphenolic metabolites. Moreover, the protective effects of numerous polyphenols and their metabolites against various gastrointestinal disorders/diseases including gastritis, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) like celiac disease (CED) are discussed. For this review, the authors chose only a few popular polyphenols (green tea polyphenol, curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin), and a discussion of their proposed mechanism underpinning the gastroprotection was elaborated with a special focus on clinical evidence. Overall, this contribution would help the general population and science community to identify a potent polyphenol with strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory properties to combat various gut-related diseases or disorders (complementary therapy) along with modified lifestyle pattern and standard gastroprotective drugs. However, the data from clinical trials are much limited and hence many large-scale clinical trials should be performed (with different form/metabolites and dose) to confirm the gastroprotective activity of the above-mentioned polyphenols and their metabolites before recommendation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33917379/"}

This study attempts to compare two procedures to produce a working model of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the rabbit: (i) cardiomyotomy and (ii) cardiomyectomy. The animals underwent intraoesophageal pH monitoring one week before and one week following surgery. The mean changes in % reflux time from preoperative to one week postoperative were compared. The cardiomyotomy group did not demonstrate significant gastro-oesophageal reflux (p > 0.2, p < 0.5), the mean change in % reflux time was 10.5 +/- 14.11%, whereas the cardiomyectomy group did demonstrate significant reflux (p < 0.001) with a mean change in % reflux time of 22.35 +/- 3.05%. A further study investigated the cardiomyectomy procedure in ten rabbits. Animals underwent preoperative, one-week and four-week postoperative intraoesophageal manometry and pH studies. The mean change in values from preoperative to four weeks postoperative were compared. There was a significant increase in mean % reflux time from a preoperative value of 3.05 +/- 2.29% to 42.08 +/- 12.05% at four weeks after surgery (p < 0.001). There was also a significant decrease in mean basal LOS pressure from a preoperative value of 15.00 +/- 5.49 mmHg to 4.45 +/- 1.90 mmHg four weeks following surgery (p < 0.001).

There are some discrepancies in the current guidelines regarding the value of incisura angularis biopsies. The aim of our study was to assess the value of incisura angularis biopsy in staging gastritis according to the OLGA and OLGIM systems by examining the atrophic, metaplastic and inflammatory changes in the antrum, incisura angularis and corpus. We enrolled 835 patients undergoing upper endoscopy. Three expert gastrointestinal pathologists graded biopsy specimens according to the Sydney classification and the stage of gastritis was assessed by the OLGA and OLGIM systems. The results demonstrated that severe atrophic, metaplastic and chronic inflammatory changes were more frequently observed in the incisura angularis mucosa than in the antrum or corpus mucosae (P<0.05). There was a general downgrading of stage by 18.0% for OLGA and by 4.0% for OLGIM when the incisura angularis was excluded from the staging. Furthermore, there was a 30-35% downgrading for high-risk OLGA/OLGIM stages. The incisura angularis undergoes more severe atrophic, metaplastic and chronic inflammatory changes than the antrum and corpus.

In the last years some studies examined a new minimal invasive technique, in which magnets are used to create gastroenteric anastomosis. A biosynthetic model was developed from combined synthetic materials with biogenic specimens taken from slaughtered domestic pigs. The procedure was performed with endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. To increase X-ray contrast differences the model was put into physiological saline solution. Two rare-earth magnets (Br: 2500 Gauss, D: 10 mm) with central hole were inserted with the help of a guiding wire and duodenal probe. The first magnet was placed in the first jejunal loop; the second one was placed in the stomach. The gastric magnet was maneuvered using the endoscope. When the magnets reached the right position, the guiding wires were removed to let the magnets stick together. The pressure between the magnets will result in a sterile inflammation on the living tissue which develops adhesion between the bowels, and 7-10 days later anastomosis will develop as a result of the necrosis. The biosynthetic model could be used for training endoscopy without sacrificing animals. In the end of the procedure the magnets stuck together across gastric and jejunal walls in all ten cases successfully. By practice the period necessary for the procedure could be decreased from 40 to 20 minutes. The technique could be made with standard upper endoscope and instruments, and after practice on living animals it could potentially be a useful solution for complaints of gastric outlet obstruction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17649852/"}

It is believed that gastric content may be a contributory factor in the development of upper gastro-intestinal diseases. In this work, selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) has been applied to the quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the headspace vapor of gastric content samples, which were retrieved from three groups of patients, including those with gastro-esophageal cancer, noncancer diseases of the upper gastro-intestinal tract, and a healthy cohort. Twelve VOCs have been investigated in this study; the following 7 VOCs, acetone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, hexanoic acid, hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl phenol, were found to be significantly different between cancer and healthy groups by the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for the combined VOCs of acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen sulphide, and methyl phenol to discriminate cancer patients from healthy controls. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.9. This result raises the prospect that a VOC profile rather than a single biomarker may be preferable in the molecular-orientated diagnosis of gastro-oseophageal cancer, and this warrants further investigation to assess its potential application as a new diagnostic test.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23035898/"}

A pH of 4 has been defined as a threshold below which refluxed gastric contents become injurious to the oesophagus. Studies in patients with erosive oesophagitis have shown that the 8-week healing rates produced by acid suppressive therapy are related to the duration of time over a 24-h period that the intragastric pH > 4. The most effective agents, providing more hours with gastric pH > 4 and higher healing rates in erosive oesophagitis patients, are the proton pump inhibitors. The intragastric pH is often used to gauge the efficacy of acid suppressive therapies. There are several factors, however, that may affect the clinical relevance of such data, and these should be taken into account when comparing the effectiveness of different therapies. Firstly, because of inter-individual variation, studies comparing therapies should be of a crossover design, so that responses to therapy are measured in the same individuals. Secondly, the Helicobacter pylori status of the individual should be known, as H. pylori infection has been shown to increase intragastric pH readings when examining the effect of acid suppressive therapy. Other factors, such as positioning of the pH electrode and the duration of previous therapy, also need to be standardized when using intragastric pH to assess the efficacy of different therapies. Crossover studies comparing standard doses of different proton pump inhibitors have shown that esomeprazole 40 mg produces a significantly greater amount of time at intragastric pH > 4 on day 5 of treatment than standard doses of other proton pump inhibitors. The correlation between greater efficacy in acid suppression and clinical benefit is supported by the findings that esomeprazole 40 mg is the only proton pump inhibitor to provide greater 8-week healing rates in patients with erosive oesophagitis than both omeprazole and lansoprazole. These data all suggest strongly that intragastric pH monitoring is an effective surrogate marker and a relevant predictor of outcome in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15456460/"}

The pattern of pacesetter potenitals in patients with gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, and duodenal ulcer was similar to that of patients without such diseases. Complete transection of the gastric corpus isolated the distal stomach from the natural pacemaker and resulted in the appearance of a new pacemaker in the distal stomach with a slower frequency.

The prominent attribute of its gross morphology was the cardiogastric gland (CGG), located near the oesophageal entrance. Light microscopy showed that the CGG was formed by invaginations of the mucosa into the submucosa, which contained densely packed proper gastric glands comprised primarily of parietal and chief cells. Mucous neck cells represented <0.1% of cells in the CGG gastric glands and 22-32% of cells in the proper gastric glands of the mucosa lining the stomach lumen. These data suggest that chief cells in the CGG develop from undifferentiated cells that migrate through the gastric gland neck rather than from mucous neck cells. Classical chief cell formation (i.e., arising from mucous neck cells) occurred in the mucosa lining the stomach lumen, however. The muscularis around the CGG consisted primarily of skeletal muscle tissue. The cardiac region was rudimentary while the fundus/corpus and pyloric regions were equally developed. Another unusual feature of the beaver stomach was the presence of specific mucus with a thickness up to 950 µm (in frozen, unfixed sections) that coated the mucosa. Our observations suggest that the formation of this mucus is complex and includes the secretory granule accumulation in the cytoplasm of pit cells, the granule aggregation inside cells, and the incorporation of degenerating cells into the mucus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24727802/"}

The electrical acivity of the muscle wall of the two stomach segments was recorded by silver bipolar ball-shaped electrodes. Two electrodes for myogenic stimulation were implanted in the distal segment. Transection caused dissociation of the slow potentials rhythm in both stomach segments: slow potentials frequency in the distal segment is considerably reduced. Infusion of cholino- and adreno-mimetics in the artery supplying the distal segment causes increase of the frequency of the slow potentials in the distal segment to reach the frequency of the proximal segment. Bocking of the intrinsic nervous system eliminates these responses. On the background myogenic stimulation induces increased frequency of the rhythm in the distal segment. It is concluded that the intrinsic nervous system plays a role in maintaining slow potentials frequency in the stomach at a higher level than the level characteristic of this stomach segment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/596172/"}

Anterior and posterior dynamic frames were simultaneously acquired for 18 min and all data were analyzed in MatLab. Three proximal-distal segmentations using regions of interest were adopted for both meals. Intragastric distribution of the meal between the proximal and distal compartments was strongly influenced by the way in which the stomach was divided, showing greater proximal retention after the 180 mL. An important finding was that both dominant frequencies (1 and 3 cpm) were simultaneously recorded in the proximal and distal stomach; however, the power ratio of those dominant frequencies varied in agreement with the segmentation adopted and was independent of the meal size.

Acupuncture-stimulation by exciting A delta and/or C afferent fibers, could only modulate gastric motility. Acupuncture-stimulation on fore- and hind-limbs evoked a moderate gastric motility followed by increased vagus discharges with unchanged sympathetic activity, while the same stimulus to the acupoints in abdomen resulted in reversed effects on gastric motility and autonomic nervous activities. The inhibitory gastric response was completely abolished by splanchnic denervation, but the facilitative gastric response to stimulation of acupoints in limbs was not influenced, which was opposite to the effect when vagotomy was performed. The similar depressive effects were produced by the stimulation at the acupoints homo-segmental to the gastric innervation in the animals with or without spinalization. However, the facilitation induced by the stimulation at the acupoints hetero-segmental to the gastric innervation was not observed in the spinalized animals. Facilitative effects of stimulating hetero-segmental acupoints are involved in the intact preparation of vagal nerves and spinal cord, while the inhibitory response induced by stimulating homo-segmental acupoints is involved in the intact preparation of sympathetic nerves.

Stomach function depends on the timing and amplitude of wall contractions, the fill level and the type of gastric content. Using a coupled biomechanical-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (B-SPH) model, we investigate how gastric discharge is affected by the contraction behaviour of the stomach wall and the viscosity of the content. The results of the model provide new insights into how the content viscosity and the number of compression waves down the length of the stomach affect the mixing within and the discharge rate of the content exiting from the stomach to the duodenum. This investigation shows that the B-SPH model is capable of simulating complicated stomach behaviour. The rate of gastric emptying is found to increase with a smaller period in between contractile waves and to have a nonlinear relationship with content viscosity. Increased resistance to flow into the duodenum is also shown to reduce the rate of emptying. The degree of gastric mixing is found to be insensitive to changes in the period between contractile waves for fluid with a viscosity of water but to be substantially affected by the viscosity of the gastric content.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29775189/"}

Electrical activity of the muscle wall was recorded before and after feeding. When reaching the terminal ileum the active part of the migrating myoelectrical complex (MMC) continuously induced bursts of spike potentials superimposed on the slow waves. This electrical activity spread to the ascending colon. We also showed the existence of a spike activity on the terminal ileum independent of the MMC (appearing during the phase 1) and propagating to the colon. A relationship between the spike activities of the small and large intestines was also present after feeding. Beside the well-known gastro-colic reflex, we observed an increase in the spike activity of the terminal ileum and ascending colon between the 4th-5th hours after feeding. This probably corresponds to the arrival of the first portions of contents, evacuated from the arrival of the first portions of contents, evacuated from the stomach, and of the last portions of small intestinal contents. In conclusion, there is a relationship between the spike activities of the small and large intestines in starving animals and after feeding, and the terminal ileum plays a substantial role in this relationship.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1941640/"}

As yet, no isolated target cell that responds specifically to this family of peptides has been described. The present report describes the in vitro effect of human synthetic GLIC, OXM and octapeptide-bearing fragments on smooth muscle cells isolated from the rabbit antrum. GLIC or OXM decreased the mean length of the cells by: 13.9 +/- 0.8% and 15.5 +/- 0.9%, respectively - GLIC being 16 times more potent than OXM (respective EC50 values: 5 and 83 pM). The C-terminal fragments OXM(19-37) and OXM(30-37) were as efficient as GLIC or OXM. Their potencies were OXM = OXM(19-37)>>OXM(30-37). Glucagon, which corresponds to OXM without the C-terminal octapeptide, or glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36 amide) did not have any effect. The response to OXM was not influenced by antagonists to muscarinic, cholecystokinin or substance P receptors.

Abnormal SW activity is associated with gastric motility disorders. Gastric pacing is a potential treatment method to restore rhythmic SW activity. However, to date, the efficacy of gastric pacing is inconsistent and the underlying mechanisms of gastric pacing are poorly understood. Optical mapping is widely used in cardiac electrophysiology studies. Its immunity to pacing artifacts offers a distinct advantage over conventional electrical mapping for studying pacing. In the present study, we first found that optical mapping can image pacing-induced virtual electrode polarization patterns in the stomach (adjacent regions of depolarized and hyperpolarized tissue). Second, we found that elicited SWs usually (15 of 16) originated from the depolarized areas of the stimulated region (virtual cathodes). To our knowledge, this is the first direct observation of virtual electrode polarization patterns in the stomach. Conclusions: Optical mapping can image virtual electrode polarization patterns during gastric pacing with high spatial resolution.Clinical Relevance- Gastric pacing is a potential therapeutic method for gastric motility disorders.

The video shows our laparoscopic treatment of an excluded gastric fundus dilatation. A 21-year-old woman with history of RYGB was admitted in our center for recurrent abdominal pain. Many consultations have been performed before for the same reason and without explanation for this chronic abdominal pain. We found that a dilatation of the excluded gastric fundus was responsible for recurrent abdominal pain and thus required revisional surgery. An abdominal computed tomography with oral contrast study showed an atypical dilatation of the excluded stomach without gastro-gastric fistula or others abnormal findings. Intra-operative exploration then revealed multiple adhesions. During surgery, released of the excluded stomach allow to confirm a dilatation of the excluded fundus due to error in stapling when performing the vertical part of the gastric pouch of the RYGB. We resected the excluded dilated gastric fundus. An uneventful post-operative course enabled rapid discharge (post-operative day 3). Dilatation of the excluded gastric pouch due to staple line misfiring during RYGB is a rare complication and can explain chronic abdominal pain.

A more reliable and effective approach to bariatric surgery may integrate different expertise, in the areas of surgery, physiology and biomechanics, availing of a strong cooperation between clinicians and engineers. This work aimed at developing a computational model of the stomach, as a computational tool for the physio-mechanical investigation of stomach functionality and the planning of bariatric procedures. In this sense, coupled experimental and numerical activities were developed. Experimental investigations on pig and piglet stomachs aimed at providing information about stomach geometrical configuration and structural behavior. The computational model was defined starting from the analysis of data from histo-morphometric investigations and mechanical tests. A fiber-reinforced visco-hyperelastic constitutive model was developed to interpret the mechanical response of stomach tissues; constitutive parameters were identified considering mechanical tests at both tissue and structure levels. Computational analyses were performed to investigate the pressure-volume behavior of the stomach. The developed model satisfactorily interpreted results from experimental activities, suggesting its reliability. Furthermore, the model was exploited to investigate stress and strain fields within gastric tissues, as the stimuli for mechanoreceptors that interact with the central nervous system leading to the feeling of satiety. In this respect, the developed computational model may be employed to evaluate the influence of bariatric intervention on the stimulation of mechanoreceptors, and the following meal induced satiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30783831/"}

Three gross anatomical types of stomachs are described and their shapes appear to correlate somewhat with feeding habits. Each type can be divided histologically into a corpus and pylorus. Gastric glands, containing only one cell type, occur in the copora of all species, but are present in the pylori of esocids only. As a single cell can produce both enzymes and hydrochloric acid such cells may be comparable to those of amphibians but not mammals. Lamina propria and submucosa are indistinctly separated in corpora but better defined in pylori by an intervening muscularis mucosa. The arrangement of the muscularis into inner circular and outer longitudinal layers is the opposite of that seen in the esophagus. Gastric mucous cells show species variations in localization of epithelial mucosubstances, which in broad terms are recognized as sulfomucins, sialomucins and neutral mucosubstances. A piscivorous diet does not appear to demand any particular type of carbohydrate. Within the Centrarchidae, gastric pit cells vary in carbohydrate content from only neutral mucosubstance to only weakly acidic sulfomucin; two species contain both types. A positive PAS reaction on the surface of gastric epithelial cells is suggestive of a striated border and thus possibly absorptive function.

The special adaptations that enable H. pylori to colonize this well-protected habitat have been intensively studied over the last three decades. In contrast, our knowledge concerning bacteria other than H. pylori in the human stomach is still quite limited. However, a substantial body of evidence documents convincingly that bacteria can regularly be sampled from the stomachs of healthy adults. Commonly detected phyla include Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, and characteristic genera are Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium. In this review, we summarize the available literature about the gastric microbiota in humans and selected model animals, discuss the methods used in its characterization, and identify gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed to advance our understanding of the bacterial colonization of the different layers of the gastric mucosa and its potential role in health and disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23790154/"}

The effect of omeprazole was also investigated for comparison. Dimaprit-induced acid secretion was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by both PPIs in a dose-dependent manner. In the isolated rabbit gastric glands, both PPIs elicited marked reductions in histamine- and dbcAMP-evoked acid secretion with similar potency. The lesions induced by either AE or INDO were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the presence of either esomeprazole or omeprazole compared to control values. Increasing doses of esomeprazole before AE treatment resulted in a marked degree of cytoprotection and an elevation in the concentration of bound PGE2 in the stomach tissue homogenate. The results show that esomeprazole and omeprazole were equally effective against gastric haemorrhagic lesions induced by either AE or INDO and in inhibiting dimaprit-, dbcAMP- and histamine-induced gastric acid secretion in the rat and rabbit stomach both in vivo and in vitro.

The stomach is detached from the oesophago-gastric junction with an articulated 5-mm stapler, leaving a 5-mm strip of stomach attached to the oesophagus. An end-to-side isoperistaltic oesophago-jejunostomy is created between the gastric stump and the isoperistaltic jejunal Roux loop. A jejuno-jejunal anastomosis restores bowel continuity.

Alteration of these control mechanisms may lead to different situations, which are frequently associated with symptoms. An impaired tonic contraction of the proximal stomach, that is, an impaired gastric tone, results in gastroparesis. Patients with functional dyspepsia, and also patients with achalasia, have impaired meal accommodation of the stomach. Interestingly, patients with functional dyspepsia may also have a sensory dysfunction, and both dysfunctions could play a synergistic role. However, the sensory dysfunction in dyspepsia, particularly the types of afferent fibres affected, and the mechanisms of impaired accommodation, still remain to be characterized. Evaluation of gastric function has been approached using the barostat. However, the barostat has limitations and potential technical pitfalls that require proper attention. Meal ingestion induces a variety of reflexes and the net result is a relaxation of the stomach. However, gastric reflexes can be best evaluated with the stomach empty, when the stimuli are applied at a different site. Nevertheless, altered reflex responses may be difficult to interpret. For instance, absent or decreased relaxatory responses may equally correspond to a gastroparetic stomach without tone or to a dyspeptic stomach unable to relax. In this context, it may be important to measure basal tone. Distension of the stomach by means of the barostat has been also used to test gastric sensitivity. However, recent studies have shown that perception of gastric distension relays on stimulation of tension receptors; since wall tension depends on both pressure and volume, distension with the barostat may be difficult to standardize. Hopefully, a battery of tests may become available in the near future for a complete neuromuscular evaluation of the gut.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9831265/"}

Revision from a horizontal to a vertical staple line may result in a stenosis at the site of the gastro-gastrostomy. This study examines the authors' experience with balloon dilation of these strictures. Between May, 1981 and September, 1987, 12 of 113 patients who had revision of previous gastric reduction procedures developed either gastro-gastrostomy stenosis or stenosis above the Marlex collar (2 patients). Endoscopic balloon dilatation was attempted in all 12 patients. Eight females and four males (average age, 42 years) had undergone either a previous vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) (2 patients), gastric bypass, or horizontal gastroplasty as their initial operation. Revision was performed for failure of the initial operation to control weight, obstructive symptoms, or gastroesophageal reflux. Balloon dilatation was possible in 11 of 12 patients. The majority required less than four dilations to alleviate obstructive symptoms. Balloon dilatation is effective in the management of gastro-gastrostomy stenosis following revision of gastric stapling procedures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2916798/"}

We speculated that if the enteric neurons of the reconstructed gastric tube survived functionally, the motility of the gastric tube could be facilitated and the recovery process after operation would improve as a consequence. In the present study we investigated whether direct electrical stimulation was effective for facilitating the motility of the canine vagotomized stomach. Dogs underwent truncal vagotomy by transabdominal approach and, in some cases, arteries to the upper stomach and the oesophagus were also ligated and resected to resemble the blood supply and surgical invasion of the reconstructed gastric tube. Electrical stimulation, a few minutes of positive rectangular current pulses, amplitude 20 V (or 15 mA), duration 0.5 ms and frequency between 0.2 and 7 Hz, was delivered on the greater curvature of the mid corpus. Changes in mechanical contractions were recorded using strain gauge force transducers. Electrical stimulation successfully enhanced the mechanical force of the phasic ring contractions of the vagotomized stomach in a frequency dependent manner. Aboral propagation and periodicity of the contractions, impaired by surgical procedures, were restored during stimulation. These excitatory effects were inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium and tetrodotoxin, suggesting that electrical stimulation acts on intramural cholinergic nerves that have survived functionally. These results suggest that electrical stimulation could be an effective method for improving the motility of the vagotomized stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9195377/"}

{"id": "14695027", "title": "Electrophysiological properties of gastric pacemaker potentials.", "text": "Electrophysiological properties of pacemaker potentials recorded from myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-MY) within the guinea-pig gastric antrum are reviewed briefly. Pacemaker potentials consist of two components, a primary component forming a transient depolarization with a rapidly rising initial phase, followed by a secondary component as a plateau with sustained depolarization. The primary component is inhibited by low [Ca2+]o solutions or depolarization of the membrane with high [K+]o solutions. This inhibition could be mimicked by chelating [Ca2+]i with BAPTA-AM, suggesting that this component is produced by activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ permeable channels. The plateau component is inhibited by low [Cl-]o solution or DIDS, an inhibitor of Ca2+-activated Cl(-)-channels, suggesting that this component is formed by Ca2+-activated Cl(-)-currents. Reduction of Ca2+ release from internal stores by inhibiting the internal Ca-pump with cyclopiazonic acid results in a shortened duration of the plateau component, with no alteration in the rate of rise of the primary component. 2-APB, an inhibitor of the IP3-receptor mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores, abolishes pacemaker potentials, suggesting that the release of Ca2+ from internal IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores is required for generation of pacemaker potentials. CCCP, a mitochondrial protonophore, depolarizes the membrane and abolishes pacemaker potentials, suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ handling functions may be coupled with generation of pacemaker potentials. These results indicate that the two components of pacemaker potentials are generated by different mechanisms; the primary component may be produced by activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+-permeable channels, while the plateau component may be produced by the opening of Ca2+-activated Cl(-)-channels. It is hypothesized that pacemaker potentials are initiated by depolarization of the membrane due to generation of unitary potentials in response to mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. Activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, IP3-receptor mediated Ca2+ release from the internal stores and Ca2+-activated Cl(-)-channels may be involved as successive steps downstream to the generation of unitary potentials.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14695027/"}

Pathology files of gastroduodenal biopsies received at St. Mary's hospital, Northern Uganda, between 2007 and 2017 were reviewed. Pubmed search was performed under the headings \"Strongyloides stercoralis\", \"Gastric parasitosis\". Histology of the only gastroduodenal biopsy with SS infection showed parasite eggs, immature rhabditiform larvae, and numerous adult worms in gastric pits and rhabditiform larvae in interepithelial parasitic tunnels, causing reactive changes of the glandular epithelium. There was no significant acute inflammatory cell infiltrate surrounding the parasites. Literature review showed that gastric SS infection appears to be very uncommon and was, as expected, largely prevalent in immunodeficient individuals (84.2% of published cases). The rare gastric SS infection is a complication of systemic strongyloidiasis, either hyperinfective, or disseminated form. It is also commonly associated with duodenal infection at microscopical examination. Involvement of gastric mucosa in the absence of duodenal strongyloidiasis appears to be quite rare and false-negative histopathological exams are reported if only the stomach is biopsied.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34143401/"}

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study uses a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model to study the deformation and mechanical breakdown of solid beads in a liquid medium within a realistic three-dimensional representation of the stomach geometry. The model incorporates peristaltic contraction waves, including Terminal Antral Contractions (TACs), which are high-amplitude and high-speed travelling occlusions observed in the distal region of the stomach. The solid beads are modelled using elastic-plastic (EP) and elastic-brittle (EB) constitutive laws. Results show that the stomach wall can induce significant compression and fragmentation in the solid beads through direct contact, and the accompanying fluid flow contributes towards further mechanical change. An originally spherical EP bead closest to the pylorus is extruded into a thin cylindrical shape, generating 15 fragments with a 5% higher surface area, before being propelled away from the TAC region. A model-parameter sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in yield stress substantially reduces the fragmentation but not the elongation. An EB bead near the pylorus deforms less but fractures into 235 small fragments and a large chunk, leading to an overall 12% higher surface area. The EB bead remains near the pylorus, fracturing further over multiple peristaltic cycles. Increased fracture strength, represented by a higher threshold strain, significantly reduces the surface area change and the number of fragments generated by the wall contractions. These results show how a coupled biomechanics-fluid-elastic-plastic-fracture model can be used to investigate the mechanical breakdown of solid foods in the stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40689702/"}

The patients were 546 (84%) women and 104 (16%) men whose average weight was 125 kg (range: 78 to 218 kg). The average female age was 37 years (range: 17 to 69 years) and the average male age 36 (range: 19 to 64 years). Preoperative mean body mass index was 46 kg/m2 (range 31-78 kg/m2). The patients underwent radiological upper gastroenteric investigation employing water soluble contrast material between the 4th and 7th postoperative day. All patients underwent another late examination every year after surgery. At 10 years follow-up in 620 patients submitted to modified Mason VBG we observed the following early postoperative complications: 16 cases (2.6%) of oedema of the stoma, six cases (0.9%) of gastro-oesophageal reflux, one case (0.2%) of staple-line disruption, and one case (0.2%) of intragastric haemorrhage. Late complications in VBG included 26 cases (4.2%) of staple-line disruption, four cases (0.6%) of kinked stomas, six cases (0.9%) of pouch dilatations, two cases (0.4%) of stomal stenosis and one case (0.2%) of gastro-oesophageal reflux. In 30 RYGBP patients we observed the following early postoperative complications: one case (0.8%) of dilated pouch, one case (0.8%) of oedema of the anastomosis and one case (0.8%) of anastomotic leak. Late postoperative complications in the 30 RYGBP patients included three cases (2.5%) of stomal ulcers and one case (0.8%) of gastro-oesophageal reflux. We also examined the annual incidence of complications in late follow-up. Both early and late radiological studies after gastric bariatric surgery enable the detection of postoperative complications and provided morphological and volumetric data after VBG and RYGBP.

GAD immunocytochemistry was carried out on polyethylene glycol or cryostat sections of alkaline paraformaldehyde fixed tissue, with simultaneous immunolabelling of various gastro-pancreatic hormones for topographical comparison. In the rat stomach, nerve fibers displaying intense GAD-like immunoreactivity were seen in the myenteric plexus, the circular muscular layer, the submucosa and the lamina propria of the mucosa. But, they were absent from the submucous plexus. Colchicine treatment of the rats allowed to detect some labelled perikarya in the myenteric plexus suggesting that the GABAergic innervation is at least partly intrinsic to the stomach. In the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, endocrine cells appeared immunostained for GAD. However, the nature of their hormones remained unknown since double immunodetections revealed that they were immunoreactive neither for gastrin nor for somatostatin. In the rat and mouse pancreas, GAD-like immunoreactivity was found in islet cells which corresponded only to insulin-secreting cells. Somatostatin-, glucagon- and pancreatic polypeptide-immunopositive cells were devoid of GAD immunolabelling. No GAD-like immunoreactivity was detected in the exocrine tissue and innervation.

Septotomy has been indicated as an effective procedure, but the technical aspects have not been detailed in previous publications (Campos JM, Siqueira LT, Ferraz AA, et al., J Am Coll Surg 204(4):711, 2007; Baretta G, Campos J, Correia S, et al., Surg Endosc 29(7):1714-20, 2015; Campos JM, Pereira EF, Evangelista LF, et al., Obes Surg 21(10):1520-9, 2011). We herein present a video (6 min) demonstrating the maneuver principles of this technique, showing it as a safe and feasible approach. A 32-year-old male, with BMI 43.4 kg/m(2), underwent LSG. On the tenth POD, he presented with a leak and initially was managed with the following approach: laparoscopic exploration, drainage, endoclips, and 20-mm balloon dilation. However, the leak remained for a period of 6 months. On the endoscopy, a septum was identified between the leak site and gastric pouch, so it was decided to \"reshape\" this area by septotomy. Septotomy procedure: Sequential incisions were performed using argon plasma coagulation (APC) with 2.5 flow and 50 W (WEM, SP, Brazil) over the septum in order to allow communication between the perigastric cavity (leak site) and the gastric lumen. The principles below must be followed: (1) Scope position: the endoscopist's left hand holds the control body of the gastroscope while the right hand holds the insertion tube; the APC catheter has no need to be fixed. This avoids movements and unprogrammed maneuvers. (2) Before cutting, the septum is placed in the six o'clock position on the endoscopic view, by rotating the gastroscope. (3) The septum is sectioned until the bottom of the perigastric cavity (leak site). (4) That section is made towards the staple line. (5) Just after the septotomy, a Savory-Gilliard guidewire (Cook Medical, Indiana, USA) through the scope must be inserted until the duodenum, followed by 30-mm balloon (Rigiflex®, Boston Scientific, MA, USA) insertion. The balloon catheter must be firmly held during gradual inflation (maximum 10 psi) to avoid slippage and laceration. This allows increasing the gastric lumen. (6) Septotomy by electrocautery with a needle knife (Boston Scientific, MA, USA) can be made when an intensive fibrotic septum is present; bleeding is rare in this case. In this case, the endoclip previously used was removed from the septum with forceps to avoid heat transmission. Small staples visualized in the fistula orifice were not completely removed due to technical difficulties and friable tissue. Two sessions were performed in 15 days, resulting in leak closure. The patient was submitted to radiological control 1 week after the second session, which revealed fistula healing, without gastric stenosis. The nasoduodenal feeding tube remained for 7 days, when the patient started oral diet. This patient was followed for 18 months without recurrence. Septotomy and balloon dilation were initially performed on a difficult-to-treat chronic fistula after gastric bypass and named before as stricturotomy (Campos JM, Siqueira LT, Ferraz AA, et al., J Am Coll Surg 204(4):711, 2007). This procedure allows internal drainage of the fistula and deviates oral intake to the pouch. In addition, achalasia balloon dilation treats strictures and axis deviation of the gastric chamber, promoting reduction of the intragastric pressure. Septotomy and balloon dilation are technically feasible and might be useful in selected cases for closure of chronic leaks after LSG.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27299918/"}

Station pull-through manometry was performed to record the axial and circumferential asymmetry of LES pressure. Circular and longitudinal muscle were thicker in the LES compared with in the esophagus. There was a close correlation between the axial asymmetry in LES pressure and circular muscle thickness. The thickness of LES muscle increased and decreased with an increase and decrease in the LES pressure, respectively. The circumferential asymmetry in resting LES pressure was related to the noncircular shape of the LES. A swallow-induced LES relaxation was followed by its contraction. During the contraction phase, the LES and esophagus showed relative symmetry in pressure and shape. We conclude that the axial asymmetry of LES pressure is explained by its muscle thickness.

We used the partitioned chamber method to study the passive and active properties of pyloric muscles, and we found that length constants of circular muscles of myenteric region were significantly longer than muscles near the submucosal surface. These data suggested differences in either membrane resistance, junctional resistance, or cytoplasmic resistance. The first parameter was evaluated by measuring time constants in intact tissues and single cells isolated from the submucosal and myenteric regions. Membrane time constants were not different in the two regions, nor were differences found in the input resistances of isolated cells. Morphological studies failed to demonstrate differences in cell diameters in the two regions suggesting that cytoplasmic resistances are similar. These findings suggest that the different cable properties in the two regions may be due to differences in electrical coupling. Morphological examination revealed similar numbers of gap junctions between cells in the two regions, but large differences were noted in the size of muscular bundles. Muscles of the myenteric region were arranged into large, tightly packed bundles, whereas muscles of the submucosal region consisted of small bundles with an extensive extracellular space filled with connective tissue. We suggest that the difference in cable properties may be due to differences in electrical coupling between bundles. These data suggest that submucosal muscles function more like a multiunit smooth muscle, whereas myenteric muscles behave as a single unit.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2003606/"}
{"id": "24607410", "title": "Pharmacological evidence for the participation of NO-cGMP-KATP pathway in the gastric protective effect of curcumin against indomethacin-induced gastric injury in the rat.", "text": "Curcumin, main compound obtained from rizhoma of Curcuma longa, shows antitumoral, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and gastric protective properties. Recently, it has been demonstrated that curcumin exerts its gastric protective action due to an increase in gastric nitric oxide (NO) levels. However, it is unknown whether these increased NO levels are associated with activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of NO-cGMP-KATP pathway in the gastric protective effect of curcumin during indomethacin-induced gastric injury in the rat. Adult female Wistar rats were gavaged with curcumin (3-300mg/kg, p.o.) or omeprazole (30mg/kg, p.o.) 30min before indomethacin insult (30mg/kg, p.o.). Other groups of rats were administered L-NAME (70mg/kg, i.p.; inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase), ODQ (10mg/kg, i.p.; inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase) or glibenclamide (1mg/kg, i.p.; blocker of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels) 30min before curcumin (30mg/kg, p.o.). 3h after indomethacin administration, rats were sacrificed and gastric injury was evaluated by determining total damaged area. A sample of gastric tissue was harvested and processed to quantify organic nitrite levels. Curcumin significantly protected against indomethacin-induced gastric injury and this effect was comparable to gastroprotective effect by omeprazole. L-NAME, ODQ and glibenclamide significantly prevented the curcumin-mediated gastric protective effect in the indomethacin-induced gastric injury model. Furthermore, curcumin administration induced a significant increase in gastric nitric oxide levels as compared to vehicle administration. Our results show for the first time that curcumin activates NO/cGMP/KATP pathway during its gastro protective action.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24607410/"}

The dilatation was also observed in group B, but less prominent. 2) For the recovery from the gastric dilatation and reappearance of gastric motility, it took much more time in group A than in group B. 3) Co-ordinated movements across the anastomotic site were recognized about one month after operation in group B and about two months in group A. 4) Antiperistalsis at the preserved antrum during an early postoperative period was observed in 2 of 16 cases in group B. The antiperistalsis in the two cases turned into normo-peristalsis in about two months. 5) From the results obtained, the preserved antrum showed an excellent functional drainage effect and plays an important role for the transportation of the gastric content. 6) In conclusion, antrum preserving gastrectomy results in a good postoperative gastric motility and is an excellent operative method for the benign lesions located near the angle of the stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1238837/"}

Mammalian single compartment stomachs can be considered as having four anatomical regions fundus, corpus, antrum, and pyloric sphincter. Functional regions are the proximal stomach, primarily concerned with adjusting gastric volume, the distal stomach, primarily involved in churning and propelling the content, and the pyloric sphincter that regulates passage of chyme into the duodenum. The proximal stomach extends from the dome of the fundus to a circumferential band where propulsive waves commence (slow waves of the pacemaker region), and the distal stomach consists of the pacemaker region and the more distal regions that are traversed by waves of excitation, that travel as far as the pyloric sphincter. Thus, the proximal stomach includes the fundus and different extents of the corpus, whereas the distal stomach consists of the remainder of the corpus and the antrum. The distributions of aglandular regions and of specialized glands, such as oxyntic glands, differ vastly between species and, across species, have little or no relation to anatomical or functional regions. It is hoped that this review helps to clarify nomenclature that defines gastric regions that will provide an improved basis for drawing conclusions for different investigations of the stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36912719/"}

The gastric accommodation process is a complex phenomenon that describes how the size of the gastric compartment changes in response to a meal. The electronic barostat is considered the gold standard in assessing gastric accommodation. Imaging methods, including MRI, SPECT, and ultrasonography may also be used, particularly in patients who are stress-responsive, e.g. functional dyspepsia patients, as a non-invasive and less stress-inducing method is favourable. Ultrasonography satisfies these criteria as it does not by itself distort the physiological response in stress-responsive individuals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16718805/"}

The most probable portal of entry of the scrapie agent in sheep is the alimentary tract; little attention, however, has been paid to the gastro-intestinal tract in scrapie research. In this study, we examined the presence and distribution of PrPSc within the gastro-intestinal tract of sheep with natural scrapie and scrapie-negative sheep. It was found that PrPSc accumulated in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of all scrapie-infected sheep but not in scrapie-negative sheep. The distribution of PrPSc within the ENS was then studied along the entire gastro-intestinal tract in seven scrapie-infected sheep carrying various PrP genotypes. In sheep with the highest genetically determined susceptibility to scrapie, PrPSc was detected in the ENS from the oesophagus to the rectum. In sheep with a lower genetic susceptibility to scrapie, PrPSc was present in the ENS of the forestomachs, small intestine and large intestine but not in the oesophagus. In a scrapie-negative sheep with a PrP genotype associated with scrapie resistance, no PrPSc was seen in the ENS at any site along the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of PrPSc within the ENS of scrapie-infected sheep indicates a possible role of the ENS in the pathogenesis of natural scrapie as a portal of entry to the central nervous system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10373293/"}

Both kinds of smooth muscle segments were divided into 5 groups equally: group A (control group), group B (methylene blue and intense illumination were used to destroy the ICC therein), group C (motilin was added into the Krebs solution), group D (both motilin and anti-motilin serum were added), and group E (motilin and atropin or hexahydroxy-quaternary ammonium were added). stable contractile activity was recorded in these 2 kinds of smooth muscle segments with higher frequency and amplitude of contraction in those from the gastric antrum than those from the stomach body. The frequency and amplitude of contraction in the smooth muscle segments with the ICC destroyed by methylene blue and intense illumination were decreased by 80% approximately 90%. Motilin increased the frequency and amplitude of contraction in the smooth muscle segments from the gastric antrum and stomach body dose-dependently.

The aim of this study was to investigate if preservation of the right gastro-epiploic artery (GEA) during standard omentectomy would have a positive effect on gastric emptying after CRS-HIPEC. Forty-two patients subjected to a CRS-HIPEC were randomized into two groups perioperatively before performing an omentectomy: in Group I (N = 21) omentectomy was performed with preservation of the GEA; in Group II (N = 21) omentectomy was performed with resection of the GEA. The primary endpoint was the number of days to full oral intake of solid food. Secondary endpoints were number of days to intended occlusion of gastrostomy catheter and total hospital admission time. No significant differences were discovered between both groups in any of the study endpoints after CRS-HIPEC. No significant differences were observed in patient or operation characteristics between the randomized groups. No association was demonstrated between preservation of the gastro-epiploic artery during omentectomy and gastric emptying after CRS-HIPEC.

The prospective glandular epithelium invaginated at day 5 in the proventriculus and gradually developed to prospective proventricular glands. The muscular coat became distinguished at day 7 and day 8 in the proventriculus and gizzard, respectively. Transformation into simple columnar epithelium occurred in both proventriculus and the gizzard at day 12. The gizzard epithelium gave rise to tubular invaginations also at day 12. Canalization of the gizzard tubular glands was recognized at day 14. By day 15, the proventricular surface epithelium invaginated in a concentric manner around a central cavity to form immature secretory units that contained inactive oxyntico-peptic cells. The mucosal folding in the gizzard appeared at day 15 to form plicae and sulci.

Our aim was to modify the procedure using an established reconstruction already practised in gastric and bariatric surgery, thereby preventing operative sequelae that lead to a poor quality of life (eg reflux oesophagitis and vomiting). During the first postoperative year, our first two patients experienced weight loss, indigestion and lower bowel symptoms with no apparent improvement in gastric function compared with a standard gastric tube pull-up reconstruction.

The difference in emptying curves with respect to types of stomach forms were obvious in fundic body emptying curve rather than that of whole stomach. Two patterns were recognized for antral area, simple decreasing type and increasing then decreasing type. The former was for hook-shaped stomach and the latter was for other three forms. Shoulder formation observed in whole stomach and fundic-body curves was considered that it filled antrum but scarcely emptied to duodenum. It was imperative to refer three emptying curves of whole stomach, fundic-body and antral area for analyzing the gastric emptying.

Both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of compounds can be evaluated and specific mechanisms of action can also be investigated. Acid secretion is induced by substances that directly activate parietal cell receptors (histamine and bethanechol), by indirect stimuli, like 2-deoxy-D-glucose, by electrical stimulation of vagal nerves, or by the peptide pentagastrin. Reference antisecretory drugs are represented by histamine H(2) receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. This model allows the evaluation of complete dose-response curves together with a time-course of the secretory/antisecretory effects. Indirect effects involving activation or inhibition of vagal pathways are evaluated in intact animals by means of electrical vagal stimulation or in vagotomized animals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20967747/"}

This study aims to evaluate progressively the tissue perfusion of the stomach in ischemic conditioning, establishing the best moment for gastric transposition. Twenty-four male EPM-1 Wistar rats were used, which also underwent partial desvacularization of the stomach by ligature of the left gastric vessels. Tissue perfusion was measured through flowmetry by laser Doppler (tissue perfusion unit; TPU) in the antrum (10 mm distal from the cardiac region). This measurement was done before (baseline) and immediately after the ligature, and on different postoperative days (POD) (days 3, 7, 10, and 14). A statistical analysis was done with nonparametric tests (P <or= 0.05). The mean value (+/-SD) of the gastric perfusion, during the whole study period, was 88 +/- 6 (baseline), 23 +/- 5 (postligature), 31 +/- 5 (3rd POD), 55 +/- 4 (7th POD), 71 +/- 16 (10th POD), and 84 +/- 6 (14th POD), respectively. Perfusion immediately after the artery ligature was significantly lower (74%) than the baseline of the gastric perfusion; therefore, in the following days, tissue perfusion increased progressively (35%, 63%, 81%, and 96%, respectively). The flowmetry of the stomach reached basal values in the 14th POD of desvascularization, suggesting that this would the best day to perform a gastric transposition.

To investigate whether luminal nitric oxide can diffuse into the adjacent digestive tissue and alter tissue integrity. We designed an animal model using Wistar rats in which physiological concentrations of nitrite and acidified ascorbic acid were administered separately so that the two reactants first meet to form nitric oxide at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Luminal and tissue concentrations of nitric oxide were measured with an electrode and an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer, respectively. Concentrations of glutathione in the tissue were measured as a marker of nitrosative stress. High concentrations of luminal nitric oxide were generated locally at the gastro-oesophageal junction of nitrite administered rats, reproducing a phenomenon observed in humans. High levels of nitric oxide were also detected largely in the superficial epithelium of the gastro-oesophageal junction. The concentration of tissue glutathione at the gastro-oesophageal junction was significantly lower in nitrite administered rats compared with control rats, whereas that in the distal stomach was similar in the two rat groups. Using an animal model, this study demonstrated that nitric oxide generated in the lumen diffuses into the adjacent gastric tissue to a substantial degree, leading to localised consumption of glutathione in the tissue.

{"id": "39694163", "title": "Implications of compressive loading of the stomach wall: Interplay between mechanical deformation and microstructure.", "text": "During gastric surgery, the stomach wall is compressed with clamps and sutures or staple lines. These short- and long-term deformations can severely compromise the integrity of the tissue and make it difficult for the stomach wall to respond and remodel to the new loading conditions. Consequently, serious intra- and postoperative complications such as the formation of leaks during bariatric surgeries, can be associated with these immense tissue deformations. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the effects of compressive loading of the stomach wall in the radial direction. This was done by macroscopic mechanical loading of the stomach wall in each region of the stomach and evaluating the microstructural changes inflicted in the tissue. For this purpose, several imaging techniques were used, i.e., a histological analysis, second-harmonic generation microscopy, and X-ray micro-computed tomography. The combination of these three methods allowed us to investigate the gradual compression of the different stomach layers as well as the local reorientation and deformation of the main microstructural components, e.g., collagen fibers and muscle bundles. Importantly, this study found that the collagen bundles in the stomach wall straighten and reorient toward the circumferential-longitudinal plane and partially fan out with increased radial compressive deformation. The 3D scans of the stomach wall indicated a deterioration of the blood vessels and buckling of the mucosal glands due to compression. Statement of significance Unfortunately, little is known about the load transfer in the stomach wall during gastric surgery and the associated deformations on the macro- and microscale. The present study investigates the structural changes of the stomach wall, its layers and the inherent biological building blocks using histology, multi-photon microscopy, and micro-computed tomography. For the first time, the layer-specific response to stepwise radial compression of the stomach wall was studied, the related collagen fiber parameters were estimated, and a 3D sample structure was visualized. This clinically-oriented study links the structural changes within the wall to the postoperative remodel- ing process and the irreversibly altered gastric motility, thereby underscoring its relevance to the field of biomedical engineering, e.g., the development and improvement of surgical instruments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39694163/"}

Here we present a sequential study of the histological recovery of the gastric fundus and the phenomena of apoptosis, necrosis and neovascularization in an experimental model of partial gastric ischemia. Partial gastric devascularization was performed by ligature of the left gastric vessels in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were assigned to groups in accordance with their evaluation period: control, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 and 21 days. Histological analysis, caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and vascular endothelial cell proliferation (Ki-67) were measured in tissue samples after sacrifice. After 24 h of partial gastric ischemia, rates of apoptosis and necrosis were higher in the experimental groups than in controls. Tissue injury was higher 3 and 6 days post-ischemia. From day 10 after partial gastric ischemia, apoptosis and necrosis started to decrease, and on days 15 and 21 showed no differences in relation to controls. Neovascularization began between days 1 and 3, reaching its peak at 15 days after ischemia and coinciding with complete histological recovery. Both necrosis and apoptosis play a role in tissue injury during the first days after partial gastric ischemia.

In fact, there are few interstitial cells in the fundus, poor in filaments and branches, and only located inside the circular muscle layer.

The contractile response of the upper body was observed not by the cumulative application of gastrin, but by the one show applications between which interval was 30 minutes. In contrast, any response to gastrin was not obtained in the other two regions.

According to their relative frequency and secretion products the antral gastrin producing G cell and somatostatin producing D cell and the fundic histamine producing ECL cell are the best characterized cell types. Total endocrine cell mass is controlled by various factors from inside and outside the stomach. Density of antral G and D cells depends on the presence and absence of food, on the antral pH and on additional humoral and/or neural factors. Gastrin and not gastric pH has been identified as the most important factor regulating the density of fundic ECL cells. Adaptation of gastric endocrine cells to gastric pH and to the presence, abundance or absence of humoral and neural regulators are well known phenomena though only partially understood. Antral G cells increase and antral D cells decrease during long-term achlorhydria which as a consequence leads to hypergastrinaemia. Examples are pernicious anaemia in man and drug-induced acid suppression under experimental conditions. Interestingly, achlorhydria-induced G cell hyperplasia never progresses to gastrinomas. Fundic ECL cell density increases markedly in the presence of long-lasting hypergastrinaemia independently of gastric pH. In contrast to G cells ECL cell hyperplasia may progress to rarely occurring ECLomas. However, this depends on additional conditioning factors as the presence of severe atrophic gastritis as in pernicious anaemia or a specific genetic trait present in patients with gastrinomas associated with the MEN I syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1290054/"}

The cyclic increase in plasma motilin concentration was more closely correlated with the increase in contractile activity in the pouch than the increase in the main stomach. General anesthesia by thiopental sodium promptly inhibited the IMC in the main stomach but the contractile activity in the pouch was not affected but gradually decreased in proportion to the decrease in plasma motilin concentration. In conclusion, contractile activity in the extrinsically denervated pouch, which is quite independent of the CNS, is directly controlled by a humoral factor(s), motilin.

However, prolonged operative time and higher costs remain challenges. Effective gastric retraction is critical for smooth surgical manipulation during RDP.

The first fixation sutures the gastric antrum to the abdominal wall, exposing the pancreatic body. The second fixation secures the posterior gastric fundus, enhancing access to the gastro-pancreatic mesentery. The third fixation uses robotic-assisted traction on the left gastric artery pedicle, providing adjustable retraction. This approach achieves stable, wide exposure from the pancreatic body to the tail, enabling smooth and efficient surgical maneuvers. Eight consecutive patients underwent RDP with 3P-GRT.

A bidomain model was used to simulate the gastric slow waves in the antegrade wave (AW) direction and formation of colliding waves (CW). A forward modeling approach was employed to simulate body-surface potentials from the equivaelent dipoles. Simulated data were sampled from a 5 × 5 array of electrodes from the body-surface and compared between AW and CW cases. Anatomical parameters such as the Euclidean distance from the xiphoid process (8.6 ± 2.2 cm), orientation relative to the axial plane (195 ± 20.0°) were quantified. Electrophysiological simulations of AW and CW were both correlated to specific metrics derived from BSGM signals.

Thus, the stomach shape changes dynamically due to changes in contents and due to pressure from adjacent organs. Full-field strain analysis is therefore important for accurate estimation of the true deformation in this highly non-homogeneous, anisotropic organ. The aim of this study is to introduce a modified non-rigid image registration based 3D shape context method combined with a full-field strain analysis method to describe a distension-induced 3D gastric deformation. The geometry of a normal rat stomach at distension pressures from 0.05 kPa to 0.8 kPa were obtained by ultrasonic scanning. The full-field strain distribution of the 3D gastric model between the reference state and the distended state were computed on the basis of the improved 3D shape context method and full-field strain analysis method. The registered surface showed a good agreement with the real deformed surface for all distension states. However, the errors increased with the distension pressure due to increasing dissimilarity between the deformed and the reference surface. The strain distributions on the stomach surface were non-uniform with the largest deformation in the non-glandular part and the greater and lesser curvature when the pressure was higher than 0.2 kPa. The wall stiffness of the non-glandular part was softer than that of the glandular part. The modelling analysis method which is closely allied with the non-rigid image registration and strain analysis provides a kinematically possible deformation mode of the gastric wall. This method can be potentially used for clinical data estimating the kinematical properties of the human visceral organs in health and disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22542373/"}

Concerning age, in spite of a significant decrease of gastric peptic cell mass, peptic activity does not significantly decrease. This apparent disagreement between decreasing anatomic data and functional data, remaining unchanged, may be explained by analyzing the behaviour of fundic and antral peptic cell masses in detail. A difference emerges in the behaviour of chief and mucopeptic cells. The first decrease significantly after 50 years, while the second ones do not show variations, regardless of their fundic and antral location. In particular, fundic mucopeptic cell component increase, but not significantly.

The abstracts from recent large congresses were also reviewed to ensure coverage of the latest findings. The pathophysiological factors causing GERD can be split into those inducing greater exposure of the oesophagus to stomach contents, and those that provide increased perception of reflux or increased mucosal damage. Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, which are likely to be triggered by gastric distension, appear to be a key physiological cause of GERD. Excessive reflux may also be provoked by impaired oesophageal or gastric clearance mechanisms. Pre-epithelial, epithelial and post-epithelial defences all normally protect the oesophagus from injury, and may be compromised in individuals with GERD. Heartburn could also be caused by oesophageal hypersensitivity as a result of visceral neural pathway dysfunction. The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial, and abnormalities in the gastro-oesophageal junction, the stomach, the oesophagus and the nervous system may all contribute to this disease state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17593062/"}

The antral hormone gastrin and the neural messenger pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) potently stimulate histamine synthesis, storage, and secretion by ECL cells. Histamine is stored in secretory vesicles via V-type ATPases and vesicular monoamine transporters of subtype 2 (VMAT-2). Plasmalemmal calcium entry occurs via L-type calcium channels upon stimulation with secretagogues. K(+) and Cl(-) channels maintain the membrane potential. Calcium-triggered exocytosis of histamine is mediated by interacting SNARE proteins, especially by synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. Dynamins and amphiphysins appear to play a key role in endocytosis. ECL cells are under transcriptional control of various hormones. Gastrin stimulates transcriptional activity of the histidine decarboxylase (HDC), VMAT-2, and chromogranin A promoter by activation of Sp1 elements and CREB. During chronic Helicobacter pylori infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released that can also affect ECL cells, thus impairing their secretory function and viability, which can predispose to hypochlorhydria and gastric carcinogenesis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12221195/"}

We have identified the following biological roles for TGF alpha in the stomach, using a variety of primate and rodent models: inhibition of acid secretion; stimulation of mucous cell growth; protection against ethanol- and aspirin-induced injury. This last effect is associated with a time- and dose-dependent increase in levels of insoluble gastric mucin. Based on these known biological actions of TGF alpha, we have examined TGF alpha production in Ménétrier's disease, a disorder characterized by foveolar hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and increased gastric mucin content. In four patients with Ménétrier's disease, there was enhanced TGF alpha immunostaining throughout the gastric mucosa. Furthermore, metallothionein (MT)-TGF alpha transgenic mice which overproduce TGF alpha in the stomach exhibit histopathological and biochemical features characteristic of and consistent with the diagnosis of Ménétrier's disease. Thus locally produced TGF alpha may mediate a number of biological processes in the stomach, and its altered production may participate in the pathogenesis of selected pathological states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1341072/"}

In c-kit mutant Ws/Ws rats while ICC-CM and ICC-LM were not observed, but unexpectedly, a few ICC-SM and ICC-AP were found. By electron microscopy, ICC-SM and ICC-AP were characterized by abundant mitochondria, many caveolae, a distinct basal lamina and formed gap junctions with other ICC or with smooth muscle cells and make close contacts with nerves. Thus, ICC-SM and ICC-AP of the rat antrum were classified as Type 3 ICC, the type most similar to smooth muscle cells. The functional significance of ICC-SM and their survival in the c-kit mutant animals is discussed in reference to the role of the c-kit/stem cell factor system for their cellular maturation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12700899/"}

Acitivity patterns arising from the thirty cells of the stomatogastric ganglion of Panulirus argus are described for both a semi-intact preparation and an isolated one. 2. The thirty or so cells can be divided so far into two functional groupings: the gastric mill group, with at least ten motor elements, and the pyloric group with at least fourteen. There is some, but not extensive, interaction between groups. 3. The main gastric mill activity is arranged in two sets of elements, each of which is composed of reciprocating elements innervating antagonistic muscles. Thus alternation in activity between the single LC and the two LG neurones results in alternate closing and opening of the lateral teeth; alternation between the four GM and single CP units results in alternate protraction and retraction of the medial tooth. 4. The two sets are phased to each other in such a way that they cause gastric mill teeth to operate effectively to masticate food. 5. The main pyloric activity is arranged in a three-part cycle with each of three sets of units active in sequence. Activity in two PD and one AB unit is followed by bursts in IC and LP units followed in turn by activity in up to seven PY units. Activity in a single VD neurone is locked to this cycle in a more complex pattern.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/173787/"}

For assessment of variability, all subjects underwent two scintigraphic studies. For each study, the number of reflux episodes and gastric emptying half-times were recorded. The amount of reflux was graded according to the classification suggested by Blumhagen. Patients with grade 1 reflux were considered low-grade refluxers, while patients with grade 2 or 3 reflux were considered high-grade refluxers. The level of reflux for each patient was based on the highest reflux grade recorded in either study. Of the 28 patients, 19 had reflux in at least one study. Ten patients had high-grade and nine patients low-grade reflux. All patients but one with high-grade reflux had the same grade of reflux in both studies (90%). Of nine patients with low-grade reflux, three had the same grade in both studies. The mean half-time was significantly higher for high-grade than for low-grade refluxers (P < 0.05). For subjects with low-grade reflux, this value did not differ significantly from that of non-refluxers (P > 0.05). Our results show that patients with high-grade gastro-oesophageal reflux had prolonged gastric emptying. The inter- and intra-subject variability of gastric emptying in children appeared to be low.

Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data, and the postsleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. Specifically, the total gastric liquid emptying rates increased by 21% with a 30% volume reduction and by 51% with reductions exceeding 50%, due to altered intragastric pressure. Additionally, impaired motility functions resulted in slower mixing, leading to delayed food emptying. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and postoperative management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40192645/"}

It is shown that each type of receptor was activated by only one kind of stimulus (carbohydrates and acids, respectively). These receptors must thus be considered as true glucoreceptors or acido-receptors. Being silent before activation, these two types of chemoreceptors discharged at a frequency that varied from 2 to 14 imp/s for the acido-receptors, and from 2 to 30 imp/s for the glucoreceptors. The response could be irregular or regular and might last several minutes. Its latency was short (between 1 and 20 s for both types of chemoreceptors.

The entire stomach was lined by a thick cornified stratified squamous epithelium, except at the duct orifices of glands and in the pyloric gland region. The wall of the fundus was thin and devoid of glands. The gastric glands consisted of mucous, oxyntic, and pyloric glands. The mucous glands were observed in the lesser curvature (Mg-L), in the greater curvature (Mg-G), and in the pyloric canal (Mg-C) respectively. The oxyntic glands were organized into gland mass, making an oval mound elevated to the gastric lumen, in the middle of the greater curvature. The oxyntic gland mass has a single common duct with opening directed to the pyloric side. This duct was surrounded by mucus gland (Mg-G). The pyloric glands were located caudal to the pylorus. There was no sphincter at the pyloric-duodenal junction. Large mucosal protuberance, the torus pyloricus was observed in the side of the lesser curvature of the pyloric canal.

Movements of the stomach and of gastric contents were monitored by video camera and ultrasound and were related to mechanical events. Based on pressures, we defined the following four phases of contractions: 1) Po, a steady pressure associated with tonic contraction of proximal stomach; 2) P', a pressure wave during which the contraction indents the gastric body; 3) a pressure nadir while the contraction lifts the gastric sinus toward the incisura; and 4) a second pressure wave, P\", as the contraction advances through the antrum. In open preparations, liquid output and shortening of the greater curvature are large during Po, stop during P', and resume with P\". Contractions generate higher pressures when gastric volume is held steady. Contractions increase wall thickness and decrease gastric diameters at sites they involve and have opposite effects at remote sites. Contractions move the incisura and hence redraw the borders between gastric segments and shift volumes back and forth within the gastric lumen. Contractions furthermore stir up, compress, and disperse particulate beans without moving them to the pylorus. We conclude that gastric contractions 1) reverse changes in gastric length that occur during gastric filling, 2) move gastric contents directly through local contact and indirectly by changing the configuration of the stomach, and 3) interact with structures such as the incisura in retaining and breaking up solid gastric contents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9486190/"}

The anatomic orientation of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) components was examined in two organ donor specimens using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The three distinct structures identified within the GEJHPZ, from distal to proximal, were as follows: the gastric clasp and sling muscle fiber complex, crural diaphragm, and lower esophageal circular smooth muscle fibers (LEC). The LEC was statistically significantly thicker than adjacent esophageal muscles. These structures were associated with three pressure peaks. The pressure peak produced by the clasp/sling fiber complex often overlapped with the pressure peak from the crural diaphragm. The most proximal peak, associated with the LEC, was significantly greater and bimodal in nine of 20 subjects. This bimodal LEC pressure peak correlated with two areas of thickened muscle observed with ultrasound. Micro-CT of GEJ from organ donors confirmed the two areas of thickened muscle. Three distinct anatomic structures, the clasp and sling muscle fibers, crural diaphragm, and LEC combine to form the antireflux barrier of the proximal stomach and distal esophagus.

To evaluate the wound healing in the stomach of rats with the use of the hydroalcoholic extract of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (aroeira). Sixty rats, adult males, were divided into two groups: aroeira group and control group. Each one was subdivided into four subgroups of 15 animals (test groups). Each subdivided subgroup was also subdivided into three subgroups of five rats (deaths periods of 7, 14 and 21 days). All animals underwent the same surgical procedure (injury and stomach suture); animals in the aroeira group received daily dose of 100 mg/kg of hydroalcoholic extract via gavage while the control group received isotonic saline solution. Parameters evaluated were: macroscopic and microscopic changes, test for resistance to insufflation of atmospheric air and test for tensile strength. All animals had good healing of the abdominal wall and gastrorraphies without infection and dehiscence. Both groups had adhesions to the gastrorraphies surfaces with neighboring organs. The resistance test by insufflation of atmospheric air and tensile strength showed higher average of pressure on the 7th day and breaking strength in the time periods for the aroeira group. The intensity of chronic inflammation revealed statistically significant differences in the variables fibroblast proliferation and collagen. The use of hydroalcoholic extract of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi accelerated the stomach healing in rats.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23411801/"}

We demonstrated that exposure to Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> exerts significant cytotoxicity in RGM1 cells through induction of oxidative stress. Exposure of RGM1 cells to Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> caused a significant formation of protein carbonyls and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, major oxidative stress markers, with a concomitant accumulation of carbonylated protein-related aggregates. Furthermore, we found that incubation of lysozyme with Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> evokes protein carbonylation and aggregation <i>via</i> the metal ion-catalyzed free radical formation derived from Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>.

In this context, it is mandatory to consider the propulsive contraction waves that occur in the antral region of the stomach, since they are regarded as the major physiological hurdle to overcome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an in vitro model that allowed the evaluation of the gastroretentive potential of objects with different properties (e.g. size, shape and elasticity). The model enabled a realistic simulation of the human antrum and occurring contraction waves. We could demonstrate that larger objects made of elastic polyurethane foam were more rapidly emptied by the model than smaller objects having the same shape. Compared to this, rigid as well as slippery objects showed decreased gastroretentive properties. In contrast, a self-formed trichobezoar - an indigestible object known to remain in the stomach - showed the highest gastroretentive potential. We suggest that the gastroretentive potential of objects of a certain size increases if they exhibit compressible and elastic properties along with certain dimensions.

Through an incision on the wall of the stomach, the endoscope could be led into the abdominal cavity, where several interventions can be performed. The aim of the study was to examine the technical feasibility and the success of the formation of gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Meanwhile the difficulties of the method could be explored in order to introduce this method in human use. A lifelike biosynthetic model was made from a slaughtered domestic pig's gastrointestinal tract (stomach and the first few jejunum loops) which was fixed onto a plastic frame. Two single-channel gastroscopes were inserted into the stomach. On the wall of the stomach an approximately 2 centimetres wide incision was made by the electrocoagulator with a needle-knife. Through it the first jejunum loop was grasped by a foreign-body forceps and then was retracted into the stomach. Subsequently the jejunum loop was held safely with the first endoscope. Parallel to it an incision was made on the jejunum by the electrocoagulator. The authors managed to securely unite the open edges of the gastric wall and the jejunum with endoclips. The model was good for practising. The anastomosis is technically feasible and was successfully made on biosynthetic porcine model using the transgastric route. Although the incisions both on the gastric wall and on the jejunum loop were made easily, the fixing of the anastomosis might be questionable. It was revealed that more experiments and the development of new, special instruments are needed in order to conduct the anastomosis safely.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17344130/"}

The nodules appeared similar to ileal aggregated lymphoid nodules found in other animals and consisted of typical polymorphological lymphatic nodules arranged in a single continuous row occupying the submucosa and forming mucosal folds together with the mucous membrane. The whole mucous membrane with cardiac glands, diffuse lymphatic tissue and solitary lymphoid nodules in the lamina propria were found to cover the aggregated lymphoid nodule regions, but some nodules with a typical corona extended into the lamina propria and were covered with follicle-associated epithelium devoid of cardiac glands.

Gastric banding involves no opening of the gastrointestinal tract, which helps to minimize operative risk and complication rate. Operation resulted in an average weight loss of 36.5 kg (29.5 per cent) over six months, and is considered highly effective. Each patient was submitted, postoperatively, to a thorough check-up which included clinical examination, X-ray, gastroscopy and an extensive battery of laboratory tests. The fact that the artificial stoma and the gastric mucosa of upper and lower compartments can be inspected on gastroscopy is an added advantage.

Spontaneously occurring pharyngeal, upper oesophageal sphincter, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were analysed after feeding. Inspiratory strain was the most common spontaneously occurring strain (172 episodes), defined as an oesophageal body inspiratory negative pressure dip at least twice the size of the normal inspiratory wave. Overall, during inspiratory strain, upper oesophageal sphincter pressure was significantly higher than before straining (p < 0.01) (5 v 27 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Sustained strains defined as increases in gastric and oesophageal body pressure for two to 20 seconds were also common (149 episodes) and when compared with just before straining, also augmented upper oesophageal sphincter pressure (60 v 39 mm Hg, p < 0.01). The vigour of straining, estimated as increase of gastric pressure, correlated significantly with the degree of augmentation of upper oesophageal sphincter pressure (p < 0.05). Children with and without evidence of troublesome oesophagopharyngeal reflux showed no difference in upper oesophageal sphincter response patterns to straining. Failure of augmentation of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in the face of strain induced increases of oesophageal body pressure is probably a secondary factor in the production of oesophagopharyngeal reflux in children.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8307464/"}

Lower esophageal sphincter length and frequency of common cavity episodes after each volume increment. The pressure and intragastric volume at the yield point are defined as the point of permanent loss of the gastroesophageal pressure gradient.

The median +/- interquartile range LES length decreased by 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm for every 1-mm Hg increase in gastric pressure before fundoplication and by 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm after fundoplication (P < .02). With gastric distention there was an indirect correlation between the degree of LES length and the frequency of reflux episodes (r = -0.70). This correlation was abolished by a Nissen fundoplication (r = -0.31).

However, the injury worsened and reached the maximum at 1 h after reperfusion, almost simultaneously with the gastric mucosal cellular apoptosis increase and cellular proliferation decrease in gastric mucosa. Then, gastric mucosal cells began to repair by increasing gastric cellular proliferation, which achieved the maximum at 24 h after reperfusion. The mucosal lesions were almost completely repaired at about 72 h after reperfusion. These results indicate that the gastric mucosal injury after GI-R is mainly induced by reperfusion. The damaged gastric mucosa could initiate its repairing mechanism immediately through inhibiting cellular apoptosis and increasing the number of proliferative cells, which substitute the damaged cells gradually.

Pigs were laparotomized under general anesthesia. An 8 × 8-cm, round portion of the anterior gastric wall was excised and replaced by an AGW. The AGW was composed of a copolymer comprising 50% lactic acid and 50% caprolactone.

All recipient pigs survived until killing. By 4-8 weeks, the graft site revealed progressively fewer mucosal defect after each day. Moreover, the grafted area was indistinguishable from the native stomach 12 weeks after AGW implantation. The structures of the regenerated mucous membrane and muscle layers were identical to those of the native stomach. Furthermore, proton pumps were found in the regenerated tissue.

Under conditions of chronic inflammation with parietal cell loss, SPEM has been found to emerge and evolve into neoplasia. Cluster-of-differentiation gene 44 (CD44) is known to coordinate normal and metaplastic epithelial cell proliferation. In particular, CD44 variant isoform 9 (CD44v9) associates with the cystine-glutamate transporter xCT, stabilizes the protein, and provides defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). xCT stabilization by CD44v9 leads to defense against ROS by cystine uptake, glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and maintenance of the redox balance within the intracellular environment. Furthermore, p38 signaling is a known downstream ROS target, leading to diminished cell proliferation and migration, two vital processes of gastric epithelial repair. CD44v9 emerges during repair of the gastric epithelium after injury, where it is coexpressed with other markers of SPEM. The regulatory mechanisms for the emergence of CD44v9 and the role of CD44v9 during the process of gastric epithelial regeneration are largely unknown. Inflammation and M2 macrophage infiltration have recently been demonstrated to play key roles in the induction of SPEM after injury. The following review proposes new insights into the functional role of metaplasia in the process of gastric regeneration in response to ulceration. Our insights are extrapolated from documented studies reporting oxyntic atrophy and SPEM development and our current unpublished findings using the acetic acid-induced gastric injury model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32755448/"}

These adaptations culminated in the differentiation of a novel digestive structure in jawed vertebrates, the stomach. Specific endoderm/mesenchyme signalling is required for stomach differentiation, involving the growth and transcription factors: 1) Shh and Bmp4, required for stomach outgrowth; 2) Barx1, Sfrps and Sox2, required for gastric epithelium development and 3) Cdx1 and Cdx2, involved in intestinal versus gastric identity. Thus, modulation of endoderm/mesenchyme signalling emerges as a plausible mechanism linked to the origin of the stomach. In order to gain insight into the ancient mechanisms capable of generating this structure in jawed vertebrates, we characterised the development of the gut in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. As chondrichthyans, these animals retained plesiomorphic features of jawed vertebrates, including a well-differentiated stomach. We identified a clear molecular regionalization of their embryonic gut, characterised by the expression of barx1 and sox2 in the prospective stomach region and expression of cdx1 and cdx2 in the prospective intestine. Furthermore, we show that gastric gland development occurs close to hatching, accompanied by the onset of gastric proton pump activity.

Superficial injury heals via surface cells with histopathologic changes like foveolar hyperplasia. Deeper, usually chronic, injury/inflammation, most frequently induced by the carcinogenic bacteria Helicobacter pylori, elicits glandular histopathologic alterations, initially manifesting as pyloric (also known as pseudopyloric) metaplasia. In this pyloric metaplasia, corpus glands become antrum (pylorus)-like with loss of acid-secreting parietal cells (atrophic gastritis), expansion of foveolar cells, and reprogramming of digestive enzyme-secreting chief cells into deep antral gland-like mucous cells. After acute parietal cell loss, chief cells can reprogram through an orderly stepwise progression (paligenosis) initiated by interleukin-13-secreting innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). First, massive lysosomal activation helps mitigate reactive oxygen species and remove damaged organelles. Second, mucus and wound-healing proteins (eg, TFF2) and other transcriptional alterations are induced, at which point the reprogrammed chief cells are recognized as mucus-secreting spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia cells. In chronic severe injury, glands with pyloric metaplasia can harbor both actively proliferating spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia cells and eventually intestine-like cells. Gastric glands with such lineage confusion (mixed incomplete intestinal metaplasia and proliferative spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia) may be at particular risk for progression to dysplasia and cancer. A pyloric-like pattern of metaplasia after injury also occurs in other gastrointestinal organs including esophagus, pancreas, and intestines, and the paligenosis program itself seems broadly conserved across tissues and species.

We used the following antigenic markers: M3, present in all the goblet cells of the whole small and large intestine; M3SI, expressed in all the goblet cells of the small intestine, but only in some of them of the large intestine; M3D, mainly produced in the upper small intestine; and M3C, specific for colonic mucus cells. All these antigens were found to be similarly expressed in both Laurèn's intestinal and diffuse types. Nevertheless, M3 and M3C appeared to be more largely produced in carcinomas showing well-differentiated cells (tubulopapillary, mucinous, and signet ring cells according to the WHO classification). Our results evidenced the occurrence of two main fetal antigenic patterns in gastric carcinomas, one of the gastric type (M3SI produced to a larger extent than M3 and M3C) and the other one of the small intestinal type (M3 and M3SI more largely expressed than M3C). On the basis of their similar antigenic pattern, the histogenesis of carcinomas showing the fetal small intestinal antigenic profile may be associated with intestinal metaplasia.

Disordered slow wave rhythms and patterns are associated with functional motility disorders. Various drugs have been used to simulate disease states to develop and investigate the efficacy of novel therapies for treating GI disorders. Slow wave dysrhythmias associated with GI conditions are commonly characterized based on their frequency, but this metric has also been shown to be unreliable. This study induced slow wave dysrhythmias in the stomach and quantified the slow wave spatial response using high resolution mapping techniques (128 electrodes at 5 mm inter-electrode spacing). Glucagon (0.0125 mg/kg) was infused to induce hyperglycemia in pigs (n=6, 42.8 ± 8.1 kg). The resultant slow wave dysrhythmias were mapped and quantified by determining the frequency of slow wave activity and the prevalence of regions of uncoupled activity compared to the baseline recordings. At baseline, slow waves were fully entrained and propagated at a regular frequency of 3.4 ± 1.0 cycles per minute (cpm) with no presence of disordered activity. However, after the infusion of glucagon, slow wave activity was uncoupled in 3.2 - 10.9 % of the mapped region, with slow waves occurring during every alternate slow wave cycle compared to other regions. Therefore, slow wave activity in regular and uncoupled regions occurred in a 2:1 frequency ratio in the ranges between 2.1 - 3.1 cpm and 1.0 - 1.6 cpm. The findings highlighted the importance of high-resolution mapping techniques to define electrical dysrhythmias of the stomach which otherwise would have been undetected with a few sparse electrodes due to spatial aliasing. This study defined the response of gastric slow wave activity resulting from glucagon-induced hyperglycemia for the first time in pigs.

Therefore, an experimental study was planned to evaluate the effects of FD on fetal gastric physiology and histology. In this study, a model of FD was created by way of intermittent maternal aortic occlusion in pregnant rabbits. In total, 21 fetuses of 6 pregnant rabbits were available for surgical and laboratory procedures. Laboratory examinations showed that (1) fetal gastric acid secretion was 4.24 +/- 2.68 muEq/h in the control group and 18.08 +/- 6.34 muEq/h in the distress group (p < 0.01) and (2) fetal gastric PGE2 level was 16.59 +/- 6.15 mg/g wet weight in the control group and 9.86 +/- 3.46 mg/g wet weight in the distress group (p < 0.05). Histopathologically, there were mild hemorrhagic and errosive changes in the distressed fetuses, but not in control fetuses. These findings support that FD adversely affects fetal gastric physiology through two mechanisms consisting of increased gastric acid secretion and decreased fetal gastric protection in rabbits. Consequently, gastric injury should be noted as a potential problem among hypoxia-associated abnormalities encountered in the distressed fetus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9376016/"}

A total of 30 patients surviving the operation and who were still alive at least 3 months afterwards were included in this study. Gastric emptying (GE) was evaluated 6-8 weeks after the operation.

The corresponding GE time for solids in the three groups was 9.9 +/- 5.1, 10.31 +/- 6.6, and 7.7 +/- 3.4 min. No statistical difference was observed in the GE in the three groups even though liquids tend to empty faster than solids. Clinically there was also no significant difference in their ability to tolerate normal meals. When evaluated for clinical evidence of altered GE (effect of vagotomy) there did not appear to be any significant differences between the three groups.

{"id": "40389049", "title": "A biomechanical comparative study of passive stomach tissue from pigs and humans.", "text": "The prevalence of gastric problems, which are associated with high economic costs and medical complexity, is soaring worldwide. In biomedical research, porcine models have been widely used to investigate the gastrointestinal tract in preclinical studies due to their similar functionality and macrostructure. Despite their widespread acceptance, there is insufficient research on whether porcine gastric tissue accurately reflects the biomechanics and microstructure of the human stomach. Hence, the present study aims to characterize the human stomach wall and investigate inter-species differences and similarities through a comparison with a preceding study. For this purpose, quasi-static mechanical tests were performed in several deformation modes, i.e., planar biaxial extension, radial compression, and simple shear. The cyclic experiments were complemented by stress-relaxation tests to examine the viscoelastic behavior. Samples from two main layers of the stomach, i.e., mucosa and muscularis, as well as the complete stomach wall were tested from all gastric regions, i.e., fundus, body, and antrum. Through this strategic testing approach, considerable softening effects and various region- and layer-specific variations in the mechanical behavior of the stomach wall were observed. Complementary histological investigations highlighted the heterogeneous stomach wall architecture and its influence on the mechanical tissue response. The present study revealed significant regional, layer-, and sex-specific differences in the human stomach of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The male stomach wall was thicker, more extensible in the antrum, and stiffer under radial compression in the fundus compared to the female cohort. Furthermore, notable differences were observed between porcine and human tissue, such as a significantly softer tissue response to radial compression and simple shear of the human muscularis and the complete stomach wall due to a higher collagen and elastin content and smaller muscle bundles.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40389049/"}

Accommodation after a liquid meal (300 ml, 450 kcal) was measured twice at random in eight healthy volunteers. Proximal accommodation was measured once using barostat and once using ultrasound (US). Antrum accommodation was measured using US. Bag volume (BV), antral area (AA), proximal gastric area, and proximal gastric diameter (PGD) data were assessed before and 1, 5, 15, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min postprandially. Transpyloric flow was measured using Doppler 1-5 min postprandially. Fasted, AA size was not affected by the barostat bag (1 mmHg > minimal distension pressure; 2.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.3 cm(2)). Postprandially, AAs were larger with the bag present (ANOVA, P < 0.04). Maximum AA was reached with the bag in 5 min, without the bag in 1 min postprandially (15.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 9.4 +/- 1.5 cm(2); P < 0.03). Furthermore, AAs were related to BVs (r = 0.57; P < 0.01). After bag deflation, AA decreased (11.9 +/- 1.8 to 7.0 +/- 0.9 cm(2); P = 0.02) and was comparable with the 60-min AA size without the bag (7.1 +/- 1.2 cm(2); P = 0.76) present. Proximal gastric radius calculated from the BVs and PGDs was larger with the bag present (ANOVA, P < 0.001). No effect on early gastric emptying was observed. Postprandially, the barostat bag causes dilatation of the antrum due to meal displacement without influencing early gastric emptying. This antral dilatation is likely to induce exaggerated proximal gastric relaxation observed in studies using the barostat to evaluate fundic accommodation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12181183/"}

Here, we report a role of delta9-THC in a vago-vagal reflex that can result in gastro-oesophageal reflux, that is, gastric distension-evoked lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) relaxation. Oesophageal, LOS and gastric pressures were measured using a miniaturized, manometric assembly in decerebrate, unanaesthetized ferrets.Gastric distension (30 ml) evoked LOS relaxation (70 +/- 8% decrease from baseline). Delta9-THC administered systemically (0.2 mg kg-1, iv.) or directly to the dorsal hindbrain surface (0.002 mg),significantly attenuated the nadir of the gastric distention-evoked LOS relaxation, and time to reach maximal response. Similar increases to maximal effect were observed after treatment with the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (0.2 mg kg-1 iv.). The effect of systemic delta9-THC on gastric distention-evoked LOS relaxation was reversed by a selective cannabinoid1 (CBI) receptor antagonist, SR141617A (1 mg kg-1 i.v.). Since this reflex is vagally mediated, we used a CB1 receptor antiserum and immunocytochemistry to determine its distribution in ferret vagal circuitry. CBI receptor staining was present in cell bodies within the area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and nodose ganglion. Intense terminal-like staining was noted within the NTS and dorsal motor vagal nucleus (DMN). Neither nodose ganglionectomy nor vagotomy altered the CB1 receptor terminal-like staining in the dorsal vagal complex. Retrogradely labelled gastric- or LOS-projecting DMN neurones did not express CBI receptors within their soma. Therefore, CBI receptor staining in the NTS and DMN is not due to primary vagal afferents or preganglionic neurones. These novel findings suggest that delta9-THC can modulate reflex LOS function and that the most likely site of action is via the CBI receptor within the NTS. This effect of delta9-THC may have implications in treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux and other upper gut disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12879865/"}

There was 63% shunting of 9-micron microspheres in the antrum, but none in the body. Corrosion cast and Indian ink studies showed that in the body there was a single microvascular network of capillaries that appeared to originate from the arterioles in the submucosa and were in close apposition to the epithelial cells of the gastric glands. The diameter of these capillaries was 8.6 +/- 0.2 microns. In contrast, there were two distinct capillary networks in the antrum: a basal and a superficial. The capillaries of the basal network of the antrum originated from the arterioles at the level of the muscularis mucosa and drained into the capillaries of the superficial mucosa. The capillaries of the superficial network had a significantly larger diameter (10.8 +/- 0.4 microns) than those of the basal network (7.3 +/- 0.2 microns).

The intragastric administration of esculin at doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg was able to protect the gastric mucosa against ethanol (0.2 mL/animal p.o.), and esculin at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg protected against indomethacin-induced lesions (20mg/kg p.o.). Administration of l-NAME (10mg/kg i.p.), glibenclamide (10mg/kg i.p.) or indomethacin (10mg/kg p.o.), but not capsazepine (5mg/kg p.o.), was able to reduce the gastroprotection promoted by esculin (25mg/kg) on the ethanol-induced lesions. Measurements of nitrite, a NO metabolite, were increased in the group that was pretreated with esculin. In terms of antioxidant activity as a gastroprotective mechanism of esculin, the results show that pre-treatment with esculin decreased the amount of GSH, increased SOD activity, did not interfere with the CAT activity and decreased both the MPO activity and the MDA amount. In conclusion, pre-treatment with esculin confers significant gastroprotective and antioxidant activity and leads to a reduction in gastric injury; the mechanisms underlying these effects include stimulation of endogenous prostaglandins, nitric oxide synthesis, opening of K(ATP) channels and reduction of free radicals or modulation of antioxidant enzyme systems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20678495/"}

Squares, 2 X 2 cm, were cut from the anterior and posterior walls of stomachs from cats and rabbits; the corresponding edges of opposing squares were sewn together. A luminal balloon served to change pouch volume and to monitor pouch pressure. Filling increased the width more than the length of most pouches; this difference was particularly marked in pouches from the rabbit fundus. Filling led to an initial pressure peak, after which pressure declined to a new baseline pressure plateau; emptying led to an initial pressure nadir, pressure recovery, and baseline pressure plateau. The difference between initial pressure and plateau pressure was larger in proximal than in distal pouches: hence, baseline pressures rose more sharply on filling and declined more steeply on emptying of antral than of proximal pouches. Pressure waves occurred in all antral pouches of cats and in some antral pouches of rabbits. Carbachol enhanced the pressure waves and isoproterenol inhibited them. In the fundic pouches, these drugs altered primarily the baseline pressure. Electrical field stimulation caused a relaxation in fundic pouches and a suppression of rhythmic contractions in antral pouches. The onset and the duration of nervous inhibition was comparable in fundic and in antral pouches. The baseline pressure of pouches was not affected by the presence or by the absence of the mucosa. This novel preparation is suitable to demonstrate differences in the volume-pressure relationships of the muscle coat of the proximal and the distal stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3972222/"}

In vitro studies have characterized the actions of modulatory projection neurons in great detail in the stomatogastric nervous system, a model system for neuromodulatory influences on central pattern generators. Less is known about the activities and actions of modulatory neurons in fully functional and richly modulated network settings, i.e., in intact animals. It is also unknown whether their activities contribute to the motor patterns in different behavioral conditions. Here, we show for the first time the activity and effects of the well-characterized modulatory projection neuron 1 (MCN1) in vivo and compare them to in vitro conditions. MCN1 was always spontaneously active, typically in a rhythmic fashion with its firing being interrupted by ascending inhibitions from the pyloric motor circuit. Its activity contributed to pyloric motor activity, because 1) the cycle period of the motor pattern correlated with MCN1 firing frequency and 2) stimulating MCN1 shortened the cycle period while 3) lesioning of the MCN1 axon reduced motor activity. In addition, gastric mill motor activity was elicited for the duration of the stimulation. Chemosensory stimulation of the antennae moved MCN1 away from baseline activity by increasing its firing frequency. Following this increase, a gastric mill rhythm was elicited and the pyloric cycle period decreased. Lesioning the MCN1 axon prevented these effects. Thus modulatory projection neurons such as MCN1 can control the motor output in vivo, and they participate in the processing of exteroceptive sensory information in behaviorally relevant conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21325688/"}

Seven extraluminal strain gauge force transducers and five platinum electrodes were implanted along the antropyloroduodenal region, and gastric emptying was studied by X-ray after a 280-g solid meat meal mixed with barium. The motility index increased aboral to the myotomy by 106 and 69% in the distal antrum and pylorus, respectively, in the first postprandial 30-60 min because of the loss of an inhibitory neural influence from the proximal part of the stomach. Destabilization of the basic electrical rhythm occurred in 50% of the dogs. This was apparent as tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia and an early postprandial 2-11% decrease in slow-wave frequency and a 100% increase in slow-wave amplitude. Coordination of corporoantropyloric contractions was disorganized. Frequent segmenting and antidromic contractions were associated with reduced periods of optimal emptying and disturbed intragastric chyme transport into the constricted antrum. A 10-30% gastric emptying delay of approximately 50 min was a consequence of myotomy despite an increased antroduodenal motor gradient after myotomy. The overall results suggest that intact intramural innervation and muscular continuity are essential for coordination of corporoantropyloric motility and normal gastric emptying.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8141299/"}

Four main groups were established: abnormal position along longitudinal (I) and horizontal axis (II), as well as abnormal shape (III) and stomach connections (IV). An additional group (V) encloses mixed forms that combine features of two or more of the main groups. The first group contains the partial and total translocation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity after the partial or total oesophagectomy. Depending on the applied surgical techniques used during the total oesophagectomy, the stomach could be located anteriorly or posteriorly to the pericardial sac. An elongated and gastrectatic form often with signs of pylorostenosis is visible in patients treated by vagotomy. The consequences of fundoplication included: lack of or narrow cardiac angle, and often a mild form of stomach cascade. The most common abnormal shape of the stomach was secondary to gastrectomy and gastric bending. The final organ shape depends on the type of applied surgical procedure that maintains physiological connection with the duodenum or an un-anatomical one, mostly with the jejunal loop.

So, the stomach of this animal can be classified as a simple stomach, in the format of a curved sack and similar to an inverted letter 'J'. The gastric mucous membrane presents a surface filled by numerous tortuous gastric folds and longitudinally distributed along all its extension. The mucous tunic also possesses recesses located among the successive gastric folds, which were denoted as gastric parts with numerous openings described as gastric pits. In the cardiac part, a glandular epithelium with cardiac glands is noticed containing a lot of parietal and mucous neck cells.

However, because the vagus trunks are interrupted during surgery, patients easily suffer from postoperative stomach adynamia. Based on our understanding from autopsy of the path of vagus trunks along the distal oesophagus, we designed the operative procedure of PD by preserving vagus trunks (PDPVT) to treat portal hypertension. Between May 1991 and January 2003, patients with portal hypertension were treated surgically using PDPVT (n = 42), single PD (n = 32), or PD with pyloroplasty (PD+PP; n = 16). Operative mortality was 2.4% in the PDPVT group and 6.3% in both the PD and PD+PP groups (p > 0.05). The postoperative rebleeding rate was 9.5% in the PDPVT group and 12.5% in both the PD and PD+PP groups (p > 0.05). There were no differences in operative time and estimated blood loss between the three groups (p > 0.05). The recovery time for gastroenteric function was shorter with PDPVT (mean, 3.5 days) than with PD (mean, 5.7 days) and PD+PP (mean, 4.2 days; p < 0.02).

We studied 31 <i>H. pylori</i> positive and 28 <i>H. pylori</i> negative volunteers, matched for age, gender and body mass index. Jumbo biopsies were taken at 11 predetermined locations from the gastro-oesophageal junction and stomach. Combined high-resolution pH metry (12 sensors) and manometry (36 sensors) was performed for 20 min fasted and 90 min postprandially. The squamocolumnar junction was marked with radio-opaque clips and visualised radiologically. Biopsies were scored for inflammation and density of parietal, chief and G cells immunohistochemically. Under fasting conditions, the <i>H. pylori</i> positives had less intragastric acidity compared with negatives at all sensors >1.1 cm distal to the peak lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure (p<0.01). Postprandially, intragastric acidity was less in <i>H. pylori</i> positives at sensors 2.2, 3.3 and 4.4 cm distal to the peak LES pressure (p<0.05), but there were no significant differences in more distal sensors. The postprandial acid pocket was thus attenuated in <i>H. pylori</i> positives.

Gestation day 14 (Gd14) fetal stomachs from time-dated pregnant CD-1 mice (term, 20 days) were maintained in organ culture for 7 days. Some stomachs were ligated at the gastroesophageal (GE) and pyloroduodenal (PD) junctions. Others were left unligated. Gd14, Gd16, and Gd18 stomachs were taken as well to compare organogenesis in vivo. Tissues were processed for histological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analysis, as well as total protein and DNA determination. The ligated stomachs were visibly distended compared with unligated stomachs in organ culture after 7 days. The length and width of the 7-day in vitro ligated stomachs were significantly increased compared with unligated (2.97+/-0.04 mm v 2.48+/-0.05 mm and 2.14+/-0.04 mm v 1.57+/-0.08 mm, respectively, P < .05). Mucosal epithelial cells showed nuclear polarization, and there was a distinct outer muscle layer in the ligated stomachs, but not in the unligated stomachs, which demonstrated pseudostratified epithelial cells in the mucosa. The ligated stomachs had increased in mucosal thickness compared with unligated (31.4+/-1.3 microm vs 24.9+/-0.9 microm, p < 0.05). The ligated stomachs also had significantly increased protein and DNA content when compared with unligated stomachs (65.8+/-3.1 microg and 23.3+/-1.2 microg v 55.0+/-2.7 microg and 19.0+/-1.2 microg, respectively, P < .05). However, there were no significant differences noted between the protein to DNA ratios. Immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for cell proliferation, demonstrated increased proliferative activity of the mucosal epithelial cells in the ligated stomachs. Esophageal and pyloric ligation enhanced the development of the fetal stomach in vitro in comparison with unligated stomachs cultured under similar conditions.

During therapy, the patient complained of ructus and dysphagia, probably related to an overly proximally (oesophageal) positioned stent. After a total of 12 weeks, far longer than the described stenting duration in the literature, the Lap-Band was found free in the gastric lumen and was successfully removed using an endoscopic loop.

Mucormycosis (or zygomycosis) is an uncommon opportunistic fungal infection that is usually seen in immunocompromised patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This report is of a rare case of spontaneous gastric perforation due to mucormycosis infection. CASE REPORT A 52-year-old woman, with a past medical history of heroin abuse, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease treated by dialysis, presented to the emergency department with cellulitis of the arms. Following hospital admission, her medical condition deteriorated, and she developed septic shock and multiorgan failure, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she was diagnosed with a perforated hollow viscus as the cause. Surgical exploration showed that the mucosa of the stomach was necrotic and perforated, but the remaining bowel appeared normal. Total gastrectomy was performed, and a jejunostomy feeding tube was inserted. Histopathology of the gastric tissue confirmed infection with mucormycosis. The patient was treated with adjunctive liposomal amphotericin B, her condition improved, and she was extubated on postoperative day 2. However, the patient died on postoperative day 21 due to sepsis and multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS Mucormycosis is an opportunistic angioinvasive fungal infection, and gastric perforation is a rare clinical presentation. However, knowledge of the association between gastric necrosis and perforation and mucormycosis infection might lead to early diagnosis and treatment and reduce patient morbidity and mortality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29724988/"}

In all fetuses and in all gastric segments investigated, VIP-like immunoreactive (IR) nerve-cell bodies were seen in all intramural ganglia, and VIP-IR nerve fibres were found in all layers of the gastric wall except the tunica serosa. Consequently, VIP-IR nerve fibres were found to form a periglandular network, to accompany arterioles, to interconnect the intramural ganglia, to encircle both VIP-IR-negative and -positive neurons, and were found in all muscle layers. Despite the fact that VIP-IR seems to be restricted to the intramural nervous elements, some non-specific-reacting VIP-IR glandular cells were noticed in the basal parts of the fundic, antral and pyloric gastric glands. The distribution pattern of VIP in the fetal pig resembles that of the adult pig. This suggests a possible functional role for VIP during fetal life and/or puts forward the suggestion that the stomach of a fetal pig from the second half of the gestation period is prepared, from then on, for postnatal function. High similarities with regard to the general distribution pattern of VIP in the stomach have also been noted between the fetal pig and humans, proving once more that the fetal pig can serve as a good animal model in several research areas. Finally, the morphological data provided here may, combined with the physiological significance of VIP, contribute to a better insight into the physiopathology of economically important gastro-intestinal disorders in the pig, such as gastric ulceration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9011104/"}

Increased fibrosis was found inside of the polypropylene banding, resulting in a significant incidence of luminal obstruction. The channel dilated in stages, affecting the proximal end first; but obstructive effect remained as long as part of the channel was undilated.

Subsequently, different methods were developed to study functional aspects of gastric pathology. Ultrasound can be used to evaluate antral contractility, gastric emptying, transpyloric flow, gastric configuration, intragastric distribution of meals, gastric accommodation and strain measurement of the gastric wall. Advanced methods for 3D ultrasound imaging and tissue Doppler (Strain Rate Imaging) have also been developed to study diseases of the stomach.

Smooth muscle strips from organs of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tract contain multiple muscle layers with different muscle fiber orientations, which are frequently not separated for the experiments. During strip activation, these muscle fibers contract in deviant orientations from the force-measuring axis, affecting the biomechanical characteristics of the tissue strips. This study aimed to investigate the influence of muscle layer separation on the determination of smooth muscle properties. Smooth muscle strips, consisting of longitudinal and circumferential muscle layers (whole-muscle strips [WMS]), and smooth muscle strips, consisting of only the circumferential muscle layer (separated layer strips [SLS]), have been prepared from the fundus of the porcine stomach. Strips were mounted with muscle fibers of the circumferential layer inline with the force-measuring axis of the uniaxial testing setup. The force-length (FLR) and force-velocity relationships (FVR) were determined through a series of isometric and isotonic contractions, respectively. Muscle layer separation revealed no changes in the FLR. However, the SLS exhibited a higher maximal shortening velocity and a lower curvature factor than WMS. During WMS activation, the transversally oriented muscle fibers of the longitudinal layer shortened, resulting in a narrowing of this layer. Expecting volume constancy of muscle tissue, this narrowing leads to a lengthening of the longitudinal layer, which counteracted the shortening of the circumferential layer during isotonic contractions. Consequently, the shortening velocities of the WMS were decreased significantly. This effect was stronger at high shortening velocities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33900446/"}

However, much remains unknown about its mechanical properties, especially regarding regional heterogeneities and wall microstructure. Consequently, the present study aimed to assess regional differences in the mechanical properties and microstructure of the stomach wall. In general, the stomach wall and the different tissue layers exhibited a nonlinear stress-stretch relationship. Regional differences were found in the mechanical response and the microstructure. The highest stresses of the entire stomach wall in longitudinal direction were found in the corpus (201.5 kPa), where food is ground followed by the antrum (73.1 kPa) and the fundus (26.6 kPa). In contrast, the maximum stresses in circumferential direction were 39.7 kPa, 26.2 kPa, and 15.7 kPa for the antrum, fundus, and corpus, respectively. Independent of the fibre orientation and with respect to the biaxial loading direction, partially clear anisotropic responses were detected in the intact wall and the muscular layer. In contrast, the innermost mucosal layer featured isotropic mechanical characteristics. Pronounced layers of circumferential and longitudinal muscle fibres were found in the fundus only, whereas corpus and antrum contained almost exclusively circumferential orientated muscle fibres. This specific stomach structure mirrors functional differences in the fundus as well as corpus and antrum. Within this study, the load transfer mechanisms, connected with these wavy layers but also in total with the stomach wall's microstructure, are discussed. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This article examines for the first time the layer-specific mechanical and histological properties of the stomach wall attending to the location of the sample. Moreover, both mechanical behaviour and microstructure were explicitly match identifying the heterogeneous characteristics of the stomach. On the one hand, the results of this study contribute to the understanding of stomach mechanics and thus to their functional understanding of stomach motility.

To validate the overall accuracy of the method, 24 combined aspiration and gamma camera gastric emptying studies were carried out in three normal volunteers. Gastric meal volume, expressed as a percentage of the original volume of the meal ingested was underestimated due to scattered radiation from the stomach. The underestimation was 7-20% varying with the size of the gastric region of interest (ROI), the energy of the nuclide and the fraction of meal in the stomach. The overestimation, due to scattered radiation from the gut, was negligible (1-3%) for any of the procedures with 10% of the meal situated outside the stomach at a distance of at least 1 cm. Sections of the duodenal loop were always inside the stomach ROI and were likely to contain a constant fraction of the meal (3-10%). The gamma camera technique eliminated much of the error due to variations of stomach geometry and produced accurate quantitative gastric emptying data comparable to those obtained by evacuation (P greater than 0.10), when the entire field maximum 1-min count achieved within the first 20 min of a study was taken as representing the original volume of the meal ingested, and when corrections for area related errors due to scattered radiation from the stomach were performed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2740026/"}

The pyloric sphincter, which demarcates the stomach from the small intestine, acts as a mechanical and electrical barrier, isolating each organ, thus enabling independent behaviors that are critical for proper digestion. Unique electrical patterns in the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum underpin the distinct contractile patterns of these regions, and improper organization of these mechanical behaviors leads to clinical conditions such as gastroparesis and dumping syndrome. For this reason, the gastroduodenal junction should be a focal point in investigations of novel biomarkers of gastrointestinal dysfunction. This review summarizes the current knowledge of bioelectrical and mechanical characteristics of the gastroduodenal junction, as well as the relevant underlying anatomy. As there is limited documentation of physiological recordings from the gastroduodenal junction of humans, inferences are made from animal studies and from measurements taken from other regions of the gastrointestinal tract, where appropriate. We suggest hypotheses on gastroduodenal electromechanical coupling and propose further studies to support or reject these ideas. Improved physiological understanding of this region, and the advent of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools are crucial aspects for the future of clinical gastrointestinal medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39976325/"}

Three dosage levels (5, 50 or 100 v/v%) of PEG 400 were administered at a volume of 5 ml/kg/day by gavage for 15 days to the rats (5 males and 5 females in each group). At the end of the treatment, the whole lengths of gastrointestinal tracts were examined pathologically. Although there were no gross abnormalities at necropsy, the histopathological examination revealed several changes localized to the stomach mucosa, but not in the intestine. The changes consisted of infiltration of eosinophils and globule leukocytes, increased in the height of the entire mucosal layer, elongation of the surface mucous epithelial and mucous neck cell layers with increased intracellular mucous in the glandular stomach, and the spongiosis (intercellular edema) of the squamous epithelium in the forestomach. These changes near the limiting ridge tended to increase in severity and extent in a dose-dependent manner.

We propose the hypothesis of the gastric motility, based on the following points: 1) The gastric cardia is the intra-abdominal portion of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Its tone increases in response to the increasing pressure in the stomach. 2) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cardia cannot withstand the pressure and subsequently opens. Depending on the degree of insufficiency of the LES and the force applied during provocative test, angular deformity of the stomach appears, due to the shortening of LES as well as a downsizing of the gas bubble in the stomach; 3) Pyloric sphincter (PS) is a true sphincter. Evacuation from the stomach is the result of the opening of the PS due to increase of antral pressure above the \"threshold\" level; 4) The evacuation starts in the upright position, when the liquid chyme above PS creates hydrostatic pressure above the threshold; 5) When hydrostatic pressure is reduced below the threshold level or in the recumbent position the antral pressure is created by the clamping of deep peristaltic wave and formation of the closed antral cavity; 6) The portioned evacuation is provided in two ways; a) the volume of antral cavity corresponds to the volume of duodenal bulb; b) in upright position after filling of the duodenal bulb the postbulbar sphincter is closed, whereby the pressure in the bulb rises, which leads to a reflex contraction of the PS and cessation of the e stomach emptying.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29889384/"}

However, little is known about how intestinal GLP-1 affects distant organs despite rapid enzymatic inactivation. We show that intestinal GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying and eating via intestinofugal neurons, a subclass of myenteric neurons that project to abdominal sympathetic ganglia. Remarkably, cell-specific ablation of intestinofugal neurons eliminated intestinal GLP-1 effects, and their chemical activation functioned as a GLP-1 mimetic. GLP-1 sensing by intestinofugal neurons then engaged a sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic pathway that links abnormal stomach distension to craniofacial programs for food rejection. Within this pathway, cell-specific activation of discrete neuronal populations caused systemic GLP-1-like effects.

Recent publications support earlier observations of an age-related selective decline in the number of cholinergic neurons in the enteric nervous system, but also reveal a progressive loss of interstitial cells of Cajal in the stomach and colon throughout adult life. These changes appear to have surprisingly little effect on gastrointestinal motor function in healthy ageing, although gut sensation is impaired and older individuals have an increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal complications of comorbid illnesses. Alterations in gut function with ageing have particular implications in the oesophagus, colon, and anorectum. Dysphagia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, constipation, and faecal incontinence are the most prevalent clinical manifestations. Older individuals are also susceptible to postprandial hypotension, in which altered cardiovascular responses to intestinal nutrient exposure are pivotal.

However, existing techniques are often invasive, terminal, or limited in resolution. This study aims to develop a non-invasive, standardized MRI protocol capable of capturing whole-stomach dynamics in anesthetized rats with high spatiotemporal resolution. Experiments were performed in a 7-T MRI system. Gadolinium-doped test meals were prepared to enhance intraluminal contrast in T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI. Based on a modified multi-slice gradient-echo sequence, our protocol integrates respiratory gating to minimize motion artifacts, spatial saturation to improve intraluminal contrast, and slice grouping to optimize the trade-offs between signal-to-noise ratio and motion sensitivity. Image acquisition was accelerated using a time-interleaved k-space undersampling scheme, with missing data reconstructed through k-t interpolation. Image quality and gastric motility were quantitatively assessed. The protocol enabled successful imaging of the stomach and visualization of its quasi-periodic dynamics in anesthetized rats. The gadolinium-doped meal produced relatively homogeneous intraluminal contrast, allowing clear delineation of gastric anatomy, volume, and motility. The retrospectively reconstructed image exhibited high image quality and yielded reliable estimates of antral contractions, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the k-t interpolation method. Estimated antral contraction amplitude and velocity showed minimal deviations from the reference values, whereas contraction frequency estimation remained highly consistent and accurate. Using the accelerated imaging protocol, we imaged the entire stomach and major intestinal regions, acquiring 24 slices with an effective temporal resolution of < 3 s and capturing antral contraction at ~5 cycles per minute. We established an accessible and standardized imaging protocol that encompasses contrast meal preparation, animal handling and training, and a contrast-enhanced dynamic GI MRI acquisition and reconstruction framework. This protocol provides a comprehensive, robust, non-invasive tool for studying gastric motility and dysmotility in rodents, offering strong potential to advance preclinical gastrointestinal motility research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40926545/"}

A comparison was made with gastro-esophageal afferents found in a similar preparation of ferret tissue. Responses of mouse tension receptors to circular tension were significantly greater than ferret tension and tension/mucosal receptors. Similarly the responses of mouse mucosal receptors to mucosal stroking were significantly greater than ferret mucosal and tension/mucosal receptors. Forty-seven percent of mouse mucosal receptors and 50% of tension receptors responded to one or more drugs or chemical stimuli applied to the receptive field. These included alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10(-6) to 10(-3) M), 5-hydroxytryptamine (10(-6) to 10(-3) M), and hydrochloric acid (10(-2) to 10(-1) M). Drug responses were concentration dependent. One hundred percent of mucosal receptors and 61% of tension receptors tested responded to bile (1:8 to 1:1 dilution). A third type of fiber was recruited by bile. These fibers were mechanically insensitive and silent prior to bile exposure. In conclusion, we have shown three types of gastro-esophageal vagal afferent fibers in the mouse: mucosal mechanoreceptors, tension receptors, and specific chemoreceptors activated by bile.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11929927/"}

Two bipolar electrodes were implanted in the pre- and postanastomosis stomach. Electromyographic recordings were performed intermittently for 8 to 13 weeks in fasting and after feeding. In one of the 6 dogs, 11 weeks after the initial surgery, one half of the anterior muscle wall of the greater curvature side was reapproximated. In fasting, the BER interval in the preanastomosis remained unchanged, but that in the postanastomosis became prolonged. After feeding, the BER interval in the postanastomosis was shortened and showed an advancement to close to that in the preanastomosis. 3 weeks after reapproximation of partial muscle wall, the BER interval in the postanastomosis recovered to the same BER interval as in the preanastomosis in fasting and after feeding stages. Dysrhythmia in the postanastomosis was of temporal occurrance.

Sixty-one stomachs of five beaked whale species were examined, including Berardius, Hyperoodon, Mesoplodon, Tasmacetus, and Ziphius. Specimens were obtained post mortem from beach-stranded individuals, with the exception of 30 Berardius specimens that were taken at a whaling station in Japan. Most specimens were collected by the Marine Mammal Program of the National Museum of Natural History, with the exception of one specimen of Mesoplodon steinegeri, which from the Los Angeles County Museum and one specimen of Tasmacetus from the Museum of New Zealand. Additional data are included from published accounts. A single species was examined for all of the genera but Mesoplodon, where there was material for 7 of 13 known species. The sample of Berardius bairdii was sufficient (n = 30) to determine species-specific variation in compartment counts. Chamber anatomy was explored by means of manual palpation. Results indicate that ziphiid stomachs can be separated into at least three principal groups: generalized ziphiid stomach (one main stomach, one pyloric stomach), derived stomach type I (two main stomachs, one pyloric stomach), and derived stomach type II (two main stomachs, two pyloric stomachs). Generalized stomachs are found in Hyperoodon, Tasmacetus, Ziphius, Mesoplodon densirostris, M. perrini, and M. stejnegeri. Derived stomachs of type I are found in Berardius, and of type II are found in Mesoplodon bidens, M. europaeus, and M. mirus. The ziphiids clearly form a distinct group of cetaceans in their utilization of differences in stomach morphology. These anatomical differences may serve to elucidate systematic relationships among the ziphiids.

{"id": "11403544", "title": "Alterations in intragastric nitrite and vitamin C levels during acid inhibitory therapy.", "text": "Most nitrite entering the healthy acid-secreting stomach is derived from dietary nitrate. The latter is absorbed from the small intestine, 25% then being secreted by the salivary glands into the mouth. Buccal organisms subsequently convert 20% of this nitrate to nitrite. When this nitrite is swallowed, the ascorbic acid in the acidic gastric juice reduces it to nitric oxide, which is absorbed by the mucosa. In the process, the ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. When the intragastric pH is elevated by powerful anti-secretory agents, this gastric chemistry is profoundly modified. At a neutral pH, the swallowed nitrite does not react with ascorbic acid but accumulates in the stomach. The level of nitrite in the gastric juice during treatment with anti-secretory medication is particularly high after a nitrate-containing meal. Powerful anti-secretory medication also lowers the intragastric concentration of ascorbic acid and total vitamin C, probably because of the relative instability of the vitamin at a higher pH. These changes in the intragastric concentrations of nitrite and ascorbic acid are most marked in Helicobacter pylori -infected subjects on proton pump inhibitor therapy. It is recognized that an elevated nitrite-to-ascorbic acid ratio predisposes to the formation of potentially carcinogenic N -nitroso compounds. It is, however, unclear at present whether such compounds are formed within the human stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11403544/"}

We calculated gastric power, by spectral analysis of EGG by the maximum entropy method, for 400 s before and after water ingestion, and calculated their ratio (power ratio). We calculated, using sonography, the number of antral contractions before and after water ingestion, the motility index after water ingestion, the distance between the antrum and the abdominal skin surface before and after water ingestion, and the ratio of these distances (distance ratio). The number of contractions was positively correlated with gastric power before water ingestion, and the antrum-skin distance was negatively correlated with gastric power both before and after water ingestion. The motility index after water ingestion was positively correlated with both gastric power after water ingestion (Spearman's rank correlation r = 0.492; P = 0.0498) and the power ratio (r = 0.615; P = 0.0141).

The colorimetric analysis demonstrated that the CPAE exhibited an importance in vitro antioxidant activity against ABTS and DPPH radicals. We found that CPAE pretreatment in vivo, protected against EtOH-induced macroscopic and histological changes induced in stomach mucosa. Carob extract administration also protected against alcohol-induced volume gastric juice decrease. More importantly, We showed that CPAE counteracted EtOH-induced gastric lipoperoxidation, reversed the decrease of sulfhydryl groups (-SH) an hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, and prevented the depletion of antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).

Progress requires a better understanding of dysrhythmic behaviors, including the slow wave patterns that accompany or promote them. The aim of this study was to use high-resolution spatiotemporal mapping to characterize and quantify the initiation and conduction of porcine gastric dysrhythmias. High-resolution mapping was performed on healthy fasted weaner pigs under general anesthesia. Recordings were made from the gastric serosa using flexible arrays (160-192 electrodes; 7.6mm spacing). Dysrhythmias were observed to occur in 14 of 97 individual recordings (from 8 of 16 pigs), and these events were characterized, quantified and classified using isochronal mapping and animation. All observed dysrhythmias originated in the corpus and fundus. The range of dysrhythmias included incomplete conduction block (n=3 pigs; 3.9±0.5cpm; normal range: 3.2±0.2cpm) complete conduction block (n=3; 3.7±0.4cpm), escape rhythm (n=5; 2.0±0.3cpm), competing ectopic pacemakers (n=5, 3.7±0.1cpm) and functional re-entry (n=3, 4.1±0.4cpm). Incomplete conduction block was observed to self-perpetuate due to retrograde propagation of wave fragments. Functional re-entry occurred in the corpus around a line of unidirectional block. 'Double potentials' were observed in electrograms at sites of re-entry and at wave collisions. Intraoperative multi-electrode mapping of fasted weaner healthy pigs detected dysrhythmias in 15% of recordings (from 50% of animals), including patterns not previously reported.

The system comprises an anchor made of a flexible body embedding two needle-shaped electrodes. The electrodes can easily switch from a parallel position - to pierce the stomach - to a diverging position - enabling them to remain firmly anchored into the muscular layer of the stomach. Key device parameters governing anchoring stability were assessed on a traction test bench, and optimal values were derived. The device was then implanted in six dogs by open surgery to assess its anchoring durability in vivo. Computed tomography images showed that the electrodes remained well placed within the dogs' gastric wall over the entire assessment period (more than one year). Finally, a prototype of a surgical tool for the minimally invasive device placement was manufactured, and the anchoring procedure was tested on a dog cadaver, providing the proof of concept of the minimally invasive implantation procedure. The use of our electrode anchoring system in long-term gastric electrical stimulation is promising in terms of implantation stability (the anchor withstands a force up to 0.81 N), durability (the anchor remains onto the stomach over one year) and minimal invasiveness of the procedure (the diameter of the percutaneous access is smaller than 12 mm).

We have used a new radionuclide technique to quantify proximal, distal and total stomach emptying of a digestible solid meal (100 g of 99Tcm-labelled liver/ground beef given with 150 ml of 10% dextrose) in 13 normal subjects. A proximal reservoir area was seen after consumption of the meal, and used to define the proximal stomach region. A line drawn immediately below this area divided the total stomach region into proximal and distal stomach. Emptying from the total stomach exhibited two phases--an initial lag period (median 41 min, range 21-57 min), followed by approximately linear emptying. Redistribution of food from the proximal to the distal stomach was a major component of the lag period in 11 of the 13 subjects. In the remaining two subjects, redistribution was rapid (proximal 50% emptying time of 4 and 10 min) and antral retention was the major component of the lag period. In seven subjects, a region of reduced activity (contraction band) was seen. The midpoint of this band closely approximated to the line used to divide proximal and distal stomach. We suggest that a contraction band may be responsible for the proximal gastric reservoir seen after meal consumption and plays an important role in the redistribution and emptying of digestible solid food from the stomach.

Spectrophotometric arteriovenous oxygen difference and electromagnetic blood flow were recorded continuously. Except at the lowest frequency of stimulation (2 Hz), total blood flow exhibited autoregulatory escape, i.e., blood flow decreased initially but then returned toward control. The fall in total blood flow at the onset of sympathetic stimulation was smaller at 2 Hz than at 4 Hz, but stimulation at 6 and 8 Hz caused no further reductions in total blood flow. However, at all frequencies, total blood flow escaped to the same steady-state value (approximately 17 ml.min-1.100 g-1). Although total blood flow was still less than control (approximately 25 ml.min-1.100 g-1), oxygen extraction increased proportionately so that oxygen consumption was not significantly less than control at any frequency of stimulation. We conclude that autoregulatory escape from sympathetic stimulation is mediated by local mechanisms acting to maintain tissue oxygenation in the stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2801944/"}

The stomach has been implicated as one source of signals regulating food intake. The sight and smell of food are potent stimuli to gastric acid secretion and contraction. The mouth, upper gastrointestinal tract and liver contain receptors regulating food intake; afferent information passes into the brain stem and into the brain areas. Lateral hypothalamic lesions abolish feeding, raise the body temperature and basal gastric acid secretion and produce gastric erosions. Vagotomy and administering propantheline bromide abolish the increased acid secretion after such lesions; they also alter the mucosal barrier permitting diffusion of protons into mucosal cells. Several of the neuropeptides via the central nervous system stimulate or inhibit gastric acid secretion through modulation of the autonomic nervous system. Most animal models of gastric erosions are associated with a reduced body temperature. Unknown is whether or not this association is the result of increased levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone-a potent stimulus to gastric acid secretion and erosion formation when injected intracisternally.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2863896/"}

Baclofen floating tablet was prepared to offer convenience by designing a tablet that would float in the stomach for a prolonged period and allow controlled drug release to enable once-a-day administration. Ethylcellulose microballoons (ECMBs) prepared by pseudo emulsion solvent diffusion method were employed as floating aid. The ECMBs were spherical with a size of 446.71 µm and a circularity index of 0.995. Buoyancy of 98.90 percent and good flowability reflected by an angle of repose of 23° suggested the feasibility of preparing floating tablets by direct compression. Directly compressed baclofen floating tablets comprised ECMBs, HPMC-K15M, and hydroxyl ethylcellulose as independent variables in the Box-Behnken design, however, performance characteristics of tablets such as in vitro drug release, floating lag time, and swelling index were selected as the dependent variables. Among the variables, ECMBs played a critical role in ensuring buoyancy. However, HPMC-K15M significantly influenced in vitro drug release. The optimized batch displayed Hickson-Crowell kinetics and exhibited a similar drug release profile as a marketed once-a-day formulation (f<sub>2</sub>, 91.03). Furthermore, optimized tablets showed a swelling index of > 300, floating lag time < 3 s, and total floating time > 24 h.

The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of the distal stomach to generate transpyloric flow pulses in the absence of the proximal stomach. Concurrent motility and flow measurements were made in eight anesthetized pigs. Four animals had the proximal stomach excluded by creation of a mucosal septal pouch. Although major modifications of both flow pulse and motility patterns resulted from proximal stomach exclusion, emptying remained pulsatile and overall emptying rate unchanged. After proximal stomach exclusion, backflow disappeared and flow pulses occurred simultaneously with antral and pyloric pressure events, whereas flow pulses preceded the pressure events in intact animals. The frequency of flow pulses decreased after proximal stomach exclusion because the interval between gastroduodenal pressure events was longer. In contrast, there was an increase in the stroke volume of flow pulses attributable to a decrease in pyloric resistance. Exclusion of the proximal stomach does not modify the overall emptying rate, although the mechanisms responsible for emptying are modified. In particular, the stroke volume of individual pulses is greater.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8020687/"}

Prenatal diagnosis of CM is a challenge with important implications. This study explores the value of biochemical amniotic fluid (AF) analysis and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the prenatal diagnosis of CM in case of nonvisible stomach on fetal ultrasound. Four cases of CM were retrospectively investigated in terms of fetal ultrasound, MRI findings, and biochemical AF analyses. The patients were referred to the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit of the Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant (Lyon, France) at a mean age of 21 weeks of gestation for absent or small fetal stomach on ultrasound with a suspected diagnosis of esophageal atresia (EA). Ultrasound examination confirmed that the stomach was absent in two of the four fetuses and small in the other two. This feature was associated with a congenital heart defect in two cases and a terminal transverse limb defect in one case. Standard genetic workup (array-CGH) results were normal. Biochemical AF analysis, including the EA index, was not suggestive of EA. Fetal MRI showed a small midline tubular stomach, associated with a dilated esophagus, highly suggestive of CM. If the fetal stomach is absent on ultrasound, CM should be considered if the AF volume is normal, especially during the third trimester, and if the EA index is not suggestive of gastrointestinal obstruction. In these cases, the diagnosis can be confirmed by fetal MRI, through observation of a small midline tubular stomach associated with a dilated esophagus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38934150/"}
{"id": "9647465", "title": "Different actions of CCK on pancreatic and gastric growth in the rat: effect of CCK(A) receptor blockade.", "text": "1. It is now well established that cholecystokinin (CCK) has a major physiological role in the regulation of pancreatic secretion and gastro-intestinal (GI) motility. Both these actions are mediated by stimulation of CCK(A)-receptors located on pancreatic acini and GI smooth muscle cells. While chronic administration of CCK-like peptides invariably causes pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, their action on gastric growth remains controversial. 2. In the present investigation the action of exogenous and endogenous CCK on both pancreatic and gastric growth was studied in the same animal. In addition, the ability of dexloxiglumide, a new potent and selective CCK(A)-receptor antagonist, to counteract CCK-mediated effects was evaluated. 3. The amphibian peptide caerulein (1 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally three times daily) was used as a CCK agonist, while camostate (200 mg kg(-1) intragastrically once daily), a synthetic protease inhibitor, was used to release endogenous CCK. They were administered to rats for seven days with or without dexloxiglumide (25 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously 15 min before the stimulus). On the eighth day, animals were killed, the pancreas and stomach excised, weighed, homogenized and their protein and DNA content measured. 4. Both exogenous and endogenous CCK increased the weight of the pancreas as well as the total pancreatic protein and DNA content. Dexloxiglumide, which alone did not affect pancreatic size and composition, was able to counteract both caerulein- and camostate-induced pancreatic changes. Neither stimuli affected gastric growth in respect of weight and composition of the oxyntic gland area and the antrum. 5. These results show different effects of CCK on pancreatic and gastric growth. The CCK-induced pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia are blocked by the potent and specific CCK(A)-receptor antagonist, dexloxiglumide. This compound therefore represents a useful tool to investigate CCK-receptor interactions in peripheral organs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9647465/"}

In the isthmus, stem cells designated \"undifferentiated granule-free cells\" undergo division so as to maintain their own number and produce several differently oriented progenitors: (1) \"Pre-pit cell precursors\" are characterized by prosecretory Golgi vesicles with a uniform, fine particulate content. They give rise to \"pre-pit cells\" defined by the presence of few dense mucous granules. These cells migrate outward from the isthmus to the pit, where they become the dense granule-rich \"pit cells\" which populate the pit region and migrate to the gastric surface where they are lost. (2) \"Pre-neck cell precursors\" are identified by prosecretory Golgi vesicles containing an irregular dense center and a light rim. They give rise to \"pre-neck cells\" defined by a few mucous secretory granules with a clear-cut core. These cells migrate inward from the isthmus to the neck where they become \"neck cells,\" which contain many such granules. Even though neck cells are mature mucus-producers, they are not end cells. As they enter the base region, they become \"prezymogenic cells\" whose phenotype gradually changes from mucous to serous. These cells eventually lose the ability to produce mucus and thus become the typical zymogenic cells that populate the base region.

The normal human slow wave ranges from 2.5 to 3.75 cycles per min (cpm), tachygastrias range from 3.75 cpm to 10.0 cpm and bradygastrias from .5 to 2.5 cpm, the gastric dysrhythmias of men and women. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, O'Grady, et al. describe the gastric dysrhythmias of pigs in electrocardiology terms. Printed circuit boards (PCB) with multi-electrode arrays (160-192 electrodes) were attached to the stomach serosa. Gastric dysrhythmias occurred in eight of the 16 anesthetized pigs and were analysed by manually and by computer. The patterns of dysrhythmias were reminiscent of cardiac dysrhythmias: conduction blocks, ectopic foci, re-entrant wave fronts, premature and aberrant slow waves and regular and irregular tachygastrias. The authors suggest gastric dysrhythmias recorded in pigs may be relevant to human gastric dysrhythmias and electricity-based therapies. The categories of porcine gastric dysrhythmias may help to understand the spectrum of gastric dysrhythmias of men and women recorded over the past 25 years. Analogies between gastric and cardiac neuromuscular disorders are explored because Neurogastroenterology is evolving as a clinical and therapeutic field utilizing knowledge of gastric rhythmicity and electro-contractile events. Interstitial cells of Cajal are the pacemaker cells of the stomach and loss of cells or faulty circuitry appear to be key pathways to gastric dysrhythmias. Gastric electrophysiology (EP) labs, human and animal, are needed to test hypotheses and advance understanding of human gastric dysrhythmias and upper GI symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21838727/"}

The most typical challenge is the design of more adequate visual descriptors that can assist the classification algorithms in getting good diagnostic results. Literature shows that most of the texture descriptors for feature extraction from gastric lesions are based on Gabor filters or local binary patterns (LBP). Although good results are obtained, these techniques have their shortcomings. In this paper, we aim to explore the use of fusion of Gabor filters and LBPs for characterizing gastric lesions. The images are first subjected to Gabor filtering using isotropic Gabor filters, followed by extracting LBPs from the filtered images. We validate the performance of the descriptor on a novel gastroenterology dataset: the Post-MAPS dataset. Our results show that the proposed feature set outperforms the other methods that have been considered in this paper.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28268541/"}

As a result of the requirement of surgical skill of LRG, the evidence is always highly demanded. The surgical safety and radical resection of tumor is one of the most important principles. Based on published studies and authors' own experience, this article discusses the following topics on laparoscopic gastrectomy: (1)Indications of surgery: Laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer is accepted all over the world. For locally advanced gastric cancer, laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 dissection is considered to be safe and feasible based on domestic studies, especially the CLASS research. (2)Positions and approaches: Classic approaches of laparoscopic gastrectomy include left-side approach, right-side approach, anterior approach and posterior approach. Left-side position is the first choice in China, which is suitable for most laparoscopic gastrectomy. Meanwhile, right-side position is most recommended in Japan and Korea. The selection of approach could be varied by the feature of the tumor, the anatomy of the tumor and the habit of surgeons. (3) Lymphadenectomy of the superior area of pancreas: Based on Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (14th edition), Chinese Expert Consensus on Quality Control of Laparoscopic Radical Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer (2017 edition) and authors' own experience, we define the lymph node dissection margin of the superior area of pancreas in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 dissection as follows: right side is the left wall of portal vein; left side is the posterior gastric artery; upper side is the commissure of diaphragmatic crura; lower side is the anterosuperior side of common hepatic artery and splenic artery; posterior side (on the right side of coeliac trunk) is the plane composed of portal vein, common hepatic artery and the root of coeliac trunk; posterior side (on the left side of coeliac trunk) is the Gerota's fascia. (4) Bursectomy or not: Bursectomy is not recommended as standard procedure in cT3 or cT4a gastric cancer based on the results of JCOG1001. However, to achieve a better surgical plane, dissection of anterior lobe of transverse mesocolon and pancreatic capsule in some area is accepted. (5) Totally laparoscopic reconstruction of digestive tract: along with the development of equipment and modification of anastomosis, the totally laparoscopic reconstruction of digestive tract becomes more and more welcome in laparoscopic gastrectomy as it provides a better and larger surgical scene compared to small incision assisted surgery. The whole procedure of anastomosis is overlooked by laparoscopy, without any over traction of tissue.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28836239/"}

Forty-nine of the 52 tumors could be examined by endosonography and 41 by hydrosonography. The T-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 74% and 46% for hydrosonography. Carcinoma of the cardia are often classified as uT3 and hT3 preoperatively and pT2 postoperatively due to infiltration of the subserosal fat. The N-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 86% and 61% for hydrosonography.

Eighty-two patients diagnosed with pituitary adenoma were recruited consecutively. Semi-quantitative (Perlas scores: 0, 1 and 2) and quantitative (cross-sectional area, CSA) ultrasound assessments of the gastric antrum were performed immediately before and after surgery in the semi-recumbent and semi-recumbent right-lateral positions. Seven (8.5%) patients had antrum scores from preoperative grade 0 to postoperative grade 2; nine (11%) patients had antrum scores from preoperative grade 0 to postoperative grade 1. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of increased gastric volume was 71.0 ± 33.1 mL and 236.5 ± 32.4 mL in postoperative grade 1 and 2 groups, respectively.

There were those responding to mucosal stroking (mucosal receptors), to circular tension (tension receptors) and those responding to mucosal stroking and circular tension, which we have termed tension/mucosal (TM) receptors. 3. The conduction velocities for mucosal, TM and tension receptor fibres were 6.38 +/- 1.22 m s-1 (n = 22), 6.20 +/- 1.49 m s-1 (n = 13) and 5.33 +/- 0.86 m s-1 (n = 22), respectively. 4.

This retro-oesophageal tuberous valve involves simultaneous fixation of the stomach and oesophagus to the pillars of the diaphragm, first on the right and then on the left, and the fixation of the fundus to the left diaphragmatic dome. Anterior gastro-oesophago-phreno-plasty is proposed on the basis of the finding that damage of any kind to the meso-oesophagus can cause the oesophagus to rise in the chest and thus disturb inferior sphincter function and possibly lead to the onset of regurgitation and hernia. The pre-oesophageal tuberous valve employed involves simultaneous fixation of stomach and oesophagus to the pillars of the diaphragm, first left and then right, and the fixation of the fundus to the left diaphragmatic dome.

Contents of the E and F types of PG were measured by radioimmunoassay as PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. The isolated circular muscles contained 17.04 +/- 2.12 ng PGE2/g tissue (n = 12) and 9.38 +/- 0.62 ng PGF2 alpha/g tissue (n = 12), and released 0.36 +/- 0.04 ng PGE2/g tissue/min (n = 10) and 0.14 +/- 0.01 ng PGF2 alpha/g tissue/min (n = 12) into the solution. These contents and releases of PGs were reduced by treatment with indomethacin (ID50 = 0.3 microgram/ml). Indomethacin (0.1-6 microgram/ml) increased the amplitude of spontaneous contractions dose-dependently, while high concentrations (20 microgram/ml) conversely depressed it. Physiological concentrations of exogenously applied PGE2 (0.03-0.35 ng/ml) markedly suppressed spontaneous contractions in the presence and absence of indomethacin (3 microgram/ml), while PGF2 alpha in concentrations of 0.35-3.54 ng/ml slightly increased them. Therefore, these results suggested that spontaneous contractions in circular muscles were largely influenced by the E type of endogenous PG, not by the F type. The indomethacin-induced increase in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions was not affected by intrinsic nerves and was accompanied by an increase in spike discharges on the slow wave and 45Ca uptake in the muscle cells. These observations suggested that the E type of endogenous PG in circular muscles might play a suppressive role in spontaneous contractions by inhibiting spike generation on the slow wave.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7265559/"}

In particular, HDlive rendering images showed remarkably fine details that appeared as if they were being viewed under an endoscope, with visible rugal folds after 27 weeks' gestational age. Our study suggests that the HDlive rendering mode can be used as an additional method for evaluating the fetal stomach.

{"id": "22954692", "title": "Gastric secretion.", "text": "This review summarizes the past year's literature regarding the regulation of gastric exocrine and endocrine secretion, both basic science and clinical. Gastric acid secretion facilitates the digestion of protein as well as the absorption of iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and certain medications as well as prevents bacterial overgrowth, enteric infection, and possibly community-acquired pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and IgE-mediated food allergy. It is regulated by neural (e.g., pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide), hormonal (e.g., gastrin, ghrelin, and apelin), and paracrine (e.g., histamine) pathways as well as by chemical (e.g., amino acids) and bacterial stimuli (e.g., Helicobacter pylori). Novel peptides, which may possess physiologic function, have been identified in gastric mucosal neuroendocrine cells including parathyroid hormone-like hormone in histamine-secreting enterochromaffin-like cells and hepcidin in acid-secreting parietal cells. The secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells involves translocation of the proton pump, HK-ATPase, to the apical membrane along with activation of apical chloride and potassium channels. Serum markers include chromogranin A for neuroendocrine tumors, pepsinogen I for gastric atrophy, and pepsinogen II for H. pylori infection. We continue to make progress in our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion in health and disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22954692/"}

Of the methods available for studying gastric emptying patterns, nuclear medicine techniques are optimal due to their noninvasive character, reproducibility and quantitative ability. The modulation of gastric emptying is multifactorial, and includes motor control, electrical activity, hormonal influences, and the composition of the meal itself: liquid vs solid; protein, carbohydrate and fat content; fiber or particle size; osmolality; pH; and pharmacologic agents. Because of the ease of performing gastric emptying studies using radiolabeled physiologic meals, these tests are being employed with increasing frequency in the evaluation of patients with disorders such as diabetic gastroparesis, postgastrectomy gastroparesis or dumping syndrome, and in the study of normal gastric physiology in man. Present data suggests that combined liquid-solid, dual radionuclide studies afford the greatest information regarding simultaneous gastric emptying patterns of liquid and solid components of a meal, and that single radionuclide, solid tests of gastric emptying are the more sensitive technique for determining subtle abnormalities of gastric emptying, when only a single tracer is employed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7089589/"}

The weight loss was not correlated with radiologically measured stoma size or volume of the upper gastric pouch. Thus, in contrast studies combined with Gastroluft (sodium bicarbonate, tartaric acid, and dimethicone), pouch distention does not yield prognostic information on anticipated weight loss.

A total of 22 dogs were included, with time since gastropexy ranging from 16 to 1552 days (median: 311 days). Computed tomography findings showed a median attenuation of 38.5 HU (range: 6 to 57) of the gastropexy site, as well as focal slight thickening of the gastric wall and adjacent muscle in all dogs. Neovascularisation at the gastropexy site was found in approximately 65% of the animals, while marked gastric dilatation was noted in 32%, and a gravel sign was observed in 73%.

If there is close collaboration between the radiologist and the surgeon performing the endoscopy, this method can considerably improve diagnosis. Its application enabled 21 \"early\" cancers (as defined by the Japanese Society of Gastro-Enterology and Endoscopy) to be diagnosed out of 8 000 exsminations performed between 1971 and 1977. The smallest lesion measured 0.5 X 0.8 cm. The diagnostic value of this examination technique is about equal to that of fibroscopy, and a comparison of the different methods of radiological examination clearly demonstrates the superiority of double contrast for detecting small lesions: 19 of the 21 early cancers were visible in the double contrast images, while only 10 produced irregulrities in the walls as seen when filling had been completed, and 6 of the 21 lesions appeared during compression. This method is also very useful for the differential diagnosis of ulcers, ulcer scars, and early cancer.

During the period, there was a gradual increase in the expression of pepsinogen and cathepsin E, markers of cytodifferentiation of the stomach epithelia, both at protein and mRNA levels. Cathepsin E was weakly expressed in undifferentiated gastric epithelial cells at 16.5 days of gestation, and a higher level of the expression was observed in differentiated epithelia of the transplants. In contrast, the pepsinogen-producing cells first appeared around days 3-4 after transplantation and gradually increased in number to about 30% of the epithelial cells and became localized at the bottom of the gland. During the period of the experiment up to 1 month, the pepsinogen-producing cells were all positive for class III mucin and cathepsin E, indicating the immature character of these cells.

When the tissue fragments were transplanted into adrenalectomized animals, the epithelial differentiation and morphogenesis was suppressed, but its proliferation was enhanced. The observed changes were reversed by hydrocortisone replacement. These results suggest that the development of the 16.5-day fetal stomach is regulated intrinsically to a certain extent by the genetic program of the cells involved and various gastric functions develop in the absence of luminal stimulation, stage-specific systemic hormonal change, neuronal regulation or other systemic influences, and that glucocorticoids modulate the developmental program of the fetal stomach tissues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9338599/"}

Experiment one was performed in all dogs to test for food intake with or without GES. Experiment two on six normal dogs consisted of baseline, GES and recovery periods. Gastric volume and GMA were recorded. 1) GES reduced food intake in both normal (398.5+/-111.7 g versus 573.0+/-97.9 g; p<0.02) and vagotomized dogs (170.6+/-100.4 g versus 401.0+/-97.3 g; p<0.05). 2) Gastric volume was increased with stimulation from 168.4+/-17.7 ml to 301.1+/-34.1 ml (p<0.02 ANOVA) and maintained at 271.8+/-27.6 ml. 3) The percentages of normal slow waves before, during and after GES were 83.3+/-4.6%, 38.0+/-3.5% and 61.0+/-12.5%, respectively (p=0.02 ANOVA). Long-pulse GES at tachygastrial frequency substantially reduces food intake, and is not mediated by the vagal pathway but attributed to relaxation of the stomach and impairment of intrinsic GMA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17505992/"}

A clear dominant frequency close to 3 cpm was present both at baseline and after eight weeks of cisapride. After cisapride, nine children had an increase in the normal slow wave percentage and the mean percentage of normal slow wave was significantly different (71.90 +/- 5.19% vs 79.16 +/- 5.54%; P < 0.01). Moreover, an increased stability of the dominant frequency, determined by computing the coefficient of variation before and after cisapride, was found (28.12 +/- 1.72% vs 23.61 +/- 3.47%; P < 0.01). At baseline the gastric emptying time, expressed as T1/2, was 139.76 +/- 40.04 min and at eight weeks 119.76 +/- 30.04 min (P = 0.06). As regards the relationship between EGG and gastric emptying, the proportion of children with improved normal slow wave percentage was similar to that with improved T1/2 emptying (Z = 0.57, P = 0.57).

TBX1 maps within the region of chromosome 22q11 deleted in humans with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), a common genetic disorder characterized by numerous physical manifestations including craniofacial and cardiac anomalies. Mice with homozygous null mutations in Tbx1 phenocopy this disorder and have defects including abnormal cranial ganglia formation and cardiac neural crest cell migration. These defects prompted us to investigate whether extrinsic vagus nerve or intrinsic enteric nervous system abnormalities are prevalent in the gastrointestinal tract of Tbx1 mutant mice. We used in situ hybridization for Ret, and immunohistochemical staining for neurofilament, HuC/D and βIII-tubulin to study cranial ganglia, vagus nerve, and enteric nervous system development in Tbx1 mutant and control mice. In Tbx1(-/-) embryos, cranial ganglia of the glossopharyngeal (IXth) and vagus (Xth) nerves were malformed and abnormally fused. In the gastrointestinal tract, the vagus nerves adjacent to the esophagus were severely hypoplastic and they did not extend beyond the gastro-esophageal junction nor project branches within the stomach wall, as was observed in Tbx1(+/+) mice. Although cranial ganglia morphology appeared normal in Tbx1(+/-) mice, these animals had a spectrum of stomach vagus innervation defects ranging from mild to severe. In all Tbx1 genotypes, the intrinsic enteric nervous system developed normally. The deficit in vagal innervation of the stomach in mice mutant for a gene implicated in DGS raises the possibility that similar defects may underlie a number of as yet unidentified/unreported congenital disorders affecting gastrointestinal function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20939858/"}

In order to further analyze the vascular mechanisms underlying histamine-induced lesions, a new model was developed in the glandular stomach via administration of histamine (40 mg/kg, s.c.) twice to rats with partial gastric vascular occlusion (ligated left gastric artery and vein) also subjected to pylorus ligation. Both antagonists of histamine H(2)-receptors (roxatidine and famotidine) and H(1)-receptors (epinastine and tripelennamine) significantly inhibited lesion formation at doses that did not inhibit acid secretion. Combined treatment of tripelennamine and famotidine synergistically inhibited lesion formation. Nitro L-arginine methyl ester inhibited lesion development; inhibition was reversed by concomitantly administered L-arginine. Indomethacin, diclofenac, and SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor), but not rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor), significantly inhibited lesion formation. In addition, sodium bicarbonate, pirenzepine, S-0509 (a gastrin/CCK(2) inhibitor), omeprazole, sucralfate, and a prostaglandin analog also significantly inhibited lesion formation. It was concluded that the mechanism by which histamine induces gastric lesions in rats with partial gastric vascular occlusion appears to involve extensive vasodilation resulting from histamine acting on microvasculature histamine H(1)- and H(2)-receptors, generation of endogenous nitric oxide and prostaglandins, with the presence of gastric acid.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12832840/"}

Since the environment, food requirements, and feeding habits have a significant impact on the anatomy of the alimentary tract of fish, it was assumed that predominantly carnivorous, semi-terrestrial mudskippers would have a stomach. In order to verify this hypothesis, anatomical, histological, histochemical and ultrastructural analysis of the alimentary tract of the Atlantic mudskipper Periophthalmus barbarus was performed. The results revealed that despite a lack of clear anatomical distinction within the alimentary tract, there were four well-distinguished sections visible at the histological level: oesophagus, stomach, intestine, and rectum. The division was enhanced by the presence of a pyloric sphincter and an ileorectal valve. The stomach contained tubular glands composed of oxynticopeptic cells. Gland cells had pepsinogen granules and a well-developed tubulovesicular network of smooth membranes, which indicates the secretion of gastric juice. The presence of neutral mucus in the apical region of surface epithelial cells as protection against hydrochloric acid as well as the presence of active pepsin also confirm gastric function.

The aim of this study is to investigate the direct effects of luminal RNOS on the adjacent gastric barrier function using an ex vivo chamber model. A chamber model in which the rat gastric mucosal membrane was mounted between the two halves of a chamber was designed to simulate the microenvironment of the lumen and the adjacent mucosa of the gastro-oesophageal junction. On the mucosal side of the chamber, RNOS were generated by the acidification of physiological concentrations of sodium nitrite. The epithelial barrier function was evaluated by electrophysiological transmembrane resistance, and membrane permeability with [3H]mannitol flux. The expression of occludin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Dinitrosyl dithiolato iron complex (DNIC) was also measured by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to confirm the diffusion of RNOS from the mucosal lumen into the mounted mucosa. The administration of acidified nitrite to the mucosal lumen caused both a decrease in transmembrane resistance and an increase in epithelial permeability, suggesting a disturbance of the gastric barrier function. These changes were accompanied by a derangement of the expression of occludin. The diffusion of luminal RNOS into the mounted membrane was confirmed by showing the generation of DNIC within the tissue. Simulating the microenvironment of the human gastro-oesophageal junction, this study demonstrated that RNOS generated luminally at the human gastro-oesophageal junction can derange the barrier function of the adjacent tissue by disrupting the tight junction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17965057/"}

As determined by Fourier analysis, the dominant EGG frequency before barium was 3 cpm in 16 subjects; two subjects had no distinct frequency peaks. After barium ingestion, the mean amplitude or power at 3 cpm and 1 cpm increased, but the increase was significant only after 45% barium. (1) individual EGG waves after barium reflect gastric peristaltic sequences, which are reflected in increases in amplitude or power of 3 cpm EGG activity; (2) density or viscosity of the barium meal affects the gastric myoelectric response; and (3) mechanical correlates of 1 cpm EEG activity are unknown.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3665676/"}

The vascular factor is the main element of any reconstruction technique, as an underlying condition for the visceral material stretch and, along with other factor, for the suture safety. In the case of the stomach, a consistent vascular flow and the minimal vascular anatomy variations are the first theoretical argument. A second argument is based on the intraparietal vascular network features allowing for supplementing visceral perfusion as the blood flow is stopped in one or more pediculi. Graft hypoperfusion is, however, a potential cause of failure, and the most frequently invoked complication is, therefore, a high risk of anastomosis fistulae. A series of modern techniques - arteriography data for the pre-operative vascular reconstruction or Doppler laser fluorometry intraoperative assessments, graft oximetry, laser speckle (spot) scan or the use of indocyanine green staining (ICG) - represent methods of early determination of the gastric graft perfusion/microperfusion quality used in reducing such risks. The doubts regarding the gastric perfusion mandate the use of vascular augmentation techniques. If such techniques are not used, the final outcome is uncertain and difficult to correct.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35535775/"}

Opening of the arteriovenous shunting channel after thermal injury is one of the possible mechanisms to reduce mucosal blood flow. However, no in vivo observation of arteriovenous shunting blood flow in the stomach has been reported. To assess gastric microcirculatory disturbance, especially arteriovenous shunting blood flow after thermal injury by in vivo microsciopy, male Wistar rats were anesthetized and thermal injury was inflicted on the back skin. Gastric microvascular images were observed by in vivo microscopy. Rolling of leukocytes labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester were counted and blood flow dynamics were observed by flow of a micro dye, monastral blue B (MBB). The endothelial damage was assessed by deposits of MBB 5 min after the administration. Arteriovenous shunting blood flow is difficult to detect by normal methods, but it could be observed by How of MBB after thermal injury. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the ratio of arteriovenous shunting blood flow detection between the control (no injury) (0%; n = 15) and thermal injury (5 hrs after thermal injury) (28.6%; n = 14) groups. In the thermal injury group, the percentage of rolling leukocytes and the area of monastral blue B deposits increased, and the venular walls tended to be irregular. The total length of erosion increased time-dependently after thermal injury, and the length at 5 hrs was approximately 2 times larger than that at 2 hrs. Arteriovenous shunting blood flow is intravitally observed after thermal injury. A-V shunting blood flow can be a cause of mucosal hypoperfusion. It is suggested that the microcirculatory disturbance seen 5 hrs after thermal injury is contributed to the final step of erosion formation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12528924/"}

In order to investigate the lifestyle of these biofilm lactobacilli in C57BL/6 mice, we applied metatranscriptomics to analyse gene expression (assessed by mRNA) and community composition (assessed by rRNA). Lactobacillales were the major biofilm inhabitants (62-82% of rRNA reads), followed by Clostridiales (8-31% of rRNA reads). To identify mRNA transcripts specific for the forestomach, we compared forestomach and hindgut metatranscriptomes. Gene expression of the biofilm microbiota was characterized by high abundance of transcripts related to glucose and maltose utilization, peptide degradation, and amino acid transport, indicating their major catabolic and anabolic pathways. The microbiota transcribed genes encoding pathways enhancing oxidative stress (glutathione synthesis) and acid tolerance. Various pathways, including metabolite formation (urea degradation, arginine pathway, γ-aminobutyrate) and cell wall modification (DltA, cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase), contributed to acid tolerance, as judged from the transcript profile. In addition, the biofilm microbiota expressed numerous genes encoding extracellular proteins involved in adhesion and/or biofilm formation (e.g. MucBP, glycosyl hydrolase families 68 and 70).

{"id": "1539009", "title": "Recent studies on regulation of gastric motility in turkeys.", "text": "Recent studies have been aimed at determining how gastroduodenal contractions are initiated and at regulation of the stomach during the intestinal phase of gastric regulation. Intrinsic, myogenic, electrical slow waves, the principal regulators of motility in the mammalian gut, have not been found in the avian gut. Instead, contractions appear to be initiated by a neurogenic pacemaker located between the gastric isthmus and the pylorus. Pacemaker impulses travel over the myenteric plexus to the glandular stomach and the duodenum, and to the muscles of the muscular stomach to initiate contractions. Extrinsic innervation does not appear to be involved in this initiation. The role of two hormones, avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP) and cholecystokinin (CCK), in regulation of gastric motility has been examined. Both hormones are released postprandially by the presence of ingesta in the upper small intestine and both depress gastroduodenal motility when administered to fowl.

Here we describe a novel approach to characterize the motility of the stomach wall that drives the volumetric changes of the ingesta. A neural ordinary differential equation was optimized to model a diffeomorphic flow that ascribed the deformation of the stomach wall to a continuous biomechanical process. Driven by this diffeomorphic flow, the surface of the stomach progressively changes its shape over time, while preserving its topology and manifoldness. We tested this approach with MRI data collected from 10 rats under a lightly anesthetized condition, and demonstrated accurate characterization of gastric motor events with an error in the order of sub-millimeters. Uniquely, we characterized gastric anatomy and motility with a surface coordinate system common at both individual and group levels. Functional maps were generated to reveal the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of muscle activity and its coordination across different regions. The peristalsis at the distal antrum had a dominant frequency and peak-to-peak amplitude of [Formula: see text] cycles per minute and [Formula: see text] mm, respectively. The relationship between muscle thickness and gastric motility was found to be distinct between two functional regions in the proximal and distal stomach.

In separate, real-life experiments, 6 pairs of bipolar electrodes were inserted into the gastric wall (3 anterior, 3 posterior) of 15 anesthetized dogs at laparotomy to record 6 channels of internal gastric electrical activity (GEA). Eight-channel bipolar cutaneous electrogastrography (EGG) was simultaneously recorded. Three separate 1/2-hr recordings were made from each dog in the basal state and after each of two circumferential cuts of all gastric muscle. Distal stomach was surgically divided into three equal-sized areas, each with an electrode pair in its anterior and posterior walls. Gastric electrical activity and EGG were digitized, bandpass-filtered and analyzed in frequency domain using the fast Hartley transform. The phenomena of tachygastria and tachyarrhythmia were quantitatively compared in internal and cutaneous recordings. Computer modeling indicated that it is possible to record cutaneous \"tachygastric\" or \"tachyarrhythmic\" signals without them being present internally. Real experiments on dogs showed higher percentage of tachyarrhythmia in EGG than in the internal signal in the basal state. After the first circumferential cut, the periods of tachygastria and tachyarrhythmia increased, with EGG signals showing again a higher percentage. This tendency persisted after the second circumferential cut. A similar pattern was observed when monitoring the percentage of uncorresponding tachygastrias/tachyarrhythmias. Our findings indicate that gastric electrical uncoupling can be another possible reason for abnormal frequency characteristics of EGG.

The raw EGG data, its power spectral data, and its autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modelling parameters are used as the input to the MFNN and compared with each other. Three indexes (the percent correct, sum-squared error and complexity per iteration) are used to evaluate the performance of each learning algorithm. The results show that the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm performs best, in that it is robust and provides a super-linear convergence rate. The power spectral representation and the ARMA modelling parameters of the EGG are found to be better types of the input to the network for this specific application, both yielding a percent correctness of 95% on the test set. Although the results are focused on the classification of the EGG, this paper should provide useful information for the classification of other biomedical signals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9246852/"}

The aim of the present study was to compare a two-step gastro-intestinal (GI) <i>in vitro</i> digestion model to the commonly used one-step intestinal digestion model. The models were evaluated by studying release of the model drug A1260 from two LbDDSs (F-I and F-II), for which <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetic data from oral administration to beagle dogs were available. The amount of A1260 recovered in the aqueous phases during and after the GI digestion of F-I and F-II was related to the <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-48h</sub> of the plasma concentration-time profiles of each formulation and produced a rank order <i>in vitro</i>-<i>in vivo</i> (IVIV) relation. In comparison, a similar IVIV rank ordering was obtained when relating the amount of A1260 recovered in the aqueous phase prior (<i>t</i> = 0 min), and following 15 min of intestinal digestion, to the plasma concentration-time profiles. However, after 60 min of intestinal digestion, the LbDDSs performed equally in the one-step <i>in vitro</i> digestion model, contrary to what was observed in the two-step digestion model, and <i>in vivo</i>. As the GI digestion model produced a clearer distinction in terms of LbDDS rank ordering of the two LbDDSs, compared to the intestinal digestion model, it was found to be a promising <i>in vitro</i> model to study and estimate the LbDDS behavior <i>in vivo</i>.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32662647/"}

While high-resolution (HR) electrical mapping techniques have largely contributed to the current understanding of the effect of pacing on the electrophysiological function, these mapping techniques are restricted to surface contact electrodes and the signal quality can be corrupted by pacing artifacts. Optical mapping of voltage sensitive dyes is an alternative approach used in cardiac research, and the signal quality is not affected by pacing artifacts. In this study, we simultaneously applied HR optical and electrical mapping techniques to evaluate the bioelectrical slow wave response to gastric pacing. The studies were conducted in vivo on porcine stomachs ( n=3) where the gastric electrical activity was entrained using high-energy pacing. The pacing response was optically tracked using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes and electrically tracked using surface contact electrodes positioned on adjacent regions. Slow waves were captured optically and electrically and were concordant in time and direction of propagation with comparable mean velocities ([Formula: see text]) and periods ([Formula: see text]). Importantly, the optical signals were free from pacing artifacts otherwise induced in electrical recordings highlighting an advantage of optical mapping. Clinical Relevance- Entrainment mapping of gastric pacing using optical techniques is a major advance for improving the preclinical understanding of the therapy. The findings can thereby inform the efficacy of gastric pacing in treating functional motility disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36086523/"}

A large number of neurotransmitters including glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are involved in the central control of gastric functions. However, the neuropeptidergic systems implicated in this process remain undetermined. Nesfatin-1 was recently identified as a neuropeptide cleaved from the N-terminal part of NEFA/nucleobindin 2 precursor (NUCB2). Central administration of this neuropeptide inhibits food consumption and gastroduodenal motility in rodents. Interestingly, the NTS and the DMNX contain a dense population of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 cell bodies. These observations led us to investigate the possible involvement of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons in the brainstem neuronal pathways that modulate gastric functions. We observed an activation of NTS NUCB2/nesfatinergic neurons after gastric distention in rats. In addition, we found that several NTS NUCB2/nesfatinergic neurons were GABAergic. Finally, when fluorogold was injected at the stomach level, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the DMNX which were also positive for NUCB2/nesfatin-1. Taken together, these observations suggest for the first time that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons of the NTS are sensitive to gastric distension and then may contribute to the satiety signal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24120633/"}

This study aimed to measure gastric wall thickness using pathology laboratory measurements and to identify variables correlated with stomach wall thickness in patients who had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. We obtained fresh resected stomach wall specimens from 30 patients. Stomach wall thickness was immediately measured postoperatively, comprising the muscle layer of the antrum, body, and fundus. Results were correlated with body mass index (BMI), age, and sex and with diagnoses of presurgical diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Stomach wall thickness ranged from 3.4 ± 4.3 mm to 1.0 ± 9.6 mm at the antrum. Except for the whole layer at the body wall, there was no significant correlation between wall thickness and other factors. At the body wall, whole layer wall thickness was found to positively correlate with age, sex, diabetes, and smoking (r = 0.469, - 0.391, 0.396, and 0.349, respectively; p < 0.05 in all patients). Stomach wall thickness varied among patients who had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy according to samples taken at three stomach wall sites. The range in wall thickness was normal, and thus, surgeons need not hesitate in selecting the staple height. Also, our study may be helpful to guide surgeon choice concerning the third or fourth staple around the body area when considering a patient's independent factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32062844/"}

Our aim was to determine the role of vagal innervation of the proximal stomach in mediating the response to nonnutrient proximal gastric distention. Five dogs underwent proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV) and placement of electrodes and manometry catheters on the antrum and the upper small intestine. Proximal gastric distention for 5 hr was achieved by inflating a thin, compliant bag in the proximal stomach. Four volumes of distention stimulus (0, 1.5, 12.5, and 25 ml/kg) were tested. As with total abdominal vagotomy, intragastric stimulus volumes of 12.5 and 25 ml/kg after PGV no longer inhibited cycling of the migrating motor complex in the stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and distal jejunum. Volumes of 12.5 and 25 ml/kg did, however, on occasion, lead to the absence of phase III activity in the stomach or the duodenum when it would have been expected to precede phase III activity in the jejunum; this effect did not occur in the jejunum.

A Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining revealed that each rat pre-treated with the plant extract displayed an intense uptake of stomach epithelial glycoprotein magenta color compared to the ulcer control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that rats pre-fed with the plant extract showed an up-regulation of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and down-regulation of Bax proteins compared to ulcer control rats. Homogenates of the stomach tissue demonstrated significant increases in the endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activity and decreased lipid peroxidation (MDA) in rats pre-treated with C. barometz hair extract compared with the ulcer control rats. In acute toxicity, the liver and kidney revealed no hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effects histologically.

An in vivo microscopy technique for the direct visualization of the rat gastric microcirculation was employed. Stimulation of the splanchnic nerve for 3 min caused an initial constriction of submucosal arterioles followed by escape (dilation during continued splanchnic stimulation) in all rats. No arteriovenous anastomoses were seen either in the resting state or during nerve stimulation. Mucosal studies with splanchnic stimulation revealed an initial progressive slowing of flow in the capillaries, followed by escape (partial return of flow). There were no significant differences between the times to maximum initial circulatory change in the submucosa and mucosa, and between the times to maximum escape in the submucosa and mucosa. These findings indicate that, in the rat, sympathetic stimulation decreases mucosal blood flow through a constricting effect on the supplying submucosal arterioles and not through the opening of \"shunts\". In studies with vagal stimulation, the submucosal arterioles dilated within 10 sec of beginning stimulation in 45 of 51 observations (P less than 0.001) and decreased in diameter within 10 sec of cessation of stimulation in 45 of 51 observations (P less than 0.001).

GVX and control rats received a series of intragastric glucose infusions (1.0 ml/min) through indwelling gastric fistulas. In experiment 1, gastric samples were withdrawn either immediately after the offset of 9- or 18-min infusions of 12.5% glucose or at various times up to 36 min postinfusion. In experiment 2, samples were withdrawn either immediately or 30 min after termination of 12-min infusions of 12.5 or 25% glucose. After gastric fill, glucose solute emptying rate was stable over time not influenced by concentration doubling, and, surprisingly, not affected by GVX. During gastric fill, solute emptying rate doubled with concentration in both GVX and control rats. For each concentration, however, glucose emptied during fill at almost twice the rate in GVX compared with control rats. This accelerated emptying of glucose during fill in GVX rats is consistent with a gastric vagal contribution to inhibitory mechanisms (e.g., receptive relaxation) that operate as the stomach fills under normal conditions. The absence of a GVX effect on emptying after fill suggests either that gastric branch vagal efferents play little role in feedback inhibitory control of glucose emptying under normal conditions or that other systems compensate for the function previously served by vagal gastric branch efferents. Further work is required to address the possible role of the gastric vagus in feedback control of gastric emptying when nutritive fluids other than glucose are delivered.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9374824/"}

Male SD rats and C57BL/6 mice, both wild-type and prostacyclin IP receptor knockout animals, were used after 18 h of fasting. Gastric lesions were induced by the po administration of HCl/ethanol (60% in 150 mmol/L HCl) in a volume of 1 mL for rats or 0.3 mL for mice. Both lafutidine and capsaicin (1-10 mg/kg, po) afforded dose-dependent protection against HCl/ethanol in rats and mice. The effects were attenuated by both the ablation of CSN and pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, yet only the effect of capsaicin was mitigated by prior administration of capsazepine, the TRPV1 antagonist, as well as indomethacin. Lafutidine protected the stomach against HCl/ethanol in IP receptor knockout mice, similar to wild-type animals, while capsaicin failed to afford protection in the animals lacking IP receptors. Neither of these agents affected the mucosal PGE2 or 6-keto PGF(1alpha) contents in rat stomachs. Capsaicin evoked an increase in [Ca2+]i in rat TRPV1-transfected HEK293 cells while lafutidine did not. These results suggest that although both lafutidine and capsaicin exhibit gastro-protective action mediated by CSN, the mode of their effects differs regarding the dependency on endogenous PGs/IP receptors and TRPV1.

Gastric adaptive relaxation may be related to the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia because the response is often disturbed in dyspeptic patients. In this study, we investigated the effects of indomethacin or H. pylori water extracts on gastric adaptive relaxation. This experiment was performed using the modified method of Desai et al. Isolated guinea-pig stomach in an organ bath was monitored for intragastric pressure and volume. Adaptive relaxation was induced by gastric luminal distention. The effects of indomethacin and H. pylori on gastric relaxation were tested in this system. Indomethacin (> 1 x 10(-5) M) significantly inhibited adaptive relaxation. Indomethacin (> 3 x 10(-6) M) induced gastric relaxation in a dose-dependent fashion. However, aspirin at a concentration sufficient for cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition did not induce gastric relaxation. Preincubation with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO)-synthase inhibitor, inhibited indomethacin-induced gastric relaxation. Adaptive relaxation was not affected by H. pylori water extracts. In conclusion, indomethacin inhibited adaptive relaxation via prior gastric relaxation. NO production, but not COX-1 inhibition, may be involved in this effect of indomethacin. H. pylori water extracts may not have direct effects on adaptive relaxation. Inhibition of adaptive relaxation may be one of the major mechanisms underlying NSAID-induced dyspepsia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15700751/"}

Mechanical, chemical, and pharmacological stimuli were tested and efferent activity recorded from single cervical vagal fibres. Fibres showed either no basal discharge or low frequency, irregular patterns of resting discharge; only those which showed > 50% excitation or inhibition of basal activity with both gastric distension and oesophageal balloon distension were studied further. These responses were rapid and maintained only for the duration of the stimuli. 18/32 efferent fibres tested also showed changes in discharge in response to acid infused slowly into the distal oesophagus. These responses were larger after repeated acid infusions. Subsequent intra-oesophageal capsaicin elicited a similar response in 7/8 fibres. These responses were reproducible with repeated capsaicin infusions in 2/4 fibres and desensitized in 2/4 fibres. 2 capsaicin-responsive fibres were unresponsive to oesophageal acidification. 4/12 fibres tested responded to close intraarterial injections of capsaicin and 9/12 to close intraarterial bradykinin. These responses were brief and of short latency. Vagal efferent responses to mechanical and chemical stimuli above were unchanged after the NK-1 receptor antagonist CP96,345 (4 mg/kg i.v.). Subsequently, bilateral vagotomy caudal to the recording site abolished the basal activity in 4/7 fibres. In the 3 fibres where spontaneous activity remained, none of these responded to oesophageal distension or intra-oesophageal acid (2/2 fibres tested) after vagotomy, whereas 2/2 fibres tested still responded to gastric distension. The response of 1 fibre to intraarterial bradykinin and capsaicin was unchanged by vagotomy. We conclude that vagal efferent neurones respond to gastro-oesophageal mechanical inputs and also receive convergent input from oesophageal acid-sensitive and gastrointestinal bradykinin- and capsaicin-sensitive afferents. These afferent inputs are not mediated via NK-1 receptors. There also exists a nonvagal afferent input onto vagal efferent neurones which is probably spinal and likewise non NK-1 receptor mediated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9406122/"}

Technical details, however, remain to be established before its clinical application. We investigated the effects of posture and ultrasonographic plane on the correlation between milk volume and antral cross-sectional area. After gastric aspiration through a nasogastric tube, healthy newborns were fed 0, 10, 20, and 40 ml of milk cumulatively, and antral cross-sectional area was measured in either upright, sitting, or right lateral position. To determine the best sonographic plane, subjects were put in the right lateral position and antral cross-sectional area was measured in the plane of the aorta and either the superior mesenteric artery, the superior mesenteric vein, the midline of the abdominal surface, 1 cm right of midline, or 2 cm right of midline. The results showed that antral cross-sectional area reflects intragastric milk volume most accurately, with minimal gas interference when measured in the right lateral position. The area correlates well with milk volume in the plane of the aorta and either the superior mesenteric artery, the superior mesenteric vein, or the midline. Next, we studied the effect of intragastric gas on the antral cross-sectional area in subjects who were given 40 ml of milk followed by an injection of air. More than 20 ml of intragastric gas increases antral cross-sectional area significantly. Ultrasonographic evaluation of intragastric volume requires attention to the above factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8929384/"}

The aim of this study was to determine the volume of the human stomach during the embryonic period and to compare its rate of growth with that during the early fetal period. To calculate gastric volume, computer imaging techniques were applied on cross sections of a graded series of human embryos (from Carnegie stage 11) and fetuses. Gastric volume increased progressively, except for a decrease between stages 12 and 13 due principally to the reduction of the right gastric wall. The growth of the left wall of the stomach was predominant over that of the right. Until stage 20 the stomach volume increased due to the predominant growth of the walls, after this stage the gastric cavity volume increased rapidly, and the rate of growth of the gastric volume reached similar values to that of the early fetal period. We concluded that in the beginning the human stomach grows due to the predominant growth of its walls, chiefly of the left, and from stage 20 because of the predominant expansion of its cavity, which may be related to the capacity to swallow amniotic fluid at the end of the embryonic period. The diminution of the right gastric wall volume (stages 12-13) is consistent with an extension of the omental bursa into the mesodermal anlage of the stomach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8621339/"}

Thirty-four transplants were microsurgically grafted either inside a pouch created on the nude peritoneum (n = 15) or on the host stomach and esophagus (n = 19). The mucosa of transplanted tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemical techniques to detect gastric cells. Gastric cell secretions were collected before and after pentagastrin or omeprazole treatment. Parietal, G, and D cells were detected immunohistochemically only after 1 month of grafting. All xenografts actively secreted acid after 1 or 2 months' transplantation at each graft site. Acid secretion was significantly stimulated by intraperitoneally injected pentagastrin (mean pH +/- SD, 3.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5; n = 10, P = 0.005) and was dramatically inhibited by intragastrically administered omeprazole (2.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.7; n = 15, P = 0.0007) after 5 hours.

Intrinsic components of such patterns involving mechanosensitive enteric neurons (MEN) have been described in the guinea pig gastric corpus but are poorly understood in the fundus and antrum. To elucidate mechanosensitive properties of myenteric neurons in the gastric fundus and antrum, membrane potential imaging using Di-8-ANEPPS was applied. A small-volume injection led to neuronal compression. We analyzed the number of MEN and their firing frequency in addition to the involvement of selected mechanoreceptors. To characterize the neurochemical phenotype of MEN, we performed immunohistochemistry. In the gastric fundus, 16% of the neurons reproducibly responded to mechanical stimulation and thus were MEN. Of those, 83% were cholinergic and 19% nitrergic. In the antrum, 6% of the neurons responded to the compression stimulus, equally distributed among cholinergic and nitrergic MEN. Defunctionalizing the sensory extrinsic afferents led to a significant drop in the number of MEN in both regions. We provided evidence for MEN in the gastric fundus and antrum and further investigated mechanoreceptors. However, the proportions of the chemical phenotypes of the MEN differed significantly between both regions.

Although the mechanisms of chemical digestion are usually characterized by using in vitro analysis, the difficulty in reproducing the stomach geometry and motility has prevented a good understanding of the local fluid dynamics of gastric contents. The goal of this study was to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to develop a 3-D model of the shape and motility pattern of the stomach wall during digestion, and use it to characterize the fluid dynamics of gastric contents of different viscosities. A geometrical model of an averaged-sized human stomach was created, and its motility was characterized by a series of antral-contraction waves of up to 80% relative occlusion. The flow field within the model (predicted using the software Fluent™) strongly depended on the viscosity of gastric contents. By increasing the viscosity, the formation of the 2 flow patterns commonly regarded as the main mechanisms driving digestion (i.e., the retropulsive jet-like motion and eddy structures) was significantly diminished, while a significant increase of the pressure field was predicted. These results were in good agreement with experimental data previously reported in the literature, and suggest that, contrary to the traditional idea of a rapid and complete homogenization of the meal, gastric contents associated with high viscous meals are poorly mixed. This study illustrates the capability of CFD to provide a unique insight into the fluid dynamics of the gastric contents, and points out its potential to develop a fundamental understanding and modeling of the mechanisms involved in the digestion process.

Both phasic or tonic increases and decreases in firing rate were observed. Out of 41 units sensitive to gastric filling, 7 were also responsive to gastric emptying, exhibiting changes in the same direction to positive and negative variation in gastric pressure. Intestinal distension elicited changes in firing rate in 15 out of 34 units tested. As during gastric distension, units decreased or increased in firing rate while distension of the lumen was performed. The latencies of responses to gastric and intestinal distension were very short (less than one second) and were consistent with the functional properties of gastrointestinal mechanoreceptors previously described. In addition, 5 out of 25 units sensitive to gastric or intestinal distension, were responsive to both gastric and intestinal distensions exhibiting changes in the same direction. In this case, vagus nerve stimulation produced the same effect as the gastro-intestinal distensions. The results are discussed in terms of convergence of gastric and intestinal mechanoreceptor inputs on lateral hypothalamic neurons, in relation to the propagation of ingested food throughout the digestive tract.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6470405/"}

The whole stomach can be used, but also a wide or narrow gastric tube can be constructed. Short-term functional results are superior after use of a narrow tube. Healing of the cervical esophagogastrostomy can be impaired, leading to leakage and stricture. The decreased vascularization at the site of the anastomosis may be one reason. It was hypothesized that the quality of the vascularization of the gastric tube, used as a substitute for the oesophagus after esophagectomy, depends on its diameter. The vascularization of postmortem specimens was studied using angiography. Whole stomachs (3), wide (3) and narrow gastric tubes (3) were constructed. In a patient with an anastomotic stricture of a narrow tube with a cervical esophagogastrostomy vascularisation was evaluated by angiography. After infusion of contrast through the supplying arteries, the whole stomachs and wide gastric tubes showed adequate vascularization, whereas the narrow gastric tube showed poor vascularization especially at the site of the anastomosis. In narrow gastric tubes, the right gastroepiploic artery was the only feeding artery. In the patient's angiography, a limited contrast visualization of the proximal end of the gastric tube could be demonstrated. Although a narrow gastric tube is favoured by some surgeons, the use of whole stomach or a type of gastric tube with preservation of the right gastric artery may lead to a better anastomotic healing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10071804/"}

We investigated the effects of menthol on gastric emptying and spontaneous- or evoked- mechanical activity of whole murine stomach. Gastric emptying was calculated after i.p. administration of menthol (50mg/Kg). Responses induced by menthol on gastric intraluminal pressure and evoked-cholinergic contractions were analyzed in vitro. Menthol decreased the gastric emptying rate. In vitro, menthol (0.3-30 mM) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of whole stomach, that was significantly reduced by tetrodotoxin or ω-conotoxin GVIA. The gastric relaxant responses were not affected by Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of nitric oxide-synthase, apamin or [Lys1,Pro2,5,Arg3,4,Tyr6] vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)(7-28), a VIP receptor antagonist, but they were significantly antagonized by atropine or guanethidine, a blocker of adrenergic neurotransmission. The joint application of atropine and guanethidine did not produce any additive effects on menthol effects. Phentolamine, an α-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not propranolol, a β-adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly reduced menthol responses and the contemporary administration of both adrenergic antagonists did not produce additive effects. Menthol (1-100 μM) produced a reduction of the electrically-evoked cholinergic contractions, which was prevented by guanethidine. Menthol did not affect the contractions induced by carbachol. In conclusion, menthol in mouse, is able to reduce the rate of gastric emptying and to relax the stomach in vitro. The latter effect appears due, almost in part, to neural mechanisms, with involvement of α-adrenoceptors leading to reduction of tonic ongoing release of acetylcholine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24041922/"}

In 12 patients parameters of gastric function were intraindividually compared after ingestion of a semiliquid and a solid test meal. In addition to the standard evaluation derived from time activity curves condensed images were established from two fixed time intervals (early and late period). These images were used to evaluate the amplitude and frequency of gastric contractions using Fourier analysis. As expected gastric emptying was influenced by the consistency of the test meal. Mean emptying rates for the solid meal were significant lower than those for the semiliquid one (p < 0.01). The amplitude and frequency of gastric contractions, however, did not depend on the consistency of the test meal. Within the course of the examination contraction amplitudes significantly increased (p < 0.05) from the early to the late period using both, solid as well as semiliquid test meals. The frequency of gastric contractions remained unchanged. As shown by an intraindividual data comparison amplitude and frequency of gastric contractions seem to be independent of the consistency of ingested test meals whereas gastric emptying is significantly influenced by the administered media.

The proventriculus is made up of a visceral and parietal blind sac opening into a connecting chamber, which in turn opens into the glandular compartment. The walls of the proventricular chambers are covered with villi and non-glandular mucous membrane. The significant difference between the animals is that whereas the connecting chamber of the adult stomach lies transversely deep in the cranial part of the abdomen and connects with the glandular chamber on the right side, that of the newborn lies almost vertically and connects ventrally with the glandular compartment situated on the floor of the abdomen. A groove which in the adult runs more or less horizontally from the cardia through the visceral sac and connecting chambers is aligned almost vertically in the newborn. In the adult the connecting chamber is the largest compartment, but in the neonate the visceral blind sac and the glandular compartment are proportionally larger.

Swellable gastro-floating formulation of freely water-soluble drug, metformin HCl as a drug model, was formulated and developed using D-optimal design. Polymer combination between interpolymer complex (IPC) (poly-vinyl acetate-copolymer methacrylate) and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and effervescent components were studied and optimized in this work. Several factors affecting the drug release behavior were determined e.g. swelling behavior, erosion behavior, and floating behavior were studied as well as the drug release through compartmental modeling analysis. The results revealed that the hydrophilic polymer was responsible for gas entrapment formed from effervescent reaction, meanwhile IPC contributed on maintaining the swollen matrix integrity through intermolecular polymer interaction. In addition, effervescent components played fundamental role in the formation of porous system as well as inducing burst release effect. Compartmental modeling provided different outlook about the drug release. Presence of IPC at a high proportion (10-15%) of the polymer blend modulated the changes of pattern of the drug release kinetics and mechanism. Finally, compartmental modeling-based approach was more adequate to describe the drug release kinetics and mechanism compared to the monophasic equation model correlating with process understanding of the drug release from swellable gastro-floating formulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31894720/"}

Rats fasted for 18 h were given the 99% ethanol p.o. for induction of gastric lesions, and were fed normally from 1 h later onwards. Monochloramine, at non-ulcerogenic doses (5 to approximately 20 mmol/L), was given p.o. twice daily for 7 days, starting 2 h after ethanol treatment. Gastric lesions caused by ethanol healed almost completely within 7 days with re-epithelialization. The repeated administration of NH2Cl significantly delayed the healing of ethanol-induced gastric lesions in a dose-dependent manner. The damaged mucosa showed a marked rise in H+ permeability, resulting in luminal acid loss, but this process was accompanied by an increase of mucosal blood flow. Monochloramine did not affect the increased mucosal H+ permeability observed in the stomach after damage by ethanol, but significantly inhibited the mucosal hyperemic response associated with luminal acid loss. Prior exposure of the mucosa to NH2Cl (20 mmol/L) did not affect the gastric hyperemic response caused by mucosal application of misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 derivative) or NOR-3 (a nitric oxide donor), but totally attenuated the increase of GMBF in response to intragastric capsaicin. Impaired healing and GMBF responses were also observed in rats following chemical ablation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons. These results suggest that NH2Cl impaired the healing of acute gastric mucosal lesions at low concentrations, and this action may be attributable, at least partly, to the impairment of gastric hyperemic response caused by the dysfunction of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11339419/"}

Medical History, Phylogenetic and Embryological Development of the Splenogastric System.", "text": "Before the spleen was discovered to be a lymphatic blood organ, it had for centuries been considered to be a digestive organ. Concepts of a regulative, secretory and resorptive function in the digestive system were based mainly on a postulated connection between the stomach and the spleen. Splenogastric vascular connections have recently been rediscovered by modern surgery. To test the hypothesis that the spleen has a digestive function, this article reviews the literature focusing on the interaction between the spleen and the stomach. We examine the historical medical view of the spleen and stomach system and the reasons why a digestive function was abandoned in the 17th and 18th centuries. We then review the rediscovery of the splenogastric system and the present-day state of knowledge (anatomical origin, variability, haemodynamics) and present it in terms of the phylogenetic and embryological development of the spleen and stomach system. Key Message: Splenogastric arteries and gastrosplenic veins form a portal system which directly connects the spleen and stomach parenchyma. Despite its mesodermal anlage, phylogenetically and embryologically the spleen is intimately interconnected with the entodermal stomach parenchyma but detaches from this in the course of development.

Indeed, the gastric motor rhythms appeared to be more sensitive to changes in activity of regulatory mechanisms than the functional activity of the gastric secretor glands. Long-term disbalance of regulatory mechanisms caused the \"regulatory rejection\", which was associated with increasing of duodenogastric reflux and increasing of gastric BMRP, as well as with decreasing of gastric mucosal defending properties.

The examined tissues were collected from 10-12 months old laying hens (n=11), Isabrown and Zielononózka races. The distribution and number of the nerve fibres was examined considering differences between the proventriculus and gizzard, and also between particular layers of the stomach wall. Large or moderate numbers of nerve fibres showing NOS-immunoreactivity (NOS-IR) were found in all major layers of both parts of the stomach. In the muscular layer of the gizzard, NOS-positive nerve cell bodies were also observed. Small or moderate numbers of nerve terminals were distributed around blood vessels. NOS-IR nerve fibres associated with blood vessels were slightly more numerous in the gizzard than in the proventriculus. The widespread occurrence of NOS in both parts of the hen stomach can prove its important role in the control of digestive processes. It seems that there is a reasonable necessity of further, more detailed studies on morphological characteristics of the nitrergic nerve structures the bird alimentary tract, their functional significance and plasticity in different physiological and pathological conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16385856/"}

A 75-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with solitary gastric varices. Initially, intraoperative splenic artery embolization was performed using the balloon transcatheter technique under general anesthesia. Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed safely owing to preoperative splenic artery embolization. Intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography was performed following the injection of 5 mL of ICG; the remnant stomach was observed using laparoscopic equipment with an ICG imaging system, and blood flow from the remnant gastric artery was confirmed. The blood did not pool or wash out immediately, which confirmed successful devascularization of the stomach. The total operative time was 269 minutes, and the intraoperative blood loss was 500 mL. The patient's postoperative course was good, and at 21 days after the last operation, she was discharged from our hospital in remission. Real-time fluorescence angiography with ICG is a reliable and objective technique of assessing blood flow of the stomach.

After ingestion of a radiolabeled test meal, dynamic images of the stomach were acquired and analyzed to determine the frequency, amplitude, and rate of gastric contractions in healthy subjects. The frequency of antral contractions was found to be inversely related with food retention in the stomach; in contrast, the amplitude of the contractions decreased progressively during the course of gastric emptying. The peaks of both antral contraction and filling rate and the time of their occurrence remained constant throughout gastric emptying. The observed patterns of phase distribution and sequential phase changes of the food in the stomach confirmed noninvasively what was already known from invasive technique, i.e., that the proximal stomach does not undergo phasic contractions and that, in the distal stomach, smooth muscle contraction originates in midcorpus and propagates aborally to the pylorus. The scintigraphic test can be used to noninvasively and quantitatively characterize gastric motor function and to delineate the spatial sequence of gastric contractions. This technique can be applied to study the pathophysiology of gastric emptying in various motor disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2260662/"}

H. pylori expresses significant urease activity which is an essential virulence factor. Since a significant fraction of urease activity is located on the surface of the bacterium, the urease molecule is a logical choice as an antigen for a vaccine; currently recombinant urease apoenzyme is being tested as a vaccine in phase II clinical trials. We have recently demonstrated that urease and HspB (a homolog of the GroEL heat shock protein) become associated with the surface of H. pylori in vitro in a novel manner: these cytoplasmic proteins are released by bacterial autolysis and become adsorbed to the surface of intact bacteria, reflecting the unique characteristics of the outer membrane. To determine if similar mechanisms are operative in vivo, we determined the ultrastructural locations of urease and HspB within bacteria present in human gastric biopsies. Our results demonstrate that both urease and HspB are located within the cytoplasm of all bacteria examined in human gastric biopsies. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the bacteria examined also possessed variable amounts of surface-associated urease and HspB antigen (from 5 to 50% of the total antigenic material), indicating that in vivo, H. pylori has surface characteristics which enable it to adsorb cytoplasmic proteins. This is consistent with our altruistic autolysis model in which H. pylori uses genetically programmed bacterial autolysis to release urease and other cytoplasmic proteins which are subsequently adsorbed onto the surface of neighboring viable bacteria. These observations have important implications regarding pathogenesis and development of vaccines for H. pylori.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9119449/"}

Gastroplasty results in a small proximal pouch with a narrow stoma to the remaining stomach. The total gastric emptying was delayed 3 months after gastroplasty (p less than 0.01). Twelve months after gastroplasty, emptying of the proximal pouch was faster than at 3 months (p less than 0.01). This may indicate dilatation of the stoma between the two gastric pouches during this period. Surprisingly, the total gastric emptying 12 months after gastroplasty was not only faster than at 3 months but also faster than before surgery. The explanation, therefore, cannot only be attributed to a dilated stoma, and hormonal mechanisms may be involved. A lack of correlation between preoperative weight and emptying was observed, but because the material consists of only obese subjects, no conclusion can be drawn about the postulated role of gastric emptying in developing obesity. Emptying of the total stomach and of the proximal pouch failed to correlate with postoperative weight losses.

Before radiography, each animal was fed its normal diet that contained a barium sulfate suspension and/or radio-opaque pellets. The basic pattern of motility in the major chamber of the pig's stomach was similar to that described in animals with a simple stomach. Type II peristaltic waves were clearly identified as indentations of the body of the stomach that moved towards the pyloric antrum, which became circular as it filled with digesta. A terminal antral contraction then occurred, the antrum decreased in diameter, and the ingesta and barium sulfate either entered the duodenum or were returned to the body of the stomach. Liquids and finely ground food left the stomach more rapidly than did the radio-opaque pellets that were retained for up to 44 hours. The radio-opaque pellets demonstrated the movement of ingesta within the gastric lumen and showed that ingesta was retropulsed into the body of the stomach by the terminal antral contraction. In 4 pigs, barium and ingesta were present in the 2nd chamber of the stomach, the gastric diverticulum.

Meal emptying and its distribution within the stomach were assessed with carbonated and still water in a crossover study. Emptying of both solid and liquid, including the duration of the lag phase, was identical for both drinks. However, the proximal stomach contained a greater proportion of solids (74 +/- 7% vs 56 +/- 8%, P < 0.05) and liquids (43 +/- 5% vs 27 +/- 4%, P < 0.05) with carbonated water as opposed to still water.

Intraoperative quality assessment of tissue perfusion with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence using a near-infrared camera system has been described in different ways and for different indications. The aim of the present study was to evaluate fluorescent imaging (FI) in the quantitative assessment of intestinal perfusion in a gastric tube model in pigs and to compare the results to results obtained with florescent microspheres (FM), the gold standard for tissue perfusion. Seven pigs (56.0±3.0 kg), both males and females, underwent gastric tube formation after transection and ligation of the gastric arteries, except the right gastroepiploic artery, to avoid collateral blood flow. After baseline assessment (T0), hypotension (T1) was induced by propofol (Karampinis et al 2017) (< 60 mmHg). Then, propofol was paused to obtain normotension (T2, Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60-90 mmHg). Finally, hypertension (T3, MAP>90 mmHg) was induced by norepinephrine. Measurements were performed in three regions of interest (ROIs) under standardized conditions: the fundus (D1), corpus (D2), and prepyloric area (D3). Hemodynamic parameters and transit-time flow measurement (TTFM) in the right gastroepiploic artery were continuously assessed. FI, FM and the partial pressure of tissue oxygen (TpO2) were quantified in each ROI. The study protocol could successfully be performed during stable hemodynamics. Flow in the gastroepiploic artery measured by transit time flow measurement (TTFM) was related to hemodynamic changes between the measurements, indicating improved blood flow with increasing MAP. The distal part of the gastric tube (D1) showed significantly (p<0.05) impaired perfusion compared to the proximal parts D3 and D2 using FM. ICG-FI also showed the highest values in D3 and the lowest values in D1 at all hemodynamic levels (T1-T3; p<0,05). Visual and quantitative assessment of gastric tube perfusion is feasible in an experimental setting using ICG-FI.

The healing of experimental ulcers was also examined under the conditions either with ligation or embolization of the left and right gastric arteries. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1) Ten dogs with ulcer preparation only showed 3 persistent and 7 perforated ulcers at the subcardia and 4 healed, 4 persistent and 2 perforated ulcers at the angular incisure. 2) Four dogs with vessel ligation showed 2 persistent and 2 perforated ulcers at the subcardia and 1 healed, 2 persistent and 1 perforated ulcers at the angular incisure. 3) In 6 dogs with vessel embolization, 3 showed regional erosions. 4) The ratio of epithelization were 23.3% for the high and 68.2% for the low ulcers in the dogs with ulcer preparation only, while these were 11.3% and 54.5% respectively for the dogs with vessel ligation.

After the failure of conservative therapy a double-lumen jejunal (Hunt-Lawrence) pouch with distal Roux-en-Y anastomosis was anastomosed to the stomach to increase the gastric reservoir. One year later, there has been progressive weight gain, the megaesophagus and gastroesophageal reflux have lessened significantly, pneumonia has not recurred, and the tracheobronchitis and esophagitis have resolved. This suggests that the gastroesophageal reflux and megaesophagus were due to an inadequate reservoir with a secondary gastric overflow as the esophagus dilated to enlarge the reservoir capacity of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Utilization of a jejunal pouch increased the size of the gastric reservoir, allowed resolution of the secondary esophageal changes, and permitted normal growth to proceed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7463290/"}

It has been arged in some research circles that some of the organisms in the gastric mucosa may not be true H.pylori. Immunohistochemical techniques have been developed and make use of anti H.pylori antibody, which reacts, with somatic antigens of the whole bacteria and have been found to correlate well with the presence of the bacteria. To ascertain the efficacy of modified Giemsa stain in an African setting where H.Pylori seems quite prevalent. A laboratory-based study of two diagnostic tests in which modified Giema stain was compared with immunohistochemistry. A total of 48 consecutive autopsy cases with no upper gastro intestinal diseases had their gastric mucosa stained for demonstration of H.pylori using both modified Giemsa and immunohisto chemical staining techniques. Twenty-seven cases of H.pylori were demonstrated by both techniques and 14 cases were not identified by the two staining methods. In 2 cases immunostain could not demonstrate the bacteria but they were identified with modified Giemsa stain while in 5 cases the bacteria were identified by immunostain but not with modified Giemsa stain. The sensitivity of modified Giemsa stain was 85% (CI 66.5-98.8) while the specificity was 89% (CI 60.4 - 97.8). The positive predictive value of modified Giemsa stain was 93% CI 75 - 98.8%) while the negative predictive value was 74% (CI 48.6 - 89.9). The kappa statistic comparing the 2 stains was 0.69 (p value 0.00001) giving a good agreement between the two tests. With the above results the modified Giemsa stain, which is readily available in most African laboratories, is recommenced for diagnosis of H.pylori, a prevalent infection in Africa.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12789102/"}

Therefore, there is a need for model platforms that recapitulate human in vivo development, physiology, and disease processes to validate new therapeutics. One of the major steps toward this goal was the generation of three-dimensional (3D) human gastric organoids (hGOs) via the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The normal functions and diseases of the stomach occur in the luminal epithelium, however accessing the epithelium on the inside of organoids is challenging. We sought to develop a bioengineered platform to introduce luminal flow through hGOs to better model in vivo gastric functions. Here, we report an innovative microfluidic imaging platform housing hGOs with peristaltic luminal flow in vitro. This human stomach-on-a-chip allows robust, long-term, 3D growth of hGOs with the capacity for luminal delivery via a peristaltic pump. Organoids were cannulated and medium containing fluorescent dextran was delivered through the lumen using a peristaltic pump. This system also allowed us to rhythmically introduce stretch and contraction to the organoid, reminiscent of gastric motility. Our platform has the potential for long-term delivery of nutrients or pharmacological agents into the gastric lumen in vitro for the study of human gastric physiology, disease modeling, and drug screening, among other possibilities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30238091/"}

Six dogs were implanted with gastric serosal electrodes, sonometric sensors, and a gastric cannula. Experiments were performed to assess sensor distance when an intragastric balloon was inflated with different volumes, after a meal with or without a balloon, and with gastric electrical stimulation. (i) The distance measured using sonometry was reproducible and stable, and there was a correlation between sensor distance and the gastric volume measured with barostat. (ii) Simultaneous recordings by sonometry and barostat showed a similar postprandial response, while the postprandial increase of the sensor distance was much smaller without the balloon (3.2+/-0.2 mm vs 9.7+/-1.5 mm, P<0.02). (iii) The sensor distance was increased with gastric electrical stimulation. Sonometry is able to detect gastric volume changes as validated by gastric perturbations with distensions, food ingestion and electrical stimulation. The postprandial increase in gastric volume measured by sonometry with barostat balloon is greater because of the presence of the intragastric balloon.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15916632/"}

Although initially thought to be a consequence of radiation or chemotherapy, subsequent studies suggested that it results from an artifactual postmortem chemical denaturation of the protein of the gastric submucosa, possibly related to an agonal tear in the gastric submucosa. We studied the clinicopathologic and ultrastructural findings in a case that had morphologic features of gastric hyalinization but that, in contrast with previous reports, was present in a surgically removed stomach and was associated with a small, chronic, peptic ulcer, with clinical manifestations of gastromegaly and borderline gastric retention. Ultrastructurally, the severe submucosal hyaline thickening that focally involved the muscularis and serosa largely consisted of proteinaceous material, ground substance, and collagen fibers, with occasional interspersed fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. This case indicated that gastric hyalinization can be a nonartifactual and clinically significant entity that may be associated with peptic ulcer disease and that should be distinguished from neoplastic (linitis plastica) and other processes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6896812/"}

Studies are underway to validate these techniques with recent data proving the performance characteristics of SPECT. The non-invasive nutrient drink test measures satiety scores as a surrogate marker of gastric accommodation and remains controversial. More recently, intragastric monitoring has been proposed as yet another non-invasive modality to assess gastric accommodation. Each of these different modalities brings its associated advantages and disadvantages, as is discussed in this review.

The hollow toothpick functioned as a fistula between the contents of the stomach and the peritoneal cavity. This resulted in a very different clinical picture from that observed in \"classical wooden\" toothpick injury, where the toothpick is not able to function as a fistula. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a hollow toothpick perforating the stomach. A hollow toothpick perforation must be considered in any patient with symptoms of intestinal perforation, even when there is no history of swallowing toothpicks. Removal of a toothpick and subsequent suturing of the puncture site is a simple and relatively minor surgical procedure, which may have a lower morbidity and mortality as compared to other causes of gastric perforation.
