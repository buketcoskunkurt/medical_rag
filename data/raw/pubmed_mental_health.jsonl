The treatments for depression and anxiety are multiple and have varying degrees of effectiveness. Physical activity has been shown to be associated with decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Physical activity has been consistently shown to be associated with improved physical health, life satisfaction, cognitive functioning, and psychological well-being. Conversely, physical inactivity appears to be associated with the development of psychological disorders. Specific studies support the use of exercise as a treatment for depression. Exercise compares favorably to antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression and has also been shown to improve depressive symptoms when used as an adjunct to medications. While not as extensively studied, exercise has been shown to be an effective and cost-efficient treatment alternative for a variety of anxiety disorders. While effective, exercise has not been shown to reduce anxiety to the level achieved by psychopharmaceuticals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21495519/"}

According to the DSM-5 criteria, it uses \"with anxious distress specifier\" to define anxious depression in its MDD section. Anxious depression is known to have different neurobiological profiles compared to non-anxious depression. Several studies have revealed significant differences between anxious depression and non-anxious depression regarding the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, structural and functional brain imaging findings, inflammation markers, etc. Patients with anxious depression were significantly more likely to be found in primary care setting and more likely to be associated with female gender, non-single, unemployed, less educated, and more severe depression. Previous reports also showed that patients with anxious depression had more frequent episodes of major depression and a higher risk of suicidal ideation and previous suicide attempts than those with non-anxious depression. Although anxious depression is known to be associated with poor treatment outcomes in several studies, recent researches have sought to find better treatment strategy to improve patients with anxious depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32002932/"}

Research has also demonstrated strong associations between addictive use of technology and comorbid psychiatric disorders. In the present study, 23,533 adults (mean age 35.8 years, ranging from 16 to 88 years) participated in an online cross-sectional survey examining whether demographic variables, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and depression could explain variance in addictive use (i.e., compulsive and excessive use associated with negative outcomes) of two types of modern online technologies: social media and video games. Correlations between symptoms of addictive technology use and mental disorder symptoms were all positive and significant, including the weak interrelationship between the two addictive technological behaviors. Age appeared to be inversely related to the addictive use of these technologies. Being male was significantly associated with addictive use of video games, whereas being female was significantly associated with addictive use of social media. Being single was positively related to both addictive social networking and video gaming. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that demographic factors explained between 11 and 12% of the variance in addictive technology use. The mental health variables explained between 7 and 15% of the variance. The study significantly adds to our understanding of mental health symptoms and their role in addictive use of modern technology, and suggests that the concept of Internet use disorder (i.e., \"Internet addiction\") as a unified construct is not warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26999354/"}

Our search included PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Embase, and Cochrane databases, selecting only single-herb randomized controlled trials between 1996 and 2016 in any population for data extraction, excluding herbs with known potential for interactions with cancer treatments. One hundred articles involving 38 botanicals met our criteria. Among herbs most studied (≥6 randomized controlled trials each), lavender, passionflower, and saffron produced benefits comparable to standard anxiolytics and antidepressants. Black cohosh, chamomile, and chasteberry are also promising. Anxiety or depressive symptoms were measured in all studies, but not always as primary endpoints. Overall, 45% of studies reported positive findings with fewer adverse effects compared with conventional medications. Based on available data, black cohosh, chamomile, chasteberry, lavender, passionflower, and saffron appear useful in mitigating anxiety or depression with favorable risk-benefit profiles compared to standard treatments. These may benefit cancer patients by minimizing medication load and accompanying side effects. However, well-designed larger clinical trials are needed before these herbs can be recommended and to further assess their psycho-oncologic relevance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29464801/"}

The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of randomised-controlled trials of psychological programs, designed to prevent depression and/or anxiety in children and adolescents delivered in school settings. Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles published until February 2015. Eighty-one unique studies comprising 31,794 school students met inclusion criteria. Small effect sizes for both depression (g=0.23) and anxiety (g=0.20) prevention programs immediately post-intervention were detected. Small effects were evident after 12-month follow-up for both depression (g=0.11) and anxiety (g=0.13). Overall, the quality of the included studies was poor, and heterogeneity was moderate. Subgroup analyses suggested that universal depression prevention programs had smaller effect sizes at post-test relative to targeted programs. For anxiety, effect sizes were comparable for universal and targeted programs. There was some evidence that externally-delivered interventions were superior to those delivered by school staff for depression, but not anxiety. Meta-regression confirmed that targeted programs predicted larger effect sizes for the prevention of depression.

While artefactual factors make some contribution, it is concluded that there is a higher order biological factor (variably determined neuroticism, 'stress responsiveness' or 'limbic system hyperactivity') that principally contributes to the gender differentiation in some expressions of both depression and anxiety, and reflects the impact of gonadal steroid changes at puberty. Rather than conclude that 'anatomy is destiny' we favour a diathesis stress model, so accounting for differential epidemiological findings.

Adults with physical disabilities may have fewer opportunities of favourable exchange, and therefore the effects on mental health and wellbeing may be less advantageous. The aim of this study is to systematically review quantitative studies exploring associations of social relationships with mental health and wellbeing in persons with physical disabilities. The databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published between 1995 and 2016. Data was extracted on study and participants' characteristics, independent and dependent variables, used measures and effects sizes of associations between social relationships and mental health or wellbeing. A narrative review was performed to synthesize findings along the constructs social support, social networks, negative social interactions, family functioning and relationship quality. Of the 63 included studies, 47 were cross-sectional and 16 longitudinal. Most studies included a measure of social support (n = 58), while other concepts were less often studied (social networks n = 6; negative social interaction n = 3; family functioning n = 2; relationship quality n = 1). Over half of studies included depression as outcome (n = 33), followed by wellbeing (n = 14), composite mental health measures (n = 10), anxiety (n = 8), psychological distress (n = 7), posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 3), and hopelessness (n = 1). Although trends for associations of social support with mental health and wellbeing were consistent, around a quarter of studies failed to report significant associations. Social networks were related to depression, but not to other mental health or wellbeing measures. Family functioning, negative social interactions and relationship quality showed consistent associations with mental health and wellbeing, however, only few studies were available. This review indicates that social relationships play an important role in mental health and wellbeing in persons with disabilities, although findings are less consistent than in general populations and strength of associations vary between constructs.

Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and were included if they: (1) used human participants, (2) were longitudinal, (3) reported primary data, (4) had smoking as an exposure and depression and/or anxiety as an outcome, or (5) had depression and/or anxiety as the exposure and smoking as an outcome. Outcomes from 148 studies were categorized into: smoking onset, smoking status, smoking heaviness, tobacco dependence, and smoking trajectory. The results for each category varied substantially, with evidence for positive associations in both directions (smoking to later mental health and mental health to later smoking) as well as null findings. Overall, nearly half the studies reported that baseline depression/anxiety was associated with some type of later smoking behavior, while over a third found evidence that a smoking exposure was associated with later depression/anxiety. However, there were few studies directly supporting a bidirectional model of smoking and anxiety, and very few studies reporting null results. The literature on the prospective association between smoking and depression and anxiety is inconsistent in terms of the direction of association most strongly supported. This suggests the need for future studies that employ different methodologies, such as Mendelian randomization (MR), which will allow us to draw stronger causal inferences. We systematically reviewed longitudinal studies on the association of different aspects of smoking behavior with depression and anxiety. The results varied considerably, with evidence for smoking both associated with subsequent depression and anxiety, and vice versa. Few studies supported a bidirectional relationship, or reported null results, and no clear patterns by gender, ethnicity, clinical status, length to follow-up, or diagnostic test. Suggesting that despite advantages of longitudinal studies, they cannot alone provide strong evidence of causality. Therefore, future studies investigating this association should employ different methods allowing for stronger causal inferences to be made, such as MR.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27199385/"}

Exercise is one such option that is supported by published extensive basic and clinical research data. The aim of this review was to examine the beneficial effects of exercise in depression. Physical activity and exercise have been shown to be effective in treating mild-to-moderate depression and in reducing mortality and symptoms of major depression. However, physical activity and exercise are still underused in clinical practice. This review attempts to propose a framework to help clinicians in their decision-making process, how to incorporate physical activity in their toolkit of potential therapeutic responses for depressed patients. We first summarize the interactions between depression and physical activities, with a particular focus on the potential antidepressant physiological effects of physical activity. We then identify some of the barriers blocking physical activity from being used to fight depression. Finally, we present several perspectives and ideas that can help in optimizing mitigation strategies to challenge these barriers, including actions on physical activity representations, ways to increase the accessibility of physical activity, and the potential of technology to help both clinicians and patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36137954/"}

While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. \"Lifestyle Medicine\" provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24721040/"}

A comprehensive search of electronic databases was undertaken from 1 January 2003 to 4 February 2020 (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EBM Reviews, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PILOTS, Web of Science). Quantitative studies were included if diagnosis of mental illness involved a clinical interview and use of a validated assessment measure and reported at least 50 participants. Study quality was assessed using a descriptive approach based on a template according to study design (modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Random-effects models, based on inverse variance weights, were conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, sample size, displacement duration, visa status, country of origin, current residence, type of interview (interpreter-assisted or native language), and diagnostic measure. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD) 42016046349. The search yielded a result of 21,842 records.

We analysed depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptomatology in comparison with two large age- and sex-matched samples randomly selected from the general population. Moderate to severe depression and anxiety were reported in 17% and 9% of cancer survivors, respectively. There were no significant differences between the 5 years and 10 years after diagnosis cohorts (p = 0.232). In both cohorts, we found higher depression and anxiety in women than in men (p < 0.001), and lower depression and anxiety in elderly patients (p < 0.001).

{"id": "28384395", "title": "Consensus Bundle on Maternal Mental Health: Perinatal Depression and Anxiety.", "text": "Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions encountered by women of reproductive age. When left untreated, perinatal mood and anxiety disorders can have profound adverse effects on women and their children, ranging from increased risk of poor adherence to medical care, exacerbation of medical conditions, loss of interpersonal and financial resources, smoking and substance use, suicide, and infanticide. Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are associated with increased risks of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity and are recognized as a significant patient safety issue. In 2015, the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care convened an interdisciplinary work group to develop an evidence-based patient safety bundle to address maternal mental health. The focus of this bundle is perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. The bundle is modeled after other bundles released by the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care and provides broad direction for incorporating perinatal mood and anxiety disorder screening, intervention, referral, and follow-up into maternity care practice across health care settings. This commentary provides information to assist with bundle implementation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28384395/"}

The sample included clients with positive screens for depression or anxiety or SMI diagnoses. Prenatal clients with a positive screen for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders or SMI comprised 13-30 percent of classes, characterized by more than two co-occurring social determinants (for example, co-occurring socioeconomic and interpersonal factors). The study findings highlight the salience of social determinants among prenatal patients experiencing perinatal mood and anxiety disorder and SMI and suggest the necessity of consistent screening for both social determinants and perinatal mental health.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has strong evidence among people with mood and anxiety disorders, but limited studies reported the effectiveness of MBCT on perinatal comorbid conditions. This study aimed to examine the effects of an 8-week MBCT intervention on pregnant women with comorbid depression and anxiety. In this randomized controlled study, 38 pregnant women with a diagnosis of depression and varying levels of comorbid anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to either MBCT or a control group. Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Scales of Psychological Wellbeing were used as outcome measures at baseline, after MBCT, and through 1-month follow-up. Intent to treat analyses provided preliminary evidence that MBCT can be effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and in enhancing the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and psychological well-being. Improvements in outcomes were maintained 1 month. Results provide cross-cultural support for MBCT as a treatment for depression and anxiety in pregnant women.

We aimed to systematically evaluate the available literature on the prevalence, associates, and treatment of mental disorders in patients with cancer in LLMICs. We systematically searched Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of major depression or anxiety disorders in this population, defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases criteria. We qualitatively reviewed studies that examined the prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders defined by self-report tools, the prevalence of other mental disorders, associated factors of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the treatment of mental disorders in this population. Forty studies spanning a 15-year period were included in the review. The pooled prevalence defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases criteria was 21% for major depression (95% CI, 15 to 28) and 18% for anxiety disorders (95% CI, 8 to 30). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were most frequently associated with advanced disease and low levels of education. Among the four studies evaluating treatment, three evaluated the effectiveness of psychotherapy and one evaluated a yoga program. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with cancer generally appears higher in LLMICs than in upper-income countries. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a significant and underappreciated disease burden. We suggest that clinicians remain vigilant to psychiatric symptoms.

Objective estimates included sleep duration (SD), sleep efficiency, relative amplitude (RA) between day-time and night-time activity, mid sleep on free days (MSF), gross motor activity (GMA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Self-reported measures included insomnia rating scale, SD, MSF, metabolic equivalent total, and MVPA.

In contrast, self-reported, but not objective, sleep differed between people with current depression/anxiety compared to those without current disorders; people with current depression/anxiety reported both shorter and longer SD and more insomnia. More depressive/anxiety symptoms and number of depressive/anxiety diagnoses were associated with larger disturbances of the actigraphy measures. Actigraphy provides ecologically valid information on sleep, CR, and PA that enhances data from self-reported questionnaires.

They responded during their stay in the maternity ward to a set of questionnaires between the 1st and the 6th day after delivery. This included an anamnestic questionnaire as well as different scales that evaluated generalized self-efficacy feeling (GSES), marital adjustment (DAS), perceived sense of control during labor and delivery (LAS), birth experience (QEVA), anxiety manifestations (STAI-Y), depressive symptoms (EPDS) and peri-traumatic distress (PDI). Symptoms of anxiety, depression and peri-traumatic distress in the immediate postpartum period, as indicators of women's mental health, are predicted by different determinants. An anxious personality and perceived complications during childbirth for the woman or baby have been shown to be significant predictors of postpartum anxiety. Symptoms of depression are related to a history of depression, a low overall sense of general efficacy and lower satisfaction in the marital relationship. Peri-traumatic distress is related to certain dimensions of the childbirth experience, such as perceived sense of control, perceived complications and emotions felt during birth. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and peritraumatic distress are linked to aspects of the prenatal period, but also to the experience of childbirth. More specific prevention, screening and care measures, depending on the woman's symptomatology, can be implemented during pregnancy or at the maternity. Further research seems essential to better understand the interactions between the prenatal period, childbirth and postpartum in explaining women's mental health in the immediate postpartum period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33039587/"}

National audits aim to improve population-level clinical care by identifying unwarranted variations and making recommendations for clinicians, managers and service commissioners. The National Clinical Audit of Anxiety and Depression aimed to improve clinical care for people admitted to English hospitals for treatment of anxiety and depression, to provide comparative data on quality of care, and to support local quality improvement initiatives by identifying and sharing examples of best practice. Thirteen standards were developed based on NICE guidelines, literature review and feedback from a steering committee and reference group of service users and carers. All providers of NHS inpatient mental health services in England were asked to submit details of between 20 and 100 eligible service users/patients admitted between April 2017 and September 2018. To ascertain data reliability, participating services re-audited 5 sets of case-notes with a second auditor, and the coordinating team checked 10 randomly-selected sets of case-notes from 3 services, also selected at random. The reference group and steering committee identified key findings and developed a series of recommendations, which were discussed in regional quality improvement workshops and on-line webinars. Data from 3795 case notes were analysed. A sizeable proportion of records indicated that at least one important aspect of initial assessment was not documented. Many service users/patients who could have benefited from an intervention targeted at optimising physical health did not receive it. Only a minority (39%) were referred for psychological therapy. Use of outcome measures varied considerably but no single outcome measure was being used routinely. Most individuals had a care plan recorded in the notes, but a review date was documented in only two-thirds, and almost half of individuals had not received a copy. There was considerable variation between English mental health services across many variables, and much scope for improvement. Clinicians should ensure that care plans are developed collaboratively with service users/patients and identified carers should be provided with information about support services. Health services should investigate the reasons for low referral rates for psychological therapies. Clinicians should ensure all service users have jointly developed crisis plans in place at discharge. Service managers should agree outcome measures to evaluate the treatment provided and clinicians should use these measures at initial assessment and review appointments.

Besides being more susceptible to the onset of depression, young people have a higher risk of loneliness, and their personal and social development is impacted by social relationships during this time. It is thought that mental health stigma can undermine both help-seeking and longer-term outcomes for disorders like depression in young people. However, how stigma (i.e., related to depression) might affect young people's feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and relationships is unclear. Using qualitative research methods, this study aimed to explore the subjective experiences of public and internalized stigma and its effects on loneliness, social isolation, and relationship quality in young people with depression symptoms. We carried out in-depth, semi-structured interviews with N = 22 young people aged 17-25 (M<sub>age</sub> = 22 years) who reported high symptoms of depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) score > 27) (i.e., community sample, N = 9) or had been previously diagnosed with depression by a medical professional (i.e., clinical sample, N = 13). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. We explored the subjective effects of depression stigma on loneliness, social isolation, and relationships. Participants described both public stigma (i.e., initiated by others) and internalized stigma (i.e., self-imposed) as disrupting social relationships and eliciting loneliness, isolation, and depressive symptomology. Four main themes about young people's subjective experiences of stigma were identified: 1) Others' Misunderstanding of Mental Health Disorders and the Impact Misunderstanding has on Relationships; 2) Effects of Stigma on the Self and Wellbeing; 3) Stigma Fosters Secrecy Versus Disclosure; and 4) Stigma Increases Loneliness Driven by Avoidance of Social Contexts. Young people's accounts revealed a wide range of consequences beyond their depression diagnosis. Participants often felt discriminated against, misunderstood, and judged by others as a result of public stigma; they discussed internalizing these attitudes. They suggested that a lack of understanding from others, for example from their partners, family, and peers, and unreliable and/or absent support systems resulted in increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation and reduced the quality and quantity of relationship formation, social bonds, and interactions. Stigma also reduced their self-esteem and confidence, which in turn fostered secrecy and a reluctance to disclose their depression. Despite depression's stigma, most participants reported having long-term goals and aspirations to reconnect with others. These goals stood in contrast to feeling hopeless and unmotivated during periods of depression. Overall, we reveal how stigma can impact feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and relationships among young people with depression, which could lead to targeted interventions to lessen the impact of stigma in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37479975/"}

Given that comorbid anxiety and major depressive disorders are very common in AUD, and that such comorbidity affects psychological treatments negatively, the primary aim of the present study was investigating whether ApBM training is moderated by anxiety/major depressive disorder comorbidity. The secondary aim was to examine whether ApBM's relapse-preventive effect can be replicated. <b><i>Method:</i></b> We conducted a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a clinical sample of AUD inpatients (n = 729) with a follow-up assessment after 1 year. All patients received 12 weeks of inpatient treatment as usual (TAU). On top of that, patients were randomized to a 12-session ApBM (TAU + ApBM), and a no-training control condition (TAU-only). Treatment success was defined as either no relapse or a single lapse shorter than 3 days in duration, ended by the patient and followed by at least 4 weeks of abstinence. Failure was defined as relapse, passed away, no contact, or refusal to provide information. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We found that TAU + ApBM had significantly higher success rates than TAU-only at 1-year follow-up. Importantly, anxiety/depressive comorbidity moderated ApBM's effects: Adding ApBM to TAU increased success rates more for patients with a comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder than for patients without such comorbidity. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our data suggest that adding ApBM to TAU works better in patients with a comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder; a promising finding gave the high rates of comorbidity in clinical practice.

Research indicates treatment response is a non-linear process characterized by combinations of gradual changes and abrupt shifts in depression symptoms, although less is known about differential trajectories of depression symptoms in therapist-supported digital mental health interventions (DMHI). Repeated measures latent profile analysis was used to empirically identify differential trajectories based upon biweekly depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among patients engaging in a therapist-supported DMHI from January 2020 to July 2021. Multivariate associations between symptom trajectories with sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were examined with multinomial logistic regression. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were defined as a five-point change on the PHQ-9 from baseline to week 12. The final sample included 2192 patients aged 18 to 82 (mean = 39.1). Four distinct trajectories emerged that differed by symptom severity and trajectory of depression symptoms over 12 weeks. All trajectories demonstrated reductions in symptoms. Despite meeting MCID criteria, evidence of treatment resistance was found among the trajectory with the highest symptom severity. Chronicity of major depressive episodes and lifetime trauma exposures were ubiquitous across the trajectories in a multinomial logistic regression model. These data indicate that changes in depression symptoms during DMHI are heterogenous and non-linear, suggesting a need for precision care strategies to address treatment resistance and increase engagement. Future efforts should examine the effectiveness of trauma-informed treatment modules for DMHIs as well as protocols for continuation treatment and relapse prevention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651947/"}

Multivariable linear regression analyses examined the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and patients' functional impairment. Approximately 46.3% and 27.0% showed some depression and anxiety symptomatology, while 8.0% and 3.0% experienced major depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Patients reported the most impairment in mobility and capacity for life activities. More functional impairment was identified in patients with gastrointestinal cancers, those receiving radiation therapy alone, and those scoring higher on depression and anxiety than in those with cancers originating in the head, neck, or lung or those receiving chemotherapy alone. Reports of better overall health status were negatively associated with functional impairment. Patients reported extensive perceived barriers to seeking psychiatric care, including not knowing where to get mental health support (86.7%), wanting to manage mental health independently (73.7%), and thinking mental health will resolve on its own (73.7%), and denying mental health concerns (61.0%).

A community sample of depressed adolescents and non-depressed peers was followed-up with a structured diagnostic interview after 15 years. The participants (n=382) were divided into five groups depending on their status in adolescence: no depression (n=155); long-term MD (n=91); episodic MD (n=63); dysthymia (n=33); and subthreshold symptoms (n=40). Outcomes (age 19-31) included mood disorders, other mental disorders, suicidality, and treatment for mental disorders. The long-term group overall had a poorer outcome than the non-depressed group, with the episodic group in an intermediate position. The outcome of the dysthymic group was similar to that of the long-term group, while the subsyndromal group did not differ markedly from the non-depressed group. The long-term group was more likely than the episodic group to report adult anxiety disorders, multiple mental disorders, suicide attempts, and treatment; they also seemed to develop more persistent adult depressions, with a higher number of recurrent episodes and longer duration of antidepressant treatment. Even after adjustment for adolescent factors of clinical and etiological importance, the long-term group had a markedly less favourable outcome than the episodic group.

We adjusted the logistic regression analyses for several confounding factors; the analyses with sleep problems at 24 months were additionally adjusted for preexisting anxiety or depressive symptoms (at 18 months). Dyssomnia and parental presence during sleep onset at 2 months and 24 months were associated with anxiety or depressive symptoms at 3 years (e.g., parental presence: odds ratio(2 months), 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.44; odds ratio(24 months), 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.92). Parasomnia, short sleep duration, and absence of set bedtime at 24 months, but not at 2 months, also preceded anxiety or depressive symptoms. These significant associations were not due to children's anxiety or depressive symptoms at 18 months. Rhythmicity and co-sleeping were not associated with later anxiety or depressive symptoms. Additional analyses provided little evidence for a bidirectional association with anxiety or depressive symptoms preceding later sleep problems.

Therefore, healthcare practitioners must be particularly attentive to these problems in young children. Future research should address possible mechanisms underlying the association between disturbed sleeping and anxiety or depressive symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21257976/"}

One of the most puzzling phenomena regarding mental health treatment, research, and policy is why depression has become the central component of the stress tradition since then. This article reviews statistical trends in diagnosis, treatment, drug prescriptions, and textual readings of diagnostic criteria and secondary literature. The association of anxiety with diffuse and amorphous conceptions of \"stress\" and \"neuroses\" became incompatible with professional norms demanding diagnostic specificity. At the same time, the contrasting nosologies of anxiety and depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III) extended major depressive disorder to encompass far more patients than any particular anxiety disorder. In addition, antidepressant drugs were not associated with the stigma and alleged side effects of the anxiolytic drugs. Various factors combined between the 1970s and the 1990s to transform conditions that had been viewed as \"anxiety\" into \"depression.\" New interests in the twenty-first century, however, might lead to the reemergence of anxiety as the signature mental health problem of American society.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20377760/"}

This review focuses on their experiences of clinically significant anxiety and depression and provides recommendations for appropriately timed referrals to mental health professionals. Adults with congenital heart disease have a higher probability of experiencing symptoms consistent with mood and anxiety disorders, yet risk factors are not well understood. Although patients as a group are often interested in psychological treatment, there is currently under-recognition and under-treatment of mental health concerns. As provider and patient awareness of the biopsychosocial implications of living with congenital heart disease continues to grow, the focus of comprehensive care is broadening to include attention to psychosocial well-being.

Maternal deaths related to mental health in the perinatal period can be attributed to a lack of appropriate treatment and/or support. A barrier to women's help-seeking behaviors is the lack of discrete, perinatal specific interventions where women can self-assess and access support. This review examines original research evaluating perinatal mental health interventions used by women to improve mental health. An integrative literature review was undertaken. A comprehensive search strategy using 5 electronic databases resulted in the retrieval of 1898 articles. Use of an inclusion and exclusion criteria and Critical Appraisal Skills Program tools resulted in 4 original research papers. Thematic analysis identified universal themes. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation and Mindfulness-based interventions, specifically adapted to meet the needs of women in the perinatal period, demonstrate an overall improvement in mental health. Women involved in the interventions experienced both improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as secondary benefits from participating in the research. To improve perinatal mental health outcomes, innovative modes of providing effective perinatal mental health interventions that address the unique needs of women in the perinatal period are needed. Future development of perinatal mental health interventions require adaptions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation and/or Mindfulness-based methods to address mental health outcomes for women in the perinatal period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27118000/"}

The co-occurrence or co-morbidity is higher than what could be expected based on their respective prevalences, and even pushed some authors to call it cothymia. This epidemiological and clinical reality results in many conceptual hesitations. We first will summarize how the different (versions of the) classification systems do not seem to have been successful in their attempts to delineate the blurred line between depression and anxiety, before questioning whether a dialogue with a more phenomenological or psychopathological approach could be helpful in understanding the articulation between both affective phenomena, as well as in bridging neurobiological research and clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32436448/"}

This study aims to provide a recent mental health screening prevalence, including anxiety and depression screening in the general public and to explore the associated risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted, employing a phone interview survey with 6,015 participants, using a quota sampling strategy to ensure equal representation of both sexes and administrative regions. The study assessed the prevalence of MDD and GAD risk and examined demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors associated with these mental health disorders. The national prevalence of people at risk of MDD and GAD were found to be 12.7 and 12.4%, respectively. Low diagnosis and treatment rates were observed, with only 1.5 and 0.5% of participants currently diagnosed and treated for depression and anxiety, respectively. Risk factors for MDD and GAD included female sex, lower education and income levels, smoking, and waterpipe use. Protective factors included physical activity, participation in volunteering activities and the practice of daily hobbies in the last 30 days. The relatively high prevalence of MDD and GAD risk and low diagnosis and treatment rates in Saudi Arabia emphasize the need for increased mental health promotion, early detection, and treatment accessibility. The study highlights the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors and fostering protective factors through targeted interventions.

The aim of this study was to assess anxiety, depression, hopelessness, quality of life, and the perception of stigmatization in a large cohort of patients with chronic liver disease of different aetiology and severity, as well as to identify predictors associated with mental health disorders. A total of 340 patients completed a survey assessing mental health using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Major Depression Inventory. Quality of life was measured with the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire and the European Quality-of-Life visual analogue scale. To assess stigmatization, validated questions from the Danish Nationwide Survey of Patient Experiences were used. Predictors associated with anxiety, hopelessness, and depression were analysed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Overall, 15% of the patients had moderate or severe anxiety, 3% had moderate or pronounced hopelessness, and 8% had moderate or severe depression. The prevalence of all three was highest in patients with cirrhosis and was associated with a low quality of life. More patients with cirrhosis had perceived stigmatization compared to patients with liver disease without cirrhosis, which affected their self-perception, and more than one-third of the patients refrained from telling others about their liver disease. The results emphasize the need for increased focus on mental health problems and awareness on preventing the discrimination of patients with liver disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37107779/"}

To address this need, the current study undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 studies involving 88,336 persons examining the prospective relationship between anxiety and depression at both symptom and disorder levels. Using mixed-effect models, results suggested that all types of anxiety symptoms predicted later depressive symptoms (r = .34), and all types of depressive symptoms predicted later anxiety symptoms (r = .31). Although anxiety symptoms more strongly predicted depressive symptoms than vice versa, the difference in effect size for this analysis was very small and likely not clinically meaningful. Additionally, all types of diagnosed anxiety disorders predicted all types of later depressive disorders (OR = 2.77), and all depressive disorders predicted later anxiety disorders (OR = 2.73). Most anxiety and depressive disorders predicted each other with similar degrees of strength, but depressive disorders more strongly predicted social anxiety disorder (OR = 6.05) and specific phobia (OR = 2.93) than vice versa. Contrary to conclusions of prior reviews, our findings suggest that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia, whereas other anxiety and depressive disorders are bidirectional risk factors for one another.

About 90.2% of the students in the PHQ-9 scale had depressive symptoms in the major depressive disorder (MDD) dimension, and 44.5% in the GAD-7 scale had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Gender, being a preclinical student, history of psychiatric treatment in the past, currently receiving psychiatric treatment, death of someone due to pandemic, economic and health situation, perception of mental health were found associated with MDD and Moderate/Severe Anxiety symptoms. Students with Anxiety and MDD reported significantly more anxiety about contamination and negative beliefs about precautions' sufficiency.

However, past research has relied on nonclinical samples and nonspecific depression measures, raising the question of whether these features are unique to depression vis-à-vis frequently co-occurring conditions, especially anxiety. Using structured questions about recent life changes or difficulties, we interviewed a sample of individuals with varying levels of depression and anxiety (<i>N</i> = 486), including individuals in a major depressive episode (<i>n</i> = 228) and/or diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (<i>n</i> = 273). Interviews were transcribed to provide a natural language sample. Analyses isolated language features associated with gold standard, clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety. Many language features associated with depression were in fact shared between depression and anxiety. Language markers with relative specificity to depression included <i>I-usage</i>, <i>sadness</i>, and decreased <i>positive emotion,</i> while <i>negations</i> (e.g., \"not,\" \"no\"), <i>negative emotion,</i> and several emotional language markers (e.g., <i>anxiety, stress, depression</i>) were relatively specific to anxiety. Several of these results were replicated using a self-report measure designed to disentangle components of depression and anxiety. We next built machine learning models to detect severity of common and specific depression and anxiety using only interview language. Individuals' speech characteristics during this brief interview predicted their depression and anxiety severity, beyond other clinical and demographic variables. Depression and anxiety have partially distinct patterns of expression in spoken language. Monitoring of depression and anxiety severity via language can augment traditional assessment modalities and aid in early detection.

To identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in staff working in ICUs in nine English hospitals during June and July 2020. An anonymized brief web-based survey comprising standardized questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), well-being and alcohol use was administered to staff. Seven hundred and nine participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) doctors, 344 (49%) nurses and 74 (10%) other healthcare staff. Over half (59%) reported good well-being; however, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6%), PTSD (40%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%). Thirteen per cent of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past 2 weeks. Within the sample used in this study, we found that doctors reported better mental health than nurses across a range of measures. We found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in nurses. Whilst further work is needed to better understand the real level of clinical need amongst ICU staff, these results indicate the need for a national strategy to protect the mental health, and decrease the risk of functional impairment, of ICU staff whilst they carry out their essential work during COVID-19.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33434920/"}

People's life pressures are increasing as society develop, resulting in a series of adverse emotions. If it is not paid attention to for a long time, it will lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. Depression and anxiety can occur separately or simultaneously, both of which are highly correlated. In recent years, the incidence of T2DM with the state of depression and anxiety has increased significantly. According to recent research, the state of depression and anxiety might increase the prevalence of T2DM and accelerate its progression by influencing patient's behavioral style and biological mechanisms. T2DM can also aggravate patients' state of depression and anxiety, worsening their life quality. However, few reviews have discussed the association between T2DM and the state of depression and anxiety. In order to reduce the prevalence of the two diseases, we ought to investigate them more thoroughly so that readers can recognize the close connection between the two and take appropriate interventions. Therefore, this article mainly discusses the interaction between T2DM and the state of depression and anxiety from behavioral and biological mechanisms, the effects of common hypoglycemic drugs on the state of depression and anxiety, and the effects of antidepressant anxiety treatments on T2DM. These three aspects are intended to shed light on the interaction between the two so as to find the appropriate interventions to reduce morbidity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40419162/"}

A total of 10 interventions over the course of 25 years of research met inclusion criteria. Three of the included studies found a small but significant effect on paternal depression scores. However, none of the included studies exclusively targeted paternal mental health. Instead, they addressed paternal well-being indirectly by focusing on the mother, infant, or couple relationship. Studies did not require fathers to meet criteria for depression at baseline. This may have resulted in a selection bias, whereby the included fathers may not have required any treatment. We were also unable to perform additional statistical analyses because of the limited research available as well as the inconsistent outcome measures.

The present study therefore sought to identify predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms among U.S. adults with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online between October and December 2020. U.S. adults with disabilities (<i>n</i> = 441) completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, psychosocial processes, and a range of demographic and disability characteristics. In our sample, 61.0% and 50.0% of participants met criteria for a probable diagnosis of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Participants also experienced significantly higher levels of disability-related stigma and social isolation compared to prepandemic norms. Hierarchical regression analyses identified higher social isolation, presence of chronic pain, younger age, higher disability-related stigma, and higher worries about contracting COVID-19 as significant predictors of both depression and anxiety symptoms. This study highlights important demographic and psychosocial predictors of mental health risks for people with disabilities in the context of COVID-19. Findings further underscore the need to attend to those at elevated risk within the disability community as rehabilitation professionals, disability organizations, and policy makers work to support people with disabilities in postpandemic recovery and create a more equitable response to ongoing and future public health crises.

Data were from the Triple B Pregnancy Cohort Study. Participants included 1539 mothers and 793 partners. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. Major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in trimester three. Infant development was assessed at 12-months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Antepartum, maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with poorer infant social-emotional (d = -0.11, p = .025) and language development (d = -0.16, p = .001). At 8-weeks postpartum, maternal anxiety symptoms were associated with poorer overall development (d = -0.11, p = .030). No association was observed for clinical diagnoses in mothers, nor paternal depressive and anxiety symptoms or clinical diagnoses; albeit risk estimates were largely in the expected direction of adverse effects on infant development. Evidence suggests that maternal perinatal depression and anxiety symptoms may adversely impact infant development.

To have women report on their experienced source of orgasm, including combinations of vaginal and clitoral stimulation, the solo or partnered context of the stimulation, and the intensity of the orgasms from different sources and to predict indicators of mental health and sexual health using the orgasm source. Eighty-eight women 18 to 53 years old answered detailed questions about their usual and recent orgasm experiences, sexual history, depression, and anxiety. Then, they viewed a series of neutral and sexual films. They were instructed to increase or decrease their sexual arousal or respond \"as usual\" to the sexual films. They reported their sexual arousal after each film. Outcomes assessed included mental health (depression and anxiety) and sexual health (orgasm quality, ability to regulate sexual response to sex films). Reported sexual arousal was analyzed for the regulation task. Most women (64%) reported that clitoral and vaginal stimulation contributed to their usual method of reaching orgasm. Women who reported that clitoral stimulation was primarily responsible for their orgasm reported a higher desire to self-stimulate and demonstrated greater control over their self-reported sexual arousal. The primary stimulation site for orgasm was unrelated to measurements of depression or anxiety despite sufficient statistical power. Most women reported that clitoral and vaginal stimulation is important in orgasm. Women experience orgasms in many varied patterns, a complexity that is often ignored by current methods of assessing orgasm source. The reported source of orgasm was unrelated to orgasm intensity, overall sex-life satisfaction, sexual distress, depression, or anxiety.

It has been suggested that living with someone with depression is comparable to that of other serious mental health problems, such as schizophrenia or dementia. This meta-ethnography included 15 studies exploring experiences of living with a relative or partner with depression. Studies were heterogeneous regarding types of relationship with the depressed individual. The synthesis revealed a cyclical, psychosocial process that family caregivers undergo whilst providing care to a person with depression. The process consists of four phases: making sense of depression; changes in family dynamics; overcoming challenges; and moving forward. The findings illustrate that care giving is not a static process and that the needs of the depressed person are constantly changing. Some of the studies presented in the review represent caregivers recruited via support groups and so the person cared for may not have had professional diagnoses of depression. This synthesis indicated the need for professional support to be available to caregivers for their own mental health needs. The model put forward suggests that different types of support may be useful for caregivers at different stages of the process including couples or systemic therapy at the initial stages of management, addressing stigma to help those overcoming challenges of caring for their partner or relative and self-compassionate approaches for caregivers who may need support to look after themselves, avoid feelings of guilt and move forward towards acceptance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26706831/"}

Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content.

Observational evidence supports a relationship between habitual diet quality and depression. Less is known about the causative effects of diet on mental health outcomes. Therefore a systematic review was undertaken of randomised controlled trials of dietary interventions that used depression and/or anxiety outcomes and sought to identify characteristics of programme success. A systematic search of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed and PyscInfo databases was conducted for articles published between April 1971 and May 2014. Of the 1274 articles identified, seventeen met eligibility criteria and were included. All reported depression outcomes and ten reported anxiety or total mood disturbance. Compared with a control condition, almost half (47%) of the studies observed significant effects on depression scores in favour of the treatment group. The remaining studies reported a null effect. Effective dietary interventions were based on a single delivery mode, employed a dietitian and were less likely to recommend reducing red meat intake, select leaner meat products or follow a low-cholesterol diet. Although there was a high level of heterogeneity, we found some evidence for dietary interventions improving depression outcomes. However, as only one trial specifically investigated the impact of a dietary intervention in individuals with clinical depression, appropriately powered trials that examine the effects of dietary improvement on mental health outcomes in those with clinical disorders are required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25465596/"}
{"id": "38351574", "title": "Can Muscular Parameters Predict Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression?", "text": "Major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders are among the major public health issues. Therefore, identifying predictors of symptoms of depression and anxiety holds fundamental importance to avoid the aggravation of these conditions. Muscle strength and function (e.g., handgrip strength and timed-stands test) are widely recognized predictors of health outcomes; however, their association with symptoms of depression and anxiety is still not completely understood. This study investigated the associations between handgrip strength and timed-stands test scores with symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, we examined whether individuals exhibiting greater strength levels demonstrate reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with lower levels of strength. This is a community-based, cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited through social media and underwent a semi-structured interview to record sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, use of tobacco and medication, and symptoms of anxiety (Beck's Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and depression (Beck's Depressive Inventory [BDI]). Subsequently, anthropometric characteristics, handgrip strength, and functionality (i.e., timed-stands test) were assessed. In all, 216 individuals were evaluated. The adjusted regression model showed an inverse association between handgrip strength and anxiety (β = -0.22; 95% CI [-0.38, -0.07]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.07, <i>p</i> = .005) and depression symptoms (β = -0.25; 95% CI [-0.42, -0.07]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.05, <i>p</i> = .006). Similarly, timed-stands test scores were associated with anxiety (β = -0.33; 95% CI [-0.54, -0.13]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.09, <i>p</i> = .002) and depression (β = -0.32; 95% CI [-0.56, -0.09]; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.06, <i>p</i> = .008). Furthermore, the low-strength group showed higher values on the BAI (9.5 vs. 5.9 arbitrary units; <i>p</i> = .0008) and BDI than the high-strength group (10.8 vs. 7.9 arbitrary units; <i>p</i> = .0214).

Perinatal depression has adverse effects on the physical and mental health of mothers and children. However, according to current researches, Yoga has been considered as an effective exercise that can help pregnant women to regulate their emotions. Thus, this review reports the effectiveness of yoga on perinatal depression. We reviewed all of the relevant RCT (Randomized Control Trial, RCT) studies published until June 2021 from the major open-access databases. 12 RCTs were selected and included in this study, and the total number of people included in the analysis in the combined study was 594. The level of depression and anxiety of participants was evaluated using detailed and recognized scale. Compared with the control group, the yoga intervention group indicates a statistically significant decrease in depression levels (SMD (Standardised Mean Difference, SMD), -2.31; 95% CI, -3.67 to -0.96; P=0.139) and anxiety (SMD, -4.75; 95% CI, -8.3 to -1.19; P=0.002). In addition, we also conducted a subgroup analysis according to the type of population. The subgroup analysis successfully reduced the level of heterogeneity and the results indicated that the difference in population types in the combined analysis leads to the higher heterogeneity. The SMD value for healthy women is -2.3 (95% CI, -4.83 to 0.23) and for depressed women is -9.02 (95% CI, -11.42 to -6.62). Finally, the meta-analysis results of the self-control group prove that yoga can reduce the depression scores (SMD, 5.23; 95% CI, 1.90 to 8.56; P=0.049) compared with baseline. Yoga can effectively relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety in the perinatal period, which can be used as an auxiliary treatment option clinically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35772128/"}

A recently developed computerized adaptive mental health assessment tool (computerized adaptive test-mental health [CAT-MH]) allows rapid, precise, and accurate assessment of numerous mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, without the need for a trained interviewer. The goal of this investigation was to determine the feasibility of administering CAT-MH for anxiety and depression in the preoperative setting and to obtain preliminary evidence of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in preoperative patients. In this prospective cohort study, 100 adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled and asked to complete the CAT-MH in the preoperative clinic. Urgent and emergency surgeries were excluded as were pregnant patients. Primary feasibility outcomes were completion rate and time to completion. Secondary outcomes were prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression. All 100 enrolled patients completed the study. All patients were able to complete the mental health assessment (mean time: 3.6 ± 1.8 minutes standard deviation). Sixteen patients (16%) screened positive for anxiety (severity: mild, n = 7 [7%]; moderate, n = 7 [7%]); severe, n = 2 [2%]); 12 of 16 (75%) did not have a previous diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Twenty-eight (28%) patients screened positive for depression (severity: mild, n = 26 [26%]; moderate and severe, n = 1 each [1%]); 23 of 28 (82%) had no previous diagnosis of depressive disorder. Nineteen patients (19%) met the screening criteria for major depressive disorder; 14 of 19 (74%) of which had no previous diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The results of this pilot study support the feasibility of using CAT-MH in a preoperative evaluation and indicate that there is a substantial prevalence of undiagnosed anxiety and depression in surgical patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958316/"}

Pregnant and up to 3 months postpartum women, older than 18 years of age. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) were used to assess mental health status. Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models were performed to identify factors associated with poor mental health. 5210 women participated (including 3411 pregnant and 1799 postpartum women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (EDS ≥13) was 16.1% in the pregnancy group and 17.0% in the postpartum . Moderate to severe generalised anxiety symptoms (GAD ≥10) were found among 17.3% of the pregnant and 17.7% of the postpartum women. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a pre-existing mental illness, a chronic somatic illness, having had COVID-19 or its symptoms, smoking, unplanned pregnancy and country of residence. Among COVID-19 restrictive measures specific to perinatal care, pregnant and postpartum women were most anxious about not having their partner present at the time of delivery, that their partner had to leave the hospital early and to be separated from their newborn after the delivery. Approximately one in six pregnant or postpartum women reported major depression or anxiety symptoms during the third wave of the pandemic. These findings suggest a continued need to monitor depression and anxiety in pregnancy and postpartum populations throughout and in the wake of the pandemic. Tailored support and counselling are essential to reduce the burden of the pandemic on perinatal and infant mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36631239/"}

The existing practice at our clinic was depression screening via the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 at all prenatal visits; screenings were prospectively tracked for 3 months in women presenting for visit at 24-28 weeks gestation (Patient Health Questionnaire-2-only group). We then added Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item validated anxiety scale assessment to prenatal visits at 24-28 weeks gestation (Patient Health Questionnaire-2+Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item group). Our primary study outcome was the rate of positive depression and anxiety screens during pregnancy; secondary outcomes included referral rates to mental health services and obstetric and medical outcomes.

Relaxed criteria were used to select studies including relevant single-cases, case series and single group studies along with studies that employed control groups. Twenty-four studies were identified. Twelve papers were of a single-case design (with or without replication). Two papers used uncontrolled single groups and ten studies used a control group. There were a total of 507 people in the various treatment and control groups, which ranged in size from 6 to 67 persons. All participants in the study had an ABI. Our review indicates CBT often shows a within-group pre- to post-treatment statistical difference for depression and anxiety problems, or a statistical difference between CBT-treated and non-treated groups. For studies that targeted the treatment of depression with CBT, effect-sizes ranged from 0 to 2.39 with an average effect-size of 1.15 for depression (large effect).

However, it was not possible to submit all twenty-four studies identified to effect-size analysis. Additionally, it is clear that CBT is not a panacea, as studies frequently indicate only partial reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms. This review suggests that if CBT is aimed at, for example, anger management or coping, it can be effective for anger or coping, but will not generalise to have an effect on anxiety or depression.

{"id": "25240846", "title": "A prospective examination of depression, anxiety and stress throughout pregnancy.", "text": "Perinatal distress has largely been conceptualised as the experience of depression and/or anxiety. Recent research has shown that the affective state of stress is also present during the perinatal period and thus may add to a broader understanding of perinatal distress. The aims of the present study were to investigate the changes in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms across pregnancy, and to explore the prospective relationships between these symptoms. Two-hundred and fourteen pregnant women were recruited when they were less than 16 weeks gestation. Women completed depression, anxiety and stress measures on a monthly basis, from 16 weeks gestation through to 36 weeks gestation. The covariate measures of sleep quality and social support were assessed bi-monthly at 16, 24 and 32 weeks gestation. Levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were all shown to change over time, with women experiencing fewer symptoms during the middle of their pregnancy. Higher symptoms early in pregnancy predicted higher symptom levels throughout the rest of pregnancy. Higher depression scores early in pregnancy were also shown to predict higher anxiety and higher stress scores in late pregnancy. Increased stress scores during mid pregnancy also predicted higher anxiety scores in late pregnancy. Current findings indicate that symptom levels of depression, anxiety and stress vary over the course of pregnancy. Increased depression in early pregnancy seemed to be particularly pertinent as it not only predicted later depression symptoms, but also increased anxiety and stress in late pregnancy. Collectively, these results further highlight the importance of emotional health screening early in pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240846/"}

The primary outcome of interest was the development of MHI (anxiety, major depressive disorder, depressive disorder not elsewhere classified, neurotic depression, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and suicide) after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A total of 10,389 men (20.4%) developed MHI during the study period. Independent risk factors for MHI included age ≥ 75 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29); higher comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 3, HR = 1.63); rural hospital location (HR = 1.14); being single, divorced, or widowed (HR = 1.12); later year of diagnosis (HR = 1.05); and urinary incontinence (HR = 1.47).

Mental disorder such as depression is an important yet often neglected NCD and is becoming a growing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden. This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. On the basis of the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey, our results indicate that these mental health conditions have significant impacts on the individual medical expenditure, and they jointly contribute to 14.7% of total personal expected medical spending in China, with depression and depressive symptoms accounting for 6.9% and 7.8%, respectively. Given that patients with mental illness face multiple psychological and institutional barriers in seeking appropriate treatment, the high depression-induced medical costs may be primarily driven by the cost-shifting effect from mental health care to general health care, as mental disorders often coexist with other NCDs such as diabetes and hypertension. As an implication, our study calls for an urgent reform of China's mental health and insurance systems to remove the policy-induced obstacles for the access to mental health care resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28990318/"}

The relationship between these two conditions is often unclear and has been the subject of much discussion. The classical viewpoint considered depression and anxiety to be two disorders with separate treatment options: anxiolytic agents for anxiety and antidepressant agents for depression. Depression and anxiety may occur together representing comorbid 'pure' conditions, or anxiety may predispose depression (or vice versa), or symptoms of anxiety and depression may be external manifestations of one underlying cause, or there may be an overlap of classifications. It is also possible that a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder exists: the association of subthreshold depressive symptoms and subthreshold depressive anxiety. This review examines the relationship of co-occurring depression and anxiety. The socioeconomic burden and the need for effective treatment of comorbid anxiety and depression are highlighted.

Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions-with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter. If similar restrictions are reimposed, governments must carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decisions, whilst developing effective global and long-term responses to the cognitive and mental health challenges of this type of pandemic; as well as implementing appropriate psychological interventions with specific guidelines: particularly regarding exposure to COVID-19 mass-media reports.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503055/"}

We enrolled 200 pregnant women living with HIV from antenatal care clinics in the Kilimanjaro region. Women were eligible if they were in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and had been in PMTCT care for a minimum of one month. Data were collected via interviewer administered surveys. Participants self reported depression symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS) and anxiety symptoms (Brief Symptom Index, BSI). Multivariate logistic regression models examined factors associated with depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety. 25.0% of women met screening criteria for depression (EPDS ≥10). Depression was significantly associated with being single (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.1-15.5), food insecurity (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0-6.4), and HIV shame (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.3). 23.5% of participants met screening criteria for anxiety (BSI ≥1.01).

Depression and anxiety symptom scores were relatively stable across time. Growth curve analysis showed that higher child internalizing scores and lower parental sense of competency at five months post-placement were associated with higher initial levels of parental depressive symptoms. Lower parental sense of competency was also associated with higher initial levels of parental anxiety symptoms. Parents of older children and those with higher levels of parental anxiety and sense of competency at five months post-placement had a steeper decrease in depressive symptoms over time.

Primary outcomes included observer-rated anxiety (HAM-A) and depressive (QIDS) symptom severity 8 weeks after randomization assessed by blinded raters via telephone. Follow-up outcomes at 6 and 12 months are reported. Symptom severity was significantly lower with small to medium effects in IG-IMI (anxiety: d = 0.45, depression: d = 0.43) and AG-IMI (anxiety: d = 0.31, depression: d = 0.32) compared to WLC. No significant differences emerged between guidance formats in primary outcomes. There was a significant effect in HAM-A after 6 months favoring AG-IMI. On average, participants completed 85.38% of IG-IMI and 77.38% of AG-IMI.

Following current developments in this field, studies were classified as 'mechanistic' or 'predictor' studies (i.e., informing neurobiological models about putative mechanisms versus aiming to provide predictive information). Mechanistic evidence points toward a dual-process model of psychotherapy in anxiety disorders with abnormally increased limbic activation being decreased, while prefrontal activity is increased. Partly overlapping findings are reported for depression, albeit with a stronger focus on prefrontal activation following treatment. No studies directly comparing neural pathways of psychotherapy between anxiety and depression were detected. Consensus is accumulating for an overarching role of the anterior cingulate cortex in modulating treatment response across disorders. When aiming to quantify clinical utility, the need for single-subject predictions is increasingly recognized and predictions based on machine learning approaches show high translational potential. Present findings encourage the search for predictors providing clinically meaningful information for single patients. However, independent validation as a crucial prerequisite for clinical use is still needed.

Of 1827 titles initially identified, 42 were included in the systematic review. They comprised of four interventions (one RCT, three non-RCTs) and 38 observational studies (33 cross sectional, five prospective). In studies with DR/DME as the exposure (n = 28), its severity and related vision impairment were consistently associated with poor psychosocial outcomes, mostly higher incidence of depression and depressive symptoms. Baseline depression and depressive symptoms were also associated with greater DR incidence and progression of DR. Medical intervention strategies showed significant improvement in psychosocial outcomes in patients with DR, such as significant improvements in mental health domain scores of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ 25). Severity of DR, DME and associated vision loss are significantly associated with poor psychosocial outcomes. Aspects of depression and its symptoms show a bi-directional association, with increased incidence and progression of DR significant in those with baseline depression or depressive symptoms. Based on these findings, we propose two areas that may benefit from targeted interventions: (1) Prevention of development of poor psychological outcomes by preventing and delaying progression of DR/DME; and (2) Improved detection and management of poor psychological functioning by improving screening tools and multidisciplinary care for patients.

A total of 279 patients completed questionnaires including measures of personality dimensions, rumination, immature defenses, depression and anxiety. Our findings suggested that sociotropy and autonomy may be associated with both depressive and anxious symptoms in patients with MDD and with GAD. Multiple mediation analyses indicated that brooding always acted as a mediating link between personality vulnerabilities (sociotropy and autonomy) and depressive and anxiety symptoms, independently of the patient group. In addition, in patients with MDD and those with GAD, brooding and immature defenses functioned together by linking sociotropy and autonomy, respectively, with depressive symptoms. Our results also showed that, in patients with GAD, both types of rumination explained the relationship between sociotropy and autonomy and anxiety symptoms. Overall, our findings provided evidence of the transdiagnostic role of the brooding, linking the vulnerability of personality dimensions and emotional symptoms. They also indicated that reflection and immature defenses can operate in conjunction with brooding, depending on the type of vulnerability and emotional context.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32784694/"}

This study investigated prospectively whether women with preconception personality disorder have increased rates of antenatal anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. 244 women in a population cohort were assessed for personality disorder at age 24 using the Standardised Assessment of Personality. Five to twelve years later, women were screened with the Clinical Interview Schedule, Revised Anxiety Subscale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during the third trimester of 328 pregnancies. Preconception personality disorder was associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of antenatal anxiety symptoms, which remained with adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental disorder (adjusted OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.31-6.15). Preconception personality disorder was associated with doubled odds of antenatal depressive symptoms, however this was attenuated with adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental disorder (adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.81-4.81). Our findings are restricted to pregnant women aged 29-35 years. Anxiety and depression may have been under-identified because they were assessed at a single antenatal time point. Residual confounding of the associations by preconception common mental disorder at other time points may have occurred. Women with personality disorder are at heightened risk of anxiety symptoms in pregnancy, over and above risks associated with prior common mental disorder. This raises a possibility that pregnancy brings particular emotional challenges for women with personality disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923193/"}

To that end we sought to identify the impact of co-morbid anxiety and depression in COPD patients and evaluate recent evidence regarding the management of such cases. A Pubmed search was conducted for relevant original articles with emphasis on the past 5 years. The studies we identified indicate that psychiatric comorbidity negatively impacts the prognosis of COPD, as it is associated with reduced adherence to treatment, reduced physical activity and a general reduction in quality of life, in turn leading to more frequent exacerbations and increased severity of exacerbations (which are more likely to require hospitalization), resulting in increased mortality. Despite the evidence showing a high prevalence and exceedingly negative impact of depression and anxiety in patients with COPD, very few clinical trials (for both pharmacological and psychological treatments) with small sample sizes have been conducted in this population.

FSS are consistently associated cross-sectionally with anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders in childhood and adolescence, and the likelihood of associated anxiety and depression increases with the number of reported FSS. The presence of one or more FSS early in life is associated with an increased likelihood of multiple FSS and anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders later in life, and anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders in childhood are associated with subsequent multiple FSS. Strong associations between FSS, anxiety, and depression across the life span suggest the need to reconsider existing nosology and reconceptualize symptomatic relationships.

Research shows that depression exhibits disturbances in biological rhythms. Yet, the relationship between these biological rhythms and concomitant anxiety symptoms is insufficiently investigated in structured clinical assessments. This multicenter study, carried out in four Chinese hospitals, comprehensively examined the relationship between anxiety and disruptions in biological rhythms among patients with depression. The study encompassed 218 patients diagnosed with depression and 205 matched healthy controls. The Chinese version of the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry was utilized to evaluate the participants' biological rhythms, focusing on four dimensions: sleep, activity, social, and diet. In patients with depression, there is a significant positive correlation between the severity of anxiety symptoms and the disturbances in biological rhythms. The severity of anxiety and depression, along with the quality of life, are independently associated with disruptions in biological rhythms. The mediation model reveals that anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and biological rhythms. This research highlights the role of anxiety within the spectrum of depressive disorders and the associated disturbances in biological rhythms. Our findings shed light on potential pathways towards more targeted preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions for individuals battling depression and anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38678687/"}

The treatment group was treated with biofeedback exercise twice a day for 7 days, supplemented with psychotherapy for a period of 2 months (half-month intervals for one time). Intestinal medications in the treatment group were stopped after one month of treatment. While for the control group, patients were maintained with gastrointestinal motivational drugs, probiotics, anti-anxiety and depression medications. Both groups reduced the dosage of anxiolytics and depressants after 3 months. The control and the treatment group were both effective and the latter had a more significant effect compared to the former. Moreover, the anxiety/depression symptom for patients in the treatment group was significantly milder than those in the control group. Notably, compared with pre-treatment symptoms, the treatment group showed a significant reduction in Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores in the sixth month (F = 0.008, P = 0.008).

Pharmacological dissection of the \"neurotic\" disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that process different immediacies of threat. It is critical that each module can generate normal responses, symptoms of another syndrome, or syndromal responses. We discuss the resultant possibilities for comorbid dysfunction of these modules both with each other and with some disorders not usually classified as anxiety related. The simplest case is symptomatic fear/anxiety comorbidity, where dysfunction in one module results in excess activity in a second, otherwise normal, module to generate symptoms and apparent comorbidity. More complex is syndromal fear/anxiety comorbidity, where more than one module is concurrently dysfunctional. Yet more complex are syndromal comorbidities of anxiety that go beyond the two dimensional fear/anxiety systems: depression, substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our account of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-anxiety comorbidity entails discussion of the neuropsychology of externalizing disorders to account for the lack of anxiety comorbidity in some of these. Finally, we link the neuropsychology of disorder to personality variation, and to the development of a biomarker of variation in the anxiety system among individuals that, if extreme, may provide a means of unambiguously identifying the first of a range of anxiety syndromes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27739392/"}

This cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted on patients consecutively admitted with a new or existing cardiac diagnosis to one of the four main hospitals in Nablus, Palestine over an eight-month period. Data was obtained from hospital medical charts and an in-person interview, using a structured questionnaire with a sequence of validated instruments. All subjects were screened for depression and anxiety using the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42). Multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors among four categories (socio-demographic, clinical, psychosocial, lifestyle) independently associated with depression and anxiety. In total, 1053 patients with a confirmed cardiac diagnosis were included in the study with a participation rate of 96%. Based on the CDS and DASS-42, 54% met the criteria for severe depression (CDS > 100) and 19.2% for severe-to-very severe anxiety (DASS-anxiety > 15), respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were more prevalent among females and less educated patients. Factors independently associated with both depressive and anxiety symptoms were post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, low level of self-esteem, high somatic symptoms, low physical and mental health component scores, active smoking, physical inactivity, and longer disease duration. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms also reported poor social support and lower resilience. There was a high level of depression and anxiety in this sample of cardiac patients.

Recent evidence also suggests that the CAM can be applied to major depression and social phobia, both characterized by negative affect changes. Here, we compare negative affect variability between individuals with a variety of anxiety and depression diagnoses by measuring the levels and degree of change in the sentiment of their online communications. Participants were 1,853 individuals on Twitter who reported that they had been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (A cohort, n = 896) or a depressive disorder (D cohort, n = 957). Mean negative affect (NA) and negative affect variability were calculated using the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), an accurate sentiment analysis tool that scores text in terms of its negative affect content. Findings showed differences in negative affect variability between the D and A cohort, with higher levels of NA variability in the D cohort than the A cohort, U = 367210, p < .001, r = 0.14, d = 0.25.

However, depression in this population remains difficult to assess and is undertreated. Current estimates suggest a 20 to 30% prevalence of depression that meets diagnostic criteria in this population. The extent of other psychopathology in patients with ESRD is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to expand the research on psychiatric complications of ESRD and examine the prevalence of a broad range of psychopathology in an urban hemodialysis center and their impact on quality of life. With the use of a clinician-administered semistructured interview in this randomly selected sample of 70 predominately black patients, >70% were found to have a psychiatric diagnosis. Twenty-nine percent had a current depressive disorder: 20% had major depression, and 9% had a diagnosis of dysthymia or depression not otherwise specified. Twenty-seven percent had a current major anxiety disorder. A current substance abuse diagnosis was found in 19%, and 10% had a psychotic disorder. The mean Beck Depression Inventory score was 12.1 +/- 9.8. Only 13% reported being in current treatment by a mental health provider, and only 5% reported being prescribed psychiatric medication by their physician. A total of 7.1% had compound depression or depression coexistent with another psychiatric disorder. The construct of depression was also disentangled from the somatic effects of poor medical health by demonstrating a unique relationship between depressive affect and depression diagnosis, independent of health status. This study also suggests the utility of cognitive variables as a meaningful way of understanding the differences between patients who have ESRD with clinical depression or other diagnoses and those who have no psychiatric comorbidity. The findings of both concurrent and isolated anxiety suggest that the prevalence of psychopathology in patients with ESRD might be higher than previously expected, and the disorders may need to be treated independently. In addition, the data suggest that cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques may be especially advantageous in this population of patients who are treated with many medications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17699455/"}

This study aims to establish the prevalence of anxiety and depression in cancer patients in a Singapore hospital. It also describes the clinical characteristics of these patients, and examines if cancer patients with a psychiatric diagnosis differ from those without. Cross-sectional anxiety and depression symptom data were collected using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview generating DSM IV diagnoses from inpatients of an oncology ward in the tertiary hospital. In all, 315 patients were interviewed. Fifty three (16.8%) were diagnosed with major depression, while 30 (9.5%) were found to have generalized anxiety disorder, three to ten times higher than their corresponding prevalence rates in the general population. Patients with depression or anxiety tend to be unemployed, in stage 4 cancer, who can develop these symptoms at any time from the onset of cancer diagnosis, even when perceived social support is strong. Oncology patients with depression were more likely to be in terminal stages of cancer and to correctly identify themselves to have mental health issues, than those without (p<0.01). The psychological impact of cancer is appreciable. The lack of identifiable risk factors makes the task of diagnosing psychiatric conditions in cancer patients an onerous one. The psychiatrist involved may want to look beyond socio-demographic variables and consider biological factors in cancer to better help detect psychiatric morbidity in this group of patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24655623/"}

All invited patients (n = 100, 52% males, 2% lung transplanted), with a median age of 28 years (range 18-65), agreed to participate. In general (83%), the patients were positive to screening on an annual basis. No significant differences in total GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were found when comparing men and women. Patients younger than 30 years of age reported more symptoms of anxiety compared to older patients (p = 0.02). There were 21 (21%) patients with scores > 10 for GAD-7 and/or PHQ-9 indicating at least moderate anxiety or depression. Scores > 10 were reported by 15 patients on GAD-7, 15 patients on PHQ-9, and 9 patients reported scores above 10 on both measures. The patients considered annual check-ups for mental health issues important.

Patients with higher baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms were more likely to self-select into multiple forms of treatment, an effect driven by patients in the MHP as adjunctive treatment to in-person therapy and psychotropic medication. Patients in combined treatments had significantly higher depressive and anxiety symptoms across treatment, but all treatment groups had similar decreasing depressive and anxiety symptom trajectories. Exploratory analyses revealed differential treatment outcomes across treatment combinations. Patients in the MHP in combination with another treatment had higher rates of major depressive episodes, psychiatric hospitalization, and attempted death by suicide at baseline. Patients with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms tend to self-select into using DMHI in addition to more traditional types of treatment, rather than as a stand-alone intervention, and have more severe clinical characteristics.

It is important to explore biomarkers of anxiety and suicidal ideation in major depression. In this study we hypothesized that the volume of subregions of the amygdala might be indicators of anxiety and suicidal ideation in patients with major depression. We recruited 59 drug-naïve patients with first-episode depression who scored >17 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression, and 30 healthy controls to participate in a magnetic resonance imaging study. We examined the volume of sub-regions of the amygdala thought to be involved in processing anxious emotion in the depression and healthy control groups. We performed pair-wise comparisons of amygdala subfield volumes in patients with depression and healthy controls with an analysis of variance. We used logistic regression to test the relationship between suicidal ideation and anxious character with the volume of subregions of the amygdala. 1) We found a significant difference in the volumes of the left amygdala (P = 0.003) and right amygdala (P = 0.001) between the two groups. There are significant differences in the volumes of the sub-region of the left amygdala. 2) The volume of the left lateral nucleus (P<0.001), basal nucleus (P<0.001), accessory basal nucleus (P<0.05), left Paralaminar-nucleus (P<0.001), right lateral-nucleus (P<0.05), right basal-nucleus (P<0.05), right anterior-amygdaloid area AAA (P<0.05), right paralaminar-nucleus (P<0.001) in the depression group are larger than healthy controls, however the volumes of the central-nucleus (P<0.05), medial-nucleus (P<0.001) in both sides are decreased in the major depression group. 3) There is a significantly larger volume of right medial nucleus in the suicidal ideation group comparing the hopelessness (P = 0.026), and the depressive patients without hopeless thoughts (P = 0.004). 4) We found a negative relation between the left basal nucleus and anxiety (OR: 0.940, 95%CI: 0.891-0.991), and a positive relation between the accessory basal nucleus on the left side and anxiety (OR: 1.007, 95%CI: 1.002-1.158). We were not able to examine the effects of gender or age. The changes of amygdala volume in patients with depression were not followed up. Our sample size was such that independent replication is needed to confirm the robustness of our results. The volumes of the basal nucleus in both sides are increased in depressed patients while the volumes of the central-nucleus, medial-nucleus bilaterally are reduced in the major depression group. Among the subregions, the volume of right medial nucleus might be the biomarkers for suicidal ideation in depressive patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35691414/"}

In this protocol, the GET READY (Guided E-healTh for RElapse prevention in Anxiety and Depression) study will be described in which a relapse prevention programme is developed, implemented and evaluated. The aim of the study is to determine patients' usage of the programme and the associated course of their symptoms, to examine barriers and facilitators of implementation, and to assess patients' satisfaction with the programme. Participants are discharged from mental healthcare services, and are in complete or partial remission. They receive access to an E-health platform, combined with regular contact with a mental health professional in general practices. Online questionnaires will be completed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 9 months. Also, semi-structured qualitative individual interviews and focus group interviews will be conducted with patients and mental health professionals. This mixed-methods observational cohort study will provide insights into the use of a relapse prevention programme in relation to the occurrence of symptoms, as well as in its implementation and evaluation. Using the results of this study, the relapse prevention programme can be adapted in accordance with the needs of patients and mental health professionals.

The dual-process model hypothesises that psychological therapy is associated with increased emotional-regulation in prefrontal brain regions and decreased implicit emotional-reactivity in limbic regions; however, research has yielded inconsistent findings. Meta-analyses of brain activity changes accompanying psychological therapy (22 studies, n = 352) and neural predictors of symptomatic improvement (11 studies, n = 293) in depression and anxiety were conducted using seed-based d mapping. Both resting-state and task-based studies were included, and analysed together and separately. The most robust findings were significant decreases in anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and insula activation after therapy. Cuneus activation was predictive of subsequent symptom change. The results are in agreement with neural models of improved emotional-reactivity following therapy as evidenced by decreased activity within the anterior cingulate and insula. We propose compensatory as well as corrective neural mechanisms of action underlie therapeutic efficacy, and suggest the dual-process model may be too simplistic to account fully for treatment mechanisms.

Scientific studies on mental disorders in airline pilots are rare, and the results are heterogeneous. To date, no study has been conducted describing anxiety or depressive disorders among European airline pilots. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study using an anonymous online self-questionnaire. Pilots were recruited from the National Union of Airline Pilots between September 1 and October 16, 2022. Out of the 1,220 pilots surveyed, 25.4% of them suffered from anxiety according to the Hospital and Depression Scale (HAD): 14.4% suspected anxiety disorders and 11.0% confirmed anxiety disorders. Additionally, 13.1% of subjects reported depressive symptoms, including 8.9% suspected depressive disorders and 4.2% confirmed depressive disorders, according to the HAD. More than a third of the sample (40.1%) showed alcohol misuse. This study represents a major advancement in understanding the mental health of European airline pilots. This work highlights the need to implement prevention programs targeting profiles at risk of developing anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident.

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with humanitarian workers (national and international staff, consultants, United Nations volunteers). We applied validated measures useful for this setting. We applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to fit models with high prediction accuracy for each outcome and used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to obtain final coefficients and perform inference. A total of 277 humanitarian workers employed by 45 organizations completed the survey (a response rate in the order of 10%). We estimated prevalence of PTSD (24%), depression (39%), anxiety disorder (38%), hazardous alcohol consumption in men (35%) and women (36%), and the burnout components emotional exhaustion (24%) and depersonalization (19%). Chronic stress exposure was positively associated with PTSD (p < .001), depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), emotional exhaustion (p < .01), and depersonalization (p < .001). We found no significant association between emotion focused and problem focused coping and mental health outcomes. Associations between dysfunctional coping and depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .01) were positive. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower risk of hazardous alcohol consumption (p < .001). Contrary to expectations, working directly with humanitarian aid beneficiaries was significantly associated with lower risk for emotional exhaustion (p < .01).

Heritability of comorbid anxiety and depression was 79% compared with 41% for anxiety and 50% for depression alone. The PGS for depressive symptoms likewise predicted more variation in comorbid anxiety and depression (adjusted odds ratio per SD PGS = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.43-1.63; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.031, ΔAUC = 0.044) than the other outcomes, with nearly identical results when comorbid anxiety and depression was defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio per SD PGS = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.53-1.90; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.036, ΔAUC = 0.051).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and a truncated version of the BDI, the Cognitive Depression Index (CDI), as screening tools for anxiety and depression in dialysis patients. A total of 109 participants (69.7% males), from four dialysis centers, completed the self-report symptom scales HADS and BDI. Depression and anxiety disorders were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, overall agreement, kappa and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were assessed. Depressive disorders were found in 22% of the patients based on the SCID-I, while anxiety disorders occurred in 17%. The optimal screening cut-off score for depression was ≥ 7 for the HADS depression subscale (HADS-D), ≥ 14 for the HADS-total, ≥ 11 for the CDI and ≥ 17 for the BDI. The optimal screening cut-off for anxiety was ≥ 6 for the HADS anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and ≥ 14 for the HADS-total. At cut-offs commonly used in clinical practice for depression screening (HADS-D: 8; BDI: 16), the BDI performed slightly better than HADS-D. The BDI, CDI and HADS demonstrated acceptable performance as screening tools for depression, as did the HADS-A for anxiety, in our sample of dialysis patients. The recommended cut-off scores for each instrument were: ≥ 17 for BDI, ≥ 11 for CDI, ≥ 7 for HADS depression subscale, ≥ 6 for HADS anxiety subscale and ≥ 14 for HADS total. The CDI did not perform better than the BDI in our study. Lower cut-off for the HADS-A than recommended in medically ill patients may be considered when screening for anxiety in dialysis patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22789418/"}

However, the association cannot be interpreted unambiguously as an exposure effect because a common set of genetic factors can simultaneously contribute to increased liability for symptoms of anxiety, negative affect, and the perception of discrimination. The present study elucidates the association between discrimination and anxiety/negative affect by implementing strict genetic controls in a large sample of adults. We used data from the biomarker project of the Study of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), a national probability sample of noninstitutionalized, English-speaking respondents aged 25 to 74 y. Participants who consented to provide genetic data were biologically unrelated and of European ancestry as determined by genotype principal components analysis (<i>n</i> = 1,146). A single structural regression model was fit to the data with three measures of discrimination specified to load onto a latent factor and six measures of anxiety and negative affect specified to load onto a second latent factor. After accounting for potential genetic confounds-polygenic scores for anxiety, depression, and neuroticism and the first five genetic principal components-greater discrimination was associated with greater anxiety/negative affect (β = 0.53, SE = 0.04, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Findings suggest that measures of perceived discrimination should be considered environmental risk factors for anxiety/negative affect rather than indices of genetic liability for anxiety, depression, or neuroticism. Clinical interventions and prevention measures should focus on ways to mitigate the impact of discrimination to improve mental health at the population level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33384325/"}

This study aimed to investigate the associations between sports participation and depression and anxiety among a sample of Chinese adolescents. 2,374 adolescents from eight schools were invited to participate in this survey, of whom 1,714 adolescents from grades 7, 8, 10 and 11 were included for final analysis. Depressive symptoms and anxiety disorder were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), as well as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), respectively. Sport participation was assessed using a single question. Additionally, sociodemographic factors were assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate sport participation's associations with depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders separately, having controlled for all sociodemographic covariates. Among all study participants, those with less participation in sport-related activities had a greater likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms (Odd ratio [OR] for never = 2.07; OR for 1-3 times per month = 1.77; OR for 1-2 times per week = 1.77), as well as anxiety disorders (OR for never = 1.61; OR for 1-3 times per month = 1.69; OR for 1-2 times per week = 1.38). Encouraging adolescents to engage in more sports participation would provide an effective and feasible approach for mental health promotion.

Research on CCBT has found solid evidence for efficacy when the use of a therapeutic computer program is supported by a clinician or other helping professional. Lower levels of efficacy have been found when CCBT is used as a stand-alone treatment. Current CCBT programs have many desirable features; however, few of the current programs incorporate services such as artificial intelligence that have the potential to help improve communication with patients. An increasing number of mobile apps have been created that claim to be useful for depression and/or anxiety, yet caution is warranted before using most due to limited research on effectiveness, low retention rates, and other issues like safety concerns.

In this paper, based on data collected in Portugal, we will analyze the consciousness of both health and environmental injustices and test one hypothesis for this social blindness. The results show, even more clearly than before, that public opinion tends to see rich and poor people as being equally susceptible to health and environmental events. Furthermore, those who have this equal view of the world present lower levels of depression and anxiety.

This study examined therapists' practice of assigning and reviewing action recommendations in therapy sessions, and how it correlates with patients' depression and anxiety outcomes. We analyzed 2,444 therapy sessions from community-based behavioral health programs. Machine learning models and natural language processing techniques were deployed to discern action recommendations and their subsequent reviews. The extent of the review was quantified by measuring the proportion of session dialogues reviewing action recommendations, a metric we refer to as \"review percentage\". Using Generalized Estimating Equations modeling, we evaluated the correlation between this metric and changes in clients' depression and anxiety scores. Our models achieved 76% precision in capturing action recommendations and 71.1% in reviewing them. Using these models, we found that therapists typically provided clients with one to eight action recommendations per session to engage in outside therapy. However, only half of the sessions included a review of previously assigned action recommendations. We identified a significant interaction between the initial depression score and the review percentage (p = 0.045). When adjusting for this relationship, the review percentage was positively and significantly associated with a reduction in depression score (p = 0.032). This suggests that more frequent review of action recommendations in therapy relates to greater improvement in depression symptoms. Further analyses highlighted this association for mild depression (p = 0.024), but not for anxiety or moderate to severe depression. An observed positive association exists between therapists' review of previous sessions' action recommendations and improved treatment outcomes among clients with mild depression, highlighting the possible advantages of consistently revisiting therapeutic homework in real-world therapy settings.

Clinical data including disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale: EDSS) and depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale: HADS-D) were recorded at 0, 2 and 6months post-relapse. Prevalence of possible depression (HADS-D score of≥8) was 44.5% during relapse, reducing to 29.2% at 2months and 34.4% at 6months post-relapse. HADS-D scores were significantly lower at follow-up than during relapse.

However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240764/"}

The present observational study seeks to describe the use of a proprietary precision prescribing algorithm piloted during routine clinical practice as part of Brightside's telepsychiatry services. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this intervention. Secondary aims include exploring remission and symptom improvement rates. Participants were adult patients enrolled in Brightside who completed at least 12 weeks of treatment for depression and/or anxiety and received a prescription for at least one psychiatric medication. A prescription recommendation was made by Brightside's algorithm at treatment onset and was utilized for clinical decision support. Participants received baseline screening surveys of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, and at weeks 2,4,6,8,10 and 12. Intent-to-treat (ITT) sensitivity analyses were conducted. Feasibility of the implementation was measured by the platform's ability to enroll and engage participants in timely psychiatric care, as well as offer high touch-point treatment options. Acceptability was measured by patient responses to a 5-star satisfaction rating. Brightside accessed and treated 6248 patients from October 2018 to April 2021, treating a majority of patients within 4-days of enrollment. The average plan cost was $115/month. 89% of participants utilized Brightside's core medication plan at a cost of $95/month. 13.4% of patients in the study rated Brightside's services as highly satisfactory, averaging a 4.6-star rating. Furthermore, 90% of 6248 patients experienced a MCID in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score. Remission rates were 75% (final PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score < 10) for the study sample and 59% for the ITT sample. 69.3% of Brightside patients were treated with the medication initially prescribed at intake. Results suggest that the present intervention may be feasible and acceptable within the assessed population. Exploratory analyses suggest that Brightside's course of treatment, guided by precision recommendations, improved patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35854281/"}

This study compared two commonly used scales, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), in relation to their measurement range and cut points to consider the relative prevalence of both constructs, and if prevalence rates may be due to scale-specific case definition. Patients meeting the criteria for RA were recruited in Leeds, UK and Sydney, Australia and asked to complete a survey that included both scales. The data was analysed using the Rasch measurement model. A total of 169 RA patients were assessed, with a repeat subsample, resulting in 323 cases for analysis. Both scales met Rasch model expectations. Using the 'possible+probable' cut point from the HADS, 58.3% had neither anxiety nor depression; 13.5% had anxiety only; 6.4% depression only and 21.8% had both 'possible+probable' anxiety and depression. Cut points for depression were comparable across the two scales while a lower cut point for anxiety in the DASS was required to equate prevalence. This study provides further support for high prevalence of depression and anxiety in RA. It also shows that while these two scales provide a good indication of possible depression and anxiety, the estimates of prevalence so derived could vary, particularly for anxiety. These findings are discussed in terms of comparisons across studies and selection of scales for clinical use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22269280/"}

A sample of German cardiac patients (n = 2,696) and a sample of the German general population (n = 2,037) were tested using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). While we confirmed a linear age trend of anxiety and depression in the general population, we observed an inverted U-shaped age dependency in the patient sample. Young patients are especially affected by anxiety and depression. Five items of the HADS that mainly contributed to the age differences were identified. Formal characteristics of these 5 items could not explain the age differences. Concerning the meaning of the items, however, most of the items refer to worrying about the future. The relatively low rates of anxiety and depression in older patients (compared with the general population) indicate that adaptation processes took place, which should be taken into account in studies concerning the psychological status of patients.

A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis were conducted, including studies found in Medline, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and through reference lists and reverse citations. Twenty-five eligible studies including 11,091 patients measured early response and examined associations with posttreatment outcomes.

A large pooled effect size (g = 0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.10], p < .0001) indicated that early responders had significantly better posttreatment outcomes compared to cases without early response, and this effect was larger in anxiety (g = 1.37) compared to depression (g = 0.76) measures. Most studies were of good quality and there was no evidence of publication bias. The main limitations concerned insufficient statistical reporting in some studies, which precluded their inclusion in meta-analysis, and it was not possible to examine effect sizes according to different outcome questionnaires.

Using baseline data from the Project STRIDE: Stress, Identity, and Mental Health study, we examined the health effects of discrimination among individuals who self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. We used logistic and linear regression to assess whether multifactorial discrimination met the four criteria designating a fundamental cause, namely that the cause: 1) influences multiple health outcomes, 2) affects multiple risk factors, 3) involves access to resources that can be leveraged to reduce consequences of disease, and 4) reproduces itself in varied contexts through changing mechanisms. Multifactorial discrimination predicted high depression scores, psychological well-being, and substance use disorder diagnosis. Discrimination was positively associated with risk factors for high depression scores: chronic strain and total number of stressful life events. Discrimination was associated with significantly lower levels of mastery and self-esteem, protective factors for depressive symptomatology. Even after controlling for risk factors, discrimination remained a significant predictor for high depression scores. Among subjects with low depression scores, multifactorial discrimination also predicted anxiety and aggregate mental health scores. Multifactorial discrimination should be considered a fundamental cause of mental health inequities and may be an important cause of broad health disparities among populations with intersecting social identities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257630/"}

Antidepressant prescriptions are very common in general practice, but are often not in line with recommendations. The recent introduction of mental health nurses may have decreased antidepressant prescriptions, as general practitioners (GPs) have greater potential to offer psychological treatment as a first choice option instead of medication. Anonymised data from the medical records of general practices participating in the NIVEL Primary Care Database in 2011-2015 were analysed in an observational study. We used multilevel logistic regression analyses to determine whether total antidepressant prescriptions and antidepressants prescribed within one week of diagnosing anxiety or depression decreased in the period 2011-2015. We analysed whether changes in antidepressant prescriptions were associated with the employment or consultation of mental health nurses. Antidepressants were prescribed in 30.3% of all anxiety or depression episodes; about half were prescribed within the first week. Antidepressants prescriptions for anxiety or depression increased slightly in the period 2011-2015. The employment of mental health nurses was not associated with a decreased number of prescriptions of antidepressants. Patients who had at least one mental health nurse consultation had fewer immediate prescriptions of antidepressants, but not fewer antidepressants in general.

Specifically, maternal involvement, combined synergistically with peer support and problematic behaviors, as well as paternal involvement, together with peer support and anxiety, significantly affects depressive outcomes. Additionally, anxiety and strong peer relationships independently have a substantial impact on these outcomes. Effective mitigation strategies involve active parental engagement and robust peer support, reducing the influence of risk factors such as problematic behaviors and anxiety.

Of adolescents with anxiety and/or depression at T1, only 25% recovered or were non-symptomatic 3 years after referral to a psychiatric clinic. Homotypic continuity was observed for anxiety disorders in general (OR = 2.33), for phobic anxiety disorders (OR = 7.45), and for depressive disorders (OR = 2.15). For heterotypic continuity, depression predicted later anxiety (OR = 1.92), more specifically social anxiety (OR = 2.14) and phobic anxiety disorders (OR = 1.83). In addition, social anxiety predicted later generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 3.11). Heterotypic continuity was thus more common than homotypic continuity. For adolescents presenting with anxiety or depression, treatment should, therefore, target broad internalizing symptom clusters, rather than individual diagnoses.

One of these developments is the reworking of the concept of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from that of a residual category (anxiety after all other anxiety disorders are removed) to a generalized anxiety syndrome that includes symptoms of mild depression that are less severe than the symptoms of anxiety. GAD is thereby expanded to a broader concept, namely mixed anxiety/depression (MAD). A second major development, however, posits a different definition of MAD: a stable core of subsyndromal symptoms that do not reach the threshold for the diagnosis of GAD or depression, but which, under stress, will decompensate to an overt anxiety disorder or depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8425874/"}

We assessed whether males and females differed on measures of major depression and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 the pandemic, and if so, which sociodemographic, pandemic, and psychological variables may affect sex differences in depression and anxiety. Participants were a nationally representative sample of Irish adults (N = 1,032) assessed between April 30<sup>th</sup> to May 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020, during Ireland's first COVID-19 nationwide quarantine. Participants completed self-report measures of anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9), as well as 23 sociodemographic pandemic-related, and psychological variables. Sex differences on measures of depression and anxiety were assessed using binary logistic regression analysis and differences in sociodemographic, pandemic, and psychological variables assessed using chi-square tests of independence and independent samples t-tests. Females were significantly more likely than males to screen positive for major depressive disorder (30.6% vs. 20.7%; χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 13.26, p < .001, OR = 1.69 [95% CI = 1.27, 2.25]), and generalised anxiety disorder (23.3% vs. 14.4%; χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 13.42, p < .001, OR = 1.81 [95% CI = 1.31, 2.49]). When adjusted for all other sex-varying covariates however, sex was no longer significantly associated with screening positive for depression (AOR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.51, 1.25) or GAD (AOR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.60, 1.57). Observed sex-differences in depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland are best explained by psychosocial factors of COVID-19 related anxiety, trait neuroticism, lower sleep quality, higher levels of loneliness, greater somatic problems, and, in the case of depression, increases in childcaring responsibilities and lower trait consciousnesses.

The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were used. A three-factor confirmatory factor analysis is reported which identified a) mood and social-cognitive symptoms of depression, b) worrying symptoms, and c) somatic and information-processing symptoms as distinct yet closely related constructs. Subsequent bifactor modelling supported a general distress factor which accounted for the communality of the depression and anxiety items. Specific factors for hopelessness-suicidal thoughts and restlessness-fatigue indicated distinct psychopathological constructs which account for unique information over and above the general distress factor. The general distress factor and the hopelessness-suicidal factor were more severe in females but the restlessness-fatigue factor worse in males. Measurement precision of the general distress factor was higher and spanned a wider range of the population than any of the three first-order factors. The general distress factor provides the most reliable target for epidemiological analysis but specific factors may help to refine valid phenotype dimensions for aetiological research and assist in prognostic modelling of future psychiatric episodes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22151586/"}

The database was linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Depression and anxiety were assessed with validated questionnaires five times from the second trimester to 36 months after delivery. Blood was drawn for analysis of antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations. Women with epilepsy more often had peripartum depression (26.7%) or anxiety (22.4%) than women without epilepsy (18.9% and 14.8%, respectively, p<0.001 for both comparisons) and women with other chronic diseases (23.1% and 18.4%, respectively, p=0.03 and 0.01). Women using AEDs during pregnancy were especially at risk regardless of AED type. The risk further increased with the use of multiple AEDs and with high doses and/or plasma levels. Risk factors associated with peripartum depression and/or anxiety in the epilepsy cohort were high seizure frequency, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, adverse socioeconomic factors, previous loss of a child, AED use, unplanned pregnancy, and prepregnancy depression and/or anxiety. The recovery rate 3 years after delivery was lower for women with epilepsy with a history of depression/anxiety or physical/sexual abuse than for women without epilepsy. Depressed women with epilepsy were less frequently treated with antidepressive drugs during pregnancy than women without epilepsy. Women with epilepsy frequently have depression and anxiety during and after pregnancy.

Identifying the impact of risk factors on this comorbidity is essential for guiding early interventions. Data from 4563 young participants in the Growing Up in New Zealand (GUiNZ) longitudinal study were analysed to identify risk factors associated with comorbid depression and anxiety. Scores for depression and anxiety symptoms were converted into binary variables using the cut-off of 10 and 60, respectively, and then combined to create the comorbidity outcome. A Cumulative Risk (CR) score was used to measure the impact of multiple risk factors from prenatal to childhood on the likelihood of this comorbidity. CR scores were further grouped into three levels of risk, and their association with comorbidity was examined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of comorbidity at age 12 years was 8.9% (406/4563). Among young people, 14.2% (647/ 4563) had no risk factors, 64.7% (2953/4563) had one to three (low CR score level), and 21.1% (963/4563) had four or more risk factors (high CR score level). In the adjusted analyses, young people in the low and high CR levels had 2.6 times and 4.6 times higher odds, respectively, of experiencing comorbidity compared to those with no risk factors. The risk of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms increases with the number of risk factors experienced from prenatal to childhood.

Changes in outcome variables were assessed using covariance analysis with repeated measures (ANCOVA) with sociodemographic variables (propensity score method), therapy dose, setting and symptom severity as covariates. The PSIW and PSOC groups included 122 and 66 men respectively. There were 102 first-time users of mental healthcare in the PSIW group and 83 in the PSOC group. There were group differences in outcome variables at baseline (p < 0.05); PSIW patients were less impaired overall. There were no group difference in sociodemographic variables, number of sessions within the offer or symptom severity. There was no main effect of group on outcome variables and no group*time interaction. Work-related stress indicators did not change during the intervention, but work ability improved in both groups (F = 10.149, p = 0.002; baseline M = 27.2, SD = 8.85); follow-up M = 28.6, SD = 9.02), as did perceived mental health (SF-12 MCS), depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (PHQ-7).

Over recent years, the number of refugees has been increasing, and there are questions on how many of them need mental health care and which type of interventions are beneficial. Meta-analyses showed highly variable rates of mental disorders in adult refugees. This variability is likely to reflect both real differences between groups and contexts, and methodological inconsistencies across studies. Overall prevalence rates after resettlement are similar to those in host populations. Only post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent in refugees. In long-term resettled refugees, rates of anxiety and depressive disorders are higher and linked to poor social integration. Research on mental health care for refugees in high-income countries has been extensive, but often of limited methodological quality and with very context-specific findings. The existing evidence suggests several general principles of good practice: promoting social integration, overcoming barriers to care, facilitating engagement with treatment and, when required, providing specific psychological treatments to deal with traumatic memories. With respect to the treatment of defined disorders, only for the treatment of PTSD there has been substantial refugee-specific research. For other diagnostic categories, the same treatment guidelines apply as to other groups. More systematic research is required to explore how precisely the general principles can be specified and implemented for different groups of refugees and in different societal contexts in host countries, and which specific interventions are beneficial and cost-effective. Such interventions may utilise new communication technologies. Of particular importance are long-term studies to identify when mental health interventions are appropriate and to assess outcomes over several years.

Twenty-nine studies met criteria for inclusion in our analysis of family, school, and community variables as moderators. Dependent variables included internalizing (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder) and externalizing symptoms (e.g., aggression, substance use). Effect sizes for the interactions of exposure to violence and potential moderators were summarized by their patterns of protective processes. The majority of studies in the literature examined family characteristics as moderators of the exposure to violence-symptom relationship, rather than school- or community-level factors. Our results indicated more consistent patterns for (a) close family relationships and social support for internalizing symptoms and (b) close family relationships for externalizing symptoms. Overall, the most common type of protective pattern was protective-stabilizing, in which youth with higher levels of the environmental attribute demonstrate relative stability in mental health despite exposure to violence. We found no consistent evidence that parental monitoring-a dimension inversely associated with exposure to violence in prior studies-moderated the relationship between exposure to violence and symptoms. The study emphasizes the importance of strengthening family support for young people's exposure to community violence; more research is needed to provide a solid evidence base for the role of school and community-level protective factors for youth exposed to violence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26114611/"}

Data were collected across pregnancy (first and third trimesters) and the postpartum (six and 12 months) for 258 women drawn from an Australian pregnancy cohort, the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study (MPEWS). The women were assessed for depression using the EPDS, anxiety using the STAI and a clinical diagnostic interview (SCID-IV), and self-reported use of antidepressants. Exercise was measured using self-reported weekly frequency of 30-min bouts of moderate to vigorous exercise, and data were analyzed using parallel process growth curve modelling. On average, women's weekly exercise frequency declined during pregnancy, returning to first trimester levels by 12 months postpartum. Women with depression and taking antidepressants reported lower first trimester exercise compared to control women. However, where non-medicated depressed women remained lower and continued to decline to 12 months, women taking antidepressants reported increasing levels of exercise during the perinatal period.

The final programme consists of four steps: 1) watchful waiting, 2) guided self-help, 3) problem solving treatment, 4) referral to general practitioner. The (cost-)effectiveness of this programme is evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Patients (N = 230) are randomly assigned to either a treatment group (stepped-care) or a control group (usual care). The primary outcome is the incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders, measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Preventive interventions for depression and anxiety have received little attention in the field of low vision. A stepped-care programme that focuses on both depression and anxiety has never been investigated in visually impaired older adults before. If the intervention is shown to be effective, this study will result in an evidence based treatment programme to prevent depression or anxiety in patients from low vision rehabilitation organisations.

A group of 325 nulliparas in the third trimester of pregnancy were enrolled at the Childbirth preparation program of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana's Division of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. The following instruments were applied: Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised, The Edinburgh Depression Scale, two aspects of anxiety - Zung Anxiety Scale and a questionnaire regarding fear of childbirth. Attachment anxiety and avoidance scales were recoded into four categories of a prototypical attachment style: secure, fearful, preoccupied and dismissive. Two-way ANOVA and the chi-square test were used for the statistical analysis. All indicators of mental health functioning of our sample of nulliparas differed significantly regarding their partner attachment style. Nulliparas with a fearful, but also with a preoccupied type of attachment, showed less optimal mental health indicators compared to those with a secure/dismissive type of attachment. A significant interactive effect of partner attachment and emotional support from the older generation was found on the level of depression. Partner attachment styles and emotional support from the older generation were found to be statistically dependent. In our sample a secure attachment seems to represent a protective buffer for the level of depression, even when a lower emotional support of the older generation was included.

Brief computerized interventions, including elements of psychoeducation, interoceptive exposure, and cognitive bias modification (CBM) can reduce anxiety and depression through AS reductions. These interventions are not equally efficacious for all who receive them, suggesting the need to explore moderators. Attentional control (AC), the ability to regulate attentional processes by focusing and shifting attention as needed, has been linked to AS, anxiety, and depression suggesting that it may moderate treatment efficacy. The moderating effects of self-report and neurophysiological (i.e., theta/beta ratio, occipital alpha power) indices associated with AC processes on a brief AS-focused intervention were examined. Participants (<i>M</i> age = 36.43, <i>SD</i> = 16.47; 57.5% female) were randomized to cognitive AS treatment (<i>n</i> = 67) or a repeated contact control (<i>n</i> = 60). Occipital alpha power moderated the rate of change in AS across three weekly treatment sessions as well as the effects of the intervention on anxiety and depression symptoms at the 1-month follow-up. Lower alpha power was associated with a swifter reduction in AS symptoms and marginally lower levels of anxiety and depression at follow-up. AC indices were not correlated with each other. These findings present a novel hypothesis that lower AC as indexed by occipital alpha power might increase treatment gains in the context of a brief transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety and depression.

We assessed depressive symptoms cross-sectionally in 393 participants with moderate-severe TBI (range 0.4-35.4 years post-injury; M = 12.6) using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms - Expanded Version (IDAS-II).

We quantified depression heterogeneity across 16 specific symptoms and explored associations between each symptom and personal, injury-related, treatment, and functional/psychosocial outcome factors. 28 % of participants self-reported a current depression diagnosis, and 35 % met DSM-5 symptom criteria for MDD. Depressed participants (according to either self-reported diagnosis or MDD symptom criteria) were more likely to endorse each specific depressive symptom, including those that overlap with TBI. Post-TBI depression was highly heterogeneous, with 84-91 % of depressed participants (depending on classification method) showing a unique symptom profile not shared with any other individual. The most common symptom profile was shared by only three individuals. This heterogeneity was meaningful, as specific depressive symptoms had distinct associations with personal, injury-related, treatment, and outcome factors. Cross-sectional design. We only analyzed DSM-5 MDD symptoms, and some symptoms were assessed using only one item.

{"id": "35578885", "title": "An Insight through Various Models being used for Assessment of Depression and its Management at Primary Level in Current Scenario.", "text": "The main aim of present study to assess depression and various neurotransmitters involved in it with their evaluating models. Depression is a common ailment that can be recurrent or even become chronic. According to the National Service Framework for Mental Health (released in 1999 by the Department of Health), people with depression should continue to be treated primarily in primary care settings. Despite mounting evidence that general practitioners could do a better job of detecting and treating depression, little research has been done on the perspectives of general practitioners who treat patients who are depressed. Depression (major depressive disorder) is a widespread and significant medical condition that has a negative impact on feeling, thinking, and behaviour. The primary goal of this study was to gather data on depression, as well as to discuss several methods for evaluating antidepressant drug response based on physical activities and neurotransmitters. Antidepressant activity of various medications can be tested using two different types of studies, including in vivo and in vitro, according to the review. Depression is characterized by a persistent sense of sadness, insomnia, lack of concentration, slowness in activity, restlessness, social isolation and a loss of interest that prevents you from doing normal things. There are several types of depression, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Depression is caused by a combination of factors and conditions, rather than a single factor. Major depression is a mental condition marked by feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, decreased activity, sadness and mood swings, which seriously disrupt and negatively affect a person's life, sometimes, leading to suicidal thoughts. The quest for a better understanding of the causes of depression and the development of more effective treatments is critical. According to clinical and preclinical research, stress appears to be a crucial mediator in the pathophysiology of depression. Using experimental models, depression may be assessed based on several physical parameters such as locomotor activity, rearing, defecation, and the number of centre square entries (in vivo and in vitro). Biological parameters may also be used to locate it. Unhappiness and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities are the symptoms of depression. It can cause emotional and physical problems, as well as a decrease in the ability to function together at work and at home. Finally it has been concluded that various neurotransmitters are involved in depression at the synaptic cleft which can be controlled using various synthetic and herbal drugs through in vitro and in vivo evaluating models.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35578885/"}

Path analyses revealed that anxious attachment style in adulthood in part explained the relationship between childhood neglect and physical abuse to depression, anxiety, and self-esteem, but not the relationship to allostatic load.

As part of the ongoing Hong Kong Epidemiological Study of Mental Health (HK-YES) project, the current study analysed data from 1,144 participants who provided complete data on ideal-actual selfdiscrepancy, psychiatric conditions, resilience level and recent stressful life events (SLEs). Ideal-actual self-discrepancies were associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as odds of 12-month major depressive episodes (MDEs) and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). All these associations became nonsignificant after adjusting for resilience. Separate models found resilience mediating rather than moderating the relationship. According to four-way decomposition, the pure indirect effect explained most of the total effects of self-discrepancy on mental health conditions. The mediation effects on symptom severity were recently revealed to be more prominent among individuals with substantial exposure to SLE.

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of large-scale implementation of universal screening for depression in pregnancy and during the postpartum period with the use of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted from July 2010 to June 2014 at a large academic medical center. Pregnant women were screened at 24-28 weeks gestation and again 6 weeks postpartum. An Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of ≥12 was the cutoff for referral to mental health services for diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Among 8985 women who were enrolled in prenatal care at the participating sites, 8840 women (98%) were screened for depression antepartum, and 7780 women (86%) were screened postpartum. A total of 576 women (6.5%) screened positive for probable depression; of these, 69% screened positive antepartum, and 31% screened positive postpartum (P < .01). All women who screened positive were referred for an evaluation by a mental health professional; 79% of the women were evaluated, which was more common antepartum than postpartum (83% vs 71%; P < .01). One hundred twenty-one women (21%) were not evaluated further after a positive screen; primary reasons included declining a mental health evaluation (30%) or transferring obstetric care (12%). Among women who underwent a mental health evaluation, 67% were diagnosed with major depression; 37% were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder; 28% were diagnosed concurrently with major depression and an anxiety disorder; 76% were diagnosed with either depression or anxiety, and 35% were treated with an antidepressant medication, which was more frequent during the postpartum period than during the antepartum period (54% vs 28%; P < .001). After adjustment for maternal age, parity, race, and household income, women who screened positive antepartum were significantly more likely to link to mental health services compared with women who screened positive postpartum (adjusted odds ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.24-3.24; P = .001). This study demonstrates the feasibility of universal depression screening during both the antepartum and postpartum periods with the use of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale as an initial screen followed by mental health referral for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. The population of women who screened positive and who accepted additional services differed at the 2 time points, which reinforces the utility of screening during both the antepartum and postpartum periods. Although universal screening for depression is feasible, further study of the barriers to mental health evaluation and treatment and the impact of treatment on obstetric outcomes are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27210067/"}

A cross-sectional telephone survey (n = 1201) of a randomly selected sample of adults in each State and Territory of Australia, conducted in late 2009. Depression was the most frequently cited general health problem for women after childbirth (43.6% of spontaneous responses), in contrast to previous findings of low awareness of depression generally. A total of 94% of adults believed that postnatal depression requires specialized treatment. Older Australians (55 + years) identified postnatal depression less readily than younger Australians. Although well recognized as a specific mental health issue, as a general health issue antenatal depression had low recognition and was viewed by 52% of respondents as 'normal'. Community beliefs about perinatal rates of depression appeared realistic. Men and women differed in their knowledge and beliefs about the symptoms and causes of postnatal depression. Difficulty in mother-infant bonding was seen as a common sign of postnatal depression, particularly by women. Most commonly, postnatal depression was perceived as having a biological rather than psychosocial etiology (30% of men, 41% of women). Recognition of anxiety in the postnatal period was relatively low, although higher among those with mental health training. Over 80% of Australians believed that all new mothers should be routinely assessed for depression. Awareness of postnatal depression appeared to be at a high level in the community, but both anxiety and antenatal depression were comparatively under-recognized, suggesting there is considerable scope for awareness-raising. Established risk factors for postnatal depression were not coherently recognized. Ongoing tracking of perinatal mental health literacy in Australia is likely to be valuable in assessing the impact of future public awareness efforts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21438748/"}

Several types of endogenous depression were identified: 1) hysterical depression with hysterical-conversions, and also the phenomena of delusional fantasies; 2) dysmorphic depression with predominance of over-valued ideas of physical disability, self-inferiority and eating disorder; 3) depersonalization depression with depersonalization-derealization symptoms; 4) psychopath-like depression with exaggerated behavior, opposition and impulsivity; 5) existential depression with a feeling of losing the life meaning and often pessimistic worldview; 6) psychasthenic depression with the low self-esteem and exaggerated introspection combined with obsessive-phobic disorder; 7) anxious-melancholic depression with anxiety, melancholy and ideas of self-accusation and self-inferiority; 8) depression with symptoms of adolescent asthenic insolvency with difficulties of understanding information, increasing intellectual exhaustion. We revealed differences in motives for committing non-suicidal self-harm behavior and suicidal behavior in typological variants of depressions. Hysteroform and psychopathic depressions prevail in personality disorders, while psychosthenic-like, anxious-melancholic and existential depressions are more frequent in affective disorders.

Given high comorbidity among mental health problems and implementation challenges with scaling up multiple structured evidence-based treatments (EBTs), a transdiagnostic treatment could provide an additional option for approaching community-based treatment of mental health problems. Our objective was to test such an approach specifically designed for flexible treatments of varying and comorbid disorders among trauma survivors in a low-resource setting. We conducted a single-blinded, wait-list randomized controlled trial of a newly developed transdiagnostic psychotherapy, Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), for low-resource settings, compared with wait-list control (WLC). CETA was delivered by lay workers to Burmese survivors of imprisonment, torture, and related traumas, with flexibility based on client presentation. Eligible participants reported trauma exposure and met severity criteria for depression and/or posttraumatic stress (PTS). Participants were randomly assigned to CETA (n = 182) or WLC (n = 165). Outcomes were assessed by interviewers blinded to participant allocation using locally adapted standard measures of depression and PTS (primary outcomes) and functional impairment, anxiety symptoms, aggression, and alcohol use (secondary outcomes). Primary analysis was intent-to-treat (n = 347), including 73 participants lost to follow-up. CETA participants experienced significantly greater reductions of baseline symptoms across all outcomes with the exception of alcohol use (alcohol use analysis was confined to problem drinkers). The difference in mean change from pre-intervention to post-intervention between intervention and control groups was -0.49 (95% CI: -0.59, -0.40) for depression, -0.43 (95% CI: -0.51, -0.35) for PTS, -0.42 (95% CI: -0.58, -0.27) for functional impairment, -0.48 (95% CI: -0.61, -0.34) for anxiety, -0.24 (95% CI: -0.34, -0.15) for aggression, and -0.03 (95% CI: -0.44, 0.50) for alcohol use. This corresponds to a 77% reduction in mean baseline depression score among CETA participants compared to a 40% reduction among controls, with respective values for the other outcomes of 76% and 41% for anxiety, 75% and 37% for PTS, 67% and 22% for functional impairment, and 71% and 32% for aggression. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large for depression (d = 1.16) and PTS (d = 1.19); moderate for impaired function (d = 0.63), anxiety (d = 0.79), and aggression (d = 0.58); and none for alcohol use. There were no adverse events. Limitations of the study include the lack of long-term follow-up, non-blinding of service providers and participants, and no placebo or active comparison intervention. CETA provided by lay counselors was highly effective across disorders among trauma survivors compared to WLCs.

This theoretical review paper addresses the ubiquity of comorbidity among internalizing disorders. Our central thesis is that progress in understanding this co-occurrence can be made by employing latent dimensional structural models that organize psychopathology as well as vulnerabilities and risk mechanisms and by connecting the multiple levels of risk and psychopathology outcomes together. Different vulnerabilities and risk mechanisms are hypothesized to predict different levels of the structural model of psychopathology. We review the present state of knowledge based on concurrent and developmental sequential comorbidity patterns among common discrete psychiatric disorders in youth, and then we advocate for the use of more recent bifactor dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., p factor; Caspi et al., 2014) that can help to explain the co-occurrence among internalizing symptoms. In support of this relatively novel conceptual perspective, we review six exemplar vulnerabilities and risk mechanisms, including executive function, information processing biases, cognitive vulnerabilities, positive and negative affectivity aspects of temperament, and autonomic dysregulation, along with the developmental occurrence of stressors in different domains, to show how these vulnerabilities can predict the general latent psychopathology factor, a unique latent internalizing dimension, as well as specific symptom syndrome manifestations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27739389/"}

One possibility is that they predispose one another. An informative way to examine interactions between disorders without the confounds present in patient populations is to manipulate the psychological processes thought to underlie the pathological states in healthy individuals. In this study we therefore asked whether a model of the sad mood in depression can enhance psychophysiological responses (startle) to a model of the anxiety in ADs. We predicted that sad mood would increase anxious anxiety-potentiated startle responses. In a between-subjects design, participants (n=36) completed either a sad mood induction procedure (MIP; n=18) or a neutral MIP (n=18). Startle responses were assessed during short-duration predictable electric shock conditions (fear-potentiated startle) or long-duration unpredictable threat of shock conditions (anxiety-potentiated startle). Induced sadness enhanced anxiety- but not fear-potentiated startle. This study provides support for the hypothesis that sadness can increase anxious responding measured by the affective startle response. This, taken together with prior evidence that ADs can contribute to depression, provides initial experimental support for the proposition that ADs and depression are frequently co-morbid because they may be mutually reinforcing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22088577/"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces on anxiety and depression and intake of related medication. Additionally, we aimed to explore potential mediators and effect modifiers of this association. The study was based on an existing adult cohort (ALFA - Alzheimer and Families) and includes 958 adult participants from Barcelona recruited in 2013-2014. For each participant residential green and blue exposure indicators [surrounding greenness (NDVI), amount of green (land-cover) and access to major green spaces and blue spaces] were generated for different buffers (100m, 300m and 500m). Participants reported their history of doctor-diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders and intake of related medication. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the corresponding associations. Increasing surrounding greenness was associated with reduced odds of self-reported history of benzodiazepines [e.g. Odds ratio - OR (95%CI) = 0.62 (0.43, 0.89) for 1-interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI in a 300m buffer] and access to major green spaces was associated with self-reported history of depression [OR (95%CI) = 0.18 (0.06, 0.58)]. No statistically significant associations were observed with blue spaces. Air pollution (between 0.8% and 29.6%) and noise (between 2.2% and 5.3%) mediated a proportion of the associations observed, whereas physical activity and social support played a minor role. Our findings suggest a potential protective role of green spaces on mental health (depression and anxiety) in adults, but further studies, especially longitudinal studies, are needed to provide further evidence of these benefits and of the mediation role of exposures like air pollution and noise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29358115/"}

This study aims to estimate the screening prevalence and associated factors of subthreshold depressive symptoms among Chinese residents enrolled in the cohort study using a mobile app-based integrated mental health care model and investigate the 12-month incidence rate and related factors of major depressive disorder (MDD) among those with subthreshold depressive symptoms. Data were drawn from the Depression Cohort in China (DCC) study. A total of 4243 community residents aged 18 to 64 years living in Nanshan district, Shenzhen city, in Guangdong province, China, were encouraged to participate in the DCC study when visiting the participating primary health care centers, and 4066 (95.83%) residents who met the DCC study criteria were screened for subthreshold depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at baseline. Of the 4066 screened residents, 3168 (77.91%) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were referred to hospitals to receive a psychiatric diagnosis of MDD within 12 months. Sleep duration, anxiety symptoms, well-being, insomnia symptoms, and resilience were also investigated. The diagnosis of MDD was provided by trained psychiatrists using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to explore the potential factors related to subthreshold depressive symptoms at baseline, and Cox proportional hazards models were performed to explore the potential factors related to incident MDD. Anxiety symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.42-1.87) and insomnia symptoms (AOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.22) were associated with an increased risk of subthreshold depressive symptoms, whereas well-being (AOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99) was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. During the follow-up period, the 12-month incidence rate of MDD among participants with subthreshold depressive symptoms was 5.97% (189/3168). After incorporating all significant variables from the univariate analyses, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model reported that a history of comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.04-2.14) and anxiety symptoms (AHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.17) were independently associated with an increased risk of incident MDD. The 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index was associated with a decreased risk of incident MDD (AHR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.94). Elevated anxiety symptoms and unfavorable general well-being were significantly associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms and incident MDD among Chinese residents in Shenzhen.

Surprisingly, traumatic events in the past were not central in refugees' anxiety networks. Core symptoms of nosological systems seem to be differently pronounced in refugees and residents, which has important implications for our understanding of mental health symptoms in refugees.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32808440/"}

In order to address this global phenomenon, intensive studies have been carried out leading to the advancement of drugs like anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and analgesics which although help in combating the symptoms of such disorders but also create long-term side effects. Thus, as an alternative to such clinical practices, various complementary therapies such as yoga and meditation have been proved to be effective in alleviating the causes and symptoms of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of altered brain waves in this context has been recognized and needs to be pursued at the highest level. Thus, the current study provides a review focused on describing the effects of yoga and meditation on anxiety and depression as well as exploring brain waves as a tool for assessing the potential of these complementary therapies for such disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32985243/"}

The purpose of the current study was to investigate associations between specific facets of mindfulness (e.g., observing, describing, nonjudging, acting with awareness, and nonreactivity) and dimensions of anxiety and depression symptoms (e.g., anxious arousal, general distress-anxiety, general distress-depression, and anhedonic depression) while controlling for shared variance among variables. Participants were 187 treatment-seeking adults. Mindfulness was measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Bivariate correlations showed that all facets of mindfulness were significantly related to all dimensions of anxiety and depression, with two exceptions: describing was unrelated to general distress-anxiety, and observing was unrelated to all symptom clusters. Path analysis was used to simultaneously examine associations between mindfulness facets and depression and anxiety symptoms. Significant and marginally significant pathways were retained to construct a more parsimonious model and model fit indices were examined. The parsimonious model indicated that nonreactivity was significantly inversely associated with general distress anxiety symptoms. Describing was significantly inversely associated with anxious arousal, while observing was significantly positively associated with it. Nonjudging and nonreactivity were significantly inversely related to general distress-depression and anhedonic depression symptomatology. Acting with awareness was not significantly associated with any dimensions of anxiety or depression. Findings support associations between specific facets of mindfulness and dimensions of anxiety and depression and highlight the potential utility of targeting these specific aspects of mindfulness in interventions for anxiety and mood disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23768665/"}

We evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (treatment aim); and improving a sense of hope and functioning (preventive aim). We conducted a cluster randomized trial with 329 children in war-affected Burundi (aged 8 to 17 (mean 12.29 years, standard deviation 1.61); 48% girls). One group of children (n = 153) participated in a 15-session school-based intervention implemented by para-professionals, and the remaining 176 children formed a waitlist control condition. Outcomes were measured before, one week after, and three months after the intervention. No main effects of the intervention were identified. However, longitudinal growth curve analyses showed six favorable and two unfavorable differences in trajectories between study conditions in interaction with several moderators. Children in the intervention condition living in larger households showed decreases on depressive symptoms and function impairment, and those living with both parents showed decreases on posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. The groups of children in the waitlist condition showed increases in depressive symptoms. In addition, younger children and those with low levels of exposure to traumatic events in the intervention condition showed improvements on hope. Children in the waitlist condition who lived on their original or newly bought land showed improvements in hope and function impairment, whereas children in the intervention condition showed deterioration on these outcomes. Given inconsistent effects across studies, findings do not support this school-based intervention as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms in conflict-affected children. The intervention appears to have more consistent preventive benefits, but these effects are contingent upon individual (for example, age, gender) and contextual (for example, family functioning, state of conflict, displacement) variables. Results suggest the potential benefit of school-based preventive interventions particularly in post-conflict settings.

The objective of this study was to develop a prediction model for the presence of anxiety and/or depression in older dizzy patients in primary care. We performed a cross-sectional study among 415 older patients consulting their primary care physician for persistent dizziness. Participants underwent a standardized, comprehensive evaluation and completed self-administered questionnaires regarding anxiety and depression (PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]) and dizziness-related disability (Dizziness Handicap Inventory). To determine the diagnostic indicators of anxiety and/or depression, we used multiple logistic regression analysis with ''presence of Panic Disorder, Other Anxiety Disorder, or Major Depressive Disorder'' as dependent variable. Potential diagnostic indicators included dizziness-related disability, patient characteristics (age, sex, history of anxiety, and history of depression), and dizziness characteristics (description of dizziness, provoking circumstances, associated symptoms, onset, frequency, duration, and avoidance of activities because of dizziness). According to the PHQ, an anxiety and/or depressive disorder was present in 90 patients (22%), of whom 35 reported no medical history of anxiety or depression, nor current pharmacological treatment for these disorders. In the final model, dizziness-related disability, a history of depression, and accompanying fear were associated with an increased odd of anxiety and/or depression, whereas tinnitus and rotational dizziness were associated with a decreased odd of anxiety and/or depression. The model showed good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P value of .46) and discrimination (adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] after bootstrapping of .82). Primary care physicians should consider the existence of anxiety and depression in older patients presenting with dizziness.

We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before. Socioeconomic insecurity contributes to increase mental problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the measures to contain it. Maintaining or introducing an adequate level of physical activity is likely to mitigate such detrimental effects.

Currently, the relationships between symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among Shidu parents remain unclear, necessitating further research to elucidate these connections. Our study aims to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms and identify the bridge symptoms between depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation based on network analysis. This study was conducted in five urban districts and one rural district in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China. Data collection was conducted from March 2017 to February 2020. Network analysis was implemented by using the R packages qgraph and bootnet. 'Felt depressed' and 'felt sad' were central symptoms of depression, while 'feeling fainting and passing out' and 'afraid for no reason' were central symptoms of anxiety. Two pairs of bridge symptoms and one overlapping symptom were found in the transdiagnostic network. In addition, one depressive symptom and one anxiety symptom were identified to be significantly associated with suicidal ideation. The current study is the first to conduct a network analysis of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among Chinese Shidu parents.

Adolescents were 77.5% female and 22.5% male (mean age = 14.8, SD = 1.8). Ten percent of adolescents were Latino. Racial composition was 7.5% Asian, 7.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 80.0% white, and 5.0% biracial. Measures of attachment style (Experience in Close Relationships Scale-Revised [ECR-R]) and depression (Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised [CDRS-R]) were administered at baseline and Weeks 8 and 16. Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance (ECR-R) decreased significantly from baseline to Week 16. Baseline Avoidance positively predicted greater reductions in depression (CDRS-R), controlling for fluoxetine. Reductions in Anxiety and Avoidance were also significantly associated with reductions in CDRS-R, controlling for fluoxetine. Adolescents' reports of attachment anxiety and avoidance are amenable to intervention with IPT-A. IPT-A may be particularly beneficial for adolescents who report a high level of avoidant attachment. Clinical or methodological significance of this article Our findings suggest that attachment anxiety and avoidance are constructs that are amenable to intervention during adolescence, and therefore viable targets of treatment. IPT-A was found to be an effective intervention for addressing problems in attachment style, and decreases in attachment anxiety and avoidance were associated with reductions in depression. This provides support for selecting IPT-A as a treatment option for adolescents who are depressed and describe difficulty with attachment security.

The total score for anxiety was M = 8.8 (SD = 6.9, range: 0-21), with 26.8% (<i>n</i> = 15) of the sample showing symptoms of severe anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 15). No significant difference between women and men with respect to frequency and symptom scores of PTSD, depression, and anxiety was found. Amongst asylum seekers of the presented sample, the rates of traumatic events as well as the prevalence of possible PTSD, depression, and anxiety were significantly higher than in the German population. This indicates that the refugee population is in need of culturally sensitive psychological interventions.

There is limited research on the impact these symptoms have on heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers' performance. In this study 1324 HGV drivers were surveyed using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) and the Health and Performance at Work Questionnaire (HPQ). Depression, anxiety and stress had little effect on driver absenteeism rates or self-rated driving performance. However, severe (1.5% of drivers) and very severe (1.8% of drivers) depression was associated with an increased odds ratio (OR=4.5 and 5.0, respectively) for being involved in an accident or near miss in the past 28 days. This odd ratio is akin to driving with a blood alcohol content of about 0.08%. Given the number of HGV vehicles and the prevalence of depression this equates to 10,950 HGV drivers with an increased statistical risk of an accident or near miss. As the impact of HGV accidents is potentially large, including loss of life, it would be sensible to extend the research findings here into an action plan.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19393792/"}

With aging being a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, depression in this population may have been exacerbated. This study aimed to describe experiences and changes in depressive symptoms and well-being of older adults during and after the COVID-19 first wave in Spain. The study used a multi-method design. Participants self-reported depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) and well-being (Cantril Ladder of Life). Participants were asked about changes in depressive symptoms or well-being during quarantine. If a change was perceived, they were asked to describe the change. In addition, the Patient Global Impression of Change scale was used. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on the data. 111 participants (mean age: 71±5 years; 76% women) completed the study. Sixty-three percent reported mild and 2% reported major depressive symptoms. Nearly half (47.7%) reported changes in depressive symptoms during the lockdown. While 37% reported feeling better during the lockdown, about 11% reported depressive symptoms were worse now compared with during the lockdown. 60% reported worsening well-being during the quarantining period. The qualitative analysis revealed 2 main themes: (1) psychological discomfort (mood deflection, fear/worries, and boredom/inactivity) and (2) social issues (inability to go out, missing family members and others). Worsening depressive symptoms and lowering of well-being were noticed in this sample of older adults during and post-COVID lockdowns.

This randomized comparative effectiveness trial was performed from February 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020, at the prenatal clinic, postpartum unit, and pediatric clinic within an urban safety-net hospital. Participants included peripartum persons with positive depression screen results. Data were analyzed from July 6, 2020, to September 21, 2022, based on intention to treat. Engagement-focused care coordination (EFCC), which used shared decision-making and motivational techniques to refer patients to outside mental health services, and problem-solving education (PSE), a brief cognitive-behavioral program delivered at the screening site. The primary outcome consisted of severity of depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes included severity of anxiety symptoms and engagement with care, each measured bimonthly over 12 months. Rates of symptom elevations were modeled using negative binomial regression; rates of symptom trajectories were modeled using treatment × time interactions. Among the 230 participants (mean [SD] age, 29.8 [5.8] years), 125 (54.3%) were Black and 101 (43.9%) were Hispanic or Latina. At baseline, 117 participants (50.9%) reported at least moderately severe depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score ≥11), and 56 (24.3%) reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms (Beck Anxiety Inventory score ≥21). Across 6 assessment time points, the mean (SD) number of moderately severe depressive symptom episodes in EFCC was 2.2 (2.2), compared with 2.2 (2.1) in PSE, for an adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.77-1.17).

This study aimed to determine the direct and indirect effects of SSRIs relative to a placebo control condition on clinical symptoms of depression. We included data of 8262 adult patients with major depression participating in 28 industry-sponsored US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registered trials on the efficacy of SSRIs. Clinical symptoms of depression were assessed by the 17 separate items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. Network estimation techniques showed that SSRIs had quick and strong direct effects on the two affective symptoms, i.e., depressed mood and psychic anxiety; direct effects on other symptoms were weak or absent. Substantial indirect effects were found for all four cognitive symptoms, which showed larger reductions in the SSRI condition but mainly in patients reporting larger reductions in depressed mood. Smaller indirect effects were found for two arousal/somatic symptoms via the direct effect on psychic anxiety. Both direct and indirect effects on sleep problems and most arousal/somatic symptoms were weak or absent. In conclusion, our study revealed that SSRIs primarily caused reductions in affective symptoms, which were related to reductions in mainly cognitive symptoms and some specific arousal/somatic symptoms. The results can contribute to disclosing the mechanisms of action of SSRIs, and has the potential to facilitate early detection of responders and non-responders in clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36681669/"}

The treatment group consisted of a 9-week music group that incorporated various components of CBT material into a musical context. Feasibility was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were a reduction in depression, anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0) assessed at baseline and 10 weeks. Recruitment proved feasible, retention rates were high, and the participants reported a high level of acceptability. A randomized control study design was successfully implemented as there were no significant differences between treatment and control groups at baseline. Participants in the treatment group showed improvement in disability (p = 0.027). Despite a reduction in depression and anxiety scores, these differences were not statistically significant. A low-intensity CBT-based music group can be successfully administered to clients of community mental health services.

We identified a single rumination factor, which was correlated with factors representing cognitive symptoms of depression, somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety symptoms; and one factor representing adaptive responses to low mood. Elevated rumination scores predicted onset of depressive disorders over the subsequent year (p = 0.035), and levels of depressive symptoms 12 months later (p < 0.0005), after adjustment for prior levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms.

One population-based sample of 909 12-year-old adolescents was assessed using the Life Incidence of Traumatic Events scale and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. One sample of 398 17-year-old adolescents, enriched for poly-victimized individuals (USSS), was assessed using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).

The interaction effect between rs3800373 and adverse life events on the TSCC sub-scales-anxiety, depression, anger, and dissociation-and with the rs1360780 on dissociation in the USSS cohort remained significant after Bonferroni correction. This pattern of association is in line with the findings of clinical and neuroimaging studies, and implies interactive effects of FKBP5 polymorphisms and early life environment on several psychiatric symptoms.

It is therefore crucial to identify factors related to recurrence, as they may provide viable targets for preventative intervention. Previous studies have observed a link between low self-esteem and subsequent symptoms of depression and anxiety, and low levels of self-esteem in those recovered from a depression or an anxiety disorder. Research also suggests that it is crucial to differentiate more explicit self-esteem (ESE) from more implicit self-esteem (ISE). The current study is the first to test whether ISE and ESE predict recurrence of depression and recurrence of anxiety during a 3-year follow-up as determined with clinical interviews. The sample included those with a history of a depressive disorder (<i>n</i> = 559) and/or a history of an anxiety disorder (<i>n</i> = 458) who had been depression- and anxiety-free for at least six months at baseline. During the 3-year follow-up, 119 (21%) and 104 (23%) had a depression and anxiety recurrence, respectively. ISE predicted recurrence of both depression and anxiety, even when statistically controlling for residual symptoms and neuroticism at baseline. ESE also showed predictive value, although this was not over and above residual symptoms. Explorative analyses suggest that ESE and ISE improved little, or not at all, from currently having a depression or anxiety disorder to recovery. These results therefore suggest that ISE may be an important target for interventions to prevent the recurrence of both depression and anxiety disorders.

Insight into the brain basis of the dynamic nature of emotional reactivity may be critical for understanding chronic symptoms of anxiety and depression. Here, individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and healthy controls watched a video with dynamic affective content while fMRI activity was recorded. Across all participants there was a large-scale tracking of affective content in emotion processing regions and the default mode network. Anxious and depressed individuals displayed less brain-based coupling within these regions and the extent of this uncoupling correlated with variability in emotional numbing. Thus, abnormal neural tracking of affective information during dynamic emotional episodes appears to represent a disconnection between affective cues in the environment and an individual's response to these cues-providing a putative neural basis for context insensitive affective reactivity and emotional numbing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28013067/"}

They are both associated with poorer patient functioning, worse quality of life, more frequent utilization of health services, and higher health care costs. However, detection rates of depression and anxiety by non-mental health specialists remain very low, while most of the proposed screening tools are rather not practical and therefore they have not been widely used in practice. Over the last two decades, ultra-short tools including one to three questions have been developed and suggested as case-finding methods and their sensitivity and specificity have been investigated. We reviewed all the ultra-short screening tools for depression and anxiety and the existing evidence on their accuracy in detecting major depression and anxiety disorders. Two simple screening questions for depression, about depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure in doing things, have been repeatedly applied in primary care settings and found to have satisfactory sensitivity but low specificity. The addition of a third question inquiring if help is needed to the two screening questions for depression improves the specificity, however on the cost of reducing the sensitivity of the method. Screening for depression using only one of these questions alone was found to be less accurate strategy than the two or three question tests. The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) includes the same two depression-questions with rating scale answer choices and it was found to be more accurate than the two question test with dichotomous (yes or no) answers. Ultra-short screening strategies for depression in older people were found to have acceptable levels of accuracy, while in patients with cancer the two question tests had higher sensitivity and specificity than in other patient groups. According to the existing data, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) questionnaire, which includes two questions on \"feeling nervous, anxious or on edge\" and \"not being able to stop or control worrying\" appears to have acceptable accuracy in identifying clinically significant anxiety. We concluded that there is sufficient evidence on the suitability of the ultra-short screening instruments for depression and anxiety -especially the PHQ-2, the GAD-2 and their combination, the PHQ-4- for use in epidemiological studies. In primary and secondary care settings, the ultra-short tools can be used only as an initial screening method but diagnosis made by specially-trained clinicians or mental health specialists is warranted for patients who initially screen positive.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24486977/"}

However, the occurrence of response shifts (changes in subjects' values, or their standards for measurement) may limit the validity of such comparisons. As most psychological treatments for depression are aimed at changing patients' values and frame of reference, response shifts are likely to occur over the course of such treatments. In this article, we tested whether response shifts occurred over the course of treatment in an influential randomized clinical trial. Using confirmatory factor analysis, measurement models underlying item scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck & Beamesderfer, 1974) of the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (Elkin, Parloff, Hadley, & Autry, 1985) were analyzed. Compared with before treatment, after-treatment item scores appeared to overestimate depressive symptomatology, measurement errors were smaller, and correlations between constructs were stronger. These findings indicate a response shift, in the sense that participants seem to get better at assessing their level of depressive symptomatology. Comparing measurement models of patients receiving psychotherapy and medication suggested that the aforementioned effects were more apparent in the psychotherapy groups. Consequently, comparisons of observed total scores on self-report inventories may yield confounded measures of treatment efficacy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23339313/"}

Widely used in diverse settings and populations, confirmatory factor analytic evidence has accumulated for a bifactor model underlying this multidimensional measure. Studies employing an exploratory bifactor approach to more closely examine its underlying structure and inter-relations of factors, however, have been scarce. This is unfortunate because confirmatory techniques often employ indirect ways of handling model misspecification, whereas exploratory methods enable more direct approaches. Moreover, more precise approaches to modeling an exploratory bifactor structure have not been examined with the DASS-21. Based on several large samples of undergraduate students in the United States, the first two parts of the paper (Studies 1 and 2) utilized both exploratory (<i>M</i> = 19.7 years of age) and confirmatory factor analytic methods (<i>M</i> = 19.7 years of age) following those presented by contemporary multidimensional modeling theorists. Building upon these results, the third part of the paper (Study 3; <i>M</i> = 20.0 years of age) examined sensitivity-/specificity-related indices to provide cut-off score recommendations for a revised DASS-21 instrument based on a newly identified and supported bifactor structure. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of taxonomy, challenges inherent in multidimensional modeling, and potential use of the revised DASS-21 measure as a component of an actuarial decision-making strategy to inform clinical referrals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29932351/"}

Given the documented effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on ICs' common psychological complaints, such as anxiety and depression, the objective was to conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of CBTs for adult ICs. A literature search was conducted in order to identify all intervention studies on adult ICs that employed at least one therapeutic component defined as a CBT component. Literature searches revealed 36 unique records with sufficient data. These studies were subjected to meta-analyses using random effects models. A small, statistically significant effect of CBTs (Hedge's g = 0.08, p = 0.014) was revealed, which disappeared when randomized controlled trials were evaluated alone (g = 0.04, p = 0.200). A number of variables were explored as moderators. Only the percentage of female participants was positively associated with the effect size. Based on the negligible effect of CBTs across outcomes, future studies should consider moving beyond traditional CBT methods as these do not appear efficacious. It is suggested that future interventions orient towards advances in the basic affective sciences and derived therapies in order to better understand and treat the emotional struggles experienced by ICs. © 2016 The Authors.

Participants were 70 adolescents (61.4% female, mean age = 15.4 years) with a primary anxiety disorder who received residential treatment involving cognitive behavioral therapy and medication management. Treatment outcome was assessed both as the change in adolescent-reported anxiety symptoms, and using treatment response criteria. Results indicated a strong effect of the intervention on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and anxiety-related life interference. Most pre-treatment variables were not associated with treatment outcome. However, higher adolescent-reported pre-treatment anxiety was associated with a greater reduction in anxiety at post-treatment, and the presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with poorer odds of treatment response.

The Kimberley Mum's Mood Scale (KMMS) was developed and later validated as an effective and acceptable perinatal depression and anxiety screening tool for the Kimberley region under research conditions. Other regions have expressed interest in using the KMMS with perinatal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. It is, however, important to re-evaluate the KMMS in a larger Kimberley sample via a real world implementation study, and to test for applicability in other remote and regional environments before recommendations for wider use can be made. This paper outlines the protocol for evaluating the process of implementation and establishing the 'real world' validity and acceptability of the KMMS in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Far North Queensland in northern Australia. The study will use a range of quantitative and qualitative methods across all sites. KMMS validation/revalidation internal consistency of Part 1 will be determined using Cronbach's alpha. Equivalence for identifying risk of depression and anxiety compared to a standard reference assessment will be determined from receiver operating characteristic curves. Sensitivity and specificity will be determined based on these cut-points. Qualitative methods of phenomenology will be used to explore concepts of KMMS user acceptability (women and health professionals). Additional process evaluation methods will collate, assess and report on KMMS quality review data, consultations with health service administrators and management, field notes, and other documentation from the research team. This information will be reported on using the Dynamic Sustainability Framework. This project is contributing to the important public health priority of screening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women for perinatal depression and anxiety with tools that are meaningful and responsive to cultural and clinical needs. Identifying and addressing barriers to implementation contributes to our understanding of the complexity of improving routine clinical practie.

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale were used. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to investigate the impacts. MDD patients with PDD had greater severities of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms at the three follow-up points as compared with those without; however, these results were of statistical significance only in patients without pharmacotherapy. MDD patients with PDD had a longer duration of pharmacotherapy and a lower remission rate as compared with those without. After controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline, PDD was independently associated with more severe depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. At the ten-year follow-up, approximately half of the subjects were lost to follow-up; this, in addition to the unequal follow-up intervals, might have caused bias. Among the patients, PDD continued to have negative impacts on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms over the subsequent ten years. Differences in symptomatology between the patients with and without PDD were statistically insignificant when pharmacotherapy was utilized; however, pharmacotherapy did not fully compensate for the negative impacts of PDD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30248637/"}

The current study explored whether an adaptive stand-alone WM training could increase WMC and consequently reduce rumination, anxiety and depression by means of a double-blind randomized controlled trial in a sample of 98 patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. No positive effect of training on WMC was found. In addition, the results show that a WM training was not associated with a reduction of rumination, depression, nor anxiety. The high drop-out rate in both groups (20.11% from pre- to post-training) and the overrepresentation of men and use of anti-depressants in the placebo group might have influenced the results. Furthermore, expectations and perceptions about the training might have interacted with performance on WM tasks.

Following the establishment of new clinical guidelines in 2017, the duration of interventions was not to exceed 15 sessions, with some exceptions. Objectives The overall aim of the longitudinal component of the Shared Knowledge study was to evaluate the care experience of individuals with an anxiety or depressive disorder receiving a short-term intervention (<15 sessions) by first-line AMH teams, and the evolution of recovery over time. Specifically, the objectives were to: 1) determine the appreciation of short-term interventions by service users; and 2) assess the evolution over time of the symptomatology, functioning and quality of life and recovery of individuals receiving short-term interventions. Method A mixed method longitudinal design was used. Telephone interviews were conducted with participants, in which the following variables were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed: appreciation of services received, quality of relationship with the provider (INSPIRE), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), global functioning (WHODAS), quality of life (ReQOL), and personal recovery (ERTAD). Linear mixed model analyses were performed to examine changes over time on quantitative measures. Content analysis was performed on the qualitative data. Results A total of 63 individuals participated in an interview before the start of their intervention and 22 of them participated after the end of this intervention. Statistical analyses showed a significant improvement in anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and personal recovery, but no difference was observed in depressive symptoms and level of functioning. Nearly half (47.4%) of participants reported that the intervention they received had \"completely\" met the need that had led them to seek help, and 33.3% felt \"completely\" equipped or empowered in their recovery. The quality of the relationship with the caregiver, the opportunity to take part in decision-making, and the personalization of the intervention according to their needs and preferences were some of the elements that were particularly appreciated. Conclusion Short-term interventions seem to be appreciated and produce positive effects in many people suffering from anxiety or depressive disorders. However, they remain insufficient for a number of them. A personal recovery measure should be used in conjunction with symptomatology and functioning scales to monitor the progress of people using first-line mental health services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38578186/"}

A randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, through January 28, 2016, in 3 primary care centers in Peshawar, Pakistan, that included 346 adult primary care attendees with high levels of both psychological distress and functional impairment according to the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). Lay health workers administered 5 weekly 90-minute individual sessions that included empirically supported strategies of problem solving, behavioral activation, strengthening social support, and stress management. The control was enhanced usual care. Primary outcomes, anxiety and depression symptoms, were independently measured at 3 months with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Secondary outcomes were posttraumatic stress symptoms (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5), functional impairment (WHODAS 2.0), progress on problems for which the person sought help (Psychological Outcome Profiles), and symptoms of depressive disorder (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire). Among 346 patients (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [11.8] years; 78.9% women), 172 were randomly assigned to the intervention and 174 to enhanced usual care; among them, 146 and 160 completed the study, respectively. At baseline, the intervention and control groups had similar mean (SD) HADS scores on symptoms of anxiety (14.16 [3.17] vs 13.64 [3.20]; adjusted mean difference [AMD], 0.52; 95% CI, -0.22 to 1.27) and depression (12.67 [3.27] vs 12.49 [3.34]; AMD, 0.17, 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.89). After 3 months of treatment, the intervention group had significantly lower mean (SD) HADS scores than the control group for anxiety (7.25 [3.63] vs 10.03 [3.87]; AMD, -2.77; 95% CI, -3.56 to -1.98) and depression (6.30 [3.40] vs 9.27 [3.56]; AMD, -2.98; 95% CI, -3.74 to -2.22).

However, patients with major depression differ dramatically in their symptom presentation and comorbidities, e.g. with anxiety disorders. There are also large variations in treatment outcomes and associations of some anxiety comorbidities with poorer prognoses, but limited understanding as to why, and little information to inform the clinical management of depression. There is a need to improve our understanding of depression, incorporating anxiety comorbidity, and consider the association of a wide range of symptoms with treatment outcomes. Individual patient data from six RCTs of depressed patients (total n = 2858) were used to estimate the differential impact symptoms have on outcomes at three post intervention time points using individual items and sum scores. Symptom networks (graphical Gaussian model) were estimated to explore the functional relations among symptoms of depression and anxiety and compare networks for treatment remitters and those with persistent symptoms to identify potential prognostic indicators. Item-level prediction performed similarly to sum scores when predicting outcomes at 3 to 4 months and 6 to 8 months, but outperformed sum scores for 9 to 12 months. Pessimism emerged as the most important predictive symptom (relative to all other symptoms), across these time points. In the network structure at study entry, symptoms clustered into physical symptoms, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Sadness, pessimism, and indecision acted as bridges between communities, with sadness and failure/worthlessness being the most central (i.e. interconnected) symptoms. Connectivity of networks at study entry did not differ for future remitters vs. those with persistent symptoms. The relative importance of specific symptoms in association with outcomes and the interactions within the network highlight the value of transdiagnostic assessment and formulation of symptoms to both treatment and prognosis.

However, there are no robust imaging biomarkers that are specific to depression, which may be due to clinical heterogeneity and neurobiological complexity. A dimensional approach and fusion of imaging modalities may yield a more coherent view of the neuronal correlates of depression. We used linked independent component analysis to fuse cortical macrostructure (thickness, area, gray matter density), white matter diffusion properties and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging default mode network amplitude in patients with a history of depression (n = 170) and controls (n = 71). We used univariate and machine learning approaches to assess the relationship between age, sex, case-control status, and symptom loads for depression and anxiety with the resulting brain components. Univariate analyses revealed strong associations between age and sex with mainly global but also regional specific brain components, with varying degrees of multimodal involvement. In contrast, there were no significant associations with case-control status, nor symptom loads for depression and anxiety with the brain components, nor any interaction effects with age and sex. Machine learning revealed low model performance for classifying patients from controls and predicting symptom loads for depression and anxiety, but high age prediction accuracy.

Responses of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II, and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) were analyzed. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis of 42 items from the BAI and BDI-II. Correlational analyses were performed between subscale scores of the SCL-90-R and factors derived from the factor analysis. Scores of individual items of the BAI and BDI-II were also compared between groups of anxiety disorder (n = 185) and depressive disorder (n = 123). Exploratory factor analysis revealed the following five factors explaining 56.2% of the total variance: somatic anxiety (factor 1), cognitive depression (factor 2), somatic depression (factor 3), subjective anxiety (factor 4), and autonomic anxiety (factor 5). The depression group had significantly higher scores for 12 items on the BDI while the anxiety group demonstrated higher scores for six items on the BAI. Our results suggest that anxiety and depressive symptoms as measured by the BAI and BDI-II can be empirically differentiated and that particularly items of the cognitive domain in depression and those of physical domain in anxiety are noteworthy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29651821/"}

Animal models serve as a powerful tool for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this disorder; however, little standardization exists across the wide range of available modeling approaches most often employed. This review will illustrate some of the most challenging obstacles faced by investigators attempting to associate depressive-like behaviors in rodents with symptoms expressed in MDD. Furthermore, a novel series of depressive-like criteria based on correlating behavioral endophenotypes, novel in vivo neurophysiological measurements, and molecular/cellular analyses within multiple brain are proposed as a potential solution to overcoming this barrier. Ultimately, linking the neurophysiological and cellular/biochemical actions that contribute to the expression of a defined MDD-like syndrome will dramatically extend the translational value of the most valid animal models of MDD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22823549/"}

Amnesty International claims that the women and girls who survived ISIS captivity, or who succeeded in escaping the attack, suffer from severe psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This paper discusses the effectiveness of a two-month art-based intervention course on the general health status and psychological well- being of Yezidi females. A total of 14 females, ranging in age from 10 to 27, who survived the ISIS captivity/invasion, were invited to participate in a two-month art-based intervention treatment course. Their general health status and socio-psychological well-being were assessed pre- and post-intervention through self-report assessments, the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the Flourishing Scale (FS), respectively. The study showed that overall general health status and socio-psychological well- being improved, substantially, from 18.21 to 3.57 for general health status (P < 0.0001) and from 41.36-51.21 for socio-psychological well-being (P < 0.0001).

A total population of 917 individuals were included, 440 (48%) men and 477 (52%) women aged 20-35 years. Number of households for inclusion in each village was selected proportional to the total number of households in each selected village. The response rate was 99.8%. Face-to-face interviewing was done by experienced and trained clinical psychologists, following a structured questionnaire. Women were slightly less exposed during the genocide period (women 35.4% and men 37.5%; p=0.537), but more women than men were exposed to traumatic episodes over their lifetime (women 83.6%, n=399; men 73.4%, n=323; p<0.001). Current major depressive episodes (MDE) were twice as prevalent in women as in men. Traumatic episodes experienced in the genocide period severely affected men's current mental health status with relative risk (RR) 3.02 (95% CI 1.59 to 5.37) for MDE past and with RR 2.15 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.64) for suicidality. Women's mental health was also affected by trauma experienced in the genocide period but to an even higher extent, by similar trauma experienced in the lifetime with RR 1.91 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.22) for suicidality and RR 1.90 (95% CI 1.34 to 2.42) for generalised anxiety disorder, taking spousal physical/sexual violence into consideration.

Data-driven techniques may help to come to a more empirically based classification. This study aimed to identify depressive subtypes within a large cohort of subjects with depression. Baseline data from 818 persons with a DSM-IV diagnosis of current major depressive disorder or minor depression who participated in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used. Respondents were recruited in the community, in primary care, and in specialized mental health care from September 2004 through February 2007. Latent classes were derived from latent class analysis using 16 depressive symptoms from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Classes were characterized using demographic, clinical psychiatric, psychosocial, and physical health descriptors. Three classes were identified: a severe melancholic class (prevalence, 46.3%), a severe atypical class (prevalence, 24.6%), and a class of moderate severity (prevalence, 29.1%). Both severe classes were characterized by more neuroticism (melancholic OR = 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01-1.10]; atypical OR = 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.12]), more disability (melancholic OR = 1.07 [95% CI, 1.05-1.09]; atypical OR = 1.06 [95% CI, 1.04-1.07]), and less extraversion (melancholic OR = 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.99]; atypical OR = 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.99]) than the moderate class. Comparing the melancholic class with the atypical class revealed that the melancholic class had more smokers (atypical OR = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.39-0.84]) and more childhood trauma (atypical OR = 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74-1.00]), whereas the atypical class had more women (atypical OR = 1.52 [95% CI, 0.99-2.32]), a higher body mass index (atypical OR = 1.13 [95% CI, 1.09-1.17]), and more metabolic syndrome (atypical OR = 2.17 [95% CI, 1.38-3.42]).

Fortunately, recent advances in natural language processing (i.e., AI-methods) yield new opportunities to quantify people's own mental health descriptions. Our aim was to explore whether responses to open-ended questions, quantified using AI, provide additional value in measuring intervention outcomes compared to traditional rating scales. Swedish adolescents (N = 44) who received Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for eight weeks completed (pre/post) scales measuring anxiety and depression and three open-ended questions (related to depression, anxiety and general mental health). The language responses were quantified using a large language model and quantitative methods to predict mental health as measured by rating scales, valence (i.e., words' positive/negative affectivity), and semantic content (i.e., meaning). Similar to the rating scales, language measures revealed statistically significant health improvements between pre and post measures such as reduced depression and anxiety symptoms and an increase in the use of words conveying positive emotions and different meanings (e.g., pre-intervention: \"anxious\", depressed; post-intervention: \"happy\", \"the future\"). Notably, the health changes identified through semantic content measures remained statistically significant even after accounting for the changes captured by the rating scales. Language responses analyzed using AI-methods assessed outcomes with fewer items, demonstrating effectiveness and accuracy comparable to traditional rating scales. Additionally, this approach provided valuable insights into patients' well-being beyond mere symptom reduction, thus highlighting areas of improvement that rating scales often overlook.

However, no prior research has investigated how Deprexis (or any other Internet intervention for depression) impacts specific symptoms of depression. The current study utilizes symptom-level analyses to examine which symptoms are directly, indirectly, or minimally influenced by treatment. Network analysis and mean-level approaches examined which symptoms, assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms, were affected by an 8-week course of Deprexis compared with a waitlist in a nationally recruited sample from the United States (N = 295). Deprexis directly improved the symptoms of sadness and indecision. Changes in these symptoms, in turn, was associated with a change in early insomnia, middle insomnia, self-dislike, fatigue, anhedonia, suicidality, slowness, and agitation. All of these symptoms (except for agitation and early insomnia) show decreases with Deprexis compared with a waitlist after correcting for multiple comparisons. Six additional symptoms, particularly the somatic symptoms, were not impacted by Deprexis compared with a waitlist. In this sample, the efficacy of Deprexis was due to its direct impact on sadness and indecision. Examining the treatment-related change in specific symptoms may facilitate a more nuanced understanding of how a treatment works compared with examining symptom sum scores.

Paykel (1972), however, found that the psychotic-neurotic dichotomy was not helpful in predicting outcome, whereas anxious depressives tended to respond poorly. 5 In three patients with affective illness, tested at regular intervals over the course of several weeks, anxiety and depressive symptoms fluctuated in a way which suggested that they were yoked to each other.

This paper tested whether, how, and to what extent both psychomotor symptoms, agitation and retardation in depression are related to bipolarity and anxiety. The prospective Zurich Study assessed psychiatric and somatic syndromes in a community sample of young adults (N = 591) (aged 20 at first interview) by six interviews over 20 years (1979-1999). Psychomotor symptoms of agitation and retardation were assessed by professional interviewers from age 22 to 40 (five interviews) on the basis of the observed and reported behaviour within the interview section on depression. Psychiatric diagnoses were strictly operationalised and, in the case of bipolar-II disorder, were broader than proposed by DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. As indicators of bipolarity, the association with bipolar disorder, a family history of mania/hypomania/cyclothymia, together with hypomanic and cyclothymic temperament as assessed by the general behavior inventory (GBI) [15], and mood lability (an element of cyclothymic temperament) were used. Agitated and retarded depressive states were equally associated with the indicators of bipolarity and with anxiety. Longitudinally, agitation and retardation were significantly associated with each other (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0-3.2), and this combined group of major depressives showed stronger associations with bipolarity, with both hypomanic/cyclothymic and depressive temperamental traits, and with anxiety. Among agitated, non-retarded depressives, unipolar mood disorder was even twice as common as bipolar mood disorder. Combined agitated and retarded major depressive states are more often bipolar than unipolar, but, in general, agitated depression (with or without retardation) is not more frequently bipolar than retarded depression (with or without agitation), and pure agitated depression is even much less frequently bipolar than unipolar.

A bifactor solution was the best fitting latent variable model with one general latent factor termed 'distress' and five 'distress independent' specific factors defined as self-confidence, antisocial behaviour, worry, aberrant thinking, and mood. Next, six distinct subgroups were derived from a person-centred latent profile analysis of the factor scores. Finally, concurrent validity was assessed using information on hazardous behaviours (alcohol use, substance misuse, self-harm) and treatment for mental ill health: both discriminated between the latent traits and latent profile subgroups. The findings suggest a complex, multidimensional mental health structure in the youth population rather than the previously assumed first or second order factor structure. Additionally, the analysis revealed a low hazardous behaviour/low mental illness risk subgroup not previously described. Population sub-groups show greater validity over single variable factors in revealing mental illness risks. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the structure of self reported mental health is multidimensional in nature and uniquely finds improved prediction to mental illness risk within person-centred subgroups derived from the multidimensional latent traits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28403164/"}

This longitudinal study examines the predictive value of worry as a maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategy, and resources necessary for successful emotion regulation (i.e., cognitive control and resting heart rate variability [HRV]) for the course of anxiety symptoms in depressed older adults. Moreover, it examines whether these emotion regulation variables moderate the impact of negative life events on severity of anxiety symptoms. Data of 378 depressed older adults (CIDI) between 60 and 93 years (of whom 144 [41%] had a comorbid anxiety disorder) from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Adults (NESDO) were used. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling was used to identify different course trajectories of six-months BAI scores. Univariable and multivariable longitudinal associations of worry, cognitive control and HRV with symptom course trajectories were assessed. We identified a course trajectory with low and improving symptoms (57.9%), a course trajectory with moderate and persistent symptoms (33.5%), and a course trajectory with severe and persistent anxiety symptoms (8.6%). Higher levels of worry and lower levels of cognitive control predicted persistent and severe levels of anxiety symptoms independent of presence of anxiety disorder. However, worry, cognitive control and HRV did not moderate the impact of negative life events on anxiety severity. Worry may be an important and malleable risk factor for persistence of anxiety symptoms in depressed older adults. Given the high prevalence of anxious depression in older adults, modifying worry may constitute a viable venue for alleviating anxiety levels.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28641215/"}

The present study used multivariate mixed effects location-scale modeling to characterize the time-varying dynamics of depressed mood and anxiety for women diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depression (MDD). Women completed five daily EMA surveys over 30 days (150 EMA surveys/woman, T ≈ 5250 total observations) and two clinical diagnostic and retrospective self-report measures administered approximately two months apart. There was evidence of same-symptom lagged effects (bs = 0.08-0.09), but not cross-symptom lagged effects (bs < 0.01) during EMA. Symptoms co-varied such that momentary spikes from one's typical level of anxiety were associated with increases in momentary depressed mood (b = 0.19) and greater variability of depressed mood (b = 0.06). Similarly, spikes from one's typical levels of depressed mood were associated with increases in momentary anxiety (b = 0.19). Furthermore, the presence and magnitude of effects demonstrated person-specific heterogeneity. Our findings are constrained to the dynamics of depressed and anxious mood among cisgender women with primary SAD and current or past MDD. Findings from this work help to characterize how daily experiences of co-occurring mood and anxiety fluctuate and offer insight to aid the development of momentary, person-specific interventions designed to regulate symptom fluctuations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38906224/"}

Mobile behavioral activation (BA) is efficacious for the treatment of perinatal depression; however, the effect of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) on symptom trajectories remains underexplored. This is important given that at least 10% of women in the perinatal period experience CAD. We assessed whether there were differences in symptom trajectories in pregnant participants with CAD as compared to those with depression only (ie, major depressive disorder [MDD]) during intervention with a BA mobile gaming app. Pregnant adults with either CAD (n=10) or MDD (n=7) used a BA app for 10 weeks and completed biweekly symptom severity questionnaires for depression and anxiety. We assessed whether baseline diagnoses were associated with differential symptom trajectories across the study with mixed effects longitudinal models. When controlling for baseline symptoms, results revealed a significant interaction between baseline diagnosis and the quadratic component of study week on anxiety (β=.18, SE 0.07; t62=2.61; P=.01), revealing a tendency for anxiety in the CAD group to increase initially and then decrease at an accelerated rate, whereas MDD symptoms were relatively stable across time. There was a significant effect of linear time on depression (β=-.39, SE 0.11; t68=-3.51; P=.001), showing that depression declined steadily across time for both groups. There was a significant effect of baseline diagnosis on depression (β=-8.53, SE 3.93; t13=-2.17; P=.05), suggesting that those with MDD had higher follow-up depression compared to those with CAD when holding other predictors constant. The app was beneficial in reducing depression symptoms in perinatal individuals with different comorbidity profiles. With respect to anxiety symptom trajectories, however, there was more variability. The app may be especially effective for the treatment of anxiety symptoms among individuals with CAD, as it encourages in-the-moment ecologically relevant exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli. Despite no significant group difference in baseline anxiety symptoms, the MDD group did not have a significant reduction in their anxiety symptoms across the study period, and some individuals had an increase in anxiety. Findings may point to opportunities for the augmentation of BA gaming apps for those with MDD to more effectively target anxiety symptoms.

Outcome measures included PHQ-9 (sensitive to depression) and GAD-7 (sensitive to general anxiety disorder) measures. Three-level hierarchical linear modelling was employed to estimate therapist-attributable proportion of variance in clinical outcomes. Therapist effects were evaluated using the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bayesian empirical predictions of therapist random effects. Three sensitivity analyses were conducted: 1) using both treatment completers and non-completers; 2) a sub-sample of cases with baseline scores above the conventional clinical thresholds for PHQ-9 and GAD-7; and 3) a two-level model (using patient-level pre- and post-treatment scores nested within therapists). The ICC estimates for all outcome measures were very small, ranging between 0% and 1.3%, although most were statistically significant. The Bayesian empirical predictions showed that therapist random effects were not statistically significantly different from each other. Between patient variability explained most of the variance in outcomes.

Further influences of stress exposure during sensitive periods can vary by gender and duration of abuse as well. Data from animal studies are presented to provide greater translational and causal understanding of how sensitive periods, different types of psychosocial stressors, and sex interact to produce depressive-like behaviors. Findings from maternal separation, isolation rearing, chronic variable stress, and peer-peer rearing paradigms clarify interpretation about how various depressive behaviors are influenced by age of exposure. Depressive behaviors are broken down into the following categories: mood and affect, anhedonia, energy, working memory, sleep-wake, appetite changes, suicide, and general malaise. Cross-species evidence from humans, nonhuman primates, rats, and mice within each of these categories is discussed.

Our aim was to identify contributors to fluctuations in suicidal ideation severity over a 12-week period in young people with major depressive disorder receiving cognitive behavioural therapy. Data were drawn from two 12-week randomised, placebo-controlled treatment trials. Participants (<i>N</i> = 283) were 15-25 years old, with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. The primary outcome measure was the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, administered at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12.

Depression and anxiety symptom severity, and trait anxiety, independently predicted higher suicidal ideation, after adjusting for the effects of time, demographics, affective instability, non-suicidal self-injury and alcohol use. Both state and trait anxiety are important longitudinal correlates of suicidal ideation in depressed young people receiving cognitive behavioural therapy, independent of depression severity. Reducing acute psychological distress, through reducing depression and anxiety symptom severity, is important, but interventions aimed at treating trait anxiety could also potentially be an effective intervention approach for suicidal ideation in young people with depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36629043/"}

Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and uploaded into NVivo version 12 software. Two independent coders used deductive thematic analysis to identify patterned responses. Feeling listened to and validated appeared as a cornerstone of other recovery concepts. Participants discussed past negative experiences with psychiatrists and regret for being put on medications in their teenage years without information or options. Hope and optimism were low because of a general focus by professionals to address immediate symptom-based issues, rather than on improving their overall lives. Service providers' focus on medication-taking, and other one-size-fits-all tools, was interpreted as lacking a sincere desire to help. Young adults were particularly sensitive to inauthentic interactions and superficial strategies, which left them craving care that incorporated their whole lives, acknowledged biopsychosocial interconnections and prioritised improving their lives over 'feeling better' in a given moment.

At baseline and on follow-up after 2 and 6 years, psychiatric diagnoses were obtained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-I), while cluster C personality disorders (PD) were assessed on 6-month follow-up (SCID-II). Depression was also assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and general psychopathology with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) at baseline and at the end of the 6-year follow-up. Weight changes were based on measurements at baseline and at the end of the follow-up. Logistic regression was used to study the factors associated with major weight gain (≥ 10%). Altogether, 16% of the study sample experienced major weight gain during the 6-year follow-up. Adverse childhood/adolescent experiences as a self-perceived cause of depression (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.06-13.1, p=0.040), higher scores in the HAM-D (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, p=0.019) and the SCL-90 subscale of anxiety (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.11-4.42, p=0.023) at baseline, and cluster C PD at 6 months (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.11-8.97, p=0.031) were separately associated with major weight gain after adjusting for age, gender, and baseline body mass index (BMI). The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and linking adverse childhood with depression at the beginning of treatment, as well as cluster C PD at 6 months, were predictors of major weight gain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23601988/"}

The purpose of the current study was to examine a possible overlap of psychological and somatic symptoms between subjects with IEI and patients with major depression and schizophrenia as well as to specify characteristic differences. The different symptom clusters included symptoms of chemical intolerance, neurotoxicity and psychological distress as well as measurements of mental health such as anxiety, depression, somatoform symptoms, and schizophrenia-specific disturbances in cognitive domains. IEI patients reported higher overall levels in physical symptoms such as chemical intolerance, neurotoxicity and somatic symptoms not attributable to an organic cause. Schizophrenia patients showed higher overall levels in self-experienced disturbances in several schizophrenia-specific cognitive domains, whereas general psychological distress, anxiety and depression were rated highest by patients with major depression. Importantly, the groups markedly differed in the shapes of profiles of various symptom clusters. Our results provide evidence that IEI patients can be distinguished on the phenomenological level from patients with major depression or schizophrenia, and that distinct domains of psychological and somatic symptoms are particularly problematic in specific diagnostic groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28113122/"}

Patients completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) at admission (T0) and 7 days after or at discharge (T7). Three hundred-fourteen consecutive cancer patients admitted to the APSCU were surveyed. Eighty-six and 66 patients improved their level of depression and anxiety, respectively (passing from ≥ 4 to 0-3, from T0 to T7), after that palliative care intervention resulted in a significant improvement of the other symptoms. Changes were statistically significant for both symptoms (P < 0.0005). Patients admitted for uncontrolled pain were more likely to be anxious, while patients admitted for other symptoms or end-of-life care were more likely to be depressed. The presence of anxiety and depression (≥ 4/10 on ESAS) was significantly associated with a higher level of symptom expression at admission and at T7 (P < 0.0005). In patients presenting both psychological symptoms, symptom expression was significantly more relevant in comparison with patients not reporting moderate-severe psychological symptoms. Pain and depression were independently associated with anxiety at T0. Variables independently associated with depression at T0 were drowsiness, appetite, and anxiety. Psychological symptoms of ESAS concur to hyper-express some symptoms and make symptom control more difficult.

This research explores the impacts of socio-cultural environment and lifestyle factors on the psychological health of university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A 15-month follow-up was carried out among 1140 university students from April 2016 to November 2017. Data were collected by using a pre-developed questionnaire, consisting of socio-demographic information, comprehensive lifestyle information, and psychological health information including a nine-item scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for assessing the level of depression, and a 7-item scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for assessing the level of anxiety. The collected data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 22. With time, there was a 22.5% increase in the prevalence of provisional depression and a 27.1% increase in the prevalence of anxiety. In terms of demographic factors, findings revealed that students dissatisfied with university culture were significantly more likely to experience depression (B = 5.13, p<0.01, β=0.33) and anxiety (B = 4.69, p<0.01, β=0.34). 'Being female', 'being students of social sciences faculty', 'dissatisfaction with current education, financial condition and future career' were found to be significant predictors of students' psychological disorders. In terms of lifestyle factors, participants with high and excessive recreational screen time were significantly more vulnerable to depression (B = 1.25, p<0.01, β=0.097 and B = 1.75, p<0.01, β=0.12) and anxiety (B = 0.86, p = 0.02, β=0.08 and B = 1.22, p<0.01, β=0.096). Additionally, 'weekly physical inactivity', 'dissatisfaction with daily sleep', 'short and long sleep duration', 'low and high daily meal intake frequency' and 'alcohol consumption' were inextricably linked with students' depression and anxiety.

The four groups differed with respect to neuroticism (P<0.001), extraversion (P<0.001), and agreeableness (P=0.045). Post hoc analyses, showed that MUS patients compared to controls scored higher on neuroticism and agreeableness, and compared to depressed patients lower on neuroticism and higher on extraversion as well agreeableness. Interestingly, MUS and MES patients had a similar personality profile. Health anxiety and somatization were associated with a higher level of neuroticism and a lower level of extraversion and conscientiousness, irrespective whether the physical symptom was explained or not.

Participants were US Veterans with MDD enrolled in the Precision Medicine in Mental Health Care study (PRIME Care), a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized, controlled trial that examines the utility of genetic testing in the context of pharmacotherapy for MDD. Participants were a subset (N = 66) enrolled in actigraphy (using GT9X ActiGraph) monitoring component of the trial. Daily steps were examined as a predictor of depressive symptoms over 4-, 8-, 12-, 18-, and 24-weeks. On average, participants took 3,460 (±1,768) steps per day. In generalized linear mixed models, an increase in 1,000 steps per day was associated with a 0.6-point decrease in depressive symptom severity at the subsequent follow-up assessment. Activity monitoring was observational and causal inferences cannot be made between daily steps and subsequent depressive symptom severity. Results may not generalize to non-treatment-seeking populations.

Every week during the course of CT, clinicians assessed depressive symptoms and patients completed self-report instruments measuring severity of depression and anxiety. At presentation, outpatients with comorbid social phobia reported greater levels of depressive symptoms and clinicians rated their impairment as more severe, compared to their counterparts without social phobia. Patients with or without comorbid social phobia did not differ significantly in (1) attrition rates; (2) response or sustained remission rates; (3) time to response or sustained remission; or (4) rate of improvement in symptoms of depression or anxiety.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between Psychological Well-being Practitioner (PWP) competence and patient outcome within the framework of the British government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative. Forty-seven PWPs treating 3688 patients participated. Relationships between PWP scores on three observed standardized clinical examinations and reliable change in patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression were explored at two time points: during the year-long training phase, and over a 12-month follow-up. Results indicated that patients treated by qualified PWPs achieved superior outcomes than those treated by trainees. Little support was found for a general association between practitioner competence in delivering low-intensity cognitive behavioural interventions and patient outcome, either during or post-training; however, significantly more patients of the most competent PWPs demonstrated reliable improvement in their symptoms of anxiety and depression than would be expected by chance alone and fewer deteriorated compared with those treated by the least competent PWPs. Results were indicative of a complex, non-linear relationship, with patient outcome affected by PWP status (trainee or qualified) and by competence at its extremes.

The Achenbach Adult Self-Report was adopted to assess anxiety, depressive and somatic symptoms. All participants completed four runs of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mediation analyses were utilized to explore the interactions among these symptoms and their neuroimaging mechanisms. Somatic symptoms partially mediated the association between subclinical anxiety and depressive symptoms in healthy participants (anxiety→somatic→depression: effect: 0.2785, Boot 95% CI: 0.0958-0.3729; depression→somatic→anxiety: effect: 0.0753, Boot 95% CI: 0.0232-0.1314) and participants in remission of MDD (anxiety→somatic→depression: effect: 0.2948, Boot 95% CI: 0.0357-0.7382; depression→somatic→anxiety: effect: 0.0984, Boot 95% CI: 0.0007-0.2438).

The current literature, however, discusses this issue primarily within the concept of comorbidity and there are some controversies about the existence of a separate disorder of mixed anxiety-depression (MAD). MAD can be defined by the presence of mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety that are below the diagnostic threshold for either one of these diagnoses. Since MAD has not been included in any of the current official classification systems, its prevalence, risk factors, course, and outcome have not been studied specifically in any of the recent epidemiologic studies even though MAD is thought to be very important, especially in primary care settings. This paper reviews recent epidemiologic studies and presents data from the Munich Follow-Up Study, which has found a prevalence of about 1% for MAD as defined by the ICD-10. Despite the lack of clear diagnostic criteria for MAD, there are some indications that: (1) this disorder might be frequent in primary care settings, and (2) patients with MAD frequently demonstrate subjective suffering, show impairment in personal and occupational functioning, and have high health service utilization rates.

This study investigated the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Lifetime Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) in a consecutive sample of psychiatric outpatients. The LSC-R is a 30-item self-reporting questionnaire examining lifetime traumatic and non-traumatic stressors. A final sample of 258 outpatients with anxiety or depressive disorders was recruited at the psychiatric department of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Self-reported data included the Life Events Checklist (LEC), the Zung Self-Rating Depression and Anxiety Scales, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, in addition to the LSC-R. A convenience sample of 50 college students completed the LSC-R on two occasions separated by a three week-interval for test-retest reliability. Mean kappa for temporal stability was high (κ=0.651) and Cronbach alpha was moderate (α=0.724). Convergent validity was excellent with corresponding items on the LEC. Concurrent validity was good for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that 11 factors explained 64.3 % of the total variance. This study demonstrated good psychometric properties of the Korean version of the LSC-R, further supporting its use in clinical research and practice with a Korean speaking population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27873517/"}

The performance of most depression scales including the PHQ-9, however, has not been rigorously evaluated in different racial/ethnic populations. Therefore, we compared the factor structure of the PHQ-9 between different racial/ethnic groups as well as the rates of endorsement and differential item functioning (DIF) of the 9 items of the PHQ-9. The presence of DIF would indicate that responses to an individual item differ significantly between groups, controlling for the level of depression. A combined dataset from 2 separate studies of 5,053 primary care patients including non-Hispanic white (n=2,520), African American (n=598), Chinese American (n=941), and Latino (n=974) patients was used for our analysis. Exploratory principal components factor analysis was used to derive the factor structure of the PHQ-9 in each of the 4 racial/ethnic groups. A generalized Mantel-Haenszel statistic was used to test for DIF. One main factor that included all PHQ-9 items was found in each racial/ethnic group with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Although endorsement rates of individual items were generally similar among the 4 groups, evidence of DIF was found for some items. Our analyses indicate that in African American, Chinese American, Latino, and non-Hispanic white patient groups the PHQ-9 measures a common concept of depression and can be effective for the detection and monitoring of depression in these diverse populations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16808734/"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a short-term (8 session) Relaxation Response Skills Training (RRST) programme for a population of psychiatric outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders who were unresponsive to drug treatment, and to test the feasibility of this intervention as complementary treatment for a psychiatric setting. Forty patients were measured for overall psychopathological symptoms, depression, and anxiety, and were then given an 8-week course of RRST, while continuing their pharmacological treatment. Following the RRST intervention, participants were again assessed. The results demonstrated reductions in overall symptoms (large effect size and reasonable clinically significant change), and also in depression and anxiety (medium effect sizes and clinically significant change). These results suggest that this short-term RRT offers a simple and cost-effective way to augment drug management for participants with common psychiatric disorders who are less responsive to the drug treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27669887/"}

Logistic regression was used to examine sociodemographic and psychiatric determinants of attrition and the influence of clinical psychiatric characteristics on attrition. In addition, differences in determinants between 3 types of attrition (refusal, noncontact, and not able to participate) were evaluated. The attrition rate at the 2-year follow-up assessment was 12.9% (385/2981), representing 6 deceased persons, 250 refusers, 51 noncontacts, and 78 persons unable to participate because of health reasons. Determinants of attrition were younger age, less years of education, not being of North European descent, being recruited in Amsterdam, no previous participation in research, and having major depressive disorder. Only the effects of age, sampling site, and previous participation in research differed between types of attrition. Furthermore, comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders and higher symptom severity were associated with attrition. In contrast to the view that psychiatric epidemiological research is more prone to high attrition rates, this study revealed a relatively low attrition rate. Furthermore, both sociodemographic and psychiatric variables were independent determinants of attrition.

This study presents results from the largest Afghan UASC mental health survey in the U.K. Specifically, the study aims to estimate the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems and to investigate the associations of these problems with demographic variables, cumulative traumatic events, and care and migration variables. A census sample of 222 Afghan UASC was interviewed using validated self-report screening measures. Emotional and behavioural problems were screened using the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist 37A (HSCL-37A). Pre-migration stressful life events were screened using the Stressful Life Events Questionnaire. Administrative data on care and asylum were provided by the local authority social services and the UK Border Agency. Approximately one-third (31.4%) scored above cut-offs for emotional and behavioural problems, 34.6% for anxiety and 23.4% for depression. Ordinary least squares regression indicated a significant dose-response relationship between total pre-migration traumatic events and distress as well as between increased time in the country and greater behavioural problems. Compound traumatic events in the pre-migration stages of forced migration have a deleterious association with UASC well-being. Increased time in country suggests a possible peer effect for these children. Consistent with other studies on refugee children, it should be stressed that the majority of UASC scored below suggested cut-offs, thus displaying a marked resilience despite the experience of adverse events.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229138/"}

Associations between four different methods of quantifying LTE scores, psychosocial factors, major depression (CIDI), anxiety disorders (PRIME-MD), alcohol misuse and dependence (AUDIT) were measured. The LTE showed high test-retest reliability (Kappa range=0.61-0.87) and low internal consistency (α=0.44). Tetrachoric factorial analysis yielded four factors (spousal and relational problems; employment and financial problems; personal problems; illness and bereavement in close persons). Logistic multilevel regression found a strong association between greater social support and a lower occurrence of stressful events (OR range=0.36-0.79). The association between religious-spiritual beliefs and the LTE, was weaker. The association between mental disorders and LTE scores was greater for depression (OR range=1.64-2.57) than anxiety (OR range=1.35-1.97), though the highest ORs were obtained with alcohol dependence (OR range=2.86-4.80). The ordinal score (ordinal regression) was more sensitive to detect the strength of association with mental disorders. We are unable to distinguish the direction of the association between stressful events, psychosocial factors and mental disorders, due to our cross-sectional design of the study. The LTE is a valid and reliable measure of stress in mental health, and the strength of association with mental disorders depends on the method of quantifying LTE scores.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23726778/"}

Research attributes the occurrence of depressive symptoms to a dysfunction of emotion regulation. Anxious attachment and avoidant attachment, which are two dimensions of insecure attachment, are hypothesised to lead to the development of hyperactivating and deactivating emotion regulation strategies. This systematic review examines the literature on the role of emotion regulation and its relationship with attachment and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, we examined evidence for hyperactivating and deactivating strategies. Nineteen papers were identified. Adolescent studies demonstrated associations of varying strength and found unreliable and contradictory results for emotion regulation as a mediator. Conversely, adult studies provided strong evidence for emotion regulation as a mediator. The hypothesis that hyperactivating strategies mediate anxious attachment and depressive symptoms was consistently supported. Mixed evidence was provided for deactivating strategies as mediators to avoidant attachment and depressive symptomatology. Limitations of methodology and quality of studies are identified with particular attention drawn to problems with conceptual singularity and multicollinearity. Despite mixed variable findings, this review indicates that emotion regulation is a mediator between attachment and depression. Hyperactivating strategies, in particular, have been consistently noted as mediators for anxious attachment and depressive symptomatology, whereas evidence for deactivating strategies as mediators between avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms has been mixed. Future research should test the mediators of attachment and symptoms and examine theoretically grounded models of psychopathology, such as metacognitive and cognitive models using clinical samples.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451448/"}

By linking the longitudinal Psychiatric Case Register Middle-Netherlands, which contains all patients of psychiatric services in the Utrecht region, to the death register of Statistics Netherlands, hazard ratio's of death were estimated overall and for different categories of death causes separately. We found an increased risk of death among patients with an anxiety disorder (N=6919): HR=1.45 (95%CI: 1.25-1.69), and among patients with a depression (N=14,778): HR=1.83, (95%CI: 1.72-1.95), compared to controls (N=103,824). The hazard ratios among both disorders combined (N=4260) were similar to those with only a depression: HR=1.91, (95% CI: 1.64-2.23). Among patients with a depression, mortality across all important disease-related categories of death causes (neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases) and due to suicide was increased, without an excess mortality in case of comorbid anxiety. The presented data are restricted to broad categories of patients in specialist services. No data on behavioral or intermediate factors were available. Although anxiety is associated with an increased risk of death, the presence of anxiety as comorbid disorder does not give an additional increase in the risk of death among patients with a depressive disorder.

In this study, 174 patients presenting to a university clinic with anxiety or depression who had been randomly assigned to receive either ACT or CT completed an assessment of theorized mediators and outcomes before each session. Hierarchical linear modeling of session-by-session data revealed that increased utilization of cognitive and affective change strategies relative to utilization of psychological acceptance strategies mediated outcome for CT, whereas for ACT the mediation effect was in the opposite direction. Decreases in self-reported dysfunctional thinking, cognitive \"defusion\" (the ability to see one's thoughts as mental events rather than necessarily as representations of reality), and willingness to engage in behavioral activity despite unpleasant thoughts or emotions were equivalent mediators across treatments.

In this study, we examined whether the RewP predicts the first-lifetime onset of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation over 18 months in familial high-risk adolescents. The sample included 145 adolescents (64.8% female), ages 11 to 17 years, who had at least 1 parent with a history of mood or anxiety disorders and completed baseline and at least 1 follow-up measurement. At baseline, the RewP was measured using a simple gambling task; current internalizing symptoms were assessed using self-report questionnaires; and the adolescent's psychiatric diagnoses were evaluated with diagnostic interviews. The same interview was administered to the adolescents again 9 months and 18 months later. Logistic regression models showed that higher RewP scores significantly predicted a lower likelihood of developing a first onset of major depressive disorder over 18 months, even after controlling for sex, age, and baseline internalizing symptoms. In contrast, the RewP did not significantly predict the first onset of anxiety disorders or suicidal ideation. A reduced RewP precedes the first onset of depression in high-risk adolescents, highlighting the RewP's predictive capability for depression risk in predisposed populations.

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects altered autonomic nervous system activity, has been suggested as one of the mechanisms linking depression to cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship between depression and HRV has not yet been investigated in patients undergone cardiac surgery. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine whether postoperative depression could be related to reduced HRV. Eleven patients with depression and 22 patients without depression, who had undergone cardiac surgery, were enrolled postoperatively. In all patients, HRV was derived from a four-minute blood volume pulse recording at rest. Analyses of covariance and partial correlations, while controlling for anxiety, were used to examine the associations between postoperative depression and each HRV parameter. Compared to non-depressed patients, patients with depression showed significantly lower standard deviation of N-to-N intervals (SDNN) (p=.02), root mean square successive difference of N-to-N intervals (rMSSD) (p=.001), and high-frequency power (p=.002). Partial correlation analyses showed that depression was inversely related to SDNN (r=-.49, p=.005), rMSSD (r=-.58, p=.001), and high-frequency power (r=-.41, p=.02), whereas it was unrelated to other HRV parameters (p's>.09). The current findings extend the depression-reduced HRV relationship to the patients after cardiac surgery.

This study sought to explore these processes and their links with adult attachment and social safeness and pleasure in a depressed group. A total of 52 participants suffering from moderate to severe depression completed measures of fears of happiness, compassion from others and for self, in addition to measures of alexithymia, attachment, social safeness, and depression, anxiety, and stress. Fears of compassion and happiness were highly correlated with alexithymia, adult attachment, and depression, anxiety, and stress. Fear of happiness was found to be the best predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas fear of compassion from others was the best predictor of adult attachment. A path analysis showed that fears of positive emotion fully mediate the link between alexithymia and depression. This clinical sample had higher mean scores in fears of positive emotions, alexithymia, and depression, anxiety, and stress than a previously studied student sample. This study adds to the evidence that fears of positive emotions are important features of mental health difficulties. Unaddressed, these fears can block positive emotions and may lead to emotional avoidance of positive affect thus contributing as blocks to successful therapy.

Salivary cortisol was assessed upon awakening, at 5 PM, and at 9 PM across two consecutive days. Participants also completed measures of global psychosocial stress, current psychiatric symptomatology, pervasive distress (e.g. history of past depression), and protective factors (e.g. social support, resiliency, extent to which one has \"made sense\" of a significant stressor). High levels of current depressive symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities, past depressive episodes, trait anxiety, and poorer ability to make sense of one's stress were found to be associated with flatter (more abnormal) cortisol slopes. However, when all of these variables were entered simultaneously in a multiple regression analysis, only history of past depression and the degree of sense made of stress emerged as unique predictors of cortisol in the model. These findings have important implications for identifying depressed elderly individuals with dysregulated cortisol patterns who may be most at risk for health complications.

We conducted a cross-sectional study among consenting healthcare workers in two medium-sized hospitals in Kenya. Data on demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and practice of depression were collected through a self-administered structured questionnaire. The Revised Depression Attitude Questionnaire was incorporated into the questionnaire. Knowledge and attitude scores were computed, where higher scores suggested higher knowledge or more positive attitudes. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to assess associations, and a <i>p</i> value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Among the 316 HCWs approached, 303 (95.9%) consented and were enrolled. Almost two-thirds (64.0%) of the respondents were female, and 58.4% were between 18 and 29 years old. HCWs were categorised into three: nurses, clinicians (doctors/clinical officers), and nonclinicians (other healthcare workers). The median knowledge score among respondents was 9 out of 10. Nonclinicians scored significantly lower (<i>β</i> = -0.5, <i>p</i> < 0.011) on the knowledge score compared to clinicians. Only 9.3% of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that they were confident in assessing the risk of suicide in patients with depression.

This type of treatment is key to fostering individuals' sense of belonging in the group. However, while a sense of belonging is important, individuals also need to be shown that they have some distinct value to the group-enabling them to not only \"fit in\" but also \"stand out.\" Building from research on fair treatment, we explicate another form, distinctive treatment, whereby others show interest and appreciation for an individual's more distinguishing, group-relevant qualities. In six studies using multiple methods (e.g., experimental, longitudinal) and in multiple types of groups (work organizations, student communities, racial/ethnic minority groups), we show that fair and distinctive treatment play fundamentally different roles-shaping individuals' perceived belonging versus intragroup standing, respectively-and with downstream benefits for mental health (less anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms). Overall, this illustrates that promoting fair treatment in groups is important, but not sufficient. Experiencing distinctive treatment is also key. Each type of treatment provides unique social evaluative information that fosters a healthy sense of self. This research further indicates that distinctive treatment may be a vital yet overlooked element to promoting diversity and inclusion in groups, as it provides a path for recognizing and appreciating, and thus encouraging, a diversity of ideas, insights, knowledge and skills that individuals bring to the group.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33989362/"}

The author ascertains that there are several obstacles in the recognition, treatment and prevention of child-depression that causes a serious public health problem. He stresses the neurologic, neuropsychiatric, psychopathological and diagnostic deficiencies, and the low number of Child and Youth Dispensaries. He describes the situation of Hungarian Child and Youth Dispensaries network, and states positively that today the child-psychiatric services are not able to provide optimal provision for every depressive child. In the brief historical introduction he refers the earlier excellent child-psychiatric initiative. He emphasises the huge number of somatic and psychiatric signs and symptoms among the children. He devotes a separate chapter to the causes of child-depression, the prevention, recognition, creation of diagnosis and treatment. According to the literature data and own examination he demonstrates that the depressive and other psychopathological symptoms among children are not really interested the parents, health-workers and teachers. There are several depressive symptoms among the children without mental disorders. The new revisions of BNO and DSM are unable to help the diagnostic of child-depression. He summarizes the most important tasks for the prevention and treatment of child-depression. In the near future a great deal more should be done for prevention and treatment of child-depression than what we have accomplished so far in order to ensure every child the development of sound personality and becoming healthy adult. The deep, ramified, complicated roots of self-destructive behaviour are originated from the early mental abnormalities, primarily from the Conduct, Depressive and Anxiety Disorders. The prevention and treatment of child-depression are unimaginable without (1) the better understand of central nervous system, (2) adequate, exact symptom list (3) a new diagnostic system, (4) exact neuro-psychopharmacology, (5) powerful health-policy, (6) well-trained primary care health system and (7) paramount Child and Youth Dispensaries-network which based on the Evidence Based Medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27824311/"}

The authors used the Motivational Trait Questionnaire to examine 3 components of intrinsic motivation (personal mastery, competitive excellence, motivation related to anxiety). They also examined fluid intelligence, context processing, and working memory, as well as self-reports of mood and personal traits related to motivation. Participants were 66 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 44 healthy controls. Self-reports of personal mastery and competitive excellence did not differ between controls and individuals with schizophrenia, though patients did report significantly higher motivation related to anxiety. Among controls, but not patients, self-reports of intrinsic motivation were strongly related to cognitive performance. In contrast, both controls and patients showed similar strong relationships between self-reports of intrinsic motivation and related measures of mood and personality. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that motivational deficits in schizophrenia reflect impairments in intrinsic motivation. However, they do suggest that the normal relationship between self-reports of intrinsic motivation and cognitive function is disrupted in schizophrenia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19025225/"}

Participants consisted of three types of mother-infant dyads: mothers with comorbid depression and anxiety (n=19), mothers with depression (n=7) and nondepressed mothers (n=24). Maternal behaviors and the quality of relationship were rated on a global scale (NICHD) from video-taped mother-infant interactions. Maternal behaviors rated at six, 12 and 18 months were collapsed into a composite variable maternal style. The quality of the relationship captured as dyadic mutuality was rated at 18 months. Comorbid and depressed mothers showed lower quality in maternal style compared with the nondepressed mothers at six months. Over the follow-up the comorbid mothers were lower in maternal style compared to the nondepressed mothers, but the comorbid mothers increased significantly in maternal style despite elevated depression symptoms. Mean maternal style and infant cognitive skills predicted the quality in relationship at 18 months suggesting that the mother-toddler relationship depends on contributions from the mother and the child. Higher growth in maternal style despite of depression symptoms among comorbid mothers was interpreted against the background that the majority of the comorbid mother-infant dyads received several treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23603820/"}

Additionally, NPY gene impact on amygdala activation during facial emotion processing was analyzed in a subsample of 35 depressed patients. Particularly in anxious depression, the less active NPY rs16147 -399C allele conferred slow response after 2weeks and failure to achieve remission after four weeks of treatment. The rs16147 C allele was further associated with stronger bilateral amygdala activation in response to threatening faces in an allele-dose fashion.

Using information from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), participants reported their lifetime diagnosis of depression and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 to assess current depression and its severity. Our findings indicate that 5.9% of women 65 years old and older have current depression, 94.1% reported either no depressive symptoms or mild depressive symptoms, and 12.3% reported a lifetime diagnosis of depression. Mental health is integral to overall health and well-being and should be treated in older women with the same urgency as physical health. Depression is a mental health issue of particular concern for women, given their increasing numbers, higher proportion in the US population, and role as caregivers.

Study one examined the implementation of standardised HPMH screening with 114 adult clients (Mean age=35.49, SD=9.53; 64% male) telephoning an AOD service over a 5week period. Measures included severity of HPMH problems, AOD use, care plans and referrals. Study two used semistructured interviews with nine staff/managers to evaluate the effectiveness of screening and its impact on service delivery. Ninety-four per cent of clients were identified at risk of anxiety or depression. Most care plans incorporated counselling, and concurrent referrals commonly involved a general practitioner. Staff and management found systematic screening increased identification and understanding of comorbid issues and enhanced client interaction but impacted on resource requirements. Most AOD treatment seekers were identified HPMH comorbid and care plans generally included counselling. Adjunctive referrals were more common for severely depressed clients. Screening was effective and enhanced client rapport. Evaluations revealed low confidence in treating HPMH issues in-house.

Being able to predict treatment response from readily available patient data at presentation has potentially important benefits in aiding decisions about the most suitable interventions for a patient. This paper presents a method of identifying subgroups of patients using latent profile analysis, and comparing response to psychological treatments between these profiles. All outpatients taken into treatment at two psychological treatment services in London, UK and who provided basic demographic information and standardized symptom measures were included in the analysis (n=16636). Latent Profile Analysis was performed on intake data to identify statistically different groups of patients, which were then examined in longitudinal analyses to determine their capacity to predict treatment outcomes. Comparison between profiles showed considerable variation in recovery (74-15%), deterioration rates (5-20%), and levels of attrition (17-40%). Further variation in outcomes was found within the profiles when different intensities of psychological intervention were delivered. Latent profiles were identified using data from two services, so generalisability to other services should be considered. Routinely collected patient data was included, additional patient information may further enhance utility of the profiles. These results suggest that intake data can be used to reliably classify patients into profiles that are predictive of outcome to different intensities of psychological treatment in routine care. Algorithms based on these kinds of data could be used to optimize decision-making and aid the appropriate matching of patients to treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26991365/"}

We predict treatment failure in 12-week regular care ICBT for Depression, Panic disorder and Social anxiety disorder, using only patients' weekly symptom ratings to identify when the accuracy of predictions exceed 2 benchmarks: (a) chance, and (b) empirically derived clinician preferences for actionable predictions. Screening, pretreatment and weekly symptom ratings from 4310 regular care ICBT-patients from the Internet Psychiatry Clinic in Stockholm, Sweden was analyzed in a series of regression models each adding 1 more week of data. Final score was predicted in a holdout test sample, which was then categorized into Success or Failure (failure defined as the absence of both remitter and responder status). Classification analyses with Balanced Accuracy and 95% Confidence intervals was then compared to predefined benchmarks. Benchmark 1 (better than chance) was reached 1 week into all treatments. Social anxiety disorder reached Benchmark 2 (> 65%) at week 5, whereas Depression and Panic Disorder reached it at week 6. For depression, social anxiety and panic disorder, prediction with only patient-rated symptom scores can detect treatment failure 6 weeks into ICBT, with enough accuracy for a clinician to take action. Early identification of failing treatment attempts may be a viable way to increase the overall success rate of existing psychological treatments by providing extra clinical resources to at-risk patients, within a so-called Adaptive Treatment Strategy.

This study examined the association between patient and clinician ratings on perceived improvement and symptomatology changes for an older adult population participating in an ongoing psycho-educational program. Pre-post measures including depression (GDS), anxiety (BAI) and general well-being (GWBS) were collected in a sample of 34 older adults (age = 71.32 ± 6.46 years). Post-testing data included perceived improvement rated by patients, and clinician assessment of depressive symptoms (CS-GDS). Results indicate significant correlations between pre-post changes of the GDS and patients' PIQ (r = -0.37, n = 31, p < 0.05), but not on symptomatic changes of the BAI (r = 0.012, n = 32, p > 0.05) or the GWBS (r = 0.12, n = 31, p > 0.05).

Results imply that pre-post improvement in depressive symptoms is associated with a patient's perceived improvement and that clinician and patient ratings on depression symptoms post-treatment were both inversely correlated to patients' perceived improvement. Findings suggest that the PIQ is a good indicator to assess symptomatic change by patients and clinicians although they are possibly placing attention on different aspects of treatment outcome, as indicated by differences on sub-scales of the PIQ. Clinicians possibly place a strong focus on assessments of depression symptomatology. Future studies may integrate simultaneous assessments of instruments exploring aspects other than depression, especially those examining representations of illness in older adults.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26879663/"}

This is a 3-month prospective, observational study. Ninety-one Chinese patients were enrolled during an acute episode of MDD. Multidimensional Affect and Pain Survey (MAPS) was used to assess the multidimensional aspects of pain. Unidimensional pain intensity was evaluated using verbal rating scale (VRS) and visual analog scale (VAS). Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. The VRS and VAS pain scores were more highly correlated with MAPS somatosensory supercluster than with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and MAPS emotional and well-being superclusters. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that unidimensional pain scores were predicted better by MAPS somatosensory than by emotional clusters. The explained variance of VRS and VAS scores could be improved by 9% to 16% by adding somatosensory clusters after controlling for emotional clusters, whereas 1% to 4% of the variance was improved by adding emotional clusters after controlling for somatosensory clusters. Pain intensity was more closely related to anxiety symptoms than to depressive symptoms cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Our data suggest that pain and emotional symptoms in MDD are not entirely related.

Partial measurement invariance was established for the LMSQ scores across the countries whereas full measurement invariance was achieved across gender. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling was applied to examine the unique contributions of the two looming factors to anxiety and depression symptoms.

To address this gap, we developed and tested a novel treatment combining Mindfulness, Hope Therapy, and biobehavioral components. An uncontrolled, repeated measures design was used. Women (N = 32) with recurrent breast or gynecologic cancers were provided 20 treatment sessions in individual (n = 12) or group (n = 20) formats. On average, participants were middle aged (M = 58) and Caucasian (81%). Independent variables (i.e., hope and mindfulness) and psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, negative mood, worry, and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder) were assessed pre-treatment and 2, 4, and 7 months later. Session-by-session therapy process (positive and negative affect, quality-of-life) and mechanism (use of intervention-specific skills) measures were also included. Distress, anxiety, and negative affect decreased, whereas positive affect and mental-health-related quality-of-life increased over the course of treatment, as demonstrated in mixed-effects models with the intent-to-treat sample. Both hope and mindfulness increased, and use of mindfulness skills was related to decreased anxiety. This treatment was feasible to deliver and was acceptable to patients. The trial serves as preliminary evidence for a multi-component intervention tailored to treat difficulties specific to recurrent cancer. The blending of the components was novel as well as theoretically and practically consistent. A gap in the literature is addressed, providing directions for testing interventions designed for patients coping with the continuing stressors and challenges of cancer recurrence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24884347/"}

The one-, two- or three-factor model fit the data only when controlling for negative item wording. The results are in support of the validity of the original anxiety and depression subscales of the HADS and demonstrate the importance of evaluating item wording effects when examining the factor structure of a questionnaire. The results would also justify the use of the HADS as a single scale of emotional distress.

Interoceptive awareness is an interactive function of anxiety- and depression-specific symptom dimensions.", "text": "Delineating the differential effects of anxiety versus depression on patterns of information processing has proved challenging. The tripartite model of mood disorders (Clark & Watson, 1991) suggests that one way forward is to adopt a dimensional rather than categorical approach, making it possible to explore the main and interaction effects of depression- and anxiety-specific symptoms on a given cognitive-affective process. Here we examined how the interplay of anxiety-specific arousal and depression-specific anhedonia symptoms in the same individuals relate to interoceptive (bodily) awareness. 113 participants with varying levels of mood disorder symptoms completed a heartbeat perception task to assess interoceptive accuracy. Superior interoception was associated with anxiety-specific arousal symptoms, and this relationship held when controlling for depression-specific anhedonia symptoms and shared general distress symptoms. This main effect was qualified by an interaction between anhedonia and arousal. As anhedonia symptoms increased in severity, the relationship between arousal and interoceptive accuracy became less strong. These results further validate the tripartite framework, help clarify the mixed existing literature on interoception in mood disorders, and suggest that considering the unique and interactive effects of different symptom dimensions is a useful strategy to help identify the cognitive-affective profiles associated with anxiety and depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20692645/"}

However scientific research about resilience and coping of refugees is scarce. Especially in the recent refugee crisis, calls have been made to consider factors contributing to coping and resilience in this vulnerable population. Therefore, the current research sought to investigate individual differences that could serve as antecedents of coping and contextual factors that might moderate these effects. Specifically, it took into account individual's self-regulatory differences in terms of regulatory focus (i.e., a promotion focus on nurturance needs, ideals and gains vs. a prevention focus on security needs, oughts and losses). It furthermore explored contextual influences by considering Syrian refugees in Turkey (Sample 1, N = 273) and Germany (Sample 2, N = 169). Compared to Syrian refugees in Turkey, those in Germany had a stronger promotion focus. They also reported more problem-focused and less maladaptive coping, as well as less symptoms. Both promotion and prevention focus were positively related to problem-focused coping. Problem-focused coping, in turn, predicted more symptoms in Turkey but not in Germany. Furthermore, a stronger promotion focus was associated with less symptoms and maladaptive coping was associated with more symptoms in both samples. These results contribute to the coping literature in demonstrating that under certain conditions problem-focused coping can be maladaptive and extend the scarce previous work on self-regulation and coping. Most importantly, they highlight a promotion focus as a clear resilience factor and the role of maladaptive coping in increasing vulnerability. As such, they might inform the design of effective interventions among Syrian refugees and beyond.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30359455/"}

Mindfulness-based therapies teach mindfulness skills designed to decrease emotional reactivity in the face of negative affect-producing stressors. The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms. Fifty-two individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during, and after the stressor. MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST. Waitlist controls showed an increase in anticipatory (pre-stressor) anxiety that was absent in the MBCT group. Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms. Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations. Given that emotional reactivity to stress is an important psychopathological process underlying the chronic and recurrent nature of depression, these findings suggest that mindfulness skills are important in adaptive emotion regulation when coping with stress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22440072/"}

Based on this Basic Act, in 2007, the Japanese government formulated the General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy as a guideline for recommended suicide prevention measures. These General Principles were revised in 2012 in accordance with the initial plan of holding a review after five years. The Basic Act places an emphasis on the various social factors that underlie suicides and takes the perspective that suicide prevention measures are also social measures. The slogan of the revised General Principles is \"Toward Realization of a Society in which Nobody is Driven to Commit Suicide\". The General Principles list various measures that are able to be used universally. These contents would be sufficient if the objective of the General Principles were \"realization of a society that is easy to live in\"; however, the absence of information on the effectiveness and order of priority for each measure may limit the specific effectiveness of the measures in relation to the actual prevention of suicide. In addition, considering that nearly 90% of suicide victims are in a state at the time of committing suicide in which a psychiatric disorder would be diagnosed, it would appear from a psychiatric standpoint that measures related to mental health, including expansion of psychiatric services, should be the top priority in suicide prevention measures. However, this is not the case in the General Principles, in either its original or revised form. Revisions to the General Principles related to clinical psychiatry provide more detailed descriptions of measures for individuals who unsuccessfully attempt suicide and identify newly targeted mental disorders other than depression; however, the overall proportion of contents relating to psychiatric care remains small. In particular, it must be noted that almost no measures are provided for individuals with chronic psychiatric disorders. We believe that the role of academic societies involved in suicide prevention, including our own, is to organize the contents of the General Principles based on evidence, to advance research in areas lacking in evidence, and to promote support for implementation of activities in areas with clear evidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25244732/"}

A large, randomized, multicenter practical trial (International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression) in patients with current nonpsychotic MDD (N = 1,008; 722 completers) had three arms: escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine-extended release. At pretreatment, patients were defined as having anxious (N = 309) versus nonanxious (N = 413) depression and their resting high-frequency HRV (root mean square of successive differences) was assessed. Patients' usual treating clinicians managed medication. At 8 weeks, primary outcomes were clinician-rated depressive symptom response and remission; secondary outcomes were self-reported response and remission. Pretreatment HRV predicted antidepressant outcomes as a function of anxious versus nonanxious depression. In anxious depression, patients with higher HRV had better outcomes, whereas patients with lower HRV had poorer outcomes. In nonanxious depression, patients with lower HRV had better outcomes, whereas patients with higher HRV had poorer outcomes. Some simple effects were not significant. Results did not differ by treatment arm and remained significant when controlling for important covariates. These findings inform a precision medicine approach in which clinical and biological assessments may be integrated to facilitate treatment outcome prediction.

Goethe was one of the most creative writers, productive scientists, and effective statesmen that ever lived. His descriptions of feelings, emotions, and mental states related to anxieties, depressive episodes, dysthymia, and creativity are unique in their phenomenological precision and richness. His life and work can thus serve as an excellent example enhancing our understanding of the relationship between anxiety, depression and creativity. Furthermore, he described (self-)therapeutic strategies that reinforce and refine modern views. Goethe's self-assessments in his works and letters, and the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of current psychiatric classification. His therapeutic techniques and recommendations are compared with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and existential psychotherapy to amplify modern concepts of psychotherapy. From a scientific perspective, several distinctive depressive episodes can be diagnosed in Goethe's life. They were characterized by extended depressive moods, lack of drive, and loss of interest and self-esteem combined with social retreat. Goethe displayed diffuse and phobic anxieties as well as dysthymia. His (self-)therapeutic strategies were: (a) the systematic use of helping alliances, (b) behavioral techniques, (c) cognitive reflection on meanings and beliefs, (d) psychodynamic and psychoanalytic remembering, repeating, and working through, and (e) existential striving for self-actualization, social commitment, meaning, and creativity. In Goethe's life, creative incubation, illumination, and elaboration appear to have been associated with psychic instability and dysthymia, sometimes with depressive episodes in a clinical sense. On the one hand, his creative work was triggered by anxieties, dysthymia, and depressive moods. On the other hand, his creativity helped him to cope with psychic disorders and suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, Goethe described psychotherapeutic strategies that resemble modern techniques. He integrated relational, behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic, and existential techniques and attitudes. These modern psychotherapeutic approaches can be exemplified and enhanced by reflecting upon the (self-)therapeutic efforts of one of the most creative persons that have ever lived. Hermeneutics as the art of communication and understanding derived from Goethe's (self-)therapy and creative works can serve as a meta-theoretical framework for the integration of different psychotherapeutic approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23208149/"}

We analyzed whether the presence of a comorbid AD was moderating the effectiveness of disorder-specific (CBASP) versus nonspecific psychotherapy (supportive therapy [SP]) on depressive symptoms (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD-24]) in a sample of unmedicated early-onset PDD outpatients (N = 268). Secondary outcomes were response and remission of depressive symptoms and the extent of interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems [IIP-64]). The superiority of CBASP over SP was significantly stronger in PDD patients with comorbid AD compared to patients without AD (in HRSD-24 and IIP-64). There was no significant moderation for remission or response of depressive symptoms. Our hypothesis of a moderating effect of comorbid AD was confirmed. The main limitation might be the exclusion criteria of our sample limiting the generalizability. The major strength is the systematic analysis of the effect of AD in treating early-onset PDD with high quality of psychotherapy in both arms of this trial.

Correlation coefficients between PHQ-15 score and the measures of anxiety, depression, stress and mental/physical exhaustion indicate satisfactory validity. Normative data for PHQ-15 scores as well as for categories of somatic symptom severity are provided. The favorable psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the PHQ-15 suggest use of this instrument for quantification of somatization in Swedish and similar populations, and has the advantage of available normative data.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23294182/"}

We therefore aimed to identify a parsimonious combination of parent-reported symptoms that accurately detected offspring MDD. We used a multi-sample study comprising a development sample of 335 offspring of adults with recurrent MDD assessed on three occasions (mean age 12.4-14.8 years) and an independent validation sub-sample of 807 adolescents from a general population cohort (mean age 13.1 years). Parent ratings of psychiatric symptoms in adolescent offspring were assessed using established questionnaires. The best performing four-item combination of symptoms was identified. Accuracy in detecting concurrent DSM-IV MDD diagnosis, assessed by direct adolescent and parent interviews, was compared to the well-established 13-item short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (sMFQ) using ROC curve analysis. The combination identified (concentration problems, anhedonia, worrying excessively and feeling unloved) performed equivalently to the sMFQ both in the development dataset and in the validation dataset.

In this study, the psychometric properties of the Dutch FFMQ were assessed in a sample of 376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and by relating the FFMQ to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being, experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism and openness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the FFMQ (FFMQ-SF) was developed and assessed in the same sample and cross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia. Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for a correlated five-factor structure of the FFMQ and good model fit for the structure of the FFMQ-SF. The replicability of the five-factor structure of the FFMQ-SF was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Both instruments proved highly sensitive to change.

Insecure attachment styles are also etiologically related to depression; and, therefore, by extension, those who are insecurely attached may engage in excessive gambling behaviors to cope with depression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate this and to this end predicted that depression severity and coping motives for gambling would conjointly mediate the relations between insecure attachment styles and PG. Data came from a larger investigation of PG within mood disorders. Participants exhibited a lifetime depressive or bipolar disorder and endorsed a mood episode within the past ten years. Participants (N=275) completed self-report measures during a two-day assessment. Path analysis supported two main indirect effects. First, anxious attachment predicted elevated depression, which in turn predicted increased coping motives for gambling, which subsequently predicted greater PG severity. Second, this double mediational pathway was also observed for avoidant attachment. Results suggest that insecure attachment relates to PG via depressive symptoms and coping-related gambling motives. Mood symptoms and associated gambling motives are malleable and are promising targets of gambling interventions for insecurely attached individuals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29175293/"}

The sample included a total of 447 probands recruited from a clinically enriched community screening and their 2082 adult living and deceased first-degree relatives. A best estimate diagnostic procedure that was based on either direct semistructured interview or structured family history information from multiple informants regarding non-interviewed relatives was employed. Results revealed that there was specificity of familial aggregation of bipolar I (BP I; odds ratio (OR)=8.40; 3.27-20.97; h2=0.83) and major depressive disorder (OR=2.26; 1.58-3.22; h2=0.20), but not BP II. The familial aggregation of BP I was primarily attributable to the familial specificity of manic episodes after adjusting for both proband and relative comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders. There was no significant cross-aggregation between mood disorder subtypes suggesting that the familial transmission of manic and major depressive episodes is independent despite the high magnitude of comorbidity between these mood states. These findings confirm those of earlier studies of the familial aggregation of bipolar disorder and major depression in the first nonclinical sample, and the largest family study of bipolar disorder in the USA using contemporary nonhierarchical diagnostic criteria for mood and anxiety disorders. The results suggest that these major components of bipolar disorder may represent distinct underlying pathways rather than increasingly severe manifestations of a common underlying diathesis. Therefore, dissection of the broad bipolar phenotype in genetic studies could actually generate new findings that could index novel biologic pathways underlying bipolar disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126930/"}

To prevent these outcomes, school-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been developed, but few studies include active control conditions. We evaluated a preventive CBT program targeting internalizing symptoms relative to an activity contrast condition post-intervention and at 1-year follow-up. One thousand one hundred and thirty-nine children from Grades 3-6 from a diverse sample of schools, were screened with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and Children's Depression Inventory. Those with t>60 on either measure were offered participation in a randomized 12-week trial, school-based group CBT versus a structured after-school activity group of equal duration. We explored several therapeutic elements as potential predictors of change. One hundred and forty-eight children participated (84 boys, 64 girls; 78 CBT, 70 contrast; 57% Caucasian) and 145 completed the program. Self-reported anxious and depressive symptoms decreased significantly over time (η(2)=.15 and .133, respectively), with no group by time interaction. There was a trend toward fewer children meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule at 1-year post-CBT than post-contrast (6/76 versus 12/69). Positive reinforcement of child behavior was associated with change in anxiety symptoms; checking homework was understood with change in depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that children with internalizing symptoms may benefit from both school-based CBT and structured activity programs. Replication, longer follow-up, and further studies of therapeutic elements in child CBT are indicated.

Bond congruence-outcome associations were examined on the within- and between-dyad level for 580 patients (mainly depression and anxiety) receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy. Symptom change was assessed on a session-to-session level as well as from pre- to posttreatment. For the between-dyad analyses, the truth and bias model was applied. For the within-dyad analyses, polynomial regression and response surface analysis were conducted. On the between-dyad level, higher temporal congruence between patients' and therapists' bond ratings (i.e., their correlation) was associated with better treatment outcomes. Additionally, the average discrepancy between therapists' and patients' bond ratings showed a significant quadratic association with treatment outcome. A tendency for therapists to moderately rate the bond lower than their patients' showed lowest posttreatment symptom scores. On the within-dyad level, we found that when patients' and therapists' ratings were in \"agreement,\" higher bond scores were associated with fewer next-session symptoms. For \"disagreement,\" the results showed that if therapists rated the bond as weak, whereas their patients rated it as strong, higher subsequent symptom distress was observed than if patients rated the bond as weak and their therapists rated it as strong.

Early-life stress has also been linked with an increased risk to develop different psychopathologies later in life. We have previously shown that perinatal protein malnutrition in mice leads to the appearance of anxiety-related behaviors in the adulthood. We also found evidence that the female offspring was more susceptible to the development of depression-related behaviors. In the present work, we further investigated this behavior together with its molecular bases. We focused our study on the hippocampus, as it is a structure involved in coping with stressful situations. We found an increase in immobility time in the forced swimming test in perinatally malnourished females, and an alteration in the expression of genes related with neuroplasticity, early growth response 1, calcineurin and c-fos.

The Youth Depression Alleviation-Combined Treatment (YoDA-C) trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trial. Participants were aged 15-25 years with moderate-to-severe MDD and had sought care at one of four clinical centres in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia.

Research thus far has focused on the functional significance of cognitive rather than affective balance. Within this framework, we hypothesized that patients in untreated episodes of major depression would balance their positive and negative affects at the same level where depressed patients in other studies have balanced their positive and negative cognitions--namely, at P/(P + N) approximately 0.37.

A principal component analysis of the initial 16-item rating scale indicated that a single component explained 55.9% of the variance, with major and exclusive contributions from 9 items, which were retained in the final 9-item Subjective Thought Overactivation Questionnaire (STOQ; Cronbach's α = 0.95). Total score correlated significantly with activation, depression and perceived conflict subscales of the Internal State Scale (ISS; rs = 0.57-0.66, p < 0.001). It was associated with decreased well-being (ISS; rs = -0.48, p = 0.001) and increased state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; rs = 0.60, p < 0.001). The STOQ score was significantly higher in patients than in healthy subjects. It allowed distinguishing between ISS mood states, with the highest median score in mixed states. Sample size, representativeness, possible bias in qualitative analysis, and quality of expert consensus. Qualitative analysis of clinical interviews, together with a new short rating scale, contributed to a documentation of subjective thought overactivation, an important but often undetected feature in mood disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24107841/"}

Therefore, it is important to clarify the underlying neurophysiology of these two symptom groups to optimize treatment. We developed an interpretable deep-learning framework based on two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to diagnose depression from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging data recorded during an autobiographical memory test (AMT) from 824 participants. This system was designed to discriminate between individuals with depressed symptoms (N = 127) and healthy controls (N = 697) and identify AD (N = 72) and NAD (N = 55). Besides, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to discover discriminative biomarkers for AD symptoms. Positive episode recall features effectively distinguished depressed symptoms with the highest accuracy of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.90, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84. Conversely, negative episode recall features achieved the highest accuracy of 0.91, sensitivity of 0.80, specificity of 0.85, and an AUC of 0.91 for identifying AD symptoms. These performances were based on a five-fold cross-validation procedure. Based on the SHAP-derived analyses, the most influential channels contributing to AD symptom prediction were located within the right hemisphere. This study revealed that the hemodynamic hypo-activation of negative emotional valence in the right frontal pole area (rFPA) may contribute to AD symptom prediction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40158273/"}

Partial correlations controlling for GAD diagnosis indicated that worry correlated with higher depression and poorer overall well-being in the Depressed, Bipolar-Depressed, and Psychosis groups and decreased functioning in the Depressed, Bipolar-Manic, and Psychosis groups. Depressed and Bipolar-Depressed groups endorsed the highest level of worry. A comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with higher worry across primary diagnoses, even after controlling for GAD.

However, such an instrument would be a useful tool in subtyping depression and selecting the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for each patient. The neurocircuitry theory describes the biochemical and neuroanatomic background associated with the major symptoms of depression. Based on the neurocircuitry theory, our team has developed a new instrument, the Depression Profile, to selectively assess depressive symptom clusters associated with different neurotransmitter systems and neuroanatomic structures. The aim of our study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics of Depression Profile. 339 patients consecutively admitted with DSM-IV major depression in our hospital completed the Depression Profile in the first two weeks of their hospitalisation. 81 patients in an adult outpatient unit also completed the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. Internal consistency of Depression Profile was tested with item analysis. The external validity of Depression Profile against the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale was tested using Pearson correlations. The internal consistency of Depression Profile proved to be excellent. The Cronbach alpha values of the scales met the expectable minimum level derived from the number of items in the scales. In testing for convergent validity, all Pearson correlation coefficients between Depression profile subscales and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale were significant and moderate to high which indicates the good external validity of our instrument. The initial psychometric evaluation of Depression Profile indicates that our instrument has good reliability and internal and external validity. The instrument also proved to be useful in clinical work to aid the choice of medications and determine the subtype of depressive episodes. Further studies, possibly with biochemical and neuroimaging methodology are needed to validate the 9 main symptom clusters of the Depression Profile subscales with respect to their neuroanatomical and neurochemical bases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20606243/"}

Indeed, variations in the availability of these resources, especially mastery, provide a largely, if not entirely, adequate explanation for the SES-depressive symptoms relationship and accounts for nearly half of the SES-Major Depressive Disorder relationship.

Four hundred and four Italian adult LTCSs completed a battery of questionnaires including the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale and the State Anxiety sub-scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory respectively for depression and anxiety assessment. 16.5% of the sample displayed mild depression, 11.1% moderate depression, and 7.1% severe depression. depression was negatively associated with education (p = .017), perceived social support as provided by the family (p = .028), and perceived social support provided by friends (p = .008), and it was positively associated with occupational status (p = .023), presence of health issues (p = .010), and anxiety (p < .001). 8.7 and 15.8% of the sample were respectively possible and probable cases of anxiety. Anxiety was negatively associated with occupational status (p = .038) and it was positively associated with depression (p < .001). These data support ongoing assessment and monitoring of depression and anxiety in LTCSs, and stimulate the development and testing of psychological interventions for such individuals. In addition, they encourage further study on the psychological health of this specific population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27003472/"}

It can be noted that with GHQ-12, the presence of non-psychotic mental disorders does not come out: just the females' group, experimental and control, shows some problems with insomnia and stress. On the other hand, with PHQ, the presence of no great entity depressive symptoms comes out for all groups. In the experimental groups the quantity of depressive symptoms is greater than in the control groups. We have find the presence of a number of depressive symptoms into a hospitalized population.

Similar questions were examined regarding academic competence. The sample was 110 clinic-referred youth aged 8-16 years (65 boys, 45 girls; M age = 11.15, SD = 2.57). In the social acceptance area, both youth self-perceptions and mother-perceptions had independent and unique relations to depression and social anxiety, before and after controlling for comorbid symptoms. In the academic domain, both youth self-perceptions and mother-perceptions had independent and unique relations to depression, before and after controlling for social anxiety; yet only youth self-perceptions were related to social anxiety, before, but not after controlling for depression. For depression, larger effect sizes were observed for children's perceived, versus mother-reported, social acceptance and academic competence. Bootstrapping and Sobel tests found youth self-perceptions of social acceptance mediated the relation between mothers' perceptions and each of youth depression and social anxiety; and perceived academic competence mediated the relation between mothers' perceptions and youth depression, both before and after controlling for social anxiety.

At a global level, over 300 million people are estimated to suffer from major depressive disorders, equivalent to 4·4% of the world's population. Pandemic era stressors have increased rates for depression and anxiety by upwards of 25%. The goal of this study is to estimate the prevalence and economic burden of depression and anxiety symptoms in Singapore after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. An existing web panel was queried between April 2022 and June 2022. Adult participants aged > 21 years old who screened positive for depression and anxiety symptoms based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) Screener were eligible for participation. Prevalence estimates were quantified by dividing the number of respondents who screened positive for these symptoms by the total number of respondents. Participants who screened positive were asked about healthcare utilization, days missed from work, and reduced productivity due to these symptoms. These values were then monetized and scaled based on prevalence and population counts to generate per capita and total annual costs. Two thousand three hundred forty-eight respondents filled out the PHQ-4 depression/anxiety screener on behalf of the 5,725 adults living in their households (including respondents themselves). Prevalence estimates were calculated based on the responses recorded for these 5,725 adults. 14.1% adults had symptoms consistent with depression and 15.2% had symptoms consistent with anxiety. In total, 20.0% may experience symptoms consistent with at least one of these two conditions, yet approximately half reported never being formally diagnosed. 350 respondents screened positive for depression or anxiety symptoms and thus were eligible to fill out the healthcare utilization, presenteeism, and absenteeism survey. Direct annual healthcare costs due to depression and anxiety symptoms averaged Singapore dollar (SGD) $1,050 for these respondents. The employed subset (n = 304) missed an extra 17.7 days of work on average per year, which translates to SGD $4,980 per worker. These workers also reported being ~ 40% less productive at work, which equates to SGD $28,720 in economic losses annually. In total, these symptoms caused SGD $15.7 billion in increased costs. Presenteeism accounts for 81.6% of this total (SGD $12.8 billion), absenteeism for 14.2% (SGD $2.3 billion) and healthcare accounts for 4.2% (SGD $0.7 billion). The health and economic burden associated with depression and anxiety symptoms is large in Singapore, representing 2.9% of Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP). Employers and governments should look to identify effective remediation strategies, including strategies to address the high rates of undiagnosed cases. Increasing psychiatric resources, general practitioner mental health competency, access to peer support, and increased efforts to reduce mental health stigma should be considered to address this growing public health crisis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36782116/"}

A possible reason is that those with prior anxiety or depression may be more likely to exit the labour force prior to retirement age, but evidence has been mixed and limited. Our objective was to compare risk of early labour force exit between employed adults with a history of depression or anxiety versus those without, separately for men and women. We used data from the Baltimore Epidemiological Catchment Area Follow-up Cohort, which collected baseline data in 1981 and follow-up data 1993-1996 and 2004-2005. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the relative risk of labour force exit comparing those with versus without prior history of anxiety or depressive disorders. Women with prior anxiety or depression are at 37% increased risk of dropping out of the labour force as compared to women without, controlling for age, socioeconomic status, race and marital status (HR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.79).

It is possible that childhood anxiety typically precedes depression in girls. Comparing of the predictive utility of symptoms of anxiety with the predictive utility of symptoms of depression from early childhood to early adolescence is needed to test this hypothesis. Data from a population-based sample of 2,451 girls were used to examine age-related changes and year-to-year stability within and across symptoms of major depression, separation anxiety, and generalized/social anxiety by maternal report from ages 6 to 12. In addition, the predictive utility of symptoms of major depression, separation anxiety, and generalized/social anxiety at ages 7-10 years of age to depressive disorders at ages 11-13 was tested. Symptoms of separation anxiety demonstrated a linear decrease, depression symptoms a linear increase and symptoms of generalized/social anxiety an increase from 6-8, a plateau 8-10, followed by a decrease from 10-12 years. Year-to-year changes in symptoms of major depression were best predicted by depressive symptoms in the previous year, although a small amount of additional variance was accounted for by separation anxiety symptoms in early childhood and generalized/social anxiety symptoms in mid to later childhood. Age 8 was the earliest age from which depressive disorders in early adolescence could be predicted from symptoms of depression and generalized social anxiety. Homotypic continuity of depression and anxiety symptoms from early childhood to early adolescence is more common in girls than heterotypic continuity. Some additional information about year-to-year changes in depression symptoms and later depressive disorder is gained by assessing anxiety symptoms.

Confirmatory factor analyses suggested that unidimensional factor structures adequately matched observed face-to-face and telephone data for the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Invariance analyses revealed that while the PHQ-9 had equivalent factor loadings and latent means across data collection methods, the GAD-7 had equivalent factor loadings but unequal latent means. In support of the scales' convergent validity, positive associations between scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 emerged. With the exception of the GAD-7's latent means, the questionnaires' factor loadings and latent means were equivalent. This suggests that clinicians may meaningfully compare PHQ-9 data collected face-to-face and by telephone; however, such comparisons with the GAD-7 should be done with caution.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24117915/"}

Seventy-eight (82% female) adult outpatients with major depression and co-occurring anxiety were assessed at each of 16 outpatient treatment sessions using the Hamilton rating scales for depression and anxiety. On average, depressive symptoms declined in a quadratic form over the course of treatment. While the association between anxiety and depression was modest early in treatment, it strengthened over the middle and latter treatment phases. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that while IPT and IPT-PS were similarly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, IPT-PS may be more effective at uncoupling the association between core anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Existing studies predominantly used categorical rather than dimensional approaches, the latter of which better addresses clinical comorbidity and heterogeneity. Moreover, there is little evidence on the role of HRV in longitudinal symptom trajectory in adolescents and young adults. The current study examined the association between HRV and internalizing symptom trajectory using a dimensional approach-the tri-level model of depression and anxiety. Adolescents and young adults (N = 362) were recruited in a 3-year longitudinal study, where they completed electrocardiogram recordings and self-report symptom questionnaires. Multilevel modeling was conducted with high-frequency power bands (HF power) of interbeat intervals at baseline as the predictor, and tri-level symptom factors over 3 years as the outcome. HF power significantly predicted the trajectory of the broad General Distress symptom factor, but not the intermediate Fears or Anhedonia-Apprehension symptom factors. Higher HF power was associated with a decline in General Distress over time. This association was held when neuroticism, other tri-level symptom factors, and demographic variables were covaried. That is, greater parasympathetic nervous system activity at baseline was significantly associated with a greater decline in the broad internalizing symptom factor, but not symptom factors that are more specific to depressive or anxiety disorders.

Demographic and clinical characteristics were examined in association with symptom changes via bivariate and multiple regression models adjusted for W-MA-02 utilization. Characteristics included age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, sexual orientation, employment status, health insurance, baseline levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and concurrent psychotherapeutic or psychotropic medication treatments during the study. Both the depressive and anxiety subsamples were predominantly female, educated, non-Hispanic white, and averaged 38 and 37 years of age, respectively.

Research investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in affective disorders has been met with great enthusiasm, offering promising direction for novel therapeutics in conditions such as depression. We encourage further systematic reviews in this space, particularly which consider research quality and incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32469834/"}

Summary sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated for each study. Random effects meta-analytic pooling across studies at the recommended clinical (7/8) and research (10/11) cutoff points was undertaken and summary receiver operating characteristic curves constructed. For major depressive disorders, a cut point of ≥8 gave a sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.89) and a specificity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60-0.84) and a cut point ≥11 gave a sensitivity of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.40-0.71) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.79-0.97). Many studies have shown that the HADS is a useful screening tool to identify emotional distress in nonpsychiatric patients.

Anxiety and depression have been associated with HIV medication nonadherence, yet little research has assessed distinct components of anxiety and depression as risk factors of HIV medication nonadherence. The current study examined distinct symptom components of anxiety and depression as predictors of HIV medication non-adherence among women living with HIV and childhood sexual abuse enrolled in a coping intervention. This secondary analysis included a sample of 85 women living with HIV and childhood sexual abuse and being prescribed antiretroviral medication who completed measures on anxiety, depression, and medication adherence. Results from a logistic regression analysis suggest that distinct components of anxiety may be related to medication nonadherence among this population.

The present research study is a secondary study based on these data and archival data from the 2015 study. For analysis, multivariate analysis of covariance was used. Additionally, predictors of IPV were evaluated using linear regression. A total of 2091 married women were surveyed. The participants were divided into abused women (n = 512, 24.5%) and non-abused women (n = 1579, 75.5%). The pattern of IPV among our patients showed more instances of psychological aggression than physical assault, sexual coercion or injury. Our results show that the non-psychotic psychiatric disorders of the victims were significantly impaired in all aspects, including somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression. Except social dysfunction, the psychological and sexual abuse were significant predictors of other aspects of mental health. Our findings suggest that risk of IPV is high in this population. They also indicate that various forms of abuse are different from each other in terms of predicting a victim's mental health. Different strategies may be required to reduce and prevent this violence.

A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted. 48 studies of CBT for depressive or anxiety disorders (n=6926) that specified that their control group received TAU were identified. Most (n=45/48) provided an explanation of the TAU group however there was significant heterogeneity amongst TAU conditions. The meta-analysis showed medium effects favoring CBT over TAU for both anxiety (g=0.69, 95% CI 0.47-0.92, p<0.001, n=1318) and depression (g=0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.90, p<0.001, n=5054), with differential effects observed across TAU conditions.

Forty-eight individual CHI parents (75% female) completed self-reported questionnaires and screening tools for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), PQoL (ULQIE), and family burden (FaBeL). Additional data on sociodemographics, social support, and child- and disease-related data were recorded. 29.8% of parents showed major depressive symptoms and 38.3% had a probable general anxiety disorder, including 20.8% who had both. The family burden was moderate and assessment of PQoL yielded average scores. Neurological impairment in an affected child (p = .002 and p < .001, respectively) and lower working hours (p = .001 and p = .012, respectively) were the strongest predictors of worse GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores. Furthermore, lower working hours (p = .012) and comorbidities in the affected child (p = .007) were significantly associated with lower PQoL. Mothers had worse GAD-7 scores (p = .006) and lower PQoL (p = .035) than fathers. Indication of sleep disturbance was associated with worse PHQ-8 scores (p = .003), higher family burden (p = .039), and reduced PQoL (p = .003). A higher number of caretakers besides parents was associated with decreased family burden (p = .019), improved PQoL (p < .001), and lower scores for anxiety (p = .016) and depressive (p = .021) symptoms.    Conclusion: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are alarmingly prevalent in parents of children with CHI. Psychological screening of parents should be initiated to ensure early identification of psychological strains and psychosocial support should be offered as needed. A good support network and regular work activities can improve parental mental health and well-being. What is Known: • Psychosocial strains and reduced quality of life are common in parents of chronically ill children. What is New: • In this first study evaluating mental health, family burden, and quality of life in parents of children with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), symptoms of depression and anxiety were alarmingly prevalent. • Parents of children with CHI should receive regular psychological screening and psychosocial support should be offered as needed. A good support network and regular work activities can improve parental mental health and well-being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35507217/"}

Evidence is scarce about whether reserves (be they cognitive, economic or relational) protect people's mental health in situations of temporary stress. Based on a cohort study following undocumented migrants undergoing a stressful life course transition (regularisation with local authorities), we identified which resources and reserves, and which types, better protect mental health. To examine whether reserves, and which types, are prospectively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, whether this association is independent of resources, and whether reserves modify the effect of regularisation on anxiety and depressive symptoms. A two-wave cohort study followed 456 undocumented migrants (mean age 44 years) from 2017 to 2020, half (48%) of whom were involved in a pilot regularisation policy implemented by the local authorities of Geneva, Switzerland. Anxiety was measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Economic, cognitive and relational reserves were measured at baseline, as well as economic and relational resources. Generalised Estimating Equations tested the associations of reserves and resources with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and the interaction between reserves/resources and regularisation status. Economic and relational reserves were associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms, independent of economic and relational resources. Cognitive reserves were not associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms. Regularised participants reported lower anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to non-regularised undocumented participants. Reserves did not modify the effect of regularisation on anxiety and depressive symptoms. The provision of reserves for undocumented migrants may protect mental health but may not alter the impact of regularisation on mental health.

Three hundred fifty-four randomly selected Chinese male subjects aged ≥ 65 years and living in the community were enrolled. CVC was measured using a frequency-domain index of heart rate variability. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the flat tripartite model of HADS provided a modest advantage in model fit when compared with other theoretical factor solutions. In the flat tripartite model, there was a significant negative association between anhedonic depression and CVC. In contrast, autonomic anxiety showed a significant positive correlation with CVC. In the hierarchical tripartite model, negative affectivity was not directly associated with CVC; instead, it had positive and negative indirect effects on CVC via autonomic anxiety and anhedonic depression, respectively. As scores for negative affectivity increased, these specific indirect effects diminished. Among competing models of co-occurring depression and anxiety, constructs from tripartite models demonstrate fair conformity with the data but unique and distinct correlations with CVC. Negative affectivity may determine the relationship of anhedonic depression and autonomic anxiety with CVC. Separating affective symptoms under the constructs of the tripartite models helps disentangle complex associations between co-occurring depression and anxiety with CVC.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22846457/"}

This is in part mediated by maladaptive parenting. Females are more vulnerable to parenting behavior and were found to be at increased risk of depression compared to male offspring of depressed parents. Previous work suggested a reduced risk for depression in the offspring of parents with remitted depression. Offspring gender differences in this association were rarely considered. Here, we are examining the hypothesis that female offspring are more likely to benefit from treating parental depression using data from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). The NCS-R is a nationally representative household survey of adults 18 years and older carried out between February 2001 and April 2003. The World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO WMH-CIDI) was used to assess DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Multiple logistic regressions were used to assess the association between parental treatment and offspring risk for MDD. An interaction term was added to study the effect of offspring's gender on this risk. The age-adjusted odds ratio for treatment of parental depression was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.72). There was no effect modification by gender (p = 0.42). Surprisingly, treatment of parental depression did not reduce their offspring's risk for depression. Gender of the offspring had no effect on the risk of depression in the adult offspring of treated versus untreated depressed parents.

Several relationships between RNT forms and symptom levels were indirectly predicted by the focusing subscale of attentional control; however, the patterns of these relationships differed based on the disorder.

Twenty-one women (7.5%) were diagnosed as affected by PD, of whom 12 (57.1%) showed MD or md comorbidity. The development of PD without depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous episodes of Anxiety Disorders while the development of PD plus depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous depressive episodes and by the lack of familiar support. Given the small sample size of our anxious and depressed women, the present data need to be verified by using larger samples. The frequent association between PD and MD or md, the analysis of risk factors and of temporal relationship strongly suggests that the panic-depressive comorbidity might represent in fact depressive disorders with intense anxiety symptoms.

Five postnatal stress trajectories were identified. In females, medium to high chronic stress exposure or exposure during puberty/adolescence predicted depression and anxiety symptoms while low or reduced stress exposure over the life course did not, after adjustment for relevant confounders. High stress early in pregnancy contributed to male depression/anxiety symptoms independent of postnatal stress trajectory.

A mixed sample of 188 participants with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or no psychopathology completed self-report PT measures. Participants were also interviewed, providing a natural language sample. We examined language features associated with PT, then built a language-based PT model and examined its predictive power. PT was associated with multiple language features, most notably I-usage (e.g., \"I\", \"me\"; β = 0.25) and negative emotion language (e.g., \"anxiety\", \"difficult\"; β = 0.19). In machine learning analyses, language features accounted for 14% of the variance in self-reported PT. Language-based PT predicted the presence and severity of depression and anxiety, psychiatric comorbidity, and treatment seeking, with effects in the r = 0.15-0.41 range.

Anxiety increased the latency of sleep and REM sleep; and decreased the length of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep; while depressive symptoms were associated with reduced REM latency, slow-wave sleep and increased REM duration. The length of slow-wave sleep, REM phase decreased with ageing and the sleep was fragmented. Women had more slow-wave sleep and less REM sleep than men. Normal order of sleep stages is essential in the cognitive processing of the brain. Changes in sleep macrostructure may have an impact in the impairment of cognitive functions of patients suffering from anxiety or depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26485745/"}

In this study, we examined the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and its association with cancer survival over time. Participants were 467 consecutive adult cancer patients attending oncology follow-ups at a single academic medical centre. Assessment consisted of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision. Comparison between co-morbid psychiatric cases and non-cases was made in follow-ups of up to 24 months. Of the 467 patients, 217 of 220 patients with elevated total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores (≥16) met the criteria for an Axis I disorder at 6 months follow-up, with 102 of the follow-up sample having a persistent diagnosable psychiatric disorder after 1 year. The most frequent initial diagnoses were minor depression (17.6%), major depressive disorder (15.8%) and adjustment disorder (15.8%). Cancer patients without psychiatric morbidity had a survival benefit of 2.24 months or 67 days. Mean survival at 24 months was 20.87 months (95% CI 20.06-21.69) for cancer patients with psychiatric morbidity versus 23.11 months (95% CI 22.78-23.43) for those without (p < 0.001 for log rank). After adjusting for demographics and cancer stage on a Cox proportional hazards model, psychiatric morbidity remained associated with worse survival (hazard ratio 4.13, 95% CI 1.32-12.92, p = 0.015). This study contributes to the growing body of evidence linking psychiatric morbidity to cancer mortality. Treating underlying psychiatric conditions in cancer may therefore improve not just quality of life but also survival.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25345781/"}

We undertook the study to investigate the relationship between depressive symptomatology and the core clinical features of GTS in a well-characterized clinical population of youth with this disorder. Our aim was to verify the association between depression and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder and explore further other potential associations highlighted in some, but not all, of the studies focused on this topic. Our results demonstrated that (1) the GTS patients were significantly older than the controls, (2) the GTS patients were significantly more depressed than controls, (3) depression was associated with tic severity, (4) the Diagnostic Confidence Index scores were higher in GTS patients without depression, (5) anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), and behavioral problems were significantly associated with depression, and (6) finally, patients with GTS and depression have a positive family history of depression. However, obsessionality (CY-BOCS) did not differentiate between depressed and not depressed GTS patients. Depression is common in patients with GTS and occurs significantly more in GTS than in controls. Depression is significantly associated with GTS factors such as tic severity, comorbidity with ADHD, and the presence of coexistent anxiety, CDs, and behavior problems. Depression is importantly significantly associated with a positive family history of depression.

We conducted a retrospective study to try to clarify this uncertainty. Demographic, illness-related and behavioral variables were obtained from a neuropsychiatric database of 896 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MS. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were obtained with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Gender comparisons were undertaken and predictors of depression and anxiety sought with a linear regression analysis. HADS data were available for 711 of 896 (79.35%) patients. Notable gender differences included a higher frequency of primary progressive MS in males (p = 0.002), higher HADS anxiety scores in females (p < 0.001), but no differences in HADS depression scores. In MS, gender influences the frequency of anxiety only.

Of the dimensions of Harm avoidance, Anticipatory worry and Fatigability had the strongest effects. Symptoms of depression and anxiety showed very similar underlying temperament patterns. Although Harm avoidance and Pessimism appear to be important endophenotype candidates for depression and anxiety, their potential usefulness as endophenotypes, and whether they meet all the suggested criteria for endophenotypes will remain to be confirmed in future studies. Personality characteristics of Pessimism and Harm avoidance, in particular its dimensions Anticipatory worry and Fatigability, are strongly related to symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as to depressive disorder in this population.

Animal models of depression are efficient in detecting effective treatments but have done little to increase the reach of antidepressant drugs. This may be because most animal models of depression target the reversal of stress-induced behavioural change, whereas treatment-resistant depression is typically associated with risk factors that predispose to the precipitation of depressive episodes by relatively low levels of stress. Therefore, the search for treatments for resistant depression may require models that incorporate predisposing factors leading to heightened stress responsiveness. Using a diathesis-stress framework, we review developmental, genetic and genomic models against four criteria: (i) increased sensitivity to stress precipitation of a depressive behavioural phenotype, (ii) resistance to chronic treatment with conventional antidepressants, (iii) a good response to novel modes of antidepressant treatment (e.g. ketamine; deep brain stimulation) that are reported to be effective in treatment-resistant depression and (iv) a parallel to a known clinical risk factor. We identify 18 models that may have some potential. All require further validation. Currently, the most promising are the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and congenital learned helplessness (cLH) rat strains, the high anxiety behaviour (HAB) mouse strain and the CB1 receptor knockout and OCT2 null mutant mouse strains.

However, conceptual accounts of depression suggest this might differ in clinical depression. In this study, the diversity of negative and positive emotion experiences as remembered by a recurrently depressed sample and a never-depressed control group were compared. Emodiversity was assessed using a life structure card sort task which allowed for the assessment of memory for emotional experience over the life course. Depressed (n=34) and non-depressed (n=34) participants completed the card sort task, from which emodiversity metrics were calculated for negative and positive emotion experience. Depressed individuals showed recollections of enhanced emodiversity across negative emotion but reduced emodiversity across positive emotion, relative to never-depressed individuals. This study involved a relatively small sample size. This study indicates that greater diversity of negative emotion experience, which has been interpreted as a protective factor against depressed mood in community samples (Quoidbach et al., 2014), instead characterises the remembered experience of recurrent clinical depression. The finding that positive emodiversity is adaptive in depression suggests that therapeutic outcomes may be improved by facilitating exposure to a diverse range of positive emotions. These findings indicate that the relationship between emotion diversity and mental health is more complex than hitherto assumed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32421590/"}

Fisher et al., estimated the prevalence of depression and anxiety at 15.6% during the antenatal and 19.8% during the postpartum period. Their impact on maternal and child health is well-recognized among the public health community, accounting for high societal costs. The public health impact of these conditions has highlighted the need to focus on the development and provision of effective prevention and treatment strategies.In recent decades, some advances have been made in the development of effective universal and targeted screening programmes for perinatal depression and anxiety disorders. Recent research has shown potential benefits of universal and targeted screening for perinatal depression, to identify and treat undiagnosed cases, and help thwart its deleterious consequences. Ethical implications, however, for these screening programmes, without the provision of treatment have often been emphasized.The present mixed-methods systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to collate evidence for screening programmes for perinatal depression and anxiety. It aims to answer the following questions, in a global context: For women in the perinatal period, do screening programmes for perinatal depression and anxiety compared with no screening improve maternal mental health and infant outcomes?A series of meta-analyses reveal a reduction in perinatal depression and anxiety among perinatal women undergoing screening programmes. For the outcome of depressive disorder, meta-analysis indicates a positive impact in favour of the intervention group (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.66, n = 9009), with moderate quality of evidence.

This study examined the effect of maternal depressive disorder, antidepressant use and symptoms of depression and anxiety in pregnancy on placental 11β-HSD2 gene (HSD11B2) expression. Drawing on data from the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, placental HSD11B2 expression was compared among 33 pregnant women, who were selected based on membership of three groups; depressed (untreated), taking antidepressants and controls. Furthermore, associations between placental HSD11B2 and scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 12-18 and 28-34 weeks gestation were examined. Findings revealed negative correlations between HSD11B2 and both the EPDS and STAI (r = -0.11 to -0.28), with associations being particularly prominent during late gestation. Depressed and antidepressant exposed groups also displayed markedly lower placental HSD11B2 expression levels than controls. These findings suggest that maternal depression and anxiety may impact on fetal programming by down-regulating HSD11B2, and antidepressant treatment alone is unlikely to protect against this effect.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26593902/"}

The study aimed to translate the four-item composite Patient Health Questionnaire - 4 (PHQ-4) into Arabic and evaluate its psychometric properties, including internal reliability, sex invariance, composite reliability, and correlation with measures of psychological distress. 587 Arabic-speaking adults were recruited between February and March 2023. An anonymous self-administered Google Forms link was distributed via social media networks. We utilized the FACTOR software to explore the factor structure of the Arabic PHQ-4. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that fit of the two-factor model of the PHQ-4 scores was modest (χ<sup>2</sup>/df = .13/1 = .13, RMSEA = .001, SRMR = .002, CFI = 1.005, TLI = 1.000).

The effects of hormones on depression remain unclear. This review aims to clarify the nature of depressive disorders during the menopause transition as well as their links with climacteric syndrome, sexuality, cardiovascular risk and cognitive function. The recent literature on depressive disorders and menopause is reviewed. Women are more vulnerable than men to depressive disorders. Endocrine influences have been postulated but differences in, for example, coping style and response to stress may also contribute to the gender difference in the prevalence of depressive disorders. Gender differences in socialization may lead to higher rates of depression in women. There are data top suggest that menopause and depression are associated, although there is not a common clear causative factor. Women with climacteric symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia) are more likely to report anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Bothersome vasomotor symptoms could be associated with sleep disturbances, which in turn can increase reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Biopsychosocial and partner factors have a significant influence on middle-aged women's sexuality and depressive disorders, and most antidepressants can have a negative effect on sexual response. Lastly, studies have consistently shown that women with high levels of depressive symptoms are at greater cardiovascular risk and have poorer cognitive function than non-depressed women. At present, a direct relationship between psychiatric symptoms and hormonal changes such as estrogen decrease has not been clearly found. Stress, educational level, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and partner status may influence the prevalence and clinical course of both menopause symptoms and depressive disorders. Since in many cases depression is a lifelong condition, and is associated with severe comorbid conditions, further studies are needed to improve the early diagnosis of depression; it may be advisable to monitor a woman's mental health during the menopause transition to prevent a depressive disorder having long-term negative consequences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22196311/"}

Adverse childhood experiences are also considered to contribute to the risk of hypochondriasis, but the results of previous studies have not been conclusive with respect to the strength and specificity of this association. Therefore, we compared the association of adverse childhood experiences with both hypochondriasis and depression. Fifty-eight patients with hypochondriasis, 52 patients with depression, and 52 healthy control participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) which assesses 5 varieties of abuse and neglect. A clinical interview (SCID-I) was used to establish DSM-IV diagnoses. Associations between childhood maltreatment, hypochondriasis and depression were estimated by means of analyses of variance and multiple linear regression analyses. In comparison to hypochondriacal and healthy participants, patients with a current depressive disorder reported more emotional abuse as well as more emotional and physical neglect during childhood. Patients with hypochondriasis reported more emotional neglect than healthy individuals. However, when predicting the CTQ trauma types by diagnostic category adjusting for sex and comorbid DSM-IV diagnoses, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, as well as the CTQ total score were significantly associated with depression, but none of the CTQ scores was significantly related to hypochondriasis. The findings suggest a robust association of childhood maltreatment with depression but not with hypochondriasis.

We applied principal components analysis to baselineInventory of Depressive Symptomatology data from 1491 patients with major depressive disorder to derive naturally co-occurring symptom subsets before utilizing k-means clustering to divide patients into groups based on standardized residuals of each symptom subset score. We evaluated the clinical utility of our approach by comparing how cluster membership impacted response to citalopram. Prinicpal components analysis identified nine naturally co-occurring symptom subsets: core affective symptoms, appetite/weight loss, anxiety, somatic symptoms, insomnia, negative intrusive thoughts, leaden paralysis/mood quality, diurnal mood variation, and irritability. Cluster analysis identified two patient groups, differing significantly in 7 of 9 c symptom subsets. Patients distinguished by the prominence of somatic versus core affective symptoms exhibited less reduction in depression severity with citalopram treatment. Results depend not only on raw data, but also parameter selection, and interpretation. Replication is indicated. Findings are consistent with previous reports linking somatic symptoms to treatment resistance and demonstrating that SSRIs are most effective in treating affective symptoms.

The manifold adverse consequences of comorbid depression have been more clearly mapped in recent years. Accordingly, considerable efforts have been made to improve detection and diagnosis, with the result that many PWE are treated with antidepressant drugs, medications with the potential to influence both epilepsy and depression. Exposure to older generations of antidepressants (notably tricyclic antidepressants and bupropion) can increase seizure frequency. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that newer ('second generation') antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, have markedly less effect on excitability and may lead to improvements in epilepsy severity. Although a great deal is known about how antidepressants affect excitability on short time scales in experimental models, little is known about the effects of chronic antidepressant exposure on the underlying processes subsumed under the term 'epileptogenesis': the progressive neurobiological processes by which the non-epileptic brain changes so that it generates spontaneous, recurrent seizures. This paper reviews the literature concerning the influences of antidepressants in PWE and in animal models. The second section describes neurobiological mechanisms implicated in both antidepressant actions and in epileptogenesis, highlighting potential substrates that may mediate any effects of antidepressants on the development and progression of epilepsy. Although much indirect evidence suggests the overall clinical effects of antidepressants on epilepsy itself are beneficial, there are reasons for caution and the need for further research, discussed in the concluding section.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23146067/"}

It is estimated that if 200 people take the course, the improvements in quality of life for all these people taken together may be regarded as equally valuable and worthy of priority as an intervention that provides an extra life year to one person. The cost of giving the course to 200 people is estimated at USD 45,000-60,000. This is within the limits of what society is generally willing to pay in order to gain life years.

(Another, much rarer, cause of depressed symptoms is the classical illness of 'melancholia', which when severe cannot be self-treated and typically requires hospitalization.) A self-management option and alternative is now needed due to the an inappropriate emphasis of modern psychiatry on treatment of imprecise syndromal 'disorders' which may entail treating 'depression' at the cost of making the patient feel and function worse. By contrast, the basic theoretical stance of self-management is that depressed mood should be seen as a result of unpleasant symptoms - and it is the symptoms that require treatment, not the mood itself. Furthermore, drugs (or other interventions) need to be classified in terms of their potential therapeutic effects on these symptoms that may cause depressed mood. The four common causes of depressed mood considered here are the personality trait of Neuroticism; the state of malaise (fatigue, aching etc) which accompanies an illness with an activated immune system; demotivation due to lack of positive emotions (anhedonia); and the syndrome of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Each of the four sub-types is then 'matched' with a first-line non-prescription agent. The 'stabilizing' agents such as St John's Wort and the antihistamines chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine are used for treatment of Neuroticism; analgesics/pain killers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol/acetaminophen and the opiates are used to treat malaise; energizing agents such as caffeine and nicotine are used for the treatment of demotivation; and bright light used in the early morning to treat SAD. Self-treatments are intended to be used after research and experimentally, on a trial-and-error basis; with self-monitoring of beneficial and harmful effects, and a willingness to stop and switch treatments.

Among individuals with depression, 33 (10.3 %) out of 321 were aware of being diagnosed, and 18 (5.6 %) used antidepressants. Among those with anxiety, 38 (20.0 %) out of 190 were aware of a diagnosis, and 21 (11.1 %) received treatment with anxiolytics. The extremely low awareness and treatment rates indicate a significant unmet need for mental health services. Government and other stakeholders should raise the awareness of mental health among the communities and implement strategies to improve accessibility to services, to reduce health inequities and the stigma associated with mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40441637/"}

A questionnaire set, including sociodemographic variables, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), was completed by the participants. Clinically significant depression (CSD) and clinically significant anxiety (CSA) were defined as a score above 10 on the two scales. CSD and CSA are proxy measures but not specific diagnoses of mental disorders. <b>Results:</b> Data from 1329 patients were included in the final analysis. 422 (31.8%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms, 83 (6.3%) reported frequent suicidal ideation, and 204 (15.3%) reported clinically significant anxiety. Household income was negatively associated with CSD. Inpatients with lower household incomes and educational levels had higher rates of CSA. Middle-aged inpatients were more prone to suicidal ideation, and stable marital status was related to less suicidal ideation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation were determined to be common psychological problems in Chinese inpatients. Chinese medical personnel must pay attention to the mental health conditions of inpatients, particularly inpatients with lower income, educational levels, and poor marital status. Key Points This is one of the first studies focusing on the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese hospitalized inpatients in non-psychiatric departments of a general hospital. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were determined to be potential screening tools to aid Chinese medical workers in recognizing depression and anxiety in nonpsychiatric departments. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation was observed to be relatively high in inpatients, which requires more attention from Chinese clinicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30762438/"}

An analysis of the structure of the depressive triad was made based on the concept of heterogeneity of the depressive affect, with such acknowledged major components as melancholy, anxiety, and apathy. Depending on the nature of the leading elementary affect, three types of the depressive triad were identified, namely, melancholy, anxiety and apathy depressive triads. According to the criterion of qualitative and quantitative correlation between the triad components (ideational and motor) and the leading affect, harmonic, disharmonic and dissociated variants were identified within every type. The regular features of the time-course of the triad were established: from the initial stages to the over picture and then to the reduction of depression. These regularities were characterized by definite nosological preference, and may be helpful in the differential diagnosis and also be used as predictors of a protracted course of depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6624345/"}

This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with postnatal depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress (PTS), and comorbidity of these mental health problems for mothers of infants admitted to NNU, six months after childbirth. This was a secondary analysis of two cross-sectional, population-based National Maternity Surveys in England in 2018 and 2020. Postnatal depression, anxiety, and PTS were assessed using standardised measures. Associations between sociodemographic, pregnancy- and birth-related factors and postnatal depression, anxiety, PTS, and comorbidity of these mental health problems were explored using modified Poisson regression and multinomial logistic regression. Eight thousand five hundred thirty-nine women were included in the analysis, of whom 935 were mothers of infants admitted to NNU. Prevalence of postnatal mental health problems among mothers of infants admitted to NNU was 23.7% (95%CI: 20.6-27.2) for depression, 16.0% (95%CI: 13.4-19.0) for anxiety, 14.6% (95%CI: 12.2-17.5) for PTS, 8.2% (95%CI: 6.5-10.3) for two comorbid mental health problems, and 7.5% (95%CI: 5.7-10.0) for three comorbid mental health problems six months after giving birth. These rates were consistently higher compared to mothers whose infants were not admitted to NNU (19.3% (95%CI: 18.3-20.4) for depression, 14.0% (95%CI: 13.1-15.0) for anxiety, 10.3% (95%CI: 9.5-11.1) for PTS, 8.5% (95%CI: 7.8-9.3) for two comorbid mental health problems, and 4.2% (95%CI: 3.6-4.8) for three comorbid mental health problems six months after giving birth. Among mothers of infants admitted to NNU (N = 935), the strongest risk factors for mental health problems were having a long-term mental health problem and antenatal anxiety, while social support and satisfaction with birth were protective. Prevalence of postnatal mental health problems was higher in mothers of infants admitted to NNU, compared to mothers of infants not admitted to NNU six months after giving birth. Experiencing previous mental health problems increased the risk of postnatal depression, anxiety, and PTS whereas social support and satisfaction with birth were protective. The findings highlight the importance of routine and repeated mental health assessments and ongoing support for mothers of infants admitted to NNU.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37217846/"}

The cohort comprised 956 Japanese male employees of an enterprise (mean age, 42.7 years; SD, 10.2 years). MetS was diagnosed according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. The psychological conditions of depression and anxiety were assessed in 2 successive years by using the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire and by conducting clinical interviews as per the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). We evaluated the temporal and dose-response relationships between MetS and the development of depression and anxiety, controlling for potential confounding factors like age and lifestyle-related factors. We identified a positive relationship between MetS at baseline and new-onset depression in the subsequent year (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.10-4.17). Of the five MetS components examined, only waist circumference was significantly related to new-onset depression (OR 2.08, 1.23-3.50). Trend analysis revealed a significant positive trend of association between the number of MetS components identified and new-onset depression (P(trend) < 0.01), but not between Mets and new-onset anxiety. Our results suggest that MetS is a predictive factor for the development of depression, and that waist circumference largely contributes to the association between MetS and depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19839027/"}

Resilience is an individual's ability to maintain or regain his/her mental health in the face of significant adversity or risk of death. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of studies evaluating the effectiveness of resilience promotion interventions in adults. Electronic searches were conducted in databases ISI, PsycINFO and PubMed, including every language and every year until January 20, 2013. We selected studies with nonclinical samples of adults that evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention through randomized and non-randomized controlled trials and open-ended studies. We also considered valid constructs directly related to resilience, such as hardiness. Among 2.337 studies, 13 were selected for the review, 5 through electronic databases and 8 through search in references or the \"times cited list\" (list of articles that cited the selected papers). Of these, 7 are randomized controlled trials, 5 non-randomized controlled trials, and one an open-ended trial. Most of the studies included reported some degree of improvement in resilience-like variables among those subjects exposed to resilience-promoting programs. Furthermore, positive findings were more consistent among randomized controlled trials--six out of the seven suggested efficacy. There is evidence pointing towards some degree of effectiveness of resilience promotion programs, despite the poor operationalization of the construct and great heterogeneity in the studies. Indeed, the analysis of the methodological quality of the selected studies was hampered by the poor quality of reporting. There were faults in reporting in most studies on almost all items (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, description of concurrent treatment and intent-to-treat analysis), except for the item \"selective reporting\". Additional efforts should be made to determine the actual effect size of the interventions, since this is crucial for calculating the cost-effectiveness of resilience promotion strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266031/"}

Women scoring 10-12 on the EDS, with no other psychosocial risks, were now informed they should contact the Social Work Department if they had issues they wanted to discuss with a health professional. The study evaluated the impact of this change in EDS clinical practice. Records were audited over a 20-month period. In addition, 20 women scoring in this EDS marginal range (10-12), with no other psychosocial risks, participated in a telephone interview to ascertain if they should have been referred to the Safe Start meeting. Of 174 eligible women who scored in the marginal EDS range, none had contacted the Social Work Department. In addition, none of the 20 women interviewed indicated that they would have wanted to talk further with a health professional. This change in clinical practice reduced monthly referrals to the Safe Start meeting by about 20%. There was a linear relationship between the increasing EDS category scores and the likelihood of psychosocial risks being endorsed. Increasing the automatic referral EDS cutoff score from 10 or more to 13 or more does not appear to result in women \"in need\" being missed.

Bifactor modelling with the individual questionnaire items produced a general affect factor score that provided an integrated measure of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Linear mixed models were used to model the sleep outcomes, with adjustment for maternal age, education, parity, ethnicity, sex of the child and maternal sleep quality concurrent with maternal mental health assessment. We found that poorer mid-pregnancy, but not postpartum, maternal mental health was associated with longer wake after sleep onset duration across the first year of life (β = 49, 95% confidence interval 13-85 min). Poor maternal mental health during mid-pregnancy is linked to longer period of night awakening in the offspring during infancy.

The HADS is frequently analyzed via maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (ML-CFA). However, the overly restrictive assumption of exact zero cross-loadings and residual correlations in ML-CFA can lead to poor model fits and distorted factor structures. This study applied Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) to evaluate the latent structure of the HADS. Three a priori models, the two-factor, three-factor, and bifactor models, were investigated in a Chinese community sample (N = 312) and clinical sample (N = 198) using ML-CFA and BSEM. BSEM specified approximate zero cross-loadings and residual correlations through the use of zero-mean, small-variance informative priors. The model comparison was based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Using ML-CFA, none of the three models provided an adequate fit for either sample. The BSEM two-factor model with approximate zero cross-loadings and residual correlations fitted both samples well with the lowest BIC of the three models and displayed a simple and parsimonious factor-loading pattern. The study demonstrated that the two-factor structure fitted the HADS well, suggesting its usefulness in assessing the symptoms of anxiety and depression in clinical practice. BSEM is a sophisticated and flexible statistical technique that better reflects substantive theories and locates the source of model misfit.

However, most of those studies recruited people form the general population. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness when delivered in routine clinical practice in outpatient clinics. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to study patients with a depressive disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, fourth edition), as assessed by trained interviewers with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, who registered for treatment at an outpatient mental health clinic. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of guided Internet-based self-help before starting face-to-face treatment. We recruited 269 outpatients, aged between 18 and 79 years, from outpatient clinics and randomly allocated them to Internet-based problem solving therapy (n=136), with weekly student support, or to a control condition, who remained on the waitlist with a self-help booklet (control group; n=133). Participants in both conditions were allowed to take up face-to-face treatment at the outpatient clinics afterward. We measured the primary outcome, depressive symptoms, by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI), and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS). All outcomes were assessed by telephone at posttest (8 weeks after baseline). Posttest measures were completed by 184 (68.4%) participants. We found a moderate to large within-group effect size for both the intervention (d=0.75) and the control (d=0.69) group. However, the between-group effect size was very small (d=0.07), and regression analysis on posttreatment CES-D scores revealed no significant differences between the groups (b=1.134, 95% CI -2.495 to 4.763). The per-protocol analysis (≥4 sessions completed) results were also not significant (b=1.154, 95% CI -1.978 to 7.637). Between-group differences were small and not significant for all secondary outcomes. Adherence to the intervention was low. Only 36% (49/136) received an adequate dosage of the intervention (≥4 of 5 sessions). The overall treatment satisfaction was moderate. Internet-based problem solving therapy is not more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than receiving an unguided self-help book during the waitlist period at outpatient mental health clinics. The effect sizes are much smaller than those found in earlier research in the general population, and the low rates of adherence indicate that the acceptability of the intervention at this stage of treatment for depressed outpatients is low. However, taking into account that there is much evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based treatments, it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of these treatments in outpatient clinics as a whole.

The VGluT1/VGAT ratio was decreased in all three regions (all F > 10.09, all P < 0.004), which suggests stress-induced hypoexcitability in these regions.

Antenatal depression often co-occurs with significant anxiety, potentially exacerbating morbidities for women and their children. However, screening during the antenatal period is frequently limited to assessment of depression so that other significant comorbid disorders may be missed. Follow-up assessment by clinicians has similarly focused primarily on detection of depressive symptoms. Anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among others, often go undetected in perinatal care settings, even when depression is identified. Failing to recognize these comorbid diagnoses may lead to inadequate treatment or only partial alleviation of distress. Consequently, screening for and assessment of comorbid disorders is warranted. In this study, 382 pregnant women (M age = 25.8 [SD = 5.3] years, 85.0% Caucasian) receiving care at a university hospital clinic and Maternal Mental Health Care centers in eastern Iowa and who screened positive for depression on the Beck Depression Inventory completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to assess comorbid mental health symptoms and diagnoses. Overall, findings demonstrate high rates of anxiety disorders among women both with and without current major depression, although depressed women reported higher rates of generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Notably, however, incidence-specific symptoms were comparable across groups. Routine screening of both anxiety and depression during pregnancy should be conducted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28842756/"}

The symptom profile of MADD was similar to 'pure' ICD-10 anxiety and depression, but with a lower overall symptom count. The disorder was associated with significant impairment of health-related quality of life. Differences in health-related quality of life measures between diagnostic groups were accounted for by overall symptom severity, which remained strongly associated with health-related quality of life measures after adjusting for diagnostic group. The finding that half of the anxiety, depression and MADD cases and a third of the comorbid depression and anxiety cases grouped into a single latent class challenges the notion of these conditions as having distinct phenomenologies. Mixed presentations may be the norm in the population. The data support the pathological significance of MADD in its negative impact upon population health.

Through an anonymous, self administered questionnaire, they were assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Data on socio-demographic, family characteristics and living arrangement were also obtained. Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to explore association between these aspects. Analysis showed among all students, 27.5% had moderate, and 9.7% had severe or extremely severe depression; 34% had moderate, and 29% had severe or extremely severe anxiety; and 18.6% had moderate and 5.1% had severe or extremely severe stress scores based on the DASS-21 inventory. Both depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher among older students (20 and above) and those born in rural areas. Whereas, higher stress scores were significantly higher among older students (20 and above), females, Malays and those whose family had either low or high incomes compared to those with middle incomes. The prevalence of anxiety is much higher than either depression or stress, with some differences in their correlates except for age.

Although people with depression tend to be less physically active than non-depressed individuals, increased aerobic exercise or strength training has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms significantly. However, habitual physical activity has not been shown to prevent the onset of depression. Anxiety symptoms and panic disorder also improve with regular exercise, and beneficial effects appear to equal meditation or relaxation. In general, acute anxiety responds better to exercise than chronic anxiety. Studies of older adults and adolescents with depression or anxiety have been limited, but physical activity appears beneficial to these populations as well. Excessive physical activity may lead to overtraining and generate psychological symptoms that mimic depression. Several differing psychological and physiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of physical activity on mental health disorders. Well controlled studies are needed to clarify the mental health benefits of exercise among various populations and to address directly processes underlying the benefits of exercise on mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10739267/"}

The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview screened for elevated symptoms of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub> ) levels determined prediabetes status at baseline (2007-2013), and HbA<sub>1c</sub> and self-reported diabetes diagnoses determined diabetes status at follow-up (2014-2017).

Descriptive statistics were used to assess changes in the number of incident depression, anxiety disorders, and reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders documented by GPs in 2020 compared to the average of the years 2017-2019. There was a tremendous decrease in mental health diagnoses during the first lockdown that was only slightly compensated later. Overall populations and the entire year 2020, there was no change in documented depression (0%) and stress disorders (1%), but anxiety disorders were more often documented (+19%), especially for the elderly population (>80 years; +24%). This population group also received more frequently new depression (+12%) and stress disorder diagnoses (23%). The younger population was diagnosed more frequently at the end of 2020, nine months after the first lockdown. Anxiety disorders but not depression and stress diagnoses were elevated, which is not in line with previously published studies.

This study examined epileptiform activities as a single phenomenon, identifying the relationships between distribution patterns of EDs and endorsement of clinical symptoms across affective, cognitive, and somatic domains. In a sample of 71 nonepileptic psychiatric patients, those with EDs appearing in homologous electrode pairs endorsed significantly fewer symptoms related to affective deregulation. These patients were also significantly less likely to endorse a history of severe symptomatology, including suicidal ideation/previous attempt, self-injurious behavior, psychoses or dissociation, and previous psychiatric hospitalization. Conversely, patients with isolated EDs focused to a single brain region endorsed greater affective deregulation and severe clinical symptoms.

We further hypothesized that these variables would be predictive of depressive symptoms. All of the hypotheses were confirmed. The results suggest that the insecure fearful-avoidant attachment style is associated with severe depressive symptoms in patients with AJD.

The obtained data were analyzed through structural equation modelling (SEM) and hierarchical regression analyses. SEM results showed that positive beliefs about rumination increased the rumination level, and the higher levels of rumination significantly predicted the increase in depressive symptoms partly through the mediating effect of negative metacognitive beliefs about rumination regarding interpersonal and social consequences. However, negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of rumination were not found to be associated with symptoms of depression in the participants of this study. The power of dysfunctional attitudes for predicting depression was lost when hierarchical regression analysis was carried out by controlling the metacognitions about negative interpersonal and social consequences of rumination.

A 110-item, yes-or-no questionnaire, the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A), was specifically developed for measuring temperamental variation. The TEMPS-A was translated into more than 25 languages and cross-culturally valid versions are now available in Italian, French, German, Japanese, Turkish, Arabic, Polish, Hungarian, Spanish and Portuguese. Recent studies in the US and in Europe, however, have suggested that shorter versions of TEMPS-A can be just as efficient as the full ones while potentially enhancing the compliance of respondents. The main objective of the present study was to validate a brief Brazilian Portuguese version of TEMPS-A (brief TEMPS-Rio de Janeiro). Our main sample consisted of 997 undergraduate students (female = 72.6%) from seven different universities located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An additional group of 167 healthy senior citizens (women = 83.8%) was recruited in senior community centers in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All participants were asked to complete the 110-item, Brazilian translation of the full version of the TEMPS-A. An exploratory factor analysis (PCA type 2, Varimax rotation) vying for a five-factor solution yielded mixed results, with cyclothymic traits, physical symptoms of anxiety and preoccupation with the well-being of a family member loading together on the first factor. When a forced six-factor solution was attempted, cyclothymic, irritable, hyperthymic, and depressive were delineated as predicted by the theory. The original generalized anxious temperament was split into two sharply delimited components, a \"worrying\" subscale and an abbreviated anxious subscale, which included physical symptoms of anxiety and concerns with the well-being of relatives. Based on the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, we proposed that the abridged anxious subscale, which includes physical symptoms of anxiety, represents the \"true\" generalized anxious temperament, while the \"worrying\" subscale corresponds to the \"general distress factor\". The internal consistency of the six subscales thus identified was generally good, ranging from 0.67 (anxious subscale) to 0.81 (worrying subscale), with cyclothymic, irritable, depressive, and hyperthymic subscales exhibiting intermediate values (0.74, 0.74, 0.72, and 0.7, respectively). The present study was based on a non-clinical sample that does not reflect accurately the characteristics of the Brazilian population. The relative uniformity of the sample in terms of age and education precluded a more in-depth analysis of the influence of these highly relevant factors. Further, we did not assess convergent, divergent or test-retest validity. We believe that the brief Brazilian version of the TEMPS-A auto-questionnaire will provide Brazilian researchers and clinicians with a psychometrically sound instrument and thus contribute toward the creation of a worldwide research network dedicated to the investigation of affective temperaments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21782248/"}

One-way ANOVA analysis showed significant mean differences between the symptom groups on self-reported quality of life and self-esteem. Regression analysis predicting quality of life and self-esteem showed that in the Depression only group and the Combined group, symptom levels were significantly associated with lower self-reported scores on both functional domains. In the Combined group, older children reported lower quality of life and self-esteem than younger children. Internalizing symptoms explained more of the variance in quality of life than in self-esteem. Symptoms of depression explained more of the variance than anxious symptoms. Female gender was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms, but there was no gender difference in quality of life and self-esteem. Internalizing symptoms were associated with lower self-reported quality of life and self-esteem in children in the at-risk groups reporting depressive or depressive and anxious symptoms. A transdiagnostic approach targeting children with internalizing symptoms may be important as an early intervention to change a possible negative trajectory.

Among these, anxiety and depression stand out as prevalent diagnoses, particularly in industrialized nations. Depression, according to the DSM-5, is a heterogeneous condition that affects emotional, cognitive, and physical functioning, with symptoms including insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and weight changes. Cognitive theories of depression highlight its impact on judgment, decision-making, thinking, and focus. Depression's multifaceted nature means that no two patients experience identical symptoms, risk factors, or treatment responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health issues, with social isolation, restricted contact, and altered daily routines contributing to increased anxiety and depression, especially among adolescents and young adults. The pandemic's psychological toll underscores the need for effective treatment strategies for mental disorders. The physical manifestations of major depressive disorder (MDD) are associated with a heightened risk of developing various medical conditions, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, stroke, epilepsy, and dementia. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of depression and anxiety, covering their different types, epidemiology, potential causes, diagnostic criteria, and available treatment options. It delves into the role of pharmacological interventions and examines recent advancements to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, the review assesses the therapeutic potential of drugs, offering insights into their efficacy in treating these complex mental health disorders.

In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants who experienced b-CBT as part of the E-compared trial. A thematic analysis was conducted using a constant comparative method informed by grounded theory. Recruitment was carried out in four psychological primary care services across the UK. Nineteen trial participants with major depressive disorder who completed at least one computerised program and face-to-face session with a PWP in the b-CBT arm were recruited to the study. Qualitative interviews that were guided by WA theory and patient involvement, revealed four themes: (1) a healthcare provider (PWP and computerised program) with good interpersonal competencies for building a working relationship with the client ('bond'); (2) collaborative efforts between the client and the provider to appropriately identify what the client hopes to achieve through therapy ('goals'); (3) the selection of acceptable therapeutic activities that address client goals and the availability of responsive support ('task') and (4) the promotion of active engagement and autonomous problem solving ('usability heuristics'). Participants described how the PWP and computerised program uniquely and collectively contributed to different WA needs. This study is the first to offer a preliminary conceptual framework of WA in b-CBT for depression, and how such demands can be addressed through blended PWP-computerised program delivery. These findings can be used to promote WA in technological design and clinical practice, thereby promoting engagement to b-CBT interventions and effective deployment of practitioner and program resources.

This study was conducted in a randomly selected group of 1659 adult inhabitants of the Żywiec district. Anonymous questionnaires consisting of a proprietary questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to collect the data. The conducted analysis revealed that the factors increasing the risk of depressive disorders in the studied population were female gender, age over 60, retirement period, primary and vocational education, unemployment, mental work and absolute lack of physical activity, but also daily and intensive sports, heavy smoking, chronic somatic diseases and misuse of sleeping pills and over-the-counter sedatives. Anxiety disorders occurred more often in the group of unemployed, self-employed or retired people. They also occurred more often in the group of people who do not perform any physical activity and use alcohol every day, but also among those who maintain abstinence, regularly smoke tobacco and use stimulants, suffer from somatic diseases and overuse sleeping drugs. Disease preventive factors for anxiety disorders and depression were a constant form of employment, moderate and regular physical activity, avoiding the use of psychoactive substances and the regular treatment of comorbid somatic diseases and insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34639549/"}
{"id": "22868058", "title": "Discriminating melancholic and non-melancholic depression by prototypic clinical features.", "text": "Melancholia is positioned as either a more severe expression of clinical depression or as a separate entity. Support for the latter view emerges from differential causal factors and treatment responsiveness but has not been convincingly demonstrated in terms of differential clinical features. We pursue its prototypic clinical pattern to determine if this advances its delineation. We developed a 24-item measure (now termed the Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index or SMPI) comprising 12 melancholic and 12 non-melancholic prototypic features (both symptoms and illness correlates). In this evaluative study, 278 patients referred for tertiary level assessment at a specialized mood disorders clinic completed the self-report SMPI as well as a depression severity measure and a comprehensive assessment schedule before clinical interview, while assessing clinicians completed a clinician version of the SMPI items following their interview. The independent variable (diagnostic gold standard) was the clinician's judgment of a melancholic versus non-melancholic depressive episode. Discriminative performance was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis of four strategies for operationalising the SMPI self-report and SMPI clinician measures, and with the former strategies compared to ROC analysis of the depression severity measure. The external validity of the optimally discriminating scores on each measure was tested against a range of clinical variables. Comparison of the two self-report measures established that the SMPI provided greater discrimination than the depression severity measure, while comparison of the self-report and clinician-rated SMPI measures established the latter as more discriminating of clinically diagnosed melancholic or non-melancholic depression. ROC analyses favoured self-report SMPI distinction of melancholic from non-melancholic depression being most optimally calculated by a 'difference' score of at least four or more melancholic than non-melancholic items being affirmed (sensitivity of 0.69, specificity of 0.77). For the clinician-rated SMPI measure, ROC analyses confirmed the same optimal difference score of four or more as highly discriminating of melancholic and non-melancholic depression (sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.92). As the difference score had positive predictive values of 0.90 and 0.70 (for the respective clinician-rated and self-report SMPI forms) and respective negative predictive values of 0.88 and 0.70, we conclude that the clinician-rated version had superior discrimination than the self-report version. External validating data quantified the self-rated and clinician-rated Index-assigned non-melancholic patients having a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, a higher number of current and lifetime stressors, as well as elevated scores on several personality styles that are viewed as predisposing to and shaping such non-melancholic disorders. Assigned melancholic and non-melancholic diagnoses were determined by clinician judgement, risking a circularity bias across diagnostic assignment and clinical weighting of melancholic and non-melancholic features. The robustness of the Index requires testing in primary and secondary levels of care settings. The clinician-rated SMPI differentiated melancholic and non-melancholic depressed subjects at a higher level of confidence than the self-report SMPI, and with a highly acceptable level of discrimination. The measure is recommended for further testing of its intrinsic and applied properties.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22868058/"}

This study investigated whether components of social isolation (marital status, perceived social support, and interpersonal problems) predict change in depression severity over the course of a brief adherence intervention delivered in a primary care setting. A sample of 189 older adults with major depressive disorder were randomized to either an adherence intervention, \"Treatment Initiation Program,\" or treatment as usual. Marital status, perceived social support and interpersonal problems were assessed at baseline. A mixed-effects regression was used to test whether these factors predicted the change trajectory in depression severity over 24 weeks. Being married (F(2,176) = 6.60; p = 0.001), reporting higher perceived social support (F(2,177) = 4.70; p = 0.01), and fewer interpersonal problems (F(2, 176) = 4.34; p = 0.01) predicted lower depression severity on average over the course of 24 weeks.

Baseline data of the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO) were used. In 333 patients (≥60 years) suffering from a major depressive disorder, anxiety was assessed with the BAI, personality traits with the NEO-FFI and the Mastery Scale, and life-events with the Brugha questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analyses were applied with anxiety severity as dependent and life-events and personality traits as independent variables. 147 patients (44.1%) had recently experienced one or more life-events. The presence of a life-event is not associated with anxiety (p = .161) or depression severity (p = .440). However, certain personality traits interacted with life-events in explaining anxiety severity. Stratified analyses showed that life-events were associated with higher anxiety levels in case of high levels of neuroticism and openness and low levels of conscientiousness or mastery.

Participants included clinicians (physicians, certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners) and clinician assistants (medical assistants, nursing assistants). Baseline data regarding practices and attitudes of clinicians and clinician assistants toward addressing depression in the obstetric setting were described. Logistic regressions were used to examine the association of clinician time to complete work and depression management. Clinician assistants experienced significantly fewer time constraints than did clinicians. However, having adequate time to complete work was not significantly associated with increased depression management in clinicians. Clinician assistants reported feeling that addressing depression is an important part of their job, despite variation in doing so. Clinician assistants are interacting with perinatal women extensively and are a vital part of obstetric care workflows. Clinician assistants report that they want to address depression and have time to do so.

One hundred thirty-five Chinese individuals with anxious depression (n = 92) and nonanxious depression (n = 43) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Post hoc analyses compared changes in anhedonic symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), between patients with anxious depression (defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Anxiety-Somatization score ≥7) and nonanxious depression. In this study, 68.1 % of patients were found to have anxious depression. Anxious depressed patients were associated with a relatively lower antianhedonic response (47.8 % versus 51.2 %, p > 0.05) and remission (17.4 % versus 27.9 %, p > 0.05) than their nonanxious counterparts. When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in anhedonic symptoms was observed from the first infusion to the last infusion and 2-week follow-up in both groups (all p < 0.05). A linear mixed model did not find a significant group main effect on the MADRS anhedonia subscale scores (F = 0.5, p = 0.46).

They underwent functional MRI while viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to neural response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed using the 'distress', 'family' and 'accident' subscales from a life event dimensional questionnaire. Relationships between NLE subscale scores and neural response were investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with anxiety or depression outcomes at the age of 16 years were also investigated. Lifetime 'distress' positively correlated with ventral-lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex activations during angry face processing. 'Distress' scores correlated with the probabilities of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 16 years. Lifetime 'family' and 'accident' scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up conditions, however.

Presence of chronic illness was measured using self-report and symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate trajectories of depressive symptoms, adjusting for family environment and sociodemographic characteristics during the transition to young adulthood. Trajectories showed cubic change over time - increasing from early to mid-adolescence, decreasing to early young adulthood, increasing again to late young adulthood. Youth with chronic illness (n=753) had significantly less favorable trajectories and significantly higher proportions of clinically relevant depressive symptoms over time compared to their peers without chronic illness (n=2072). This study is limited by selective attrition, self-reported chronic illness and no assessment of illness severity, and mediating effects of family environment factors could not be examined. Findings support the diathesis-stress model; chronic illness negatively influenced depressive symptoms trajectories, such that youth with chronic illness had higher depression scores and less favorable trajectories over time.

Logistic regression was used to assess whether perceived depression and stigma among friends were associated with personal depressive status before and after accounting for depressive status at baseline.

Controlling for clinical variables, resistant group had significantly higher general OCD severity, anxiety, depression, trauma, and dissociation scores than the responders. Correlation analyses indicated that Y-BOCS scores were significantly related to severity of dissociation, anxiety, depression, and traumatic experiences. In a logistic regression analysis with treatment resistance as a dependent variable, high dissociation levels, long duration of illness, and poor insight emerged as relevant predictors, but gender, levels of anxiety, depression, and traumatic experiences did not.

Given the central role of self-report in psychiatric diagnosis, these findings highlight potentially harmful consequences of personalized genetic testing in mental health.

The present study sought to examine whether depressive symptoms and trait anxiety mediate the association between SE and SQ in male university students. 142 university students were evaluated using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Pittsburg Quality Sleep Index. The analysis was based on the Baron and Kenny four steps mediation model, and explored the potential mediator role of depression and trait anxiety through a series of simple and multiple linear regression analyses, followed by a Sobel test to corroborate the model's power. Our results showed that the association between SE and SQ is partially mediated by depression and trait anxiety. Such findings may indicate that both depression and trait anxiety contribute to the underlying mechanism through which SE influences SQ in male university students. Clinical and educational implications are discussed in the light of such results, proposing interventions to ameliorate the male students' emotional life and sleep quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31146578/"}

The Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases were searched from database inception to October 8, 2021. Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials that used the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R; the most common comprehensive screening and diagnostic measure of depressive and anxiety symptoms in primary care randomized clinical trials), measured socioeconomic factors at baseline, and sampled patients with unipolar depression who sought treatment for depression from general physicians/practitioners or who scored 12 or more points on the CIS-R. Exclusion criteria included patients with depression secondary to a personality or psychotic disorder or neurologic condition, studies of bipolar or psychotic depression, studies that included children or adolescents, and feasibility studies. Studies were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 reviewers. Data were extracted and cleaned by data managers for each included study, further cleaned by multiple reviewers, and cross-checked by study chief investigators.

In ICBT, clients review treatment materials online typically on a weekly basis. A key component of therapist-assistance involves answering questions as clients review and work on assignments related to the treatment materials. The goal of this study was to enhance understanding of the nature of client questions posed during ICBT and examine potential associations between the number of questions asked and treatment outcomes in order to provide insight into how to improve ICBT for future users. Content analysis was used to qualitatively analyse and identify questions that 80 clients asked their designated therapist over the course of an 8-week ICBT programme for anxiety and depression. On average, clients sent six emails during the course of treatment, of which less than two questions were asked. Of the 137 questions posed by clients, 46.72% reflected questions designed to enhance understanding and apply the material and techniques reviewed in the programme. Additional questions were categorized as clarifying the therapeutic process (22.62%), addressing technical challenges (18.25%), and seeking assistance with problems outside the scope of ICBT (12.41%). Number of client questions asked was not significantly correlated with the number of lessons completed, symptom change, or perceptions of therapeutic alliance.

An alternative that offers mental health care in a flexible setting is asynchronous messaging therapy. To date, no study has evaluated its efficacy and acceptability in a randomized controlled trial for depression. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of message-based psychotherapy for depression to once-weekly video-based psychotherapy. In this 2-armed randomized controlled trial, individuals (N=83) with depressive symptomatology (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ≥10) were recruited on the internet and randomly assigned to either a message-based intervention group (n=46) or a once-weekly video-based intervention group (n=37). Patients in the message-based treatment condition exchanged asynchronous messages with their therapist following an agreed-upon schedule. Patients in the video-based treatment condition met with their therapist once each week for a 45-minute video teletherapy session. Self-report data for depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were collected at pretreatment, weekly during treatment, at posttreatment, and at a 6-month follow-up. Self-reported treatment expectancy and credibility for the assigned intervention were assessed at pretreatment and therapeutic alliance at posttreatment. Findings from multilevel modeling indicated significant, medium-to-large improvements in depression (d=1.04; 95% CI 0.60-1.46), anxiety (d=0.61; 95% CI 0.22-0.99), and functional impairment (d=0.66; 95% CI 0.27-1.05) for patients in the message-based treatment condition. Changes in depression (d=0.11; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.66), anxiety (d=-0.01; 95% CI -0.56 to 0.53), and functional impairment (d=0.25; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.80) in the message-based treatment condition were noninferior to those in the video-based treatment condition. There were no significant differences in treatment credibility (d=-0.09; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.45), therapeutic alliance (d=-0.15; 95% CI -0.75 to 0.44), or engagement (d=0.24; 95% CI -0.20 to 0.67) between the 2 treatment conditions.

Siblings emerged as the most consistent source of social support on mental health. Overall caregiver and sibling support explained 13% variance in depression, 12% in anxiety, and 11% in PTS. Emotional support was the most frequent type of social support associated with mental health in all regression models, with higher levels of quality and instrumental support having the strongest relation to positive mental health outcomes. Although instrumental and quality support from siblings were related to positive mental health, unexpectedly, the higher the level of emotional support received from a sibling resulted in the child reporting more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS. The opposite was true for emotional support provided via caregivers, higher levels of this support was related to lower levels of all mental health symptoms.

Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that angina pectoris, major depression, the use of anxiolytics, and low educational level distinguished moderate-to-severe anxious patients from nonanxious. The absence of angina and major depression and not using diuretics explained the decreasing trend in anxiety in one of the trajectories. Anxiety trajectories varied across patients, with four of five being stable over 18 months. In clinical practice, knowledge of these trajectories and their determinants may help identify distinct groups of patients with potentially differential risks of adverse health outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18378871/"}

Meanwhile, anxiety is closely associated with mood disorder, but its association with morningness-eveningness is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mediating effects of resilience and anxiety on morningness-eveningness and depression as the possible mechanisms. This study included patient group and nonpatient group. Patient group consists of 743 patients with mood disorders [Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), 233; Bipolar Disorder I (BDI), 113; Bipolar Disorder II (BDII), 397] whereas nonpatient group consists of 818 individuals without mood disorder. The Composite Scale of Morningness, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to evaluate morningness-eveningness, resilience, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Our model provided a good fit for the data. The association between morningness-eveningness and depression symptoms was partially serially mediated by resilience and anxiety in both the patient and nonpatient groups. The patient group exhibited significantly stronger morningness-eveningness toward resilience and anxiety than the nonpatient group. In the indirect effect of morningness-eveningness on depression, group differences exist only through each mediation of resilience and anxiety, not through serial mediation. Our results expand on the mechanism underlying the association between morningness-eveningness and depression. They highlight the importance of morningness-eveningness modification to increase resilience and the need to consider anxiety jointly in this process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38800858/"}

In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the validity of the specifier diagnosed with a semistructured interview. Two hundred sixty patients with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder were evaluated with semistructured diagnostic interviews. The patients were rated on clinician rating scales of depression, anxiety and irritability, and completed self-report measures. Approximately three-quarters of the depressed patients met the criteria for the anxious distress specifier. Patients with anxious distress had a higher frequency of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as higher scores on measures of anxiety, depression, and anger. The patients meeting the anxious distress subtype reported higher rates of drug use disorders, poorer functioning during the week before the evaluation, and poorer coping ability compared to the patients who did not meet the anxious distress specifier. Moreover, anxious distress was associated with poorer functioning and coping after controlling for the presence of an anxiety disorder.

Evidence-based research has provided us with some direction during this unsettling time.

Prior research efforts on evidence-based treatments for youth have been unable to examine the concurrent trajectories of primary anxiety and depressive concerns across the course of treatment. The advent of transdiagnostic approaches for these emotional disorders in youth allows for such examination. The present study examined the separate trajectories of adolescent anxiety and depressive symptoms over the course of a transdiagnostic intervention, the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescence (UP-A; Ehrenreich et al., 2008), as well as up to six months following treatment. The sample included 59 adolescents ages 12-17 years old (M=15.42, SD=1.71) who completed at least eight sessions of the UP-A as part of an open trial or randomized, controlled trial across two treatment sites. Piecewise latent growth curve analyses found adolescent self-rated anxiety and depressive symptoms showed similar rates of improvement during treatment, but while anxiety symptoms continued to improve during follow-up, depressive symptoms showed non-significant improvement after treatment. Parent-rated symptoms also showed similar rates of improvement for anxiety and depression during the UP-A to those observed for adolescent self-report, but little improvement after treatment across either anxiety or depressive symptoms. To a certain degree, the results mirror those observed among other evidence-based treatments for youth with anxiety and depression, though results hold implications for future iterations of transdiagnostic treatments regarding optimization of outcomes for adolescents with depressive symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24960439/"}

Although distress tolerance, the capacity to experience and withstand negative psychological states, has been examined as a potential transdiagnostic factor that accounts for the development of mental health disorders, problem drinking, and the comorbidity between these presenting concerns, its role has not been evaluated in a veteran population. Young adult veterans were recruited for an online survey related to alcohol use. Participants (n=783) completed self-report measures of alcohol use, depression and PTSD symptoms, and distress tolerance. Mediation models were conducted to examine whether distress tolerance mediated the relationship between (1) probable PTSD, (2) probable depression, and (3) comorbid probable PTSD and depression with alcohol misuse. Moderated mediation models were conducted to examine gender as a moderator. Significant bivariate associations were observed among mental health symptoms, distress tolerance, and alcohol misuse. Distress tolerance significantly mediated the relationship between probable depression and PTSD (both alone and in combination) and alcohol misuse. Evidence of moderated mediation was present for probable PTSD and probable comorbid PTSD and depression, such that the indirect effect was stronger among males.

Although online health communities have shown the potential to reduce the symptoms of depression, emotional contagion theory suggests that negative emotion can spread within a community, and prolonged interactions with other depressed individuals has potential to worsen the symptoms of depression. The goals of our study were to investigate longitudinal changes in psychological states that are manifested through linguistic changes in depression community members who are interacting with other depressed individuals. We examined emotion-related language usages using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program for each member of a depression community from Reddit. To measure the changes, we applied linear least-squares regression to the LIWC scores against the interaction sequence for each member. We measured the differences in linguistic changes against three online health communities focusing on positive emotion, diabetes, and irritable bowel syndrome. On average, members of an online depression community showed improvement in 9 of 10 prespecified linguistic dimensions: \"positive emotion,\" \"negative emotion,\" \"anxiety,\" \"anger,\" \"sadness,\" \"first person singular,\" \"negation,\" \"swear words,\" and \"death.\" Moreover, these members improved either significantly or at least as much as members of other online health communities. We provide new insights into the impact of prolonged participation in an online depression community and highlight the positive emotion change in members. The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution, because participating in an online depression community is not the sole factor for improvement or worsening of depressive symptoms. Still, the consistent statistical results including comparative analyses with different communities could indicate that the emotion-related language usage of depression community members are improving either significantly or at least as much as members of other online communities. On the basis of these findings, we contribute practical suggestions for designing online depression communities to enhance psychosocial benefit gains for members. We consider these results to be an important step toward a better understanding of the impact of prolonged participation in an online depression community, in addition to providing insights into the long-term psychosocial well-being of members.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28320692/"}

In total, 22.2% and 16.7% of participants endorsed clinically significant anxiety or depression symptomatology, respectively; 28.6% reported 1 or more burnout symptoms; and 69.0% reported that COVID-19 affected their overall mental health. Participants reporting anxiety (OR, 8.87; 95% CI, 1.80 to 43.57; P = .007), depression (OR, 11.18; 95% CI, 1.84 to 67.74; P = .009), or burnout (OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.73 to 38.23; P = .008) were significantly more likely to report intention to leave than those not reporting mental health problems. All participants reporting that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their mental health expressed intention to leave. Poor mental health is common among dental trainees and is associated with intention to leave their program. COVID-19 has exacerbated the prevalence and consequences of poor mental health among dental students, highlighting the importance of providing wellness resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34023094/"}

Recent evidence suggests that athletes are at high risk of mental health issues. Even though the FIFA is increasingly paying attention, efforts directed towards young talented footballers are scarce. Few studies have even been conducted on young talented footballers in Africa. The majority of epidemiological studies on athletes also suffer from an analytical approach that does not highlight athletes' mental health profiles. This study aims to describe the mental health profile and their prevalence of young talented footballers in three African representative countries. The study applied an observational-based cross-sectional research design with aspiring footballers from three sub-regions of Africa and aged between 10 and 23. The data was collected face-to-face from March to November 2022. Three screening tools were used to measure three mental health outcomes: Satisfaction With Life Scale (subjective well-being), Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (depression), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (anxiety). The mental health outcomes were rates and scores of well-being, depression, and anxiety, used in latent profile analysis. 507 male young talented footballers (263[51∙9%] Cameroonians, 73[14∙4%] Moroccans, and 171[33∙7%] Ivorians) were included in the analysis with a mean age of 15∙1 (SD 2∙37) years. Screening of mental health states revealed that 367(72∙3%) and 412(81∙8%) of these players experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms respectively and 155(30∙7%) experienced low well-being. Differences in mental health outcomes were noted between countries, age groups and competition levels. Three profiles of mental health condition were also identified, namely moderate mental health (Profile 1), languishing (Profile 2) and flourishing (Profile 3). The youth of football academies in the three African countries studied have a specific mental health profile, revealing a high prevalence of common mental disorders in the African context. These findings underline the need to enhance the awareness of mental health issues in young African players and provide tailored support. FIFA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39068735/"}

We investigated whether baseline anxiety, and early improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms predict eventual treatment outcomes. 111 participants with anxious depression, defined using ≥ 10 on GAD-7, received escitalopram (10-20 mg) for 8 weeks. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression was conducted to examine the impact of baseline anxiety, and to assess the extent week 2 anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (QIDS-SR) percentage improvement associates with week 8 anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (MADRS) response/remission. Optimum improvement thresholds were identified using receiving-operating-curve analysis and their predictive values assessed. Greater percentage improvement in anxiety and depression after the first 2 weeks of treatment significantly increased odds of achieving week 8 anxiety and depression response/remission (OR:1.01-1.04, p<0.05). Early anxiety (68.4%/87.2%) and depression (52.2%/83.0%) improvement thresholds around 30 and 40% provided moderate to high positive predictive value (PPV) for predicting week 8 anxiety response/remission, as well as moderate to high negative predictive value (NPV) for predicting week 8 depression response/remission (anxiety:70.8%/91.7%; depression:72.2%/90.1%). Baseline anxiety severity predicted anxiety outcomes at weeks 2 and 8. Trial lacked placebo group. In anxious depression, early improvement in anxiety may be better than depression in predicting anxiety outcomes, with similar or higher PPVs. Both improvement types perform similarly in predicting depression outcomes, with the lack of improvement predictive of non-response and non-remission.

Some individuals also report clinically meaningful symptom improvements after only two or three treatment sessions. As the rate of symptom change has been given limited attention within digital treatments, the present study investigated the timing and magnitude of symptom change during an 8-week online treatment for anxiety and depression. Three adult samples were derived from previous randomized controlled trials: generalized anxiety disorder (<i>n</i> = 165), major depression (<i>n</i> = 149), and mixed anxiety/depression (<i>n</i> = 262). Symptom scores were compared between consecutive weeks of treatment, and we examined the proportion of individuals who achieved a ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% improvement in symptoms each week. Across all three samples, symptoms improved more rapidly during the first half of treatment compared to the second half of treatment. Within the first 4 weeks, over half of the participants had experienced a ≥ 25% improvement in symptoms, and approximately a third of participants had experienced a ≥ 50% improvement in symptoms. This pattern of change was found irrespective of diagnostic status or outcome measure. A substantial number of people who receive internet-delivered treatments appear to experience rapid, large, and clinically significant symptom improvement early in treatment. These findings add to our theoretical understanding of symptom improvements during psychotherapy, and further research investigating the mechanisms of such change will inform the development of more effective treatments.

The aim of this research was to use a large epidemiological study to identify and characterise depression clusters through \"Graphing lifestyle-environs using machine-learning methods\" (GLUMM). Two ML algorithms were implemented: unsupervised Self-organised mapping (SOM) to create GLUMM clusters and a supervised boosted regression algorithm to describe clusters. Ninety-six \"lifestyle-environ\" variables were used from the National health and nutrition examination study (2009-2010). Multivariate logistic regression validated clusters and controlled for possible sociodemographic confounders. The SOM identified two GLUMM cluster solutions. These solutions contained one dominant depressed cluster (GLUMM5-1, GLUMM7-1). Equal proportions of members in each cluster rated as highly depressed (17%). Alcohol consumption and demographics validated clusters. Boosted regression identified GLUMM5-1 as more informative than GLUMM7-1. Members were more likely to: have problems sleeping; unhealthy eating; ≤2 years in their home; an old home; perceive themselves underweight; exposed to work fumes; experienced sex at ≤14 years; not perform moderate recreational activities.

Anxiety and fear are the most frequent emotional disorders among diabetic patients. Depression occurs in approximately 30% of patients with diabetes. Both diabetes and depression belong to so called 'life style' or 'civilization diseases'. Numerous studies have confirmed that the course of depression in patients with diabetes is more severe, and the relapses of depression episodes are more frequent. The studies show that diabetic patients experience various types of psychosocial and emotional problems due to which the monitoring of own state of health is not the priority in life. In the process of treatment of both sole diabetes and concomitant anxiety and depression it is important to adjust and motivate patients to apply widely understood therapeutic recommendations. The treatment of depression syndrome in the course of diabetes does not have to lead to improvement in glycaemic control. The following factors influencing the therapeutic eff ect should be mentioned: duration of diabetes, presence of complications, and the eff ect of the drugs applied on body weight, or possibly initial diabetes management. It seems, therefore, that the patient education model based on the provision of knowledge concerning diabetes and its complications, methods of treatment, principles of nutrition and health-promoting life style, may be insufficient, at least for patients with depression. The results of a review of reports shows that an optimum treatment of diabetes, in accordance with the current state of knowledge, requires from physicians a special consideration of psychological and psychiatric knowledge for the 2 following reasons: 1) effectiveness of therapy to a high degree depends on the proper behaviour of a patient; 2) considerably more frequent, compared to the total population, occurrence of the symptoms of emotional disorders negatively affect the course of diabetes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22216806/"}

There is also some evidence suggesting perceiving other Black individuals experiencing racial discrimination (group-level discrimination) can protect one's health in Black adults. This study examined the role of personal- and group-level discrimination in Black adolescent health. The study was a secondary analysis of survey data collected from 186 Black adolescents that included reports of discrimination, physical function, anxiety, and depression. Black adolescents who reported greater, as opposed to lower, personal-level discrimination were more likely to experience poorer physical and mental health outcomes. While group-level discrimination was also associated with physical health outcomes, it was not directly associated with mental health outcomes. Importantly, across all three health outcomes, awareness of group-level discrimination mitigated the negative health consequences of personal-level discrimination. Among adolescents who reported low levels of group-level discrimination, personal-level discrimination was associated negatively with physical function and positively with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Among adolescents who reported high levels of group-level discrimination, there was no association between personal-level discrimination and any of the health outcomes. Consistent with prior research with Black adults, awareness of high group-level discrimination may protect Black adolescents from the negative health consequences of personal-level discrimination. The pattern of the results is also consistent with the literature of the personal-group discrimination discrepancy (PGDD) and psychological wellbeing.

The present study examined a possible emotion regulatory deficit, whether depression symptoms attenuate the association between communal (i.e., agreeable, quarrelsome) behavior and affect. A community sample reported on depression and anxiety symptoms before recording their affect and behavior following naturally occurring interpersonal interactions over 21 days. Participants' behaviors were measured using items selected to represent the Interpersonal Circumplex Model of behavior. Results indicated an association between affect and communal behavior, which was stronger for negative than positive affect. Depression symptoms moderated this association; elevated depression symptoms were associated with decreased association of affect and interpersonal behavior. Comorbid anxiety symptoms did not moderate this association. Results suggest that elevated depression symptoms are associated with a diminished ability to adapt communal behavior to emotion cues. Given prior evidence of elevated overall quarrelsome behavior among individuals with elevated depression symptoms, this may demonstrate an interpersonal mechanism by which emotion regulation deficits impact the generation of interpersonal problems.

After adjusting for confounders, logistic regression analyses showed that anxiety symptoms alone increased the probability for elevated hs-CRP levels (>3.0mg/L) in males over two-fold (2.19 CI 95% 1.08-4.46), while comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms caused a 1.7-fold (1.76 CI 95% 1.13-2.74) increase in the probability for elevated hs-CRP levels (1.0-3.0mg/L). Our results support the hypothesis that anxiety as well as comorbid anxiety and depression can be associated with an increased risk for low-grade inflammation in males at population level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21570260/"}

Towards a spatial cognitive bias test for mice.", "text": "Cognitive bias, the altered information processing resulting from the background emotional state of an individual, has been suggested as a promising new indicator of animal emotion. Comparable to anxious or depressed humans, animals in a putatively negative emotional state are more likely to judge an ambiguous stimulus as if it predicts a negative event, than those in positive states. The present study aimed to establish a cognitive bias test for mice based on a spatial judgment task and to apply it in a pilot study to serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout mice, a well-established mouse model for the study of anxiety- and depression-related behavior. In a first step, we validated that our setup can assess different expectations about the outcome of an ambiguous stimulus: mice having learned to expect something positive within a maze differed significantly in their behavior towards an unfamiliar location than animals having learned to expect something negative. In a second step, the use of spatial location as a discriminatory stimulus was confirmed by showing that mice interpret an ambiguous stimulus depending on its spatial location, with a position exactly midway between a positive and a negative reference point provoking the highest level of ambiguity. Finally, the anxiety- and depression-like phenotype of the 5-HTT knockout mouse model manifested--comparable to human conditions--in a trend for a negatively distorted interpretation of ambiguous information, albeit this effect was not statistically significant. The results suggest that the present cognitive bias test provides a useful basis to study the emotional state in mice, which may not only increase the translational value of animal models in the study of human affective disorders, but which is also a central objective of animal welfare research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25137069/"}
{"id": "21641046", "title": "The validity of DSM symptoms for depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy.", "text": "The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21641046/"}

Most research has focused on the role of postpartum depression, whereas maternal anxiety has been less studied, despite its high prevalence. A better understanding of the mental health variables that impact breastfeeding practices is necessary to support maternal and infant health and well-being. The aim of this study is to explore the association between breastfeeding practices and maternal mental health, with an emphasis on maternal anxiety. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Two hundred twenty-nine women were followed from the third trimester of gestation to 3 and 6 months postpartum. The participants provided self-reports of depression, anxiety, and breastfeeding practices. Mental health symptoms were compared between participants who reported exclusive versus mixed breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum, and between mothers who maintained breastfeeding versus those who had weaned their infants at 6 months postpartum. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the variables contributing to breastfeeding practices. <b><i>Results:</i></b> High levels of depressive symptoms during pregnancy were associated to nonexclusive breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum. At 3 months postpartum, both high levels of anxiety and depression were associated with nonexclusive breastfeeding at that time. Logistic regression analyses revealed that exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum predicted breastfeeding continuation at 6 months after childbirth. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Both maternal depression and anxiety negatively impact breastfeeding practices. Early identification of maternal mental health problems during the perinatal period is relevant to promote maternal emotional well-being and to prevent breastfeeding difficulties.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32522015/"}

Specifically, negative affect is broadly associated with these symptoms, whereas low positive affect is relatively specific to depression and social anxiety. However, it is unknown how affect relates to symptoms as they occur naturalistically in daily life or as a within-person dynamic process. 135 treatment-seeking adults completed a baseline assessment of trait affect and then rated current affect and symptoms (depression, social anxiety, panic, worry) three times per day for 10 days. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used, and prospective analyses held constant current symptoms. Baseline trait negative affect and individual differences in momentary negative affect predicted all four symptoms in daily life, whereas low positive affect predicted greater depression only. Similar results were found for within-person concurrent analyses. Prospectively, momentary negative affect predicted increased depression up to 24 h later, and increased panic or worry up to 8-16 h later. Low momentary positive affect predicted greater depression only (8 h later). All data were self-reported, and some relevant anxiety and mood symptoms were excluded. The timing of reports was random and may have missed notable symptoms. Given the novelty of the study, replication is important. Affective models of depression and anxiety derived from retrospective assessments demonstrated strong ecological validity.

This is the first study to investigate the association between the cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding and anxiety in patients with depression before and after antidepressant treatment and the association to treatment response. Ninety-one drug-free patients with depression were positron emission tomography scanned with the 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]-SB207145. Depression severity and concurrent anxiety was measured at baseline and throughout 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Anxiety measures included four domains: anxiety/somatization factor score; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 10-items (GAD-10) score; anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7 (anxious depression) and syndromal anxious depression. Forty patients were rescanned at week 8. At baseline, we found a negative association between global 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding and both GAD-10 score (p < 0.01) and anxiety/somatization factor score (p = 0.06). Further, remitters had a higher baseline anxiety/somatization factor score compared with non-responders (p = 0.04). At rescan, patients with syndromal anxious depression had a greater change in binding relative to patients with non-syndromal depression (p = 0.04). Concurrent anxiety in patients with depression measured by GAD-10 score and anxiety/somatization factor score is negatively associated with cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding. A lower binding may represent a subtype with reduced natural resilience against anxiety in a depressed state, and concurrent anxiety may influence the effect on the 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R from serotonergic antidepressants.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of digital depression interventions typically assess a wide range of secondary outcomes, but no study has aggregated these using meta-analytic techniques to quantify the interventions' broader impacts. This meta-analysis examined the broader effects of digital interventions for depression, analysing various outcomes covering mental health and wellbeing. We located trials from the most recent meta-analysis on digital interventions for depression and updated the search (Jan 2025) to capture new trials. Full inclusion criteria were met in 112 trials overall (97 from the previous meta-analysis and 15 from the updated search). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on 11 outcomes. Significant pooled effects favouring digital interventions for depression over controls were observed across all outcomes, including anxiety (N = 83; g = 0.40), global (N = 47; g = 0.30), physical (N = 21; g = 0.14) and mental quality of life (N = 37; g = 0.32), distress (N = 23; g = 0.51), disability (N = 28; g = 0.25), stress (N = 13; g = 0.36), behavioral activation (N = 14; g = 0.39), insomnia (N = 10; g = 0.28), self-efficacy (N = 11; g = 0.41), and work functioning (N = 12; g = 0.10). Effects remained largely stable in various sensitivity analyses that adjusted for risk of bias, potential outliers, small-study bias, and differences in population groups.

Secondary outcomes, measured at six and 12 months, included PHQ-ADS subscores, psychological distress related to somatic symptoms, recovery, health related quality of life, quality and patient centredness of chronic illness care, and adverse events. Between 24 March 2020 and 23 November 2021, 376 patients were randomised into treatment groups. Mean age was 45 years (standard deviation (SD) 14), 63% of the participants were female, and mean PHQ-ADS-score was 26 points (SD 7.6).

In addition to mental health history prior to cancer, modifiable health behaviours (physical activity, smoking status), psychological (helplessness-hopelessness, anxious preoccupation coping) and social (low positive social interaction) characteristics were stronger indicators of psychological morbidity than survivors' individual or disease characteristics. Psychological morbidity was assessed by self-report screening instrument rather than clinical interview. The extent to which psychological morbidity is age-related versus cancer-related cannot be determined without a gender- and age-matched control group. Although lower than previously reported, psychological morbidity is prevalent six months after a cancer diagnosis and emphasises the need for routine psychosocial assessment throughout the cancer trajectory to identify those at increased risk or in need of immediate intervention. Physical activity, smoking cessation and coping skills training interventions warrant further exploration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21864913/"}

This study developed a novel mouse model of depression called the post-witness social defeat stress (PWSDS) model, which combines witness stress with the social defeat paradigm. The model was evaluated based on behavior, central and peripheral immune responses, and predictive validity. The findings revealed that PWSDS-exposed mice exhibited significant anxiety-like behavior, depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and enhanced peripheral and central neuroimmune responses. Additionally, the antidepressant fluoxetine effectively ameliorated the depressive-like phenotypes and immune response in stressed mice. The model captured certain aspects of the behavioral and peripheral immune features of MDD patients. The levels of cortisol and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα in the serum of MDD patients with adult stressors increased compared with healthy controls, and were alleviated by SSRIs treatment, accompanied by improvement in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and cognitive impairments. This study establishes an improved mouse model of MDD, which has specific advantages in immune research and offers a novel approach to further study the pathogenesis and new treatment of MDD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40303307/"}

At 12 months' corrected age, fathers' parenting behaviors were assessed using the Emotional Availability Scales. Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to identify trajectories of fathers' depressive and anxiety symptoms, and linear regression equations examined relationships between these trajectories and fathers' parenting behaviors. For both depressive and anxiety symptoms, two distinct trajectories were identified. For depression, most fathers were assigned to the persistently low symptom trajectory (82%), while the remainder were assigned to the persistently high symptom trajectory (18%). For anxiety, 49% of fathers were assigned to the persistently low symptom trajectory, while 51% were assigned to the trajectory characterized by moderate symptoms over the first postnatal year. There were no significant differences in parenting behaviors between fathers assigned to the different depressive and anxiety symptom trajectories.

We investigated the prospective associations of maternal postnatal depression, and anxiety, with offspring depression, anxiety, psychotic-like experiences and Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms, in adolescence, and examined whether these were independent of each other. Data were obtained from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Maternal postnatal depression and anxiety at 8 weeks were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Crown-Crisp Index, respectively. Offspring mental health outcomes were measured at 10-13 years old, using a variety of questionnaire-based and interview assessments. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between maternal postnatal risk factors and offspring mental health, and path analysis was used to investigate the pathways of maternal postnatal factors to adolescent offspring outcomes. Data were available for 14,054 mothers with information reported on postnatal depression and 13,892 on postnatal anxiety. Logistic regression analyses found significant associations between maternal postnatal depression and offspring anxiety at 10 years old (odds ratio = 1.039, 95% confidence interval = [1.005, 1.073], <i>p</i> = 0.022) and between maternal postnatal anxiety and offspring psychotic experiences at 12/13 years old (odds ratio = 1.042, 95% confidence interval = [1.008, 1.077], <i>p</i> = 0.016). These significant associations remained after applying path analyses, when we controlled for potential offspring psychopathological overlay. These findings suggest that mothers with postnatal depression are more likely to have offspring with anxiety at 10 years old, and that mothers with postnatal anxiety are more likely to have offspring with psychotic experiences at 12/13 years old. Our findings suggest specific pathways in the association between postnatal anxiety/depression and offspring mental health and contribute to the importance of identifying mothers and their offspring with increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes resulting from postnatal mental health disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35234057/"}

In addition, mental health represents a key domain of healthcare, which currently has limited, adverse-effect prone treatment options, and probiotics may hold the potential to be a novel, customizable treatment for depression. Clinical depression is a common, potentially debilitating condition that may be amenable to a precision psychiatry-based approach utilizing probiotics. Although our understanding has not yet reached a sufficient level, this could be a therapeutic approach that can be tailored for specific individuals with their own unique set of characteristics and health issues. Scientifically, the use of probiotics as a treatment for depression has a valid basis rooted in the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) mechanisms, which play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. In theory, probiotics appear to be ideal as adjunct therapeutics for major depressive disorder (MDD) and as stand-alone therapeutics for mild MDD and may potentially revolutionize the treatment of depressive disorders. Although there is a wide range of probiotics and an almost limitless range of therapeutic combinations, this review aims to narrow the focus to the most widely commercialized and studied strains, namely <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and to bring together the arguments for their usage in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

They were also asked about a series of barriers to care. Analyses were weighted to account for low response rates. Those with more DBP training were significantly more likely to treat/manage/co-manage depression, anxiety, behavior problems and learning problems, but were still doing so less than one third of the time. There were no differences in the care of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or in screening or inquiring about mental health conditions. Those with more training were more likely to perceive somewhat fewer barriers and to report more specific familiarity with some Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and some treatment modalities.

However, the social mechanisms underlying mental health vulnerability in the context of mass crisis have been understudied. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, the aim of the current study was to examine experiences of resource loss, social exclusion, ethnic discrimination, and social support and their association with depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak among Arabs in Israel. The sample included 665 adult Arabs in Israel who completed an online self-report questionnaire regarding background variables, resource loss due to COVID-19, social exclusion, ethnic discrimination, social support, and depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants reported on average mild depression and anxiety severity scores, and 15.2% met criteria for major depressive disorder. Many (43.1%) reported experiencing more than 1 loss due to COVID-19 in health, finances or occupation, and interpersonal relationships. Path analyses show that cumulative losses due to COVID-19 and social exclusion were directly associated with depression and anxiety symptom levels. Discrimination moderated the association between losses and both depression and anxiety symptom levels. Mental health is embedded in dynamic sociopolitical contexts. Arabs as a national minority in Israel have a perceived sense of social exclusion and discrimination and social and material resource deprivation, which relates to their vulnerability, especially in the face of crisis. It is our obligation as researchers and practitioners to illuminate the centrality of these oppressive mechanisms in shaping mental health vulnerability. Clinical Impact Statement: The present study suggests that social exclusion and cumulative resource losses due to COVID-19 in areas of health, occupation, finances, and social connections predict depression and anxiety among Arabs in Israel. In addition, ethnic discrimination moderates the relationship between cumulative losses and mental health outcomes. These results highlight the importance of developing and implementing context-informed health and social care policies and practices, especially in this time of crisis.

In addition to evaluating the long-term effect of the prevention program, we also examined attrition and its effect on the outcome. High rates of attrition have commonly been observed in studies in the field. However, the role of attrition is not sufficiently understood regarding internal and external validity biases. The current study comprised 695 children (aged 8-11 at baseline) from 17 schools in Sweden. Schools were cluster-randomized to either the intervention or control condition. Children completed measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms and parents completed measures of their child's anxiety and general mental health. We found no evidence of long-term effects of the prevention program, except for a small effect regarding parent reports of child anxiety. However, that effect was not found to be of clinical significance. Regarding attrition, children with missing data at the 3-year follow-up displayed higher levels of psychiatric symptoms at baseline and increasing symptoms across time. Furthermore, children in the control condition with missing follow-up data were found to be significantly deteriorated across time compared to the corresponding children in the intervention condition regarding depressive symptoms and total difficulties. In other words, attrition served as a moderator of the effect, which suggests that the overall result was biased toward a null-result. Our study highlights that large and nonrandom attrition severely limits the validity of the results.

Although the mechanisms underlying these various causes remain under investigation, neuroinflammation is a leading hypothesis. To date, rodent models of recurrence-free tumor survival for understanding mechanisms by which these behavioral issues persist after cancer are lacking. Here, we test the extent to which potential behavioral symptoms persist after mammary tumor removal in mice (i.e., establishment of a cancer survivor model), while also empirically testing the causal role of tumors in the development of neuroinflammatory-mediated affective-like behaviors. Complete surgical resection of a non-metastatic orthotopic, syngeneic mammary tumor reversed tumor-induced increases of circulating cytokines (IL-6, CXCL1, IL-10) and myeloid-derived cells and modulated neuroinflammatory gene expression (Cd11b, Cxcl1). Multiple anxiety-like behaviors and some central and peripheral immune markers persisted or progressed three weeks after tumor resection. Together, these data indicate that persistent behavioral changes into cancer survivorhood may be due, in part, to changes in immunity that remain even after successful tumor removal.

Recent retrospective brain circuit-based analyses using lesion network mapping have suggested that a left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex target has a higher efficacy for alleviating depression symptoms, a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex target is more effective for anxiety symptoms, and a rostromedial prefrontal cortex target is effective for schizophrenia-associated psychiatric symptoms. Nonetheless, symptom-specific brain circuit targeting has not been tested prospectively. We conducted a narrative review of selected literature to investigate individualised targeting for TMS and discuss potential future directions to elucidate the efficacy of this approach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39379030/"}

The current study aimed to investigate memory bias in different mental disorders by using neutral, emotionally valenced and illness-related word stimuli in a directed forgetting task. Seventy-eight inpatients from a university-based psychosomatic hospital participated in the study. The item method of the directed forgetting task was used, in which participants are instructed to either forget or remember each item immediately after it has been presented. Memory performance was tested with a free recall test. Overall, 36 words were presented - 6 from each of 6 categories: neutral, negative, positive, illness related ('somatoform'), depression related, and anxiety related. Three words of each category were to be remembered and 3 were to be forgotten. Independently of the patients' diagnoses, we found that most patients had relative difficulties remembering anxiety- and depression-related words, compared to neutral words, when they were instructed to remember them. By contrast, in the 'instructed forgetting' condition, patients showed deficits in the ability to forget illness-related stimuli relative to neutral material. These effects were unspecific with regard to diagnosis. The results in the 'instructed remembering' condition might be interpreted in the context of cognitive avoidance instead of a memory bias. In the 'instructed forgetting' condition, it appeared that illness-related words were more difficult to suppress compared to the other word types, which could explain the observed memory bias.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22869355/"}

Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to examine existing empirical literature on yoga and its effects on women's health and well-being during the perinatal period. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systemic literature reviews, literature searches using relevant search terms were performed in four major electronic databases: CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Thirteen publications met inclusion criteria. Results indicated that yoga interventions are generally effective in reducing anxiety and depression in pregnant women.

To examine the prospective association of concern, worry, and stress related to school violence or shootings with internalizing problems and to examine sex and racial and ethnic differences in the magnitude of the associations. This longitudinal cohort study involved 3 surveys administered 6 months apart (fall of grade 11 [prebaseline]; spring of grade 11 [baseline]; and fall of grade 12 [follow-up]) from 2015 to 2016. Participants included 2263 students from 10 high schools in Los Angeles, California. Analyses were performed from April 29, 2020, to April 8, 2021. Baseline self-reported level of concern, worry, and stress about shootings or violence at the student's school or other schools, each rated on 5-point scales (ranging from not at all [0] to extremely [4]) with a mean score calculated as a 3-item composite index rescaled into z-score standard deviation units. Surpassing clinically significant or borderline significant thresholds for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or panic disorder based on symptom ratings on the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6-month follow-up.

Anonymous internet surveys were completed by 208 Jewish women and men of diverse denominations who resided primarily in the USA. Trust in God and positive religious coping were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms and mistrust in God and negative religious coping were associated with greater depressive symptoms. Intrinsic religiosity showed a small moderation effect for mistrust in God and negative religious coping in relation to depressive symptoms and for trust in God in relation to physical health. Further, positive religious coping fully mediated the link between trust in God and less depressive symptoms and negative religious coping fully mediated the relationship between mistrust in God and greater depressive symptoms. The data lend themselves to a possible integrative cognitive-coping model, in which latent core beliefs about the Divine activate coping strategies during times of distress, which in turn impact psychological health.

The pathway recommends formalized routine screening for anxiety and depression in patients with cancer at key points in the patient's journey. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System or distress thermometer with problem checklist is recommended as brief screening tools, combined with a more detailed tool, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, to identify possible cases. A structured clinical interview will be required to confirm diagnosis. When anxiety or depression is identified, it is recommended that one person in a treating team takes responsibility for coordinating appropriate assessment, referral and follow-up (not necessarily carrying these out themselves). A stepped care model of intervention is proposed, beginning with the least intensive available that is still likely to provide significant health gain. The exact intervention, treatment length and follow-up timelines, as well as professionals involved, are provided as a guide only. Each service should identify their own referral network based on local resources and current service structure, as well as patient preference. This clinical pathway will assist cancer services to design their own systems to detect and manage anxiety and depression in their patients, to improve the quality of care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26268799/"}

Yet, the intersection of postpartum mental health and postpartum family planning (FP) is understudied. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice that has proven helpful for improving mental health and supporting positive behavior change across health areas, including in low-resource settings. Drawing on existing CBT tools, we created and piloted an intervention called Mothers Time, designed to be delivered in three sessions by a community health worker (CHW) to small groups of postpartum women experiencing depression or anxiety symptoms and an unmet need for FP. Our objective was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Mothers Time in rural Amhara, Ethiopia. We recruited and trained four CHWs to deliver the intervention. We recruited 16 postpartum women experiencing mild to moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms to participate. We conducted in-depth interviews with women and CHWs before, during and after the intervention. We used a framework approach to analyze data. To assess acceptability, we analyzed data from mothers, probing to understand whether they found the intervention accessible, engaging, and relevant for the challenges they were experiencing postpartum. To assess feasibility, we explored CHWs ability to deliver the intervention and analyzed their capacity to deliver it at consistent quality. Interviews with CHWs and other health actors provided additional data on the feasibility of adding simplified CBT to CHWs' current package of services. Mothers perceived Mothers Time to be acceptable and to provide helpful tools for navigating the postpartum period. Prior to the intervention, many women felt isolated, and the group sessions supported social connection. Vignettes demonstrating simple CBT concepts engaged mothers, provoking reflection on how anxious or sad thoughts can impact behaviors that are important for informed FP use (such as care seeking, spousal communication and planning for the future) and sparked discussions on how mothers can support their own mental and physical health. Homework (explained by CHW in sessions and completed independently between sessions) helped women prioritize caring for themselves and social connection. Overall, we found that it was feasible for CHW to learn and deliver Mothers Time. CHW understood that mental health could create challenges for mothers and were able to use the simplified materials to share information about basic mental health concepts. Limited time was the biggest challenge; CHWs would benefit from additional training, and women would likely benefit from additional sessions. This research may be useful to practitioners looking to integrate mental health and postpartum FP in low-resource settings. These findings can be used as a foundation for future research and pilot interventions to support all women to meet their postpartum and FP needs, including those living with symptoms of depression and anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40410834/"}

Participants (N=722) included mental health professionals, lay people, immigrants, and refugees in Norway.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ketamine in 12 patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder who were not currently depressed, using an ascending single dose study design (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously) at weekly intervals. Within 1 h of dosing, patients reported reduced anxiety, which persisted for up to seven days. A dose-response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects, dissociative side effects, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate, with minor changes at 0.25 mg/kg, and progressively greater and more durable changes at the higher doses. Ten of 12 patients were treatment responders at 0.5-1 mg/kg. Ketamine was safe and well tolerated in this population. Ketamine may be a potential therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder. Along with its demonstrated effectiveness in patients with treatment-resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, these data raise the intriguing possibility that ketamine may have broad efficacy in disorders characterized by negative emotional states, and that these disorders may share a common precipitating neurobiology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28441895/"}

Additional age-standardized analyses were conducted to account for demographic changes. Overall, MDD 12-month prevalence remained stable at 7.4%. Women showed a shifted age distribution with increased prevalence at younger ages, and increasing MDD severity. Time trends in health-related correlates occurred both in participants with and without MDD. Mental health disability increased over time, particularly among men with MDD, reflected by the mental component score of the SF-36 and days with activity limitation due to mental health problems. Demographic changes had a marginal impact on the time trends. In contrast to the ongoing international debate regarding increased depression rates in western countries, we found no increase in overall MDD prevalence in Germany over a long period. In conclusion, increased depression frequencies in national health insurance data and growing health care costs associated with depression are not attributable to overall prevalence changes at a population level. However, shifted age distribution and increased severity among women may reflect a rising depression risk within this specific subgroup, and changes in health-related correlates indicate a growing mental health care need for depression, particularly among men.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30572872/"}

In their discussion, McHugh and Behar addressed implications of their findings for clinical assessment and for scale development. I expand on their comments by addressing the failure to consider vocabulary difficulty, a major shortcoming of readability indices that examine only text complexity. I demonstrate how vocabulary difficulty influences readability and discuss additional considerations and possible solutions for addressing the gap between scale readability and the reading skill level of the self-report respondent.

Thus, for those with a mood disorder, the type of the condition appears to have a distinct impact on the likelihood of suicide and self-harm.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30575701/"}

Previous research indicates that positivity relinquishment is a moderator of anxiety and depression, such that only anxious individuals who endorsed relinquishing positivity were also depressed. We sought to extend those findings by conducting three network analyses with self-report measures of anxiety, depression, activity avoidance, and perceived positivity of avoided activities (N = 104). We pre-registered our hypothesis for the first two networks that relinquishment of positivity would emerge as a central bridge symptom between anxiety and depressive symptoms. After combining redundant nodes, we estimated three networks and investigated the bridge symptoms in each network. Relinquishment of positivity bridged the symptom clusters in the first network, and avoidance of positivity was found to bridge the two symptom clusters of anxiety and depression in networks two and three. Additionally, an anhedonia circuit was uncovered in all three networks in which loss of interest/worthlessness, loss of energy, and loss of pleasure/pessimism connected to anxiety through relinquishment or avoidance. Our findings suggest that both relinquishment of positivity as well as avoidance of positivity could be potential pathways explaining the development and maintenance of anxiety and depression and should be properly targeted in treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39147161/"}

Confirmatory factor analysis, followed by structural equation modeling, were conducted to examine the factor structure of depression and to then examine the relations between these factors and the lower order factors of AS. This study was conducted in a sample of 374 adults (M age = 35.5, 54.3% female) with elevated levels of psychopathology (89.2% meeting criteria for at least one DSM-5 diagnosis, 25.6% primary depressive disorder). In this study a two-factor model of depression, composed of Cognitive and Affective/Somatic factors, was superior to one- and three-factor solutions. AS cognitive concerns were related to both cognitive and affective/somatic symptoms of depression. Neither of the other AS dimensions was related to depression symptom dimensions.

This study aimed to determine remission rates of subthreshold depression and anxiety, incidence rates of major depressive and anxiety disorders, and predictors of these remission and incidence rates in visually impaired older adults after a three-month 'watchful waiting' period. A pretest-posttest study in 265 visually impaired older adults (mean age 74 years), from outpatient low-vision rehabilitation services, with subthreshold depression and/or anxiety was performed as part of a randomised controlled trial on the cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention. An ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted. Main outcome measures were: (1) subthreshold depression and anxiety measured with the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and (2) depressive and anxiety disorders measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. After a three-month watchful waiting period, depression and anxiety decreased significantly by 3.8 (CES-D) and 1.4 points (HADS-A) (p < 0.001). Of all participants, 34 % recovered from subthreshold depression and/or anxiety and 18 % developed a depressive and/or anxiety disorder. Female gender [odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.86], more problems with adjustment to vision loss at baseline (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.03), more symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline (OR 1.06, 95 % CI 1.02-1.10), and a history of major depressive, dysthymic, and/or panic disorder (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.28-4.07) were associated with lower odds of remitting from subthreshold depression and/or anxiety and higher odds of developing a disorder after watchful waiting. Watchful waiting can be an appropriate step in managing depression and anxiety in visually impaired older adults. However, female gender, problems with adjustment to vision loss, higher depression and anxiety symptoms, and a history of a depressive or anxiety disorder confer a disadvantage. Screening tools may be used to identify patients with these characteristics, who may benefit more from higher intensity treatment or a shorter period of watchful waiting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26085328/"}

There was some variation in the number of sessions and timing of CBT, and whether there was a postpartum intervention. Five SRs showed that CBT reduced depression compared with usual care, an educational intervention, or no intervention. One SR that analyzed the effect on anxiety found that psychotherapy, including CBT, reduced anxiety compared with usual care or no intervention.

This study aims to explore the factor structure of the PHQ-9 and the ME/I between treatment groups over time for these patients. 187 secondary care patients with persistent major depressive disorder (PMDD) were recruited to a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with allocation to either a specialist depression team arm or a general mental health arm; their PHQ-9 score was measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Exploratory Structural Equational Modelling (ESEM) was performed to examine the factor structure for this specific patient group. ME/I between treatment arm at and across follow-up time were further explored by means of multiple-group ESEM approach using the best-fitted factor structure. A two-factor structure was evidenced (somatic and affective factor). This two-factor structure had strong factorial invariance between the treatment groups at and across follow up times. Participants were largely white British in a RCT with 40% attrition potentially limiting the study's generalisability. Not all two-factor modelling criteria were met at every time-point.

Specifically, it is proposed that memories of discrete events help define the circumstances (boundary conditions) in which our generalized knowledge applies, thereby enhancing accuracy of memory-dependent cognitive processes. However, in the domain of self-judgment, cognition is systematically biased, with a robust self-enhancement bias characterizing healthy individuals and a negativity bias characterizing the clinically depressed. We hypothesized that self-enhancement effects in the mentally healthy may partly rest on an impaired ability for specific memories to set appropriate boundary conditions on positive self-generalizations, while the opposite may be true for self-referred negative traits in the depressed. To assess this, we asked healthy and depressed individuals to think about the applicability of a trait to themselves, then to recall a specific memory that was inconsistent with that trait which would therefore index a boundary condition for its applicability. Healthy individuals showed faster recall only for specific positive memories following negative trait evaluations, while depressed individuals demonstrated faster recall only of specific negative memories following positive trait evaluations-the pattern expected given the respective self-enhancement and negativity biases. Results suggest that specific memories may serve to delimit self-generalizations in biased ways, and thus support systemic biases in trait judgments characteristic of healthy and depressed individuals.

Unfortunately, half of postpartum depression (PPD) cases begin during pregnancy but are not diagnosed until postpartum. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of PND lead to poor outcomes for both mother and child. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently updated its recommendation that screening for perinatal depression and anxiety occur at the initial prenatal visit, later in pregnancy, and at postpartum. Several hypotheses have been developed to explain the pathophysiology of PND including endocrine, epigenetic, synaptic transmission, neural network, neurosteroid, stress, and inflammatory mechanisms. Researchers believe that the answer lies in a synthesized mechanism of all of these models. Novel and emerging therapeutics are focusing on the neurosteroid mechanism within the integrated hypothesis. Neuroactive steroids are changing the understanding of the pathophysiology of depression and PPD, and novel and emerging therapeutics with new mechanisms of action based on these findings are impacting the treatment paradigm for this widespread and burdensome disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37585246/"}

This study investigated the change in the Distress and Risk Assessment Method (DRAM) outcome measure score after a 3-month course of NET was administered to participants. This was an uncontrolled cohort study in private practice. One hundred and eighty-eight (188) consecutive new patients presented to a NET clinic. The intervention was a 3-month course of NET, which incorporates elements of muscle testing, general semantics, Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, and chiropractic principles to manage patients' conditions. Scoring on the DRAM questionnaire was the outcome measure. Of the participants, 55.9% had musculoskeletal complaints, 34.6% had nonmusculoskeletal complaints, and 9.6% reported no presenting complaint. Strongly significant differences in the mean DRAM scores and the mean individual component scores were found between pre- and post-treatment. There was strong evidence to suggest that the Modified Somatic Perceptions Questionnaire and the Modified Zung Depression Index scores were correlated (p < 0.001), and that the allocation of subjects in any pretest category to categories on the basis of post-test scores changed from category to category. NET is different from traditionally described chiropractic practice, and appears, based on this one clinic, to have far more nonmusculoskeletal presentations. This profile, if consistent with other practices, has strong implications for scope of practice for this form of chiropractic practitioners. Many participant presentations were \"at risk\" of, or were clinically depressed, according to the DRAM. The DRAM status of the patient cohort significantly and clinically improved with the NET treatment. As this study was nonrandomized and uncontrolled, the results should be viewed with caution.

This longitudinal study recruited 404 students (aged 17-25 years) attending one UAE university (80.4% response rate). At baseline, participants completed a paper-based survey to assess socio-economic factors and academic performance, including most recent grade point average (GPA) and attendance warnings. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. At six-month follow-up, 134 participants (33.3%) provided details of their current GPA. Over a third of students (34.2%; CIs 29.7-38.9%) screened for possible major depressive disorder (MDD; PHQ-9 ≥ 10) but less than a quarter (22.3%; CIs 18.2-26.3%) screened for possible generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 ≥ 10). The Possible MDD group had lower GPAs (p = 0.003) at baseline and were less satisfied with their studies (p = 0.015). The MDD group also had lower GPAs at follow-up (p = 0.035). The Possible GAD group had lower GPAs at baseline (p = 0.003) but did not differ at follow-up. The relationship between GAD group and GPA was moderated by gender with female students in the Possible GAD group having lower GPAs (p < 0.001) than females in the Non-GAD group. Male students in the Possible GAD group had non-significantly higher GPA scores. Higher levels of both depression and anxiety symptoms scores were associated with lower GPAs at baseline. PHQ-9 scores, but not GAD-7 scores, independently predicted lower GPA scores at follow-up (p = 0.006). This relationship was no longer statistically significant after controlling for baseline GPA (p < 0.09).

Social anxiety disorder is unique among the anxiety disorders in sharing an affective profile with depression, characterized by low levels of positive affect (PA) and high levels of negative affect (NA). Yet it remains unclear how this shared affective profile contributes to the covariation of social anxiety and depressive symptoms. We examined whether self-reported PA and NA accounted for unique variance in the association between social anxiety and depressive symptoms across three groups (individuals with remitted bipolar disorder, type I [BD; n = 32], individuals with remitted major depressive disorder [MDD; n = 31], and nonpsychiatric controls [n = 30]) at baseline and follow-ups of 6 and 12 months. Low levels of PA, but not NA, accounted for unique variance in both concurrent and prospective associations between social anxiety and depression in the BD group; in contrast, high levels of NA, but not PA, accounted for unique variance in concurrent and prospective associations between social anxiety and depression in the MDD group. Limitations include that social anxiety and PA/NA were assessed concurrently and all measurement was self-report. Few individuals with MDD/BD met current diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder. There was some attrition at follow-up assessments.

In the treatment of anxiety disorders, it is concluded that self-administered and predominantly self-help interventions are most effective for motivated clients. Conversely, minimal-contact therapies have demonstrated efficacy for the greatest variety of anxiety diagnoses when accounting for both attrition and compliance. Additionally, predominantly self-help computer-based cognitive and behavioral interventions are efficacious in the treatment of subthreshold mood disorders.

Fifty participants with CMDD and 58 healthy controls completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) using a standard protocol. Neuroticism and extraversion were measured using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. Hierarchical linear regressions assessed associations between independent variables neuroticism and extraversion and dependent variable cortisol area-under-the-curve increase (AUCi) in response to the TSST in the two study groups. The extraversion-by-group interaction was a significant predictor of cortisol AUCi, while no significant findings related to neuroticism were found. Simple slopes analysis revealed a significant negative association between extraversion and AUCi in the CMDD group, but not in healthy controls. Post-hoc analysis of the raw cortisol data over time found that CMDD participants with higher extraversion scores had significantly higher pre-challenge cortisol levels than did other study participants, however this did not explain or confound the AUCi results. In participants with CMDD but not in controls, higher levels of extraversion were associated with higher pre-challenge cortisol levels and decreased cortisol reactivity during the TSST, however these two findings were statistically independent.

The results help clarify the strength and direction of effects between resource deprivation and depression, anxiety , and PTSD sympotms over time. Although resource deprivation is predictive of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms among recently resettled refugees, the effect may not persist in the long term. These findings have critical implications, including the urgency of ensuring initial access to resources for resettled refugees to stave off the development of depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms, as delaying immediate resource access may result in the development of chronic, hard-to-treat mental health disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37339147/"}

Recent research on the gut-brain axis has led to interest in probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics as potential therapeutic options for depression. This systematic review aims to evaluate their effects and provide evidence-based insights for future research and clinical practice. Six digital databases (Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and CINAHL complete) were examined for English-language records. Inclusion criteria involved studies assessing the impact of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotic on depression and anxiety in individuals with depression. The Cochrane Collaboration's instrument was employed to evaluate the risk of bias. For meta-analysis, random-effects model was favored, and statistical analysis was conducted using Stata software version 17. From initial 4407 studies 19 studies included in meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 19 studies involving 1405 participants (882 cases and 523 controls) revealed a significant decrease in depression scores among patients receiving probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics compared to the control group (SMD: -1.76 [-2.42, -1.10]), despite high heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup>: 96.29 %). Similarly, analysis of seven studies with 481 participants (237 cases and 244 controls) showed a significant decrease in anxiety scores for those receiving these supplements (SMD: -1.60 [-2.83, -0.36]), with high heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup>: 96.90 %). In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicates that probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics significantly reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with depression.

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale were used. Migraine was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition. The patients were divided into no migraine, inactive migraine, and active migraine subgroups. Multiple logistic regressions were used to investigate the significant factors related to full remission of depression. Among patients without pharmacotherapy at the follow-up, patients with active migraine had significantly greater severities of anxiety and somatic symptoms as compared with patients without migraine; moreover, patients with active migraine had the lowest improvement percentage and full remission rate. There were no significant differences in depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms between patients with inactive migraine and those without migraine. Active headache at follow-up was a significant factor related to a lower full remission rate. Active headache at follow-up was associated with a lower rate of full remission and more residual anxiety and somatic symptoms at follow-up among patients with migraine.

The recovery experience may involve multiple positive resources and may be hindered by negative experiences or states. Most prior studies have focused on the latter, generating a gap in understanding the role for positive psychology measures in recovery from gambling disorder. This study investigated the associations between symptom improvement in gambling disorder and positive resources operationalized as recovery capital (internal and external resources that individuals may draw upon during the recovery process) and intrinsic spirituality. Negative experiences and states, including stressful life events, depression, and anxiety, were also considered. One hundred and 40 individuals (101 men) with a lifetime gambling disorder treated in 5 treatment centers in Israel were assessed on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder (lifetime and past-year), Brief Assessment of Recovery Capital Scale adapted to gambling disorder, Intrinsic Spirituality Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 for depression, and Stressful Life Events Scale. Improvement in gambling disorder was calculated by subtracting the criteria count for the previous year from the lifetime count. Although anxiety, stressful life events, and depression were found to be negatively associated with gambling disorder symptom improvement, only recovery capital and spirituality remained significant when all variables were entered together in a multiple regression analysis. These findings highlight the positive role of recovery capital and spirituality in the recovery process and suggest treatment providers should integrate a positive psychology approach in gambling disorder treatment programs.

Mothers with babies between zero and twelve months (N=527) were recruited to a cross-sectional online survey containing a battery of psychometric measures. Correlation analyses examined relationships between the predictor (maternal-infant bonding), outcome (infant temperament), and mediator (maternal mental health; anxiety and/or depression). All associations were highly significant (p<.001). A parallel mediation (anxiety and/or depression) model was conducted, showing a significant indirect effect of maternal-infant bonding on infant temperament through anxiety, B = .04 (SE= .01) 95% CI= .01 to .07, but not through depression. Homogeneous sampling was an issue with mainly UK, married mothers, with higher socio-economic status and educational attainment participating.

Activities such as sleep, diet, exercise, and time spent using electronic devices are related to declining mental health. However, few studies have examined the association between commuting times to school and mental health. This study tested the hypothesis that high school students' long commuting times are associated with poor mental health. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October and December 2022 among 2067 students at two private high schools. Survey items included participant information (sex, grade, school), commuting time, mental health status (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]: depressive symptoms, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 [GAD-7]: anxiety symptoms), lifestyle factors, and sleep-related factors. Data from 1899 high school students were analyzed. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 17.3% and 19.0%, respectively. A commuting time of ≥1 h was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio: 1.60 [95% confidence interval]: 1.14-2.24) and anxiety symptoms (adjusted odds ratio: 1.51 [95% confidence interval]: 1.09-2.10). Sex, grade, use of ≥8 h/day of electronic devices, and chronotype were significantly associated with depressive symptoms, while sex, grade, use of ≥8 h/day of electronic devices, and insomnia were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. It is suggested that long commuting times are associated with poor mental health in high school students.

This study therefore aims to characterize the concordance between the BHL data gathered by telephone and in-person interviews. A cross-sectional study was conducted with English-speaking aging services network (ASN) clients aged 60 years and older in Monroe County, NY who were randomized to a BHL interview either in-person (n = 55) or by telephone (n = 53). There was strong evidence of equivalence between telephone and in-person interviews for depressive disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, drug misuse, psychosis, PTSD, mental illness symptom severity, and five of the six questions assessing suicidality. There was marginal equivalence in PHQ-9 total scores and one of the six questions assessing suicidal ideation, and no evidence of equivalence between interview modalities for assessing cognitive impairment. With a few exceptions, the BHL gathered nearly equivalent information via telephone as compared to in-person interviews. This suggests that the BHL may be a cost-effective approach appropriate for dissemination in a wide variety of settings including the ASN.

Both nomograms demonstrated superior discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability compared to PHQ-9. Anxiety emerged as a most significant predictor for SD, while sleep problems exhibited high rankings for both SD and MDD. The two predictors subsequently affect concentration and daytime functioning.

This relationship opens the opportunity to develop new antidepressant drugs by repurposing antidiabetic drugs. Previous research has demonstrated that GLP-1 analogs are neuroprotective in several neurological disease models including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. In addition, the GLP-1 analog liraglutide has been shown to promote neurogenesis, which is seen to play important roles in memory formation and cognitive and emotional processing. However, whether liraglutide is an effective antidepressant remains unknown. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis in the depression model of chronic administration of corticosterone (CORT) in mice and treated the animals daily with liraglutide (5 or 20 nmol/kg ip.) to assess its therapeutic potential as an antidepressant. Behavioral studies showed that liraglutide administration attenuated depressive- and anxiety- like behaviors in this depression mouse model, and attenuated the hyperactivity induced by the stress hormone. Additionally, liraglutide treatment protected synaptic plasticity and reversed the suppression of hippocampal long-term potentiation induced by CORT administration, demonstrating synaptic protective effects of liraglutide. We also found that liraglutide treatment increased the cell density of immature neurons in the subgranular dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. In addition, liraglutide prevented the CORT induced impairments and simultaneously increased the level of phosphorylated GSK3β in the hippocampus, which may be instrumental in the anti-depressant activity of liraglutide treatment. Taken together, liraglutide has the potential to act as a therapeutic treatment of depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29705602/"}

Animal research indicates that central oxytocin facilitates adaptive social attachments and modulates stress and anxiety responses. Major depression is prevalent among postpubertal females, and is associated with perturbations in social attachments, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis, and elevated levels of anxiety. Thus, depressed women may be at risk to display oxytocin dysregulation. The current study was developed to compare patterns of peripheral oxytocin release exhibited by depressed and nondepressed women. Currently depressed (N = 17) and never-depressed (N = 17) women participated in a laboratory protocol designed to stimulate, measure, and compare peripheral oxytocin release in response to two tasks: an affiliation-focused Guided Imagery task and a Speech Stress task. Intermittent blood samples were drawn over the course of two, 1-hour sessions including 20-minute baseline, 10-minute task, and 30-minute recovery periods. The 10-minute laboratory tasks did not induce identifiable, acute changes in peripheral oxytocin. However, as compared with nondepressed controls, depressed women displayed greater variability in pulsatile oxytocin release over the course of both 1-hour sessions, and greater oxytocin concentrations during the 1-hour affiliation-focused imagery session. Oxytocin concentrations obtained during the imagery session were also associated with greater symptoms of depression, anxiety, and interpersonal dysfunction.

Using men as the reference point, women had an elevated risk of having some type of psychiatric disorder (odds ratio, 2.86, p = 0.007). The HADS-D score was notably higher in women (8.66 ± 3.717) than men (6.87 ± 4.531, p = 0.004). It was determined that male patients who developed depression were on average younger than those without depression (p = 0.005). Women demonstrated an elevated risk of having anxiety and/or depression disorder compared to men. Furthermore, depression severity increased with age in men, while anxiety severity decreased. In contrast, depression and anxiety severity was similar for women of all ages after the MI. A higher depression score was associated with diabetes and physical inactivity, whereas a higher anxiety score was associated with smoking in men. Hypercholesterolemia was associated with both higher anxiety and depression scores, and a higher depression score was associated with physical inactivity in women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30156607/"}

However, most research has been undertaken in western countries. This study examined the association between financial debt, worry about debt, and mental health in Japan, where there has been little specific focus on debt and its effects on mental health. Data were analyzed from 3717 respondents collected in an online survey in 2023. Information on financial debt and worry about debt was collected with single-item questions. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale were used to respectively collect information on depression and anxiety symptoms, while a single-item measure was used to obtain information on a recent history of suicidal ideation. Logistic regression was used to assess associations. Both financial debt (17.7%) and worry about debt (14.8%) were prevalent in the study sample. In fully adjusted analyses, compared to those with no debt and worry about debt, individuals who were worried about debt but had no debt, or who had debts and were worried about debt had significantly higher odds for suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. In contrast, having debt but not being worried about debt was not associated with any of the mental health outcomes. The results of this study suggest that worrying about debt is strongly associated with poorer mental health among Japanese adults. Interventions to address debt and its associated worries may be important for improving public mental health in Japan.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37848860/"}

This cross-validation study included 5.116 respondents (mean age 36.9 (9.8)), of which 49.4% (2526) were women. The depression and anxiety screening test was done in electronic form and based on the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The validated HADS scale was used as a standard test. The categories of depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A) phenotypes were formed with a cutoff of ≥8 points and ≥11 points. The main parameters of the validity of the screening test were calculated, including accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) with their 95% confidence intervals [CI]. The prevalence of current depression and anxiety according to the screening test was 7.8% (400) and 12.5% (639), respectively. The prevalence of lifetime depression was 25.9% (1327). For the HADS-D depression subscale with cut-offs of ≥11 and ≥8 points, the prevalence of depression was 3.4% (174) and 15% (766), respectively. For the HADS-A anxiety subscale with cut-offs of ≥11 and ≥8 points, the prevalence of anxiety was 8.9% (456) and 31.8% (1628), respectively. For HADS-D and HADS-A with a cutoff of ≥11 points, the parameters of current depression were Ac=92%, Sn=47% (CI 95% [39-54]), Sp=94% (CI 95% [93-94]), lifetime depression - Ac=75%, Sn=63% (CI 95% [56-70]), Sp=75% (CI 95% [74-77]) and current anxiety - Ac=88%, Sn=54% (CI 95% [50-59]) and Sp=92% (CI 95% [90-92]).

Inpatient treatment for SUDs reduces patient relapse, which subsequently ameliorates these negative effects on the individual and society. Additionally, those who complete treatment are less likely to relapse compared to those who do not complete treatment. Thus, maintaining patient engagement in treatment and reducing the rates of those leaving against medical advice (AMA) is particularly important. Examining the factors and comorbidities that may contribute to treatment dropout has the potential to identify at-risk patients in need of additional individualized intervention. The current study aimed to examine comorbid anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as predictors of dropout AMA in a residential substance use treatment population. Results showed that patients with social anxiety were more likely to leave treatment AMA, while those with PTSD were more likely to complete treatment. Findings suggest that PTSD-specific treatment, as offered in this facility, may help with patient retention, while group focused therapy may be distressing to those with social anxiety. Clinical implications of this research may include incorporating evidence-based practice for social anxiety early during inpatient treatment to reduce anxiety such that patients may better engage with SUDs treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38662953/"}

Data collection included quantitative measures at the outset and end of the study, digital recording of sessions, observation and reflective diaries. Qualitative data were analysed thematically and critically compared with digital recordings. The evidence suggested a reduction in depressive symptoms for Get into Reading group participants. Three potential catalysts for change were identified: literary form and content, including the balance between prose and poetry; group facilitation, including social awareness and communicative skills; and group processes, including reflective and syntactic mirroring. This study has generated hypotheses about potential change processes of Get into Reading groups. Evidence of clinical efficacy was limited by small sample size, participant attrition and lack of controls. The focus on depression limited the generalisability of findings to other clinical groups or in non-clinical settings.

To date, no study has explored whether youth perceptions of parenting style are heterogeneous in families with a depressed parent or whether heterogeneous parenting styles are associated with children's internalizing symptoms. Participants were children aged 8-16 years who had a parent with major depressive disorder; they were enrolled through their parents, who were outpatients at two hospitals in Ningxia. Parenting styles were measured using the Parental Bonding Instrument. Youth depression and anxiety were measured using the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders, respectively. We applied latent profile analysis to identify the subtypes of parenting styles with similar patterns. Differences between subtypes in relation to demographic variables and parenting style scores were calculated using one-way ANOVAs, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and chi-squared tests. Bivariate logistic analyses were conducted to examine the associations between parental bonding subtypes and children's depression and anxiety. Four parenting styles were identified through latent profile analysis: care-autonomy, overprotection-indifference, indifference, and undifferentiated parenting. Youth with care-autonomy parents had a lower risk of depression (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.41) and anxiety (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10-0.48), while indifference parenting increased children's risk of depression (OR: 5.29; 95% CI: 1.30-21.54) more than undifferentiated parenting. Children with a depressed parent had heterogeneous perceptions of parenting styles. Mothers' and fathers' parenting styles were largely congruent.

Depressive, anxiety and worry symptoms were stable since April-May 2020 whereas happiness slightly decreased. Furthermore, positive coping steadily decreased and loneliness increased - exceeding pre-Covid and April-May 2020 levels. Perceived mental health impact and fear of Covid-19 fluctuated in accordance with national Covid-19 mortality rate changes. Absolute levels of all outcomes were poorer with higher chronicity of disorders, yet trajectories did not differ among subgroups. The most vulnerable psychiatric groups may have been underrepresented and results may not be generalizable to lower income countries. After a year, levels of depressive and worry symptoms remained higher than before the pandemic in healthy control groups, yet not in psychiatric groups.

Although many factors determine the mental health of an individual, diet has been gaining popularity as a key modifiable factor in the prevention and management of depression. Nutritional Psychiatry is an emerging field where researchers suggest that the food we consume influences our mental well-being. This review aims to explore the significance of diet, nutrient deficiencies, imbalances, and unhealthy dietary patterns in the prevention and management of unipolar depression or major depressive disorder among adolescents. Electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and MEDLINE were searched using keywords such as \"mental health,\" \"depression,\" \"adolescents,\" \"diet,\" \"dietary pattern,\" and pertinent articles (<i>N</i> = 68) were retrieved and reviewed. The Mediterranean and traditional diets rich in complex carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, B-group vitamins and several amino acids have shown negative correlation with the incidence of depression. On the other hand, Western dietary patterns (sweetened beverages, processed/ junk food, and foods rich in saturated fatty acids), along with low consumption of fruits and vegetables have been linked to an increased risk of depression among adolescents. Dietary modification can prove to be a cost-effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression among adolescents. Diet and nutrition need to be recognized as key modifiable targets for the prevention of mental disorders and nutritional medicine should be considered as an integral part of psychiatric treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33416032/"}

The endocannabinoid system (ECS), comprising endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors, is the critical pathway that mediates responses to stress stimuli. This study aimed to investigate the ECS's impact on responding to chronic social instability stress (SIS). Wistar (WIS) rats and an endogenously depressed rat model, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), were used to evaluate depression- and anxiety-like behavioral responses, cognitive function, hormone levels, and ECS function. The animals in the stress group (WIS-STS and WKY-STS) were exposed to TMT (predator odor) for 10 mins (two exposures in total: one in light cycle and one in dark cycle) and daily roommate changes (30 days in total), while the control group (CTL) rats were exposed to a sham odor stimulus (distilled water) and did not undergo roommate changes. The results in the open field test suggest that WKY rats had significantly lower locomotor activity than WIS rats. In contrast, WKY rats and chronically stressed WIS rats presented similar depression- and anxiety-like behaviors and impaired cognitive function in the elevated plus maze, forced swimming test, and novel objective recognition test. However, chronic SIS did not exacerbate these behavioral changes in WKY rats. ELISA and Western blot analysis indicated that chronic SIS did not induce further upregulation of endocannabinoids and CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation in WKY rats compared to WIS rats. In addition, the Luminex assay revealed that WKY rats showed a higher resilience on the HPA-axis modulation towards chronic SIS, distinguished by the hyperactivity of the HPA-axis modulation in WIS rats. Overall, the study revealed that the chronic SIS animal model (stressed WIS rats) and an animal model of endogenous depression (WKY rats) can generate similar behavioral changes in anxious behavior, behavioral despair, and cognitive impairment. Both animal models present hyperactivity of the ACTH modulation and ECS activity, while WKY rats are more resilient on CORT modulation towards chronic SIS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437836/"}

A total of 2305 women were included, with 1639 during pregnancy and 666 during postpartum. Psychological distress was assessed using the Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI-18), and data were analyzed using independent t-tests and multiple logistic regressions. The prevalence of psychological distress, defined by a cut-off score of BSI ≥ 13, was 19% during pregnancy and 15% during postpartum. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that high-risk pregnancy was the leading risk factor for psychological distress during the antenatal period (β = 1.776, P < 0.001), as well as its three subscales: somatization (β = 1.355, P = 0.019), anxiety symptoms (β = 2.249, P < 0.001), and depressive symptoms (β = 1.381, P = 0.028). Additionally, women with a gestational age < 20 weeks had a higher risk of psychological distress (β = 1.344, P = 0.038) and the somatization subscale (β = 1.641, P < 0.001). During the postpartum period, women residing in urban areas were at higher risk of psychological distress (β = 1.949, P = 0.012), as well as two subscales: anxiety symptoms (β = 1.998, P = 0.012) and depressive symptoms (β = 1.949, P = 0.020). The high prevalence of psychological distress emphasizes detecting and treating PD during pregnancy and postpartum, particularly in women with high-risk pregnancies. This study suggests that obstetricians and midwives should implement programs to identify women experiencing psychological distress during early pregnancy through postpartum visits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37964209/"}

This situation originates from lack of suitable animal models of human crying. In the present article, an attempt will be made to answer the question whether emission of rat aversive vocalizations (22 kHz calls) may be regarded as an evolutionary equivalent of adult human crying. Using this comparison, the symptom of crying in depressed human patients will be reanalyzed. Numerous features and characteristics of rat 22 kHz aversive vocalizations and human crying vocalizations are equivalent. Comparing evolutionary, biological, physiological, neurophysiological, social, pharmacological, and pathological aspects have shown vast majority of common features. It is concluded that emission of rat 22 kHz vocalizations may be treated as an evolutionary vocal homolog of human crying, although emission of 22 kHz calls is not exactly the same phenomenon because of significant differences in cognitive processes between these species. It is further concluded that rat 22 kHz vocalizations and human crying vocalizations are both expressing anxiety and not depression. Analysis of the relationship between anxiety and depression reported in clinical studies supports this conclusion regardless of the nature and extent of comorbidity between these pathological states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30677449/"}

Twenty-five published RCTs were identified and reviewed, with a total of 2495 perinatal women. MBI was superior to controls for clinical and subthreshold perinatal depression and anxiety. The benefit for depression reduction was stable over time and sustained to the postpartum period, but the maintenance effect on perinatal anxiety was less conclusive. Moreover, MBI's post-intervention effects on depression and anxiety were moderated by perinatal women's symptom severity. The post intervention effects were significantly greater among women in Low- and Middle-Income countries, where perinatal mental health care is less available and accessible. Greater improvement in mindfulness was also associated with a significantly larger post-intervention effect on perinatal depression.

We review evidence from prospective studies reporting on associations between mental health conditions and the menopause transition. Major depressive disorder and the more prevalent subthreshold depressive symptoms are the most common conditions studied. We reviewed 12 prospective studies reporting depressive symptoms, major depressive disorder, or both over the menopause transition and found no compelling evidence for a universal increased risk for either condition. However, specific subgroups of participants, primarily defined by menopause-related risk factors (ie, vasomotor symptoms that are severe or disturb sleep, a long duration of the transition, or reproductive hormone dynamics) and psychosocial risk factors (eg, stressful life events), were vulnerable to depressive symptoms. The increased risk of major depressive disorder over the menopause transition appears predominantly in individuals with previous major depressive disorder. Greater focus on recognising risk factors in primary care is warranted. On the basis of scarce data, we found no compelling evidence that risk of anxiety, bipolar disorder, or psychosis is universally elevated over the menopause transition. Potential misattribution of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders to menopause could harm women by delaying accurate diagnosis and the initiation of effective psychotropic treatments, and by creating negative expectations for people approaching menopause. A paradigm shift is needed.

We hypothesised that retirement was followed by reduced prevalence of hospital treatment for depression and antidepressant purchase. Participants were 245,082 Danish workers who retired between 2000 and 2006. Information on retirement, hospital treatment and antidepressant purchases were obtained from Danish national registers. The yearly prevalence of hospital treatment for depression and antidepressant purchases was estimated in relation to the year of retirement from 5 years prior to the retirement year to 5 years after retirement. Using logistic regressions with generalised estimating equations we analysed the trends in prevalence before, during and after the retirement. Two of 1000 participants were hospitalised with depression in the year of their retirement and 63 of 1000 purchased antidepressant medication during the retirement year. The prevalence of hospital treatment for depression increased before and around retirement, followed by a slight decline from 2 years after retirement with the prevalence of hospitalisation dropping from 0.21%(retirement +2 years) to 0.16% (retirement +5 years). For antidepressants, we observed a steady increase in purchases before retirement (retirement -2 years). This increase levelled off in the years around retirement, but continued after retirement (retirement +2 years). Overall, this study did not confirm the hypothesis that retirement is beneficial for mental health measured by hospitalisation with depression and treatment with antidepressants. Although the temporary levelling off of the increase in antidepressant treatment around time of retirement might indicate a beneficial effect, this possible effect was only short-term.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25814269/"}

Cancer treatment has markedly progressed, and so the development of cancer is now not necessarily a death sentence. Nevertheless, approximately half of cancer patients actually die as a result of the disease even today. Cancer causes marked suffering of patients. Patients with advanced and/or terminal cancer suffer from various physical symptoms and are forced to face a continuous decline in their physical function, and previous studies reported that psychological distress is frequently observed in cancer patients, especially in advanced and/or terminally ill patients. Several types of psychological defense mechanism, especially denial, are frequently observed in these patients. There are multiple levels of denial For example, a patient with true denial denies the presence of cancer itself, although true denial is quite rare. A patient with moderate denial is likely to deny an association between distressing symptoms and disease, while one with mild denial denies the life-threatening nature of disease. Denial is a psychological defense mechanism that often helps advanced cancer patients to manage their anxiety and depression. It allows such patients to continue living while facing the painfulness of their situation. In this situation, it is important for therapists to note the patient's denial. Simply being aware of the denial can, in itself, be supportive for the patient. However, when denial does not work adaptively, such as it prohibiting adherence to necessary treatment and not being useful for ameliorating psychological distress and improving the quality of life, medical staff may consider confronting a patient with the reality of the situation carefully. This paper discusses the relevance of acknowledging denial and caring for patients with denial from the point of view of psycho-oncology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27044140/"}

Whereas telemedicine has long been considered a key to reducing barriers to care, the extent to which patients tolerate and benefit therapeutically from just-in-time adapted delivery formats remains unclear. Here, we report findings from a crisis-related shift in treatment delivery format during an intervention trial. Eighty-five treatment-seeking adults with severely low positive affect, moderate-to-severe depression or anxiety, and functional impairment were randomized to either 15-session Positive Affect Treatment (PAT) or Negative Affect Treatment (NAT), with approximately 1/3 receiving in-person treatment (before March 2020), 1/3 switched to virtual sessions, and 1/3 treated exclusively virtual. We compared delivery modes and their interactions with treatment type as predictors or moderators of change in positive affect, depression/anxiety/stress, and clinician-assessed anhedonia. Treatment fidelity, credibility, therapeutic alliance, and attendance were equally high among treatment conditions and delivery formats. Individuals treated entirely virtually versus entirely in-person demonstrated superior clinical status. Sensitivity analyses suggest that, within participants, improvement in clinical status was greater when treatment was delivered virtually than in-person, despite controlling for therapist status. Cohort-independent and effectiveness studies are needed to confirm the equivalence of need-based switches to virtual or in-person treatment on treatment tolerability and efficacy. As the rise in public health and environmental disasters calls for greater adaptability in the delivery of evidence-based psychotherapy, our findings suggest that crisis-driven switching to virtual format delivery appears acceptable and comparably effective despite the clinical severity of the treated population.

About 57% of depression cases showed evidence of comorbid anxiety, while only 28% of those with clinically significant anxiety had concurrent depression. There was not only an overlap in the distribution of risk factors in these diagnostic groups but also differences. We found that 31%, 23%, and 35% of older adults with anxiety, depression, and DA showed persistence of symptoms after two years. Repeated anxiety was more common in women and repeated depression in men. Socioeconomic stressors were common in repeated DA.

This study utilized a randomized controlled research design (n = 50) to examine the efficacy of four-sessions of abbreviated MBT and BA relative to a wait-list control condition with depressed college students. Intent-to-treat data analyses on depression outcome measures suggested both treatments were superior to the control group. There were significant pre-post treatment improvements across measures of depression, rumination, stress, and mindfulness, gains largely maintained at 1-month follow-up. Neither active treatment effectively reduced somatic anxiety. Both treatments generally had moderate-strong effect sizes relative to the control group, and based on depression response and remission criteria, 56-79% of patients exhibited clinically significant improvement.

Electronic health records (EHRs) collect a great deal of biometric markers and patient characteristics that could foster the detection of GAD and MDD in primary care settings. We approached the problem of predicting MDD and GAD using a novel machine learning pipeline to re-analyze data from an observational study. The pipeline constitutes an ensemble of algorithmically distinct machine learning methods, including deep learning. A sample of 4,184 undergraduate students completed the study, undergoing a general health screening and completing a psychiatric assessment for MDD and GAD. After explicitly excluding all psychiatric information, 59 biomedical and demographic features from the general health survey in addition to a set of engineered features were used for model training. We assessed the model's performance on a held-out test set and found an AUC of 0.73 (sensitivity: 0.66, specificity: 0.7) and 0.67 (sensitivity: 0.55, specificity: 0.7) for GAD, and MDD, respectively. Additionally, we used advanced techniques (SHAP values) to illuminate which features had the greatest impact on prediction for each disease. The top predictive features for MDD were being satisfied with living conditions and having public health insurance. The top predictive features for GAD were vaccinations being up to date and marijuana use. Our results indicate moderate predictive performance for the application of machine learning methods in detection of GAD and MDD based on EHR data.

Cognitive restructuring and problem-solving were the most popular strategies to treat depressive symptoms, whereas anxiety programs also generally included relaxation and exposure. Furthermore, six strategies were identified in a single anxiety program, whereas nine strategies were implemented in only one depression program. These results suggest that in anxiety and depression programs designed for children and adolescents, the label \"CBT\" encompasses a wide variety of programs with only few similar strategies.

Apart from nosological differences (e.g., worry for anxiety, low mood for depression), it remains unclear how the emotional dysregulation inherent in individual differences in trait anxiety and depression severity present on a day-to-day basis. One approach that may facilitate addressing these questions is to utilize Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) using mobile phones to parse the temporal dynamics of affective experiences into specific parameters. An emerging literature in affective science suggests that risk for anxiety and depressive disorders may be associated with variation in the mean and instability/variability of emotion. Here we examine the extent to which distinct temporal dynamic parameters uniquely predict risk for anxiety versus depression. Over 10 days, 105 individuals rated their current positive and negative affective state several times each day. Using two distinct approaches to statistically assess mean and instability of positive and negative affect, we found that individual differences in trait anxiety was generally associated with increased instability of positive and negative affect whereas mean levels of positive and negative affect were generally associated with individual differences in depression. These data provide evidence that the emotional dysregulation underlying risk for mood versus anxiety disorders unfolds in distinct ways and highlights the utility in examining affective dynamics to understand psychopathology.

Multivariate analyses, including structural equation modeling and complex systems analysis, evaluated how personality influenced risk and resilience for anxiety and/or depression. The three groups with anxiety and/or depression were strongly distinguished by temperament and character: (i) In AD (n = 58), Harm Avoidance and Reward Dependence were higher than in DD, and Self-directedness was higher than in AD+DD; (ii) In DD (n = 90), Persistence, Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness were higher than in AD+DD; and (iii) In AD+DD (n = 101), Harm Avoidance was highest and Persistence and Self-directedness were lowest (i.e., they were lowest in Resilience). Structural equation models confirmed these risk relations with strong character development reducing the adverse effects of emotional hyperreactivity from extreme temperaments.

The present study, therefore, aimed at investigating the possible existence of spontaneous atypical/abnormal behaviours displayed by 40 cynomolgus macaques in captive conditions using an unbiased ethological scan-sampling analysis followed by multifactorial correspondence analysis and a hierarchical clustering. The study identified five distinct profiles (groups A to E) that significantly differed on several behaviours, body postures, body orientations, gaze directions and locations in the cage environment. We suggest that animals from the low n groups (D and E) present depressive-like and anxious-like symptoms, reminiscent of depressive and generalized anxiety disorders. Inter-individual differences were highlighted through unbiased ethological observations of spontaneous behaviours and associated parameters, although these were not associated with differences in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid levels of either stress-related hormones or monoamines, i.e. in accordance with the human situation. No interventional behavioural testing was required to discriminate between 3 typical and 2 atypical ethologically-defined behavioural profiles, reminiscent of certain depressive-like and anxiety-like symptoms.

The present study extended this line of research by investigating posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression in a sample of caregivers (N = 96) of children who experienced sexual abuse recruited from a child advocacy center as well as parenting practices reported by both caregivers and their children (mean age = 10.79 years, SD = 3.29; 79% female). Twenty-four percent of caregivers met criteria for presumptive clinical depression, clinically significant posttraumatic stress, or both. Results indicated elevated caregiver-reported inconsistent parenting in the context of clinically significant distress across symptom groups; children reported particularly elevated inconsistent parenting for caregivers with posttraumatic stress only. Caregiver depression was associated with low self-reported positive parenting and caregiver involvement in addition to self-reported inconsistencies. Directions for future research are offered to further elucidate the relationships between caregiver mental health and parenting practices following childhood sexual abuse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26808966/"}

This paper reviews recently published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of universal and targeted interventions to reduce depression in the workplace. Studies were identified through searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES Full Text, and Global Health and Social Policy and Practice databases. Studies were included if they included an RCT of a workplace intervention for employees targeting depression as the primary outcome. Twenty-two published RCTs investigating interventions utilising various therapeutic approaches were identified. The cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach is the most frequently used in the workplace, while interventions that combine different therapeutic approaches showed the most promising results. A universal intervention in the workplace that combines CBT and coping flexibility recorded the highest effect size (d=1.45 at 4 months' follow-up). Most interventions were delivered in group format and showed low attrition rates compared with other delivery formats. Although all studies reviewed were RCTs, the quality of reporting is low. Interventions using different therapeutic approaches with different modes of delivery have been used. Most of these interventions were shown to reduce depression levels among employees in the workplace, particularly those that combine more than one therapeutic approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29074553/"}

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic situation during and post pregnancy was addressed on three main factors; maternal mental health, mother-child bonding, and maternal self-confidence. To do this, two different patient cohorts were compared; data from one cohort was collected pre-pandemic, and data was collected from the other cohort at the beginning of the pandemic. Questionnaires were used to collect data regarding depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), maternal self-confidence (Lips Maternal Self-Confidence Scale [LMSCS]) and mother-child bonding (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire [PBQ]). There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms (EPDS with an average median of 4.00-5.00) or anxiety (STAI with an average median of 29.00-33.00) between the cohorts. However, the quality of postpartum maternal bonding was higher at 3-6 months in the pandemic cohort, which was also influenced by education and the mode and number of births. The maternal self-confidence was lower in the pandemic sample, also depending on the mode of birth delivery. In this study, a differential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mother-child bonding and maternal self-confidence was observed.

The current study aims to predict the symptoms of insomnia by investigating some of its predictors. Numerous variables such as depression and anxiety symptoms, worry, pre-sleep arousal (cognitive arousal and somatic arousal), dysfunctional cognitions, and metacognitive beliefs about sleep were assessed as insomnia predictors. A total of 400 students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-10), the Metacognitions Questionnaire-Insomnia (MCQ-I), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). All variables were significantly correlated with insomnia symptoms (P < .001). Stepwise multiple regression analysis suggested a predictive model for insomnia including cognitive arousal, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, metacognitive beliefs about sleep, and depressive symptoms. The findings underline the significant role of cognitive and metacognitive variables for predicting insomnia symptoms. Moreover, the results suggest that metacognitive beliefs about sleep may need to be considered as a significant component in the context of insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25037666/"}

Additionally, compared with non-anxious depression, anxious depression presents abnormal hemodynamic activation in the DLPFC. This study aimed to use fNIRS to investigate hemodynamic activation in the DLPFC of depression patients with and without anxiety during AMT triggered by different emotional valence stimuli. We recruited 194 patients with depression (91 with non-anxious depression, 103 with anxious depression) and 110 healthy controls from Chinese college students. A 53-channel fNIRS was used to detect cerebral hemodynamic differences in the three groups during AMT. The results showed that: (1) the activation of oxy-Hb in the left DLPFC was significantly higher under positive emotional valence than under negative emotional valence for healthy controls and patients with non-anxious depression, while there was no significant difference between positive and negative emotional valence observed in response to anxious depression; and (2) Oxy-Hb activation under negative emotional valence was significantly higher in the anxious depression group than in the non-anxious depression group. This study revealed that the hemodynamic hyperactivation of negative emotional valence in the left DLPFC may be due to the neurophysiological differences between anxious and non-anxious patients with depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39019227/"}

The present study aims to describe the mental health and quality of life of these individuals. Data, based on 510 individuals, were obtained by means of a questionnaire at open screenings conducted at or nearby refugee housing facilities. Of the participating refugees, 367 were asylum seekers and 143 had received a residence permit but were still awaiting a more permanent housing solution. The questionnaire included measures of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7), risk of having post-traumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). Of the total sample, 56-58.4% reported clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and risk of having PTSD. Prevalence estimates were higher among asylum seekers than among those who had received their residence permit. Quality of life was generally rated below population norms and correlated negatively with mental health outcomes. Individuals residing in refugee housing facilities show high levels of psychological distress and rate their quality of life as low. Asylum seekers score higher than those having received a residence permit. These results are troublesome since the wait time for asylum decisions has lengthened considerably after 2015.

But to gain insight into within-patient therapeutic changes, a within-individual design is required. The present study contrasts previous findings based on theory-driven between-patient moderators with data-driven moderators of within-patient processes to investigate whether findings converge or diverge across these two approaches. We used data of 118 patients from the pilot and active phases of a recent RCT for patients with major depressive disorder, comparing ST with SET, a time-limited psychodynamic therapy. The predefined primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Supportive versus expressive techniques were rated based on patients' end-of-session perspective. We compared previous findings based on moderators of between-patient effects with a data-driven approach for identifying moderators of within-patient effects of techniques on subsequent outcome. After false discovery rate corrections, of 10 preselected moderators, patients' attachment anxiety and domineering style remained significant. Of these, bootstrap resampling revealed significant differences between ST and SET techniques for the attachment anxiety moderator: Those with higher attachment anxiety benefited more from greater use of ST than SET techniques in a particular session, as evidenced by lower levels of symptoms at the subsequent session. Our within-individual findings diverge from previously published between-individual analyses. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the importance of complementing between-individuals with within-individual analyses to achieve better understanding of who benefits most from specific treatment techniques.

However, previous studies did not focus on the sleep quality and mood of humans. This study determines whether PS128 reduces the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, regulates autonomic nervous system function, and improves sleep quality. Forty participants between 20 and 40 years of age with self-reported insomnia were randomly assigned to two groups, a PS128 group and a placebo group, in a double-blind trial. Participants took two capsules of either PS128 or a placebo after dinner for 30 days. Study measures included subjective depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep questionnaires, and miniature-polysomnography recordings at baseline and on the 15th and 30th days of taking capsules. Overall, all outcomes were comparable between the two groups at baseline and within the 30-day period, yet some differences were still found. Compared to the control group, the PS128 group showed significant decreases in Beck Depression Inventory-II scores, fatigue levels, brainwave activity, and awakenings during the deep sleep stage. Their improved depressive symptoms were related to changes in brain waves and sleep maintenance. These findings suggest that daily administration of PS128 may lead to a decrease in depressive symptoms, fatigue level, cortical excitation, and an improvement in sleep quality during the deep sleep stage. Daily consumption of PS128 as a dietary supplement may improve the depressive symptoms and sleep quality of insomniacs, although further investigation is warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444980/"}

Three studies therefore investigated 3 broad facets of negative self-processing associated with either elevated symptoms of, or diagnosis of, CG--namely, self-related attributions or blame, self-devaluation, and cognitions about the future self. These self-processing domains were assessed using a variety of self-report and scenario-based measures either linked specifically to the bereavement or more general in their focus. Study 1 used a correlational design in a community bereaved sample. Study 2 employed an extreme-groups approach looking at individuals high versus low in CG symptoms, and Study 3 compared those with a CG diagnosis to healthy bereaved controls. The data revealed a profile of processing in CG characterized by significant relationships between CG symptoms or diagnosis and both self-devaluation and negative self-related cognitions about the future, but the data provided no support for a similar relationship with negative self-related attributions. These findings extend our understanding of self-related cognitive processing in CG. They also suggest that CG is characterized by a cognitive-affective processing profile that is distinct from that associated with other disorders, notably major depression, in the literature. This has potential implications for the psychological treatment of CG and for its nosological status as a post-loss syndrome distinct from depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22329823/"}

Structural equation modeling of associations of risk factors with the anxiety outcome using a cross-sectional data set of 342 patients with PD were used. A model with acceptable to good fit was generated that explained 65% of the variance in anxiety scores. A previous history of depression and the severity of the depressive symptoms scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were the only nonspecific variables with a direct effect on anxiety. The presence of motor fluctuations and disease-related decline in activities of daily living were PD-specific markers of anxiety. Nonspecific risk factors had a greater influence in the model than PD-specific risk factors. Standardized regression coefficients suggested that the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was the most important contributor to the variation in anxiety. A post-hoc analysis showed that the effects of the following variables on anxiety levels were fully mediated by depression: sex; family history of depression; previous history of anxiety; cognitive status; difficulties in non-disease-specific activities of daily living; and severity of motor signs. In this cross-sectional study, we showed that nonspecific general population risk factors are more important markers for anxiety than PD-specific risk factors. Depression was the most prominent marker. PD-specific markers for anxiety appear to be more situational and related to off periods and disease-specific disturbances of activities of daily living.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26685935/"}

The aim of this study was to examine whether hazardous drinking, measured by Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), influences the outcomes of repeated assessments of psychological functioning (Outcome Questionnaire-45), stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and sleep (Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire), during and after treatment in patients with mental ill health. The study was conducted within REGASSA, a randomised controlled trial aimed at comparing Internet-based cognitive-behaviour therapy and physical exercise with treatment as usual on primary care patients with mental ill health. The study involved 871 participants who completed the AUDIT at baseline and who were assessed repeatedly during and after treatment on psychological functioning, stress and sleep by interactive voice response, a computerised, automated telephone technology. At baseline, hazardous drinkers were more depressed and had lower scores on psychological functioning than non-hazardous drinkers, while there were no differences on stress and sleep. During the follow-ups, hazardous drinking negatively influenced perceived stress, that is, hazardous drinkers seemed to have less treatment effect on stress, and the results remained after controlling for depression. There were no differences during the follow-ups regarding psychological functioning and sleep. Hazardous drinking negatively influenced perceived stress. The findings of the study emphasise the importance of screening for alcohol habits in mental ill-health patients, since risky drinking may affect the outcomes of treatment.

Self-reported height and weight were used to classify participants as underweight (body mass index of less than 18.5), acceptable weight (18.5 to less than 25), overweight (25 to less than 30) or obese (30 and over). Obesity in women was associated with more anxiety and depression symptoms and less positive affect, but there were only weak and inconsistent associations in men. When factors that might mediate any association were controlled (physical ill health, lack of physical activity, poorer social support, less education and financial problems), a different picture emerged, with the underweight women having more depression and negative affect and the obese and overweight women tending to have better mental health than the acceptable weight group. Controlling for physical ill health alone accounted for the association of obesity with anxiety and depression in women. Obesity has an association with anxiety, depression and lower well-being in women, but not in men. The results are consistent with physical ill health playing a mediating role.

The questionnaire included items assessing physical activity, sport participation and validated instruments assessing well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms (BDI-II) and anxiety (SAS). Multi-level mixed effects linear regression was used to examine associations between physical activity/sport participation and mental health measures. A minority of the sample (17.9 % of boys and 10.7 % of girls; p < 0.0005) reported sufficient activity based on WHO guidelines (60 min + daily). The mean number of days of at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity in the past 2 weeks was 7.5 ± 4.4 among boys and 5.9 days ± 4.3 among girls. Frequency of activity was positively correlated with well-being and negatively correlated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms, up to a threshold of moderate frequency of activity. In a multi-level mixed effects model more frequent physical activity and participation in sport were both found to independently contribute to greater well-being and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in both sexes. Increasing activity levels and sports participation among the least active young people should be a target of community and school-based interventions to promote well-being.

Access to psychological treatments remains limited for most perinatal women suffering from depression and anxiety. Some barriers to effective care can be addressed through task-sharing to non-specialist providers and through telemedicine platforms. The cost-effectiveness of these strategies compared to traditional specialist and in-person models remains unknown. This protocol describes an economic evaluation of non-specialist providers and telemedicine, in comparison to specialist providers and in-person sessions within the ongoing Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) trial. The economic evaluation will be undertaken alongside the SUMMIT trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, randomized, non-inferiority trial across five North American study sites (N = 1,226) of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a behavioural activation treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis. The outcome will be the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which will be expressed as the additional cost required to achieve an additional quality-adjusted life-year, as assessed by the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level instrument. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis will use participants' depressive symptom scores. A micro-costing analysis will be conducted to estimate the resources/costs required to implement and sustain the interventions; healthcare resource utilization will be captured via self-report. Data will be pooled and analysed using uniform price and utility weights to determine cost-utility across all trial sites. Secondary country-specific cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses will also be completed. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted, and cost-effectiveness acceptability-curves will be generated, in all instances. Results of this study are expected to inform key decisions related to dissemination and scale up of evidence-based psychological interventions in Canada, the US, and possibly worldwide.

Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and pain was assessed with a numeric rating scale. Of the 100 patients, 31 % reported clinically meaningful anxiety, 13 % depression, and 45 % reported the presence of pain. Younger patients (p = 0.02) and those with higher anxiety scores (p = 0.02) reported worse disease-specific QOL. Patients with lower physical function (p = 0.04) and those with higher depression scores (p < 0.001) reported worse generic QOL. Age, comorbidity, physical function, anxiety, depression, and pain explained 19.2 and 49.6 % of the variance in disease-specific and generic QOL scores, respectively. Findings from this study suggest that the relationships between patient characteristics and common symptoms and QOL differ when disease-specific and generic measures of QOL are evaluated. Additional research is warranted to confirm these findings in COPD patients. Clinicians need to evaluate these common symptoms when planning and implementing symptoms management interventions to improve COPD patients' QOL.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23999743/"}

We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension.

Research on the potential prospective impact of maltreatment reduction on the incidence of psychiatric disorders is scarce. Electronic databases and grey literature from 1990 to 2014 were searched for English-language cohort studies with criteria for depression and/or anxiety and non-recall measurement of childhood maltreatment. Systematic review with meta-analysis synthesized the results. Study quality, heterogeneity, and publication bias were examined. Initial screening of titles and abstracts resulted in 199 papers being reviewed. Eight high-quality articles met eligibility criteria. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) estimated potential preventive impact. The pooled odds ratio (OR) between any type of maltreatment and depression was 2.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.01] and 2.70 (95% CI 2.10-3.47) for anxiety. For specific types of maltreatment and depression or anxiety disorders, the ORs were: physical abuse (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.25-3.19), sexual abuse (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.88-3.75), and neglect (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.35-2.23). PAFs suggest that over one-half of global depression and anxiety cases are potentially attributable to self-reported childhood maltreatment. A 10-25% reduction in maltreatment could potentially prevent 31.4-80.3 million depression and anxiety cases worldwide. This review provides robust evidence of childhood maltreatment increasing the risk for depression and anxiety, and reinforces the need for effective programs and policies to reduce its occurrence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26708271/"}

On January 16, 2023, we searched 10 databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, CRD Database, Embase, Epistemonikos, International HTA Database, KSR Evidence, Ovid MEDLINE, PROSPERO and PsycINFO); the references of included studies were also screened. We included studies of any design that compared case-identification with a relevant screening tool to the outcome of a diagnostic interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth or fifth edition (DSM-IV or DSM-5), or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). Diagnoses of interest were major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full-texts for relevance and evaluated the risk of bias using QUADAS-2.

There was no evidence for associations between other depression characteristics and all-cause mortality. The small proportion of deceased subjects impeded statistical analyses of cause-specific mortality.

The present study aimed to investigate three aspects: (1) the validation of the ASQ within a clinical sample, (2) the examination of possible differences in affective styles between patients suffering from affective versus anxiety disorders, and (3) the association of affective styles and anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. Overall 917 patients receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy at an outpatient clinic participated in this study, 550 participants were female.

The results of the regression analyses showed that the ASQ adjusting and concealing behavior seem to play a more important role than the ERQ reappraisal and suppression for depression, anxiety, and stress among clinical populations. A number of limitations must be taken into consideration while evaluating the present study. First and foremost, the clinical data were based on primary diagnoses. We did not ascertain comorbid diagnoses. This distinction may be important, since affective and anxiety disorders are often linked to each other. In addition, we only used data collected before the beginning of psychotherapeutic treatment and were therefore not able to analyze changes in affective styles during and after intervention. Furthermore, all data were based on self-reported information of patients. We did not implement either a therapeutic rating of affective styles or physiological measures, for instance arousal, which could have shown whether the used strategies successfully reduce negative emotions. Future research should address this question. Another limitation is the fact that we concentrated on the main categories of mental disorders and, therefore, did not subdivide patients with affective and anxiety disorders in terms of their concrete diagnoses.

Between May and September 2015, 68 subjects, initially admitted as emergencies for acute anxiety depressive disorders and/or suicide attempts and subsequently monitored as post-emergency outpatients in medico-psychological consultations agreed to complete a set of Visual Analogue Scales measuring their well-being, their mental pain, their estimated number of thoughts and the how agitated these thoughts are estimated to be. A double evaluation of the cognitive activity consisted of representation intrusive thoughts by filling a drawing of an aquarium to reflect the number of thoughts (by drawing fish) and cognitive turmoil (by drawing wavy lines). The depressive illness was evaluated using the Beck depression inventory and by rater-administered assessments using MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale). These measurements are of good psychometric quality (sensitivity, accuracy, validity). The mental pain is related to mental turmoil. These results reveal positive correlations between the mental turmoil and the total score on the depression. The use of the aquarium makes it possible to distinguish the feeling of having \"a lot of thoughts\" from the feeling of having \"agitated thoughts\". So, the total score of wavy lines shows positive correlation with the total score on the depression inventory (BDI) and the total MADRS score. The results suggest that the phenomena of cognitive saturation and the sensation of mental restlessness play a major role in the etiopathogensis of depression. The analyses show that the cognitive dysregulation is situated more precisely at the level of the flow of thought rather than the level of the number of thoughts. A deterioration in the flow of thought increases the mental pain and the depressive symptoms, and reduces well-being.

In this multisite clinical trial, 468 older adults aged 60 years or older with MDD received open-label protocolized treatment with venlafaxine extended release (ER) titrated to a maximum of 300 mg daily. At baseline, anxiety was assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) anxiety subscale, and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. To measure treatment response, depressive symptoms and suicidality were assessed every 1-2 weeks with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the 19-item Scale for Suicide Ideation; anxiety was assessed with the BSI. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to evaluate whether anxiety symptoms predicted depression remission. We also examined the relationships between anxiety scores and suicidality at baseline. Baseline anxiety symptoms did not predict remission or time to remission of depressive symptoms. Depressive, worry, and panic symptoms decreased in parallel in patients with high anxiety. Anxiety symptoms were associated with the severity of depression and with suicidality. In older adults with MDD, comorbid anxiety symptoms are associated with symptom severity but do not affect antidepressant remission or time to remission.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31682328/"}

Much of the literature is drawn from studies that utilise cross-sectional designs, whilst the long-term follow-up of participants is limited. We examine the short and long-term risks of job strain for depression and wellbeing over a 12-year period. In particular, we utilise measures of wellbeing to emphasise the importance of discriminating between indices of subjective and psychological wellbeing that complement measures of mental health. Participants (n = 2530) were aged between 40 and 44 years at baseline and were drawn from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through Life Project. Participants were observed once every 4 years for 12 years. A high strain job was associated with an increased risk of reporting sub-syndromal [RRR = 1.66 (95 % CI 1.23; 2.25), p < 0.001], minor [RRR = 1.92 (95 % CI 1.19; 3.10), p < 0.001] and major depression [RRR = 2.19 (95 % CI 1.30; 3.67), p < 0.001], but strain was not a long-term risk for depression 4 years later. In contrast, strain was a risk for both cross-sectional and longitudinal wellbeing outcomes. Moving into a high strain job was a risk for developing depression [RRR = 1.81 (95 % CI 1.26; 2.59), p < 0.001], but the cumulative exposure to a high strain job was not associated with poorer outcomes in adjusted models. Overall, our results emphasise the importance of current job strain, and the risk of moving into a high strain job, on adverse mental health and wellbeing outcomes.

A cross-sectional, correlational design was used. All eligible adult ICD-recipients in the Swedish ICD- and Pacemaker Registry were invited to participate. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and QoL with the EuroQol-5D. A total of 3067 ICD-recipients (66±11years, 80% male) were included. The mean HADS score was 3.84±3.70 for anxiety symptoms and 2.99±3.01 for symptoms of depression. The mean EQ-5D index score was 0.82±0.21. The probability of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with younger age, living alone, and a previous history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. Additionally, female ICD-recipients had a higher probability of symptoms of anxiety. A higher level of ICD-related concerns was most prominently related to symptoms of anxiety, depressive symptoms and poorer QoL, while number of shocks, ICD-indication and time since implantation were not independently related. In this large cohort of ICD-recipients, the association of ICD-related concerns with symptoms of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and poor QoL suggests that ICD specific factors should be addressed in order to improve outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25077853/"}

Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) has established a mental health centre in a mixed urban-refugee population in Beirut to respond to the significant burden of mental health problems. Patients received comprehensive care through a multidisciplinary team. A cohort of people with common and severe mental disorders has been analysed between December 2008 and June 2011 to evaluate individual outcomes of treatment in terms of functionality. All patients diagnosed with mental disorders were included in the study. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 items (SRQ 20) were used as tools for baseline assessment, monitoring and evaluation of patients. Predictors of evolution of SRQ20 and GAF over visits were explored using a linear mixed model. Up to June 2011, 1144 patients were followed, 63.7% of them Lebanese, 31.8% Palestinians and 1.2% Iraqis. Females represented 64.2% of the patient population. Mean age was 39.2 years (28.5-46.5). The most frequent primary diagnoses were depressive disorders (28.8%), anxiety disorders (15.6%) and psychosis (11.5%). A lower baseline SRQ20 score/higher baseline GAF score (indicators of severity), being diagnosed with anxiety (compared to being diagnosed with depression or psychosis) and a higher level of education were associated with better outcomes. In this MSF program, we observed a significant decrease of SRQ20 individual scores and a significant increase of individual GAF scores. This corresponded to an improvement in the functionality of our patients. Analysis of the predictors of this positive evolution indicates that we need to adapt our model for the more severe and less educated patients. It also makes us reflect on the length of the individual follow-up. Further research could include a qualitative evaluation of the intervention.

One hundred and ten youth aged 18-22 were recruited via child protection reception centres. We administered the Patient Health Questionnaire somatic (PHQ-15), anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) modules, the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). Logistic regression analysis was performed with the dependent variable, a secure (versus uncertain) situation, defined as (1) detaining a residence permit and being in school, an apprenticeship or a salaried job, or (2) waiting for residence permit whilst occupying a salaried job. Of the sample, 19.3% reached criteria for a probable somatic disorder, 17.6% for anxiety and 28.7% for depression (score  ≥ 10); 41.8% were in an uncertain situation regarding their right-to-stay.

Computerized CBT (CCBT) can be used to effectively treat depression and anxiety and may be particularly useful in rural settings where there are a lack of suitably trained practitioners. To systematically review the global evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of CCBT interventions for anxiety and/or depression for people living in rural and remote locations. We searched seven online databases: Medline, Embase Classic and Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. We also hand searched reference lists, Internet search engines, and trial protocols. Two stages of selection were undertaken. In the first, the three authors screened citations. Studies were retained if they reported the efficacy, effectiveness or acceptability of CCBT for depression and/or anxiety disorders, were peer reviewed, and written in English. The qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 10, was then used to run automated text searches for the word \"rural,\" its synonyms, and stemmed words. All studies identified were read in full and were included in the study if they measured or meaningfully discussed the efficacy or acceptability of CCBT among rural participants. A total of 2594 studies were identified, of which 11 met the selection criteria and were included in the review. The studies that disaggregated efficacy data by location of participant reported that CCBT was equally effective for rural and urban participants. Rural location was found to both positively and negatively predict adherence across studies. CCBT may be more acceptable among rural than urban participants—studies to date showed that rural participants were less likely to want more face-to-face contact with a practitioner and found that computerized delivery addressed confidentiality concerns. CCBT can be effective for addressing depression and anxiety and is acceptable among rural participants. Further work is required to confirm these results across a wider range of countries, and to determine the most feasible model of CCBT delivery, in partnership with people who live and work in rural and remote communities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26048193/"}

There were no differences in the dynamics of positive affect (PA) between depressed and healthy subjects. Depressed participants' negative affect (NA), however, was found to be more inert than in healthy controls, while at the same time being more variable and more reactive to positive events. There was also an association between emotional instability and depression, but this was rendered nonsignificant when analyses were controlled for emotional variability. Altogether, emotional dynamics of NA appear to be more prominently disturbed in depression compared to PA.

We designed a mono-institutional prospective study involving all new patients admitted to the Oncology Department of Fatebenefratelli and Ophtalmic Hospital in Milan from January 2005 until September 2008. During the first visit, the oncologist could offer support with a psycho-oncologist. The patients who accepted had a first interview (T0), during which they took a self-evaluation test (HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). On the basis of the score, the psycho-oncologist could offer psychotherapy and/or pharmacological intervention, if necessary. At the end of the eight sessions (T1), the patient repeated the self-evaluation test with the HADS, and we analysed both the difference in the HADS score between T0 and T1 and the clinical evaluation of the psycho-oncologist. Three hundred eighteen patients were evaluated with a psychoanalytical psychotherapy approach by two psycho-oncologists through a first interview and 90 of them were eligible for the present study also for the evaluation of HADS. The average HADS score in T0 was 15.26 for depression (sd=3.21) and 13.86 for anxiety (sd = 2.05). The reassessment at the end of the psychotherapy (T1) showed an average HADS score of 5.94 for depression (sd = 3.11) and 6.58 for anxiety (sd = 2.88). Only five patients were treated with a pharmacological approach alone. Considering all the limits of our study, we may conclude that an early POI significantly reduces patients' psychiatric symptoms and the risk of a negative evolution of pathological situations in those patients who are motivated and express a need for psychological help.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258946/"}

Depression comorbid with anxiety is often treatment-resistant where anxious-depressive attack (ADA) often lurks. ADA is a recently proposed clinical idea for just a psychological version of a panic attack. It mostly begins with an abrupt surge of intense anxiety followed by uninterrupted intrusive thoughts; lasting ruminations about regret or worry produced by violent anxiety, agitation, and loneliness. Acting-out behaviors such as deliberate self-injury and over-dose may also be observed during the attack. As the basic psychopathology of ADA, rejection sensitivity (RS) was revealed by a structural equation model. It is said that the presence of RS in depressive disorders implies a poor prognosis. The following biological markers for RS were reviewed in the literature: first, the involvement of the μ-opioid receptor function in RS and, secondly, hypersensitivity of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) in the medial prefrontal cortex. The latter has been suggested in fear-conditioned animal experiments. Manipulation of the μ-opioid receptor function together with the DRD4 function may culminate in a treatment for RS, which could contribute to the development of a treatment for TRD via the improvement of ADA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38059339/"}

The most common disorder was Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (25.7%), and 33.8% of the adolescents were in the clinical range in at least one internalizing domain. Baseline C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels correlated weakly with MDD scores. Loneliness scores correlated with all internalizing symptoms, strong association with MDD scores. Loneliness, anxiety, and parental anxiety were associated with an increased likelihood of MDD. Baseline CRP positivity did not predict MDD in adolescent COVID-19 survivors.

Six items from the K10 that most closely related to the ICD-10 diagnosis of depression and four that most closely related to a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder were used to create separate scales. The indices were developed by estimating the predicted probabilities of depression and anxiety on these separate K10 scales in the 2007 NSMHWB and then applying these predicted probabilities to the same scales in the other surveys. The 1997 NSMHWB and 2001 NHS were used as benchmarks for the respective surveys, with values greater than or less than 100 on the indices indicating a higher or lower probability of depression and anxiety in the subsequent survey year. Overall mean risks of depression and anxiety were examined along with differences in mean risk by age, household income, employment status and geographic location for males and females. There was an overall increase in the mean risk of anxiety between the 1997 and 2007 NSMHWB but no significant difference in the mean risk of depression. Significant increases in the mean risk of anxiety were observed for women aged 45-64, for employed men and women, and for women living in the inner city and non-regional rural areas. The increase in the mean risk of anxiety may support the need for public education to focus on anxiety disorders, particularly for middle-aged women and for employed men and women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21888611/"}

However, their relevance to experiences of psychosis has rarely been explored. This study aims to examine the relationship of social rank and external shame to personal recovery, depression and positive symptoms in psychosis. A cross sectional correlational design was adopted to examine the relationship between all variables. Fifty-two service users, aged between 18 to 65 years, with experiences of psychosis were recruited for the study. Participants were administered outcome measures examining social rank, external shame, positive symptoms of psychosis, depression and personal recovery. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on the data. Significant correlations were found between all variables. Low social rank was significantly associated with lower reported personal recovery, and higher levels of external shame and depression symptomology. The relationship between external shame and positive symptoms of psychosis and personal recovery was found to be mediated by participants' level of depression. Findings suggest that social rank and external shame are relevant to those who experience psychosis. Therapeutic approaches may need to focus on perceptions of social rank and external shame in working with experiences of psychosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26400370/"}

Theories of loneliness predict the existence of subtypes of loneliness. In this study, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to test for the presence of loneliness subtypes and to examine their association with multiple mental health variables. A nationally representative sample of US adults (N = 1839) completed the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, along with self-report measures of childhood and adulthood trauma, psychological wellbeing, major depression, and generalized anxiety. When treated as a unidimensional construct, 17.1% of US adults aged 18-70 were classified as lonely. However, the LCA results identified four loneliness classes which varied quantitatively and qualitatively: 'low' (52.8%), 'social' (8.2%), 'emotional' (26.6%), and 'social and emotional' (12.4%) loneliness. The 'social and emotional' class were characterised by the highest levels of psychological distress, followed by the 'emotional' class. The 'social' loneliness class had similar mental health scores as the 'low' loneliness class. Childhood and adulthood trauma were independently related to the most distressed loneliness classes. Current findings provide support for the presence of subtypes of loneliness and show that they have unique associations with mental health status. Recognition of these subtypes of loneliness revealed that the number of US adults aged 18-70 experiencing loneliness was twice as high as what was estimated when loneliness was conceptualized as a unidimensional construct. The perceived quality, not the quantity, of interpersonal connections was associated with poor mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30293176/"}

Hence, this study focused on examining this association. Data in this cross-sectional study was derived from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Based on self-reported dietary diversity score (DDS) questions were used to assess DD, ranging from 0 to 8. DDS < 5 was defined as insufficient DD and DDS ≥ 5 was defined as sufficient DD. PA was based on a self-reported binary question. Anxiety was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10). The independent and joint associations of DD and PA on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and their comorbidity were examined by multivariable-adjusted binary logistic regression models. In this cross-sectional study, sufficient DD was independently associated with a decreased risk of anxiety (adjusted OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.50-0.65), depressive symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.63-0.77), and their comorbidity (adjusted OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.49-0.68). Similarly, exposure to current exercise was also a significant protective factor for mental health. Importantly, co-exposure to sufficient DD and current exercise may amplify the protective effects on mental health (adjusted OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.38-0.57 for anxiety; adjusted OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.31-0.42 for depressive symptoms; adjusted OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.29-0.48 for their comorbidity). The robustness of these associations was demonstrated in four sensitivity analyses. Our study found that sufficient DD and current exercise were associated with a decreased risk of mental health disorders. Importantly, the combination of both appeared to enhance this protective effect.

However, common concerns in reviews of the research include lack of detail, rationale and consistency of approach of interventions used. Issues related to heterogeneity include amount, types and delivery of yoga interventions. This study aims to document consensus-based recommendations for consistency of yoga interventions for reducing depression and anxiety. The Delphi method was used to establish consensus from experienced yoga teachers. Thirty-three eligible teachers were invited to participate, from four different countries. Two rounds of an online survey were sent to participants. The first round sought initial views. The second round sought consensus on a summary of those views. Survey questions related to frequency and duration (dosage) of the yoga, approaches and techniques to be included or avoided, and training and experience for yoga teachers. Twenty-four teachers agreed to participate. Eighteen completed the second round (n = 18). General consensus (>75% of participants in agreement) was achieved on parameters of practice (dosage): an average of 30 to 40 minutes, to be done 5 times per week, over a period of 6 weeks. Numerous recommendations for yoga techniques to include or avoid were collected in the first round. The second round produced a consensus statement on those recommendations. Breath regulation and postures were considered very important or essential for people with depression; and relaxation, breath regulation and meditation being very important or essential for people with anxiety. Other recommended components also achieved consensus. There was also general consensus that it is very important or essential for teachers to have a minimum of 500 training hours over 2 years, at least 2 years teaching experience, training in developing personalised yoga practices, training in yoga for mental health, and professional supervision or mentoring. The Delphi process has achieved a consensus statement on the application of yoga for reducing anxiety and depression. This consensus provides a checklist for identification of commonalities and evaluation of past research. Future research can proceed to develop and evaluate consensus-based yoga intervention protocols for the reduction of anxiety and depression, and improvements in well-being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25888411/"}

Methods This multi-centre cohort study included six obstetrics and gynaecology departments in Sweden. Posttraumatic stress (PTSD/PTSS) was assessed using the Screen Questionnaire-Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; anxiety and depressive symptoms, using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale; and abortion quality perceptions, using a modified version of the Quality from the Patient's Perspective questionnaire. Pain during medical abortion was assessed in a subsample using a visual analogue scale. Results Overall, 16% of the participants assessed the abortion care as being deficient, and 22% experienced intense pain during medical abortion. Women with PTSD/PTSS more often perceived the abortion care as deficient overall and differed from healthy women in reports of deficiencies in support, respectful treatment, opportunities for privacy and rest, and availability of support from a significant person during the procedure. There was a marginally significant difference between PTSD/PTSS and the comparison group for insufficient pain alleviation. Conclusions Women with PTSD/PTSS perceived abortion care to be deficient more often than did healthy women. These women do require extra support, relatively simple efforts to provide adequate pain alleviation, support and privacy during abortion may improve abortion care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25666812/"}

Exposure to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety was associated with the risk of conduct disorder among offspring. Male offspring exposed to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety had higher odds of conduct disorder than did males with low exposure levels. Females exposed to medium or high pre- and postnatal anxiety were less likely to meet conduct disorder criteria than were females with lower exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of pre- and postnatal anxiety trajectories on the risk of conduct disorder in offspring.

We examined a theoretically- and empirically-based model of variables associated with these symptom types in a diverse community sample of 796 4-year-olds (391 boys, 405 girls) that included factors from the following domains: contextual (SES, stress and family conflict); parent characteristics (parental depression); parenting (support/engagement, hostility and scaffolding); and child characteristics including negative affect (NA) effortful control (EC) sensory regulation (SR), inhibitory control (IC) and attachment. We also compared the models to determine which variables contribute to a common correlates of symptoms of anxiety or depression, and which correlates differentiate between those symptom types. In the best-fitting model for these symptom types (a) SES, stress and conflict had indirect effects on both symptom types via long-chain paths; (b) caregiver depression had direct effects and indirect ones (mediated through parenting and child effortful control) on both symptom types; (c) parenting had direct and indirect effects (via temperament and SR); and temperament had direct effects on both symptom types.

They are highly prevalent following a range of traumatic events, and across a range of disorders. The prevalence of intrusion symptoms in the absence of PTSD suggests their relevance to the development of other psychopathology. Therefore, the predictive role of intrusion symptoms for other post-trauma psychopathology was examined using data from an epidemiological, longitudinal sample of adults recruited in childhood. From 5 phases of data collection for this sample, these analyses focused on the 20 year and 28 year follow-ups (n=583). Lifetime exposure to trauma was assessed using a modified set of 10 Criterion-A events from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), with PTSD assessed in reference to a self-nominated worst lifetime event, and other DSM-IV disorder also assessed using the CIDI. Results showed that the presence of intrusion symptoms without PTSD at the 20 year follow-up was predictive of increased risk at 28 years for depressive but not anxiety disorders. There was limited psychopathology in the sample, reducing the power to examine many individual disorders. Furthermore, trauma history and psychiatric symptoms were retrospectively reported, introducing the possibility of recall bias. Together the findings suggest that intrusion symptoms may play an aetiological role in the development and/or maintenance of disorders other than PTSD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26540082/"}

In parallel, the role of mental health professionals has evolved these last years: from a strictly clinical role, to the preoccupation with the rehabilitation of social competencies such as enhancing patients' abilities to return to work. The aim of this paper is to explore, specifically for patients hospitalized for a common mental health disorder, the predictive variables of returning to work within 6 months after hospitalization (RTW6). Our sample was extracted from routinely collected data during the patients' hospital stay (10 days) at the Psychosomatic Rehabilitation Day Centre of CHU Godinne. A sample of 134 patients participated in our study. Those patients were contacted 6 months after their hospitalization to assess resumption of work. We found that a patient's sociodemographicand socioeconomic variables, and depressive symptoms at the beginning of hospitalization were not predictive of return to work within 6 months (RTW6). On the other hand, duration of absence from work before hospitalization and the diagnosis of a major depression in particular were negatively associated with RTW6, whereas improvement of depressive symptoms during hospitalization stay was positively associated to RTW6. Our study identified the diagnosis of major depression and the duration of absence from work before hospitalization as two important risk factors impeding a fast return to work for patients hospitalised for a common mental health disorder. As the preoccupation with patients' abilities to return to work is now on the agenda of mental health professionals, special support and supervision should be dedicated to the more vulnerable patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28953774/"}

The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between history of anxiety and depressive disorders and COVID-19 outcome, hospitalization and severity of anxiety and depression, and whether such relationships are explicable by direct impact of the disease. We conducted a questionnaire survey among 98 inpatients in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Clinics of Samara State Medical University. The self-report questionnaire consisted of 120 items, including socio-demographic characteristics of participants, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, with items reflecting subjective feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic. We used one-factor analysis of variance to compare between groups for those indicators that conformed to a normal distribution, and the chi-square test (χ<sup>2</sup>) or Fisher's exact test to analyze group differences in the distribution of categorical variables was used. The mean (SD) total score on the STAI anxiety scale among hospitalized patients (51 (10.1)) significantly exceeded that of the COMET-G control group (44.9 (11.7) (H=22.8, p<0.001). There was a similar difference in the severity of depression as measured by the CES-D scale (23.4 (12.6) versus 18.0 (11.8), H=15.2 and p<0.001). In contrast to the general population, there were no statistically significant differences in anxiety and depression severity in the matched samples 52 subjects fulfilling the criteria of age, gender, and general perception of health condition. Anxiety and depression scores among ICU (red zone) inpatients significantly exceeded the scores observed in the COMET-G general population group. Our study did not confirm expected relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression (based on questionnaire response) and the risk of severe course of COVID-19 (e.g. hospitalization) in matched samples, but proved that the factor of self-awareness of health state may be related to the COVID-19 course severity. Future research would benefit from clinical interview of inpatients and follow-up monitoring of affective disorders to specify whether anxiety and particular type of depression (e.g., anxious) are selectively related to the severity of COVID-19 course and risks of affective disorders persistence after somatic recovery. The accumulation of mental disorders with age, and the bidirectional association of mood disorders and infectious diseases should be considered when assessing the risk factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39378459/"}

Understanding of the relationships among PTSS, anxiety, depression, and illness intrusiveness will guide the development of efficient approaches to enhance subjective well-being in patients with psychological trauma. This study investigated whether anxiety and depression mediate the relationship between PTSS and illness intrusiveness in the hope of providing more comprehensive and effective trauma treatment. Psychiatric outpatients who visited the trauma clinic of a university hospital (n = 260) participated in this study. Assessments were conducted for PTSS, anxiety, depression, and illness intrusiveness. Structural equation modeling and path analysis were performed to analyze the mediating effects of anxiety and depression on the relationship between PTSS and illness intrusiveness. PTSS had both direct and indirect exacerbating effects on illness intrusiveness. Anxiety exhibited the largest direct exacerbating effect on illness intrusiveness. The indirect effects of PTSS on illness intrusiveness through anxiety alone and through a depression-to-anxiety pathway were significant, but the indirect effect through depression alone was not. The findings demonstrate that anxiety, both independently and as part of an interrelated pathway with depression, partially mediates the relationship between PTSS and illness intrusiveness. Appropriate interventions and a comprehensive approach to alleviate anxiety and depression could mitigate the negative effects of PTSS on illness intrusiveness in patients with psychological trauma.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30402049/"}

Participants were also asked if they thought they needed help for depression, anxiety, or stress at the two time points. Obstetrical providers were blind to screening results. Two months postdelivery, each woman's obstetrical electronic medical record (EMR) was reviewed for documentation of psychiatric symptoms, diagnoses, psychiatric treatment, and mental health referrals at the two time points.

Twenty-three percent of participants screened positive for an anxiety disorder or high levels of depressive symptoms or both prenatally, and 17% screened positive at 6 weeks postpartum. The majority of women who screened positive were not identified by their providers during pregnancy or postpartum. Only 15% of positively screened participants had evidence of any mental health treatment in their EMR during pregnancy, with equally low rates of referral to mental health or social services.

We prospectively examined the association between patterns of moderate alcohol consumption, depression and psychological distress, using information from 5,299 community-dwelling older adults from the ELSA and Seniors-ENRICA cohorts. A Mediterranean drinking pattern (MDP) was defined as moderate alcohol intake (<40 g/day for men; <24 g/day for women) with a preference for wine and drinking only with meals. Depression was ascertained with the 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-10), a self-report of clinically-diagnosed depression, or being on anti-depressant medication (Seniors-ENRICA); and with the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (ELSA). Psychological distress was assessed with the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Compared to never drinkers, moderate drinkers showed comparable scores on the ENRICA-GDS-10 (PRR (95%CI): 1.03 (0.84-1.26)), the ENRICA-GHQ-12 (0.88 (0.73-1.06)), the ELSA-CES-D (0.92 (0.79-1.06)) and the ELSA-GHQ-12 (0.75 (0.55-1.01). The MDP was not associated with the GDS-10 or GHQ-12 scores, or with clinically-diagnosed depression; however drinkers with a preference for wine showed an increased number of psychological distress symptoms (1.31 (1.03-1.66)).

Data (no. of observations = 6,994, 65% female) were obtained from the longitudinal Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, with repeated waves of data collection of HR, HRV, depression, anxiety, and antidepressant use. Summary statistics from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies were used to derive polygenic risk scores of depression, HR, and HRV. Across the 9-year FU, generalized estimating equations analyses showed that the relationship between cardiac autonomic dysregulation and depression/anxiety rendered nonsignificant after adjusting for antidepressant use. A robust association was found between antidepressant use (especially tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin, and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) and unfavorable cardiac autonomic activity across all waves. However, no evidence was found for a genetic correlation of depression with HR and HRV, indicating that confounding by genetic pleiotropy is minimal. Our results indicate that the association between depression/anxiety and cardiac autonomic dysregulation does not result from a causal pathway or genetic pleiotropy, and these traits might therefore not be inevitably linked.

In this review, we aim to assess recent advances in understanding depression and its regulation, as well as its interaction with circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are internalized representations of the periodic daily light and dark cycles. Accumulating evidence has shown that MDD and the related mental disorders are associated with disrupted circadian rhythms. In particular, depression has often been linked to abnormalities in circadian rhythms because dysregulation of the circadian system increases susceptibility to MDD. The fact that several rhythms are disrupted in depressed patients suggests that these disruptions are not restricted to any one rhythm but rather involve the molecular circadian clock core machinery. The sleep-wake cycle is one rhythm that is often disrupted in depression, which often leads to disturbances in other rhythms. The circadian disruptions manifested in depressed patients and the effectiveness and fast action of chronobiologically based treatments highlight the circadian system as a key therapeutic target in the treatment of depression. This review assesses the evidence on rising depression rates and examines their contributing factors, including circadian misalignment.

The present study determined prevalence of anxiety and depression (separated for presence of symptoms versus clinical levels) in a large, representative sample of cancer patients after diagnosis. During the years 2004-2009, 10,153 consecutive patients were routinely screened with the Psychosocial Screen for Cancer questionnaire at two major cancer centers. Patients' mean age was 59 years and 45% were men. Across cancer types, 19.0% of patients showed clinical levels of anxiety and another 22.6% had subclinical symptoms. Further, 12.9% of patients reported clinical symptoms of depression and an additional 16.5% described subclinical symptoms. Analyses by cancer type revealed significant differences such that patients with lung, gynecological, or hematological cancer reported the highest levels of distress at the time point of cancer diagnosis. As expected, women showed higher rates of anxiety and depression, and for some cancer types the prevalence was two to three times higher than that seen for men. In some cancer types emotional distress was inversely related to age. Patients younger than 50 and women across all cancer types revealed either subclinical or clinical levels of anxiety in over 50% of cases. Findings describe levels of emotional distress after diagnosis but cannot inform about trajectories of anxiety and depression over time. Given that levels of anxiety and depression varied widely by cancer type, gender, and age, these results inform which cancer patients are most likely in need of psychosocial support.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22727334/"}

In the general practice, about one third of the patients suffer from anxiety, but it is not easy to identify these patients because of the frequent somatic complaints which may cover anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of anxiety disorders is between 12.6% and 17.2% per year and, in a considerable proportion of patients, both anxiety and depression are present.

Emotion regulation difficulties are a transdiagnostic prevalent across various mood and personality disorders. Dialectical Behavioural Therapy Skills Training (DBT-ST), initially designed as part of treatment for borderline personality disorder, targets emotion regulation and has shown promise in diverse psychiatric conditions. In lower middle-income countries with resource-constrained settings, online delivery of evidence-based interventions holds potential to bridge treatment gaps. This study assesses the feasibility and acceptability of online group DBT skills training for individuals with depression or anxiety disorders in India. Mental health professionals practising in India referred twenty-four eligible participants currently not engaged in psychotherapy. Of these, 18 initiated the 8-week virtual group DBT-ST program, with 12 completing it (66 % female, 18-35 years of age, 5 on concurrent medication). They provided feedback on therapy content's usefulness. Baseline, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up assessments measured changes in emotion regulation difficulties, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Treatment retained 66.7 % of participants, all participants found the intervention beneficial. Repeated measures ANOVA indicates significant reductions in self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation, depression, and anxiety symptoms post-intervention. These findings highlight the promise of transdiagnostic interventions like DBT-ST that merit further evaluations using RCTs with larger sample sizes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38908264/"}

Screening, diagnosis, and treatment for these disorders are inhibited by limited mental health resources for patients and health care providers, lack of provider training, and time constraints. Systematic screening combined with onsite mental health consultation is an evidence-based method to increase timely diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to promote and improve onsite mental health consultations through the implementation of a systematic screening guideline. The systematic screening guidelines included administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at the perinatal intake visit, the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation and again between 2 and 8 weeks postpartum. The guidelines included onsite mental health consultations for eligible women. Screening rates, attended onsite mental health consultations, and health care provider satisfaction and feedback surveys were collected over a 3-month period, before and after guideline implementation. Perinatal mood and anxiety disorder screening rates were significantly increased from 24.9% to 64.2% (P < .001) at the perinatal intake visit and in the third trimester from 0.3% to 32.8% (P < .001) with the implementation of a systematic screening guideline. Onsite mental health consultations significantly increased from 7.2% to 15.2% (P < .001). Perinatal care providers (n = 9, 100%) were satisfied with the screening guideline and reported that it added 5 minutes or less to their office visits. The implementation of a systematic perinatal mood and anxiety disorder screening guideline increased completed screenings in the perinatal period and increased the number of attended onsite mental health consultations. Systematic screening combined with onsite mental health consultation is a successful way to identify at-risk women and offer critical and convenient maternal mental health care without increasing the burden on perinatal care providers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34032002/"}

Thirty-nine articles (representing 31 unique studies/surveys) were identified. Three-quarters of the articles drew upon data from a version of the United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. A range of mental health measures were used, most commonly to measure depression and depressive symptoms, but also anxiety and stress. Most research was cross-sectional and showed associations between depression and food insecurity; longitudinal analyses suggested bidirectional relationships (with food insecurity increasing the risk of depressive symptoms or diagnosis, or depression predicting food insecurity). Several articles focused on vulnerable subgroups, such as pregnant women and mothers, women at risk of homelessness, refugees, and those who had been exposed to violence or substance abuse. Overall, this review supports a link between food insecurity and mental health (and other factors, such as housing circumstances and exposure to violence) among women in high-income countries and underscores the need for comprehensive policies and programs that recognize complex links among public health challenges.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29986420/"}

Parents also reported on past-year treatment or counseling by a mental health professional. State-level differences in condition prevalence were identified using unadjusted and adjusted prevalence estimates. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the odds of not receiving treatment by state and diagnoses.

As point of departure, we used the tripartite model of Clark and Watson that discerns three dimensions: negative affect, positive affect and physiological hyperarousal. Analyses were performed on the data of 1449 patients, who completed the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). From this, 1434 patients were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview. A model with five dimensions was found: depressed mood, lack of positive affect, somatic arousal, phobic fear and hostility. The scales appear capable to differentiate between patients with a mood and with an anxiety disorder. Within the anxiety disorders, somatic arousal was specific for patients with panic disorder. Phobic fear was associated with panic disorder, simple phobia and social anxiety disorder, but not with generalized anxiety disorder. We present a five-factor model as an extension of the tripartite model. Through the addition of phobic fear, anxiety is better represented than in the tripartite model. The new scales are capable to accurately differentiate between depression and anxiety disorders, as well as between several anxiety disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19926260/"}

We evaluated the presence of psychiatric conditions and C-reactive protein (CRP). Findings showed greater severity of depressive symptoms, higher levels of stress, and greater CRP in cases. The severity of depressive and insomnia symptoms, as well as the CRP were more remarkable in individuals with moderate/severe COVID-19. We found a positive correlation between stress and severity of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in individuals with or without COVID-19. There was a positive correlation between CRP levels and severity of depressive symptoms in cases and controls, and a positive correlation between CRP levels and the severity of anxiety symptoms and stress levels only in individuals with COVID-19. Individuals with COVID-19 and depression had greater CRP than those with COVID-19 without current major depressive disorder. We cannot infer causality because this is a cross-sectional study, and the majority of COVID-19 sample was asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, which may limit the generalizability of our findings for moderate/severe cases.

Cross-disciplinary collaborations are essential for identification and evaluation of mental health needs and service delivery. Using a research-practice partnership model, we developed and implemented a routine mental health needs identification and tracking tool at a community-based social services organization.

Patient undergoing elective upper or lower extremity orthopaedic procedures served as controls. Rates of post-injury psychiatric diagnoses were calculated. Univariate logistic regression was conducted after matching in a 1:1 ratio based on relevant comorbidities such as psychiatric history. All significant variables were included in multivariate analysis. A total of 308,578 UEF patients and 360,510 LEF patients were identified. Within the UEF cohort, the diagnosis rates following either isolated or multiple fractures were identified: MDD (25% to 30%), GAD (10% to 11%), and PTSD (4%). LEF cohort rates were as follows: MDD (30% to 38%), GAD (11% to 14%), and PTSD (4% to 7%).

Screening for perinatal depression.", "text": "Perinatal depression, which includes major and minor depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy or in the first 12 months after delivery, is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period, affecting one in seven women. It is important to identify pregnant and postpartum women with depression because untreated perinatal depression and other mood disorders can have devastating effects on women, infants, and families. Several screening instruments have been validated for use during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Although definitive evidence of benefit is limited, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that clinicians screen patients at least once during the perinatal period for depression and anxiety symptoms using a standardized, validated tool. Although screening is important for detecting perinatal depression, screening by itself is insufficient to improve clinical outcomes and must be coupled with appropriate follow-up and treatment when indicated; clinical staff in obstetrics and gynecology practices should be prepared to initiate medical therapy, refer patients to appropriate behavioral health resources when indicated, or both.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25932866/"}

Declared on March 11th, 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic triggered an additional burden on women in the perinatal period. Safety recommendations, such as social distancing and isolation, were opposite to the usual advice given to new mothers. Besides fear, changes in financial stability and daily life reorganization contributed to increased depressive symptoms. As the periods of epidemic waves and lockdowns were associated with a more significant burden for young families, we aimed to assess the intensification of depressive and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic concerning the time intervals of the three lockdowns introduced in Poland. 1588 postpartum women took part in the online self-assessment with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and General Anxiety Disorder 2 (GAD-2) questionnaire between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. This self-screening is a part of a prevention program The Next Stop: Mum, implemented in the North of Poland. The highest severity of PPD symptoms and anxiety were observed during the second lockdown in Poland: the mean score in the EPDS and anxiety assessment was significantly higher than the mean scores from previous pandemic periods. Since the second lockdown, the average EPDS and GAD-2 scores remained similarly high. Moreover, with the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of women with elevated symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety began to increase. However, the Polish National Health Fund data indicate that only 0,7% of women giving birth in the northern macro-region of Poland received diagnosis and help from public funds. In The Next Stop: Mum project, 250 women benefited from psychological consultations. Increased severity of depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic indicates the need for additional psychological support for postpartum women. However, very few women are diagnosed in health facilities in the first year postpartum and thus are rarely referred for further treatment. The study shows that the availability of services and the focus on social and individual barriers may be critical factors in implementing perinatal mental health programs and practices. This may be especially needed in a country where the screening obligation is new. In case of a further pandemic, policymakers and health care professionals should be aware that the duration of the restrictions and the repetition of lockdowns are associated with the aggravation of symptoms. The online screening without the possibility to discuss the results is only partially effective in increasing referrals for possibly affected women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36539811/"}

Existing studies mainly use non-representative samples to address this question. Some scholars argue that Black people who express an African-centered identity should experience improved mental health because it enhances one's sense of self. However, what role self-designation may have on depression, one of the most common forms of disability, is largely unknown among African Americans. There is also limited evidence on whether one's self-concept can help us understand the relationship between self-designation and mental health among African Americans. Using data from a national probability sample of African American adults (<i>n</i> = 3,329), I examined whether self-designation as African American, Afro-American, Negro, Black American, or some other label versus Black was associated with self-esteem, mastery, and major depressive episodes. Using OLS models, I found that respondents who preferred the terms African American or Afro-American exhibited higher mastery levels compared to individuals who preferred the label Black, the most common term used among respondents. African American identifying respondents also exhibited significantly higher levels of self-esteem compared to Black identifying individuals. Using logistic regression models, I found that only African American identifying respondents were significantly less likely than Black identifying respondents to meet the criteria for major depressive episodes in the past-year. Higher levels of mastery and self-esteem helped to explain such differences. In sum, among Americans of African descent, identification as African American rather than Black may help fight depressive episodes because such self-designation may enhance one's self-concept. Further research is necessary to explore other possible psychological implications of self-designation among the African American/Black population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35912817/"}

A total of 24 articles were included in the systematic review, 20 studies were conducted in China. Our results showed that the findings of the α- and β-diversity assessments were inconsistent for both depression and anxiety. In gut microbiota composition, we found that depression and anxiety were characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria and a depletion of anti-inflammatory SCFAs-producing bacteria. Specifically, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Rikenellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae were more abundant in the depression group, as well as Firmicutes, Prevotellacea and Ruminococcaceae in lower abundance. In the anxiety group, the abundance of Firmicutes, Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, and Butyricicoccus was lower, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Enterobacteriaceae, and Fusobacterium was increased.

Bivariate analysis and logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine socio-demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) predictors of indicators of anxiety-related, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD)-related symptoms. Outcomes (anxiety, OCD, and depressive related symptoms) were measured by indices generated based on reported symptoms associated with each psychosocial outcome. Loss of household income was associated with increased risk for all three index-based outcomes: depressive symptoms [aOR = 3.130, 95% CI = (1.41-6.97)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 2.531, 95%CI = (1.154-5.551)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 2.90, 95%CI = (1.32-6.36)].

We performed a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to examine the relationship of PE to depression (59 effect sizes) and anxiety (26 effect sizes). In cross-sectional analyses, PE constructs were negatively associated with depression (r = -.34) and anxiety (r = -.24). PE constructs also prospectively predicted depression (r = -.26) and anxiety (r = -.19). These relationships remained statistically significant, but were markedly attenuated, when baseline levels of depression (β = -.08) and anxiety (β = -.06) were controlled. Moreover, depression and anxiety were equally strong predictors of subsequent changes in PE (β = -.07 and -.09, respectively). These findings are consistent with theoretical accounts of low PE as a temperamental vulnerability for depression, but suggest that the prospective relationship of PE to depression may be weaker and less specific than previously assumed.

Analyses accounted for school clustering, race/ethnicity, sex, age, income, body mass index <i>z</i>-score, and previous year anxiety and depression symptoms. There were significant longitudinal associations between time spent on each type of screen and subsequent anxiety and depression symptoms. The strength of the associations varied by type of screen behaviour. Interaction analysis indicated a sex difference for television viewing and anxiety and depression symptoms, and internet surfing and anxiety symptoms. A dose-response relationship was observed between phone talking and anxiety symptoms. Beta estimates indicated that an increase in screen duration was associated with a further increase in anxiety and depression symptoms. Higher screen time was longitudinally associated with higher anxiety and depression symptoms at one-year follow-up in adolescents. Time-change associations between screen usage and depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed.

The results showed a steep increase in calls with direct or indirect reference to the economic crisis during the first half of 2010 and onwards. The callers who referred to the economic crisis manifested depressive symptomatology of clinical significance to a greater degree than callers who made no such reference. The latter exhibited increased levels of distress and agitation as well as drug/alcohol misuse. Concomitantly, a higher frequency of depressive symptomatology was discerned among the unemployed, whereas employed people were found to experience anxiety symptoms to a higher degree.

The difference in effects between control interventions translates directly to the impact a control group has on the estimated effect of an experimental intervention. We aimed primarily to assess the difference in effects between (i) wait-list versus no-treatment, (ii) usual care versus wait-list or no-treatment, and (iii) placebo interventions (all placebo interventions combined or psychological, pharmacological, and physical placebos individually) versus wait-list or no-treatment. Wait-list patients are offered the experimental intervention by the researchers after the trial has been finalised if it offers more benefits than harms, while no-treatment participants are not offered the experimental intervention by the researchers. In March 2018, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, CENTRAL, and seven other databases and six trials registers. We included randomised trials assessing patients with a mental health disorder that compared wait-list, usual care, or placebo interventions with wait-list or no-treatment . Titles, abstracts, and full texts were reviewed for eligibility. Review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. We contacted researchers working in the field to ask for data from additional published and unpublished trials. A pre-planned decision hierarchy was used to select one benefit and one harm outcome from each trial. For the assessment of benefits, we summarised continuous data as standardised mean differences (SMDs) and dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs). We used risk differences (RDs) for the assessment of adverse events. We used random-effects models for all statistical analyses. We used subgroup analysis to explore potential causes for heterogeneity (e.g. type of placebo) and sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the primary analyses (e.g. fixed-effect model). We included 96 randomised trials (4200 participants), ranging from 8 to 393 participants in each trial. 83 trials (3614 participants) provided usable data. The trials included 15 different mental health disorders, the most common being anxiety (25 trials), depression (16 trials), and sleep-wake disorders (11 trials). All 96 trials were assessed as high risk of bias partly because of the inability to blind participants and personnel in trials with two control interventions. The quality of evidence was rated low to very low, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision in estimates, and heterogeneity. Only one trial compared wait-list versus no-treatment directly but the authors were not able to provide us with any usable data on the comparison. Five trials compared usual care versus wait-list or no-treatment and found a SMD -0.33 (95% CI -0.83 to 0.16, I² = 86%, 523 participants) on benefits. The difference between all placebo interventions combined versus wait-list or no-treatment was SMD -0.37 (95% CI -0.49 to -0.25, I² = 41%, 65 trials, 2446 participants) on benefits. There was evidence of some asymmetry in the funnel plot (Egger's test P value of 0.087). Almost all the trials were small. Subgroup analysis found a moderate effect in favour of psychological placebos SMD -0.49 (95% CI -0.64 to -0.30; I² = 53%, 39 trials, 1656 participants). The effect of pharmacological placebos versus wait-list or no-treatment on benefits was SMD -0.14 (95% CI -0.39 to 0.11, 9 trials, 279 participants) and the effect of physical placebos was SMD -0.21 (95% CI -0.35 to -0.08, I² = 0%, 17 trials, 896 participants). We found large variations in effect sizes in the psychological and pharmacological placebo comparisons. For specific mental health disorders, we found significant differences in favour of all placebos for sleep-wake disorders, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders, but the analyses were imprecise due to sparse data. We found no significant differences in harms for any of the comparisons but the analyses suffered from sparse data. When using a fixed-effect model in a sensitivity analysis on the comparison for usual care versus wait-list and no-treatment, the results were significant with an SMD of -0.46 (95 % CI -0.64 to -0.28). We reported an alternative risk of bias model where we excluded the blinding domains seeing how issues with blinding may be seen as part of the review investigation itself. However, this did not markedly change the overall risk of bias profile as most of the trials still included one or more unclear bias domains. We found marked variations in effects between placebo versus no-treatment and wait-list and between subtypes of placebo with the same comparisons. Almost all the trials were small with considerable methodological and clinical variability in factors such as mental health population, contents of the included control interventions, and outcome domains. All trials were assessed as high risk of bias and the evidence quality was low to very low. When researchers decide to use placebos or usual care control interventions in trials with people with mental health disorders it will often lead to lower estimated effects of the experimental intervention than when using wait-list or no-treatment controls. The choice of a control intervention therefore has considerable impact on how effective a mental health treatment appears to be. Methodological guideline development is needed to reach a consensus on future standards for the design and reporting of control interventions in mental health intervention research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377466/"}

Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore associations between symptoms of depression and anxiety and waist girth, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, c-reactive protein, glycemic control, diet adherence, exercise, glucose monitoring, foot checks for ulcers, and the subjective patient experience. Analyses were stratified by sex. Depression was associated with a lower likelihood of avoiding saturated fats (OR=0.20 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.68]) and increased odds of physical inactivity (OR=1.69 [95% CI: 1.37, 2.72]). Anxiety was associated with increased odds of eating vegetables (OR=1.66 [95% CI: 1.02, 2.73]), and an over two-fold increase of feeling that having diabetes is difficult.

{"id": "22024317", "title": "Specificity of anhedonic depression and anxious arousal with sexual problems among sexually healthy young adults.", "text": "Past research has suggested that depression and anxiety are similarly associated with sexual problems. However, methodological limitations may have hindered the ability of prior studies to detect potential specificity between depression and anxiety with distinct sexual problems. Specifically, previous studies have frequently used measures that confound depression and anxiety, focused exclusively on populations with medical complications, and failed to account for the iatrogenic effects of antidepressants. Clark and Watson's tripartite model was used to differentiate anxious and depressive symptoms and examine their associations with indices of sexual functioning. Specifically, we examined how general distress, anxious arousal, and anhedonia are differentially related to sexual desire, arousal, erection and lubrication difficulties, orgasm achievement, pain, satisfaction, avoidance, pleasure, concerns, and sexual self-image. In a cross-sectional study, 1,258 young men and women completed the Female Sexual Function Index, Male Sexual Function Index (adapted for the current investigation), Profile of Female Sexual Function, and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Zero-order correlations revealed some specificity between the three affective constructs, as they were associated with sexual problems. However, multiple regression analyses revealed clearer patterns, showing that anhedonic depression was more uniquely related to most sexual problems among women, whereas the relations of anxiety and depression with male sexual problems were more mixed. This study of young subjects not identified to have affective or sexual disorders suggests that specificity exists between depression and anxiety as they relate to sexual functioning, and that this specificity varies between genders. Such findings highlight the importance of considering the unique influences of anxiety and depression in the conceptualization and treatment of sexual dysfunction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22024317/"}

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between current and childhood economic status and depressive symptoms in adults aged 20 or above. This study used data from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS), 2010 to 2013. A total of 9,645 individuals aged 20 years or above without depressive symptoms in 2010 were analyzed. The effect of childhood and current economic status, categorized into low, middle, and high groups, on depressive symptoms was investigated using hierarchical logistic regression models. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D 11) scale. Subgroup analysis was performed based on education level. Compared to the middle current-middle childhood economic status group, the low-low group (OR: 1.88, CI: 1.61-2.20), low-middle group (OR: 1.68, CI: 1.43-1.98), and low-high group (OR: 1.64, CI: 1.34-2.01) were more likely to have depressive symptoms.

We selected a stratified random population sample of Koreans aged 19-69 years and assessed them using a semi-structured interview designed to identify RLS, headache type, and clinical characteristics of TTH. We determined the prevalence and clinical impact of RLS in participants with TTH. Of the 2695 participants, 570 (21.2%) and 142 (5.3%) were classified as having TTH and RLS, respectively. Among the 570 individuals with TTH, 113 (19.8%) also met the criteria for probable migraine (PM). The prevalence of RLS was significantly higher among individuals with TTH than among those with non-headache (6.0% vs 3.6%, p = 0.018). The prevalence of RLS was significantly higher in subjects with TTH who fulfilled PM criteria than in those with non-headache participants (8.0% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.018).

Although diagnostic criteria for SD showed great variability, similarities for SD and MDD were striking. Both were common conditions with similar risk factor patterns. Clinical characteristics in both groups were depressed mood, suicidal ideation and high comorbidity. Outcomes were almost equally poor, with increased psychiatric morbidity and health service use. SD intervention studies showed promising results. Reports with data on SD not reported in keywords or abstract may have been missed by the search strategy. A dimensional view of depressive disorders is also supported in children and adolescents, suggesting SD to be a precursor to MDD.

Data from 915 women aged 42-52 who were recruited as part of the the Study of Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN) Mental Health Study were used to examine clinical and psychosocial features across groups of women with a lifetime history of MDD alone, anxiety alone, both MDD and anxiety, or neither MDD nor anxiety. As compared with women with a history of either MDD or anxiety alone, women with a comorbid history were more likely to report recurrent MDD, multiple and more severe lifetime anxiety disorders, greater depressive and anxiety symptoms, diminished social support, and more past-year distressing life events. Exploratory analyses indicated that women with a comorbid history also report more childhood abuse/neglect and diminished self-esteem, as compared with women with a history of either disorder alone. Midlife women with a comorbid history that includes both MDD and anxiety disorders report diminished social support, more symptomatic distress, and a more severe and recurrent psychiatric history.

The odds of having depression were more than double among females in comparison to males (AOR = 2.25, 95%CI = 1.68-7.47), which was 5.43 times (AOR = 5.43, 95% CI = 1.42-20.72) in the case of stress. Similarly, the odds of having depression among the respondents who live with persons other than parents were 4.11 times more likely as compared to those who used to live with parents before coming to the corrections home (AOR = 4.11, 95% CI = 1.37-12.27, which was 5.21 times (AOR = 5.21, 95% CI = 1.25-11.72) for anxiety. The respondents who were isolated from family were 12.57 times (AOR = 12.57, 95% CI = 3.58-44.17) more likely to have anxiety than those who were not isolated from the family, adjusting for other explanatory variables included in the model. Family history of conflict (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 0.82-4.13) and history of punishment (AOR = 2.10, CI = 1.13-4.41) were also found to be correlated with depression and stress, respectively. Mental health issues were linked to family conflict, broken homes, abuse history, and isolation, supported by key informant interviews as well. More than half of the children (14-17 years) in conflict with the law were having all three types of common mental health problems. These results highlight the urgent need for comprehensive and tailored intervention to address the mental health needs of the children in conflict with the law.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40817244/"}

Despite its relevance in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is widely under-studied and remains difficult to measure objectively in patient populations. We developed and tested a novel cognitive measure of reward-dependent agency perception in an in-person and online cohort. The in-person cohort consisted of 52 healthy control subjects and 20 subjects with depression and anxiety disorders (DA), including major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The online sample consisted of 254 participants. The task consisted of an effort implementation for monetary rewards with computerized visual feedback interference and trial-by-trial ratings of self versus other agency. All subjects across both cohorts demonstrated higher self-agency after receiving positive-win feedback, compared to negative-loss feedback when the level of computer inference was kept constant. Patients with DA showed reduced positive feedback-dependent agency compared to healthy controls. Finally, in our online sample, we found that higher self-agency following negative-loss feedback was associated with worse anhedonia symptoms. Together this work suggests how positive and negative environmental information impacts the sense of self-agency in healthy subjects, and how it is perturbed in patients with depression and anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36920973/"}

Illness beliefs have been shown to affect the outcome from physical illness, but there is limited information on the beliefs of patients who are depressed. To measure patients׳ beliefs about depression at baseline and determine whether these relate to depression severity at six months. Primary care patients with a recently diagnosed episode of depression completed the Beliefs about Depression Questionnaire and depression severity scores at baseline. The primary outcome was the change in depression severity score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale after six months. 227/292 (78%) participants completed follow-up questionnaires. Initial severity of depression at baseline, and particular beliefs about the causes, consequences and timeline of depression predicted poorer outcomes, whereas a belief in using exercise or keeping busy to treat depression predicted improved outcomes. Prescription of antidepressants did not appear to mediate these relationships. This was an initial study using a new validated questionnaire and it cannot be predicted whether these results are representative or would be reproduced in other populations. Although participants were primary care patients whose GP (General Practitioner) had coded as having a new incident episode of depression in the preceding six months, 43% of participants stated they had been depressed for more than a year. Sufficient participants were recruited to ensure the study was adequately powered but participation rate was 30%, raising the possibility of response bias.

Despite evidence that symptom severity and functional impairment are partially distinct, functional impairment is often overlooked. To assess whether functional impairment captures diagnostically relevant genetic liability beyond that of symptoms, we aimed to estimate the heritability of, and genetic correlations between, key measures of current depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment. In 17,130 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, we analyzed total scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression symptoms), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (anxiety symptoms), and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (functional impairment). Genome-wide association analyses were performed with REGENIE. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML and genetic correlations with bivariate-GREML. The phenotypic correlations were moderate across the three measures (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.50-0.69). All three scales were found to be under low but significant genetic influence (single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability [<i>h</i><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub>] = 0.11-0.19) with high genetic correlations between them (<i>r<sub>g</sub></i> = 0.79-0.87). Among individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the GLAD Study, the genetic variants that underlie symptom severity largely overlap with those influencing functional impairment. This suggests that self-reported functional impairment, while clinically relevant for diagnosis and treatment outcomes, does not reflect substantial additional genetic liability beyond that captured by symptom-based measures of depression or anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40759531/"}

The total population of 16-17-year-olds in Uppsala, Sweden, was screened for depression in 1991-1993. Adolescents who screened positive and an equal number of healthy controls took part in a semi-structured diagnostic interview. In addition, 21 different self-rated somatic symptoms were assessed. Sixty-four percent of those adolescents participated in a follow-up structured interview 15 years later. Somatic symptoms in adolescence predicted depression and other adult mental disorders regardless of the presence of adolescent depression. In adolescents with depression, the number of functional somatic symptoms predicted, in a dose response relationship, suicidal behavior, bipolar episodes, and psychotic episodes as well as chronic and recurrent depression. Contrary to expectations, the somatic symptoms of abdominal pain and perspiration without exertion better predicted depression than all DSM-IV depressive symptoms. Abdominal pain persisted as an independent strong predictor of depression and anxiety, even after controlling for other important confounders. Somatic symptoms in adolescence can predict severe adult mental health disorders. The number of somatic symptoms concurrent with adolescent depression is, in a stepwise manner, linked to suicidal attempts, bipolar disorders, psychotic disorders, and recurrent and chronic depression.

OCS and depressive symptoms may be related via depressive cognitive styles, such as rumination or dampening (i.e., down-regulating positive emotions). We evaluated the associations of OCS dimensions with depressive symptoms and cognitive styles. We also examined the indirect effects of rumination and dampening in the relationship between OCS and depressive symptoms. Participants (N = 250) completed questionnaires online. Greater depressive symptoms, rumination, and dampening were associated with greater levels of all OCS dimensions. Path analysis was utilized to examine a model including the direct effect of depressive symptoms on overall OCS and two indirect effects (through rumination and dampening). There was a significant indirect effect of depressive cognitive styles on the relationship between OCS and depressive symptoms, through rumination and dampening.

Patients with bipolar I or II disorder were assigned to an 'irritable/snappy' or 'euphoric/happy' sub-set on the basis of their dominant hypo/manic symptoms. Group differences were examined across clinical, personality, lifestyle and illness impact measures. The two sub-sets did not differ on age of depression onset, family history of mood disorders, or depression severity and impairment. The snappy sub-set reported higher levels of irritability in depressed phases and were more likely to have a comorbid anxiety disorder. Their hypo/manic episodes were shorter and they were more likely to be hospitalized at such times. On a temperament measure they scored as more irritable and self-focussed and as less cooperative and effective - indicative of higher levels of disordered personality functioning. Some comparison analyses were undertaken on a reduced sample size, giving rise to power issues. Our bipolar I and II diagnoses deviated to some extent from DSM-5 criteria in not imposing duration criteria for hypo/manic episodes.

Both clinical and economic effectiveness are evaluated in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The control condition of this 12-session preventive intervention is a 20-minute video movie. The primary outcome is symptoms of depression at post-treatment and follow-up (6 months after post-treatment). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of anxiety, satisfaction with life, mastery, reminiscence styles, quality of life, and health care costs. An additional result of this study is the insight into the working elements of the course, provided by the qualitative study. The qualitative data, mainly based on 20 open-ended interviews with participants, are to be analyzed with an emphasis on newly emerging insight. This study will add to the existing scientific knowledge in several ways, especially by also including an economic evaluation and a qualitative study to gain insight into the working mechanisms of the course, both rather new in the field of life review.

Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Studies were included if they assessed depressive or anxiety symptoms using a validated questionnaire, and controlled for the role of potentially important epilepsy factors. Eleven studies were identified and assessed for research standards using the Quality Index Scale (QIS). Ten of the eleven studies found at least one significant predictor of depression and all six studies that assessed anxiety found one or more significant predictors. Overall QIS score was only 7.5 out of 15, indicating significant design limitations of many included studies. There was also large variability between studies in measures used to assess psychosocial variables. Studies did not support the importance of attributional theory and stigma in the development of depression in epilepsy. There was inconsistent support for the role of illness representations but likely support for the role of stress and self-efficacy. Consistent support was found for the role of coping strategies and perceived social support.

Functional impairment in subthreshold respondents improved over time, but remained much higher than in controls. Prior anxiety disorder, high neuroticism, low conscientiousness, more somatic conditions, and more childhood trauma all predicted greater functional impairment. Older age predicted lower functioning only in subthreshold respondents, while the effect of neuroticism was stronger in subthreshold respondents relative to controls.

A sample of 820 emerging adult gamblers (M<sub>age</sub> = 21.14 years-old, SD = 2.90, 50.9% female) completed an online survey including an assessment of problematic engagement in gambling over the past year, levels of anxious/depressive symptomology, and difficulties in emotion regulation. In total, 15.6% and 8.2% of this sample were at moderate or high risk for gambling disorder. Results from a linear regression model revealed that difficulties with impulse control positively contributed to problem gambling scores and engagement in goal-directed behavior positively contributed to problem gambling scores, even after accounting for symptoms of depression. Moreover, results from a mediation model revealed that the association between problem gambling and depression was explained by participants' deficits in non-acceptance, goals, strategies, and clarity. Limitations include the use of self-report and cross-sectional data making it difficult to infer causality. These findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms that appear to explain for the first time the affective consequences of problem gambling.

Underdiagnosis of depression has been attributed to many reasons, including stigma surrounding mental health, limited access to medical care, and barriers due to cost. This study aimed to determine if low-burden personal health solutions, leveraging person-generated health data (PGHD), could represent a possible way to increase engagement and improve outcomes. Here, we present the development of PSYCHE-D (Prediction of Severity Change-Depression), a predictive model developed using PGHD from more than 4000 individuals, which forecasts the long-term increase in depression severity. PSYCHE-D uses a 2-phase approach. The first phase supplements self-reports with intermediate generated labels, and the second phase predicts changing status over a 3-month period, up to 2 months in advance. The 2 phases are implemented as a single pipeline in order to eliminate data leakage and ensure results are generalizable. PSYCHE-D is composed of 2 Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm-based classifiers that use a range of PGHD input features, including objective activity and sleep, self-reported changes in lifestyle and medication, and generated intermediate observations of depression status. The approach generalizes to previously unseen participants to detect an increase in depression severity over a 3-month interval, with a sensitivity of 55.4% and a specificity of 65.3%, nearly tripling sensitivity while maintaining specificity when compared with a random model. These results demonstrate that low-burden PGHD can be the basis of accurate and timely warnings that an individual's mental health may be deteriorating. We hope this work will serve as a basis for improved engagement and treatment of individuals experiencing depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333186/"}

However, some of the items on the DS14 seem to evaluate depressive symptoms rather than personality features. Therefore, the present study aims to verify whether an overlap exists between the constructs of Type D Personality and depression. Three-hundred-and-four consecutive patients who were both presenting their first ACS and had no history of major depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the DS14 to assess Type D personality at baseline and have been re-evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12-month follow-ups. Out of 304 subjects (80.6% males), 40 were diagnosed as depressed. An exploratory factor analysis of HADS and the DS14 in the second month revealed that four out of seven items on the depressive subscale of HADS (HADS-D) and six out of seven items on the Negative Affectivity (NA) subscale of the DS14 segregated on the same factor. Results were verified by a Partial Confirmatory Factor Analysis performed at the twelfth month when most of the patients achieved complete remission from the depressive episode. Temporal stability was poor for NA and Type D Personality and these construct co-vary with HADS-D over time. Our data suggests that NA and depression are overlapping constructs, supporting the idea that the DS14 measures depressed features, rather than a personality disposition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26335257/"}

Psychiatric illness is linked with obstetric complications along with impaired maternal functioning in the postpartum period. This article provides a comprehensive review of the research examining the intersection of psychopathology and adolescent pregnancy and the postpartum period. A literature search was conducted using PubMed (Medline), PsycINFO, and CINAHL for articles published between 1990 and 2013 that examined depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and psychosis during pregnancy and the postpartum period in adolescents age 21 years or younger. Articles were selected that covered the following topics: Prevalence or incidence, comorbidity, psychosocial correlates, birth outcomes, parenting, child outcomes, and psychosocial treatment. Forty articles were found and reviewed. There is a substantial research base examining self-reported depressive symptoms in adolescents during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Existing research suggests that pregnant and parenting adolescents are at greater risk for experiencing depressive symptoms than pregnant and postpartum adult women. Depression in the perinatal period is also a risk factor for substance and alcohol abuse and a harsher parenting style in adolescents. Areas for future research in this population include investigating the prevalence, psychosocial correlates, and outcomes of clinically diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder, developing and empirically validating psychotherapeutic treatments, and focusing upon other psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, and psychosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24559618/"}

Survey questions were based on a previous 2009 survey, with the addition of several novel items designed to assess knowledge around both perinatal anxiety and men's perinatal mental health. Depression (including postnatal depression) was the most frequently cited general health problem for women in the first postnatal year (52% of spontaneous first responses). Over 70% of adults believed that postnatal depression requires specialised treatment and checks for depressive symptoms should occur routinely in pregnancy and the first postnatal year. Women identified postnatal depression at a higher rate than men. Most commonly, postnatal depression was perceived as having a biological rather than psychosocial etiology (34.5%). Men and women differed in their knowledge about the symptoms of postnatal depression with more women correctly identifying core depressive symptoms. The specific term 'perinatal depression' was not well recognised. Although not well recognised as a general health issue, when prompted, 39% of respondents were aware of anxiety as a specific perinatal mental health issue. Most adult Australians (60%) were unaware that perinatal depression and anxiety could be experienced by men. Awareness of postnatal depression appeared high.

Two groups were created: Veterans receiving audio-only care (<i>n</i> = 161,071) and Veterans receiving two or more VVC visits (<i>n</i> = 84,505). Multiple logistic regression models examined symptom severity in the year before COVID as a predictor of treatment modality during COVID. Chi-square tests examined associations between modality and the number of assessments. Symptom severity as evaluated by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 significantly predicted modality of encounters during the pandemic such that those who had moderate or severe symptoms prior to COVID-19 were more likely than those with low or no symptoms to have two or more VVC encounters during the pandemic. Of those who received VVC, 55.62% had no Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessments compared to 68.96% of those who received audio-only. In the VVC group, 70.36% had no Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 assessments compared to 81.02% in the audio-only group.

World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) was used to assess the degree of disability. The associations between depressive symptoms and disability were analyzed using a linear regression and logistic regression with a complex sampling design. Of the 32,552 community residents, 655 patients were diagnosed with 12-month MDD. The disability rate due to MDD was 1.06% (95% CI: 0.85%-1.28%) among adults in Chinese community and 50.7% (95% CI: 44.3%-57.1%) among MDD patients. Depression was associated with all functional losses measured by the WHODAS. Feelings of worthlessness in life or inappropriate guilt, and psychomotor agitation or retardation were the key symptoms related to disability. Economic status, co-morbidity of physical diseases or anxiety disorders were correlates of disability scores. The disability rate might be underestimated due to the exclusion of MDD patients living in hospitals. The effect of treatments on disability was excluded. Psychological symptoms, not somatic symptoms, contribute to disability in MDD patients. Disability worsens when physical diseases or anxiety disorders are present.

Considering the prevalence of mental disorders among infertile women, health policymakers can use the results of the present meta-analysis to pay more attention to the mental health of infertile women and devise suitable interventions and programs to reduce and prevent the spread of psychological disorders among infertile women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38459997/"}
{"id": "39255015", "title": "Digital Mental Health Interventions for Alleviating Depression and Anxiety During Psychotherapy Waiting Lists: Systematic Review.", "text": "Depression and anxiety have become increasingly prevalent across the globe. The rising need for treatment and the lack of clinicians has resulted in prolonged waiting times for patients to receive their first session. Responding to this gap, digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been found effective in treating depression and anxiety and are potentially promising pretreatments for patients who are awaiting face-to-face psychotherapy. Nevertheless, whether digital interventions effectively alleviate symptoms for patients on waiting lists for face-to-face psychotherapy remains unclear. This review aimed to synthesize the effectiveness of DMHIs for relieving depression and anxiety symptoms of patients on waiting lists for face-to-face therapy. This review also investigated the features, perceived credibility, and usability of DMHIs during waiting times. In this systematic review, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and Web of Science for research studies investigating the effectiveness of DMHIs in reducing either depression or anxiety symptoms among individuals waiting for face-to-face psychotherapy. The search was conducted in June 2024, and we have included the studies that met the inclusion criteria and were published before June 6, 2024. Of the 9267 unique records identified, 8 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. Five studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 3 studies were not. Among the RCTs, we found that digital interventions reduced depression and anxiety symptoms, but the majority of interventions were not more effective compared to the control groups where participants simply waited or received a self-help book. For the non-RCTs, the interventions also reduced symptoms, but without control groups, the interpretation of the findings is limited. Finally, participants in the included studies perceived the digital interventions to be credible and useful, but high dropout rates raised concerns about treatment adherence. Due to the lack of effective interventions among the reviewed studies, especially among the RCTs, our results suggest that waiting list DMHIs are not more effective compared to simply waiting or using a self-help book. However, more high-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes are warranted in order to draw a more robust conclusion. Additionally, as this review revealed concerns regarding the high dropout rate in digital interventions, future studies could perhaps adopt more personalized and human-centered functions in interventions to increase user engagement, with the potential to increase treatment adherence and effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39255015/"}

The role of spouses, caregivers, and significant others became of salient importance not only because of their supportive functions but also in respect to their own burden. The purpose of this study was to assess the amount of distress in a mixed sample of cancer patients and their partners and to explore the dyadic interdependence. An initial sample of 154 dyads was recruited, and distress questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Symptom Checklist 9-Item Short Version and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey) were assessed over four time points. Linear mixed models and actor-partner interdependence models were applied. A significant proportion of patients and their partners (up to 40%) reported high levels of anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and low quality of life over the course of the investigation. Mixed model analyses revealed that higher risks for clinical relevant anxiety and depression in couples exist for female patients and especially for female partners. Although psychological strain decreased over time, the risk for elevated distress in female partners remained. Modeling patient-partner interdependence over time stratified by patients' gender revealed specific effects: a moderate correlation between distress in patients and partners, and a transmission of distress from male patients to their female partners. Our findings provide empirical support for gender-specific transmission of distress in dyads coping with cancer. This should be considered as an important starting point for planning systemic psycho-oncological interventions and conceptualizing further research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23825026/"}

We utilized data from a large psychiatric sample at admission and discharge from a partial hospital program (N = 1029, mean treatment duration = 8 days). We investigated features of the depression/anxiety network including topology, network centrality, stability of the network at admission and discharge, as well as change in the network over the course of treatment. Individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were more related to other symptoms within each disorder than to symptoms between disorders. Sad mood and worry were among the most central symptoms in the network. The network structure was stable both at admission and between admission and discharge, although the overall strength of symptom relationships increased as symptom severity decreased over the course of treatment.

However, no study has focused on the difference in various types of drug users. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the differences in depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and aggression among methamphetamine, heroin and polysubstance users and to further explore the risk factors for severe depression in the three groups. Drug users over 18 years old who met the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for substance -related disorders were included in the study. All participants completed a general questionnaire, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Barratt impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11), and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ). One-way ANOVAs or Chi-square tests were used to test the differences among the groups, correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between drug use and other parameters, and multiple logistic regression was conducted to assess the risk factors for severe depression. A total of 1,486 participants were included, comprising 86.3% males with a mean age of 38.97 years. There was a significant difference in the percentage of severe depression and SDS scores among the three groups, but no significant difference was found in SAS, BIS-11 and BPAQ scores. Using methamphetamines, hostility and anxiety were risk factors for developing severe depression in all the participants and anxiety remained constant in the other three groups. Moreover, methamphetamine use was 2.16 and 3.35 times more likely to cause severe depression than heroin and polysubstance use, respectively. The initial age of substance use was negatively correlated with BPAQ, SAS, and SDS scores, whereas the drug use duration and addiction duration were positively correlated. In this study, we found that the highest prevalence of severe depression was in participants using methamphetamines and that using methamphetamines, hostility, and anxiety were risk factors for developing severe depression. This result addressed an important gap in our knowledge of the different characteristics of depression, anxiety, impulsivity and aggression in various types of substance users and provides clinicians and policy-makers with directions for intervention and preventing relapse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35439968/"}

Depressive disorders were assessed with Composite International Diagnostic Interview at baseline and two-year follow-up. Functional limitations were assessed every 6 months with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment II. Depressed patients had more functional limitations compared to their non-depressed counterparts. Growth Mixture Modeling among depressed patients identified two trajectories of functional limitations, both starting at a high disability level. The largest subgroup (81.2%) was characterized by a course of high disability levels over time. The smaller subgroup (18.8%) had an improving course (functional recovery). After two years, the main predictor of functional recovery was the remission of depression. Among symptomatic remitted patients, female sex, higher level of education, higher gait speed, and less severe depression were associated with no functional recovery. Non-remitted patients without functional recovery were characterized by the presence of more chronic somatic diseases, a lower sense of mastery, and a higher level of anxiety. 1 in 5 depressed older patients have a course with functional recovery. Combining functional and symptomatic recovery points to a subgroup of older patients that might profit from more rigorous psychiatric treatment targeted at psychiatric comorbidity and a group of frail depressed older patients that might profit from integrated geriatric rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31550583/"}

In response to the need to examine their knowledge about depression and its management, and the dearth of such research from non-western developing countries, this study examined the depression literacy of undergraduates in Sri Lanka. A questionnaire was administered among 4671 undergraduates to examine their depression literacy relating to problem-recognition, measured using a vignette of a depressed undergraduate, and their treatment beliefs measured by assessing their perceptions about the helpfulness of various options of help for the presented problem. Responses for the latter aspect were quantified using a scale comprising the options of help endorsed by Sri Lankan mental health professionals. Regression analysis models were used to identify the correlates of these aspects of depression literacy. Females, medical undergraduates and those in higher years of study (compared to first-years) were more likely to recognise the problem as depression. The undergraduates obtained a mean percentage score of 76% on the constructed Depression Treatment Beliefs Scale. Scores on this scale were higher among females, medical undergraduates, those who got help for the problem after trying to deal with it alone and those who recognised the problem as depression, as well as those who used other mental health-related labels for this purpose. Scores were lower among undergraduates in years 2-4 (compared to first-years), those with family or friends with the problem and those with higher stigma on a Social Distance Scale. However, the effect sizes of these relationships were small. As factors such as gender, discipline, year of study, exposure to depression and stigma are associated with differences in the depression literacy of these undergraduates, concerning their ability to recognise the problem and their related treatment beliefs, these must be considered when designing related educational initiatives. Recognising the problem as depression or the use of other mental health-related labels is associated with better treatment beliefs as per expert consensus, indicating that such labelling could have value for appropriate help-seeking.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26518153/"}

The rise of such retirement coincided with the rise of unemployment in the second half of the 1990s. In this study we sought potential connections between these two epidemics. We assumed that depressiveness incurs a higher risk of disability retirement among the unemployed than among the employed population. Data were derived from HeSSup Study, which follows a large population sample. A total of 14,487 participants responded in 1998 and in 2003 in postal surveys about their employment status. Their depressiveness was measured in 1998 with Beck's depression inventory. Labour market status in 1998 was classified as employed, short-term unemployed and long-term unemployed. In 2003 the status was dichotomised into disability retired or not. A total of 329 participants (2.3%) retired during the 5-year follow-up. The retirement percentage was 1.9 among the employed, 4.8 among short-term unemployed and 6.7 among long-term unemployed. The percentage for the employed ranged from 1.4 (no depressiveness) to 7.1 (severe depressiveness), for the short-term unemployed, the range was from 3.3 to 17.9% and for the long-term unemployed the range was from 2.6 to 14.2%. Retirement was more probable among unemployed participants than among employed (OR 2.24 [95% CI 1.50-3.36] for short-term and OR 2.82 [95% CI 1.93-4.13] for long-term unemployed), when employment status was adjusted by sociodemographic background and somatic comorbidity and interaction term employment status with depressiveness was taken into account. Moreover, the interaction of employment status and depressiveness with the probability of disability retirement was significant. Our final analysis also revealed that disability retirement was particularly common among the short-term unemployed with severe depressiveness. Among the long-term unemployed, in contrast, retirement was more common in the mildly depressed than in the severely depressed. Our results suggest that high level of unemployment may mean high level of premature exit from the work-force due to disability retirement. The epidemic of depression-related disability contributes significantly to this general trend. In future, it will be important to find ways to support depression patients to hold on to their jobs and to develop services, combined with health policy and employment policy, can interrupt the vortex of deteriorating mental well-being, prolonged unemployment and marginalisation from health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19495533/"}

An emerging literature has examined the relation between the affective constructs in the tripartite model and smoking; however, these findings have not been summarized and integrated.

Qualitative summarization and integration of findings. All three dimensions were consistently associated with smoking status but demonstrated mixed or no relationship with smoking heaviness, chronicity, and dependence. Low PA and anhedonia consistently associated with craving and relapse, even in studies that controlled for other dimensions. Emotional disturbance on multiple dimensions (e.g., low PA + high NA) was associated with disproportionate increases in smoking risk in several studies. Tripartite dimensions may each have differential effects on smoking. Anhedonic and low PA individuals (especially those with concurrent NA or AA) may be a high-risk group worthy of targeting for interventions. Continued research of the affective dimensions linked with smoking could inform the etiology of tobacco dependence and lead to more effective smoking interventions that target affect.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21036959/"}

Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively.

Growth models for each type of symptom found significant variation in individual trajectories. Slopes were highly correlated across symptom type, as were intercepts. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses found evidence for a higher-order internalizing factor for both slopes and intercepts, reflective of comorbidity of depression and anxiety, with the internalizing factor accounting for 54% to 91% of the variance in slopes and intercepts of specific symptom sets, providing evidence for both a general common factor and domain-specific factors characterizing level and change in symptoms. Loadings on the higher order factors differed modestly for men and women, and when comparing African American and White participants, but did not differ by age, education, or history of depression. More distal factors including gender and history of depression were strongly associated with internalizing in the early weeks after job loss, but rates of change in internalizing were associated most strongly with reemployment.

Critically, residing in a setting that fails to evoke desired emotions and perceptions may have important implications for psychological wellbeing. Although previous research has investigated the relationship between student satisfaction and architecture/building amenities, little research has investigated how the ambiance of students' residences relates to mental health. Across a pair of studies, we evaluate the relationship between actual-ideal ambiance congruency (A-IAC) and mental health outcomes and mood. In Study 1, participants completed a pair of Q-sort tasks that required them to describe both their ideal room ambiance and their current room's actual ambiance. The discrepancy between these sorts was predictive of depressive symptoms, even when controlling for key covariates (e.g., personality, health, academics). In Study 2, these results were replicated among roommate pairs using dyadic analyses, while also being predictive of anxiety symptoms. Collectively, these studies reveal a novel environmental predictor of student wellbeing that can be of value for university staff. Ultimately, these findings suggest that having the ability to create one's ideal space may prove to be beneficial and possibly protective for the mental health of undergraduate university students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37786342/"}

Our analysis controlled for relevant sociodemographic factors, participation in social protest, and history of mental health treatment. Results showed that perceived neighbourhood destruction during the 2019 social uprising significantly increased PHQ-9 score by 3.702 points, prevalence of moderate to severe depressive symptoms by 18.7%, and likelihood of having a Subthreshold or Major Depressive Episode by 15.2% (p < 0.01). The impact of perceived destruction on depressive symptoms varies by gender, with a significant effect found in men (an increase in depression indicators of 5.769 points, 26.8% and 23.0%, respectively, p < 0.05) but not in women. Stratified regression models by age demonstrate a positive association between the perception of neighbourhood destruction and depressive symptoms across all age groups, with a stronger effect observed among young adults. We found a casual effect of violence related to social protest on depressive symptoms. These findings have implications for the planning of social policies aimed at protecting the mental well-being of the population in times of increasing socio-political turmoil.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38006846/"}

However, it remains unknown how the pandemic situation affects daily-life experiences of individuals with preexisting severe mental illnesses (SMI). In this real-life longitudinal study, the acute onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany did not cause the already low everyday well-being of patients with schizophrenia (SZ) or major depression (MDD) to decrease further. On the contrary, healthy participants' well-being, anxiety, social isolation, and mobility worsened, especially in healthy individuals at risk for mental disorder, but remained above the levels seen in patients. Despite being stressful for healthy individuals at risk for mental disorder, the COVID-19 pandemic had little additional influence on daily-life well-being in psychiatric patients with SMI.

Knowledge of disease, as well as understanding of illness, including patients' explanatory models of symptoms, may be useful in facilitating shared decision-making. Ideally, physicians are able to integrate evidence-based medicine with values-based medicine by combining the best research evidence with patients' unique needs and preferences. This, in turn, requires taking a systematic approach to the assessment of a range of domains (i.e. symptom profile, clinical subtype, severity and comorbidity) in individuals with depression, and individualising treatment accordingly. While data are now available from a range of randomised clinical trials addressing treatments for depressive symptoms, it is also notable that a decrease in symptom severity does not necessarily correlate with an increase in functioning, which highlights the need to monitor patients for the effect of treatment on a range of outcomes including comorbid anxiety, emotional responsiveness, and sleep quality. Importantly, recent epidemiological data emphasise the importance of persistence with treatment; most patients with major depression who persist with treatment eventually feel helped.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35247182/"}

Preventing them simultaneously in early life is critically important. We evaluated the long-term efficacy of an emotion regulation-based (ER) and a behavioural activation-based (BA) program. Both aimed to build resilience to prevent worry, a transdiagnostic feature across anxiety and depression. Participants were 316 students (52.2% female; 8-13 years) from six South Australian primary schools. Schools were randomised to the ER, BA or a control condition. Measures of resilience, worry, anxiety, and depression were taken at pre- and post- program, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. In addition, levels of emotion regulation, behavioural activation and resilience were measured as potential mediators of changes in anxiety and depression. No significant condition × time interactions were observed. However, the percentage of children who met the clinical cut-offs for generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder decreased significantly in the BA condition at 12-month follow-up, as well as the percentage of children who met the clinical cut-off for obsessive compulsive disorder in the ER condition. Furthermore, emotion regulation mediated the relationship between condition and worry at post-program in the ER condition. The sample size is relatively small. Reliance on child self-report may have resulted in inaccurate responses. The ER and BA transdiagnostic prevention programs for childhood anxiety and depression showed promising results for certain anxiety disorders not otherwise observed in universal school-based studies.

Our analysis included 383,621 individuals from the UK Biobank who were free of depressive and anxiety disorders at enrollment. TyG index was calculated as ln (fasting triglyceride [mg/dL] × fasting blood glucose [mg/dL]/2). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using primary care data and hospital inpatient records. Multivariable Cox regression analyses evaluated the prospective relationships of TyG index with incident depression and anxiety, with subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Over a median 13.75-year follow-up, 20,548 depression and 18,418 anxiety cases occurred. Participants with TyG index in the upper quartile had 29 % greater hazards for depression (HR = 1.29, 95 %CI: 1.23, 1.35) and 20 % elevated incidence of anxiety disorders (HR = 1.20, 95 %CI: 1.14, 1.25) when benchmarked against the reference group in the lowest quartile. Each standard deviation increase in TyG index was associated with a 21 % higher incidence of depression and an 15 % higher incidence of anxiety, respectively. Furthermore, these associations were stronger in participants aged <60 years, those with upper secondary or higher education, non-smokers (for anxiety), and ever-drinkers and females (for depression).

Therefore, the current study tested whether suicidal ideation (SI) relates to RewP and subjective capacity for anticipatory and consummatory pleasure at baseline and whether Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) impacts these measures. Participants with SAD (n = 55) or MDD (n = 54) completed a monetary reward task (gains vs. losses) during electroencephalogram (EEG) before being randomized to CBT or supportive therapy (ST), a comparator common factors arm. EEG and SI data were collected at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment; capacity for pleasure was collected at baseline and post-treatment. Baseline results showed participants with SAD or MDD were comparable in SI, RewP, and capacity for pleasure. When controlling for symptom severity, SI negatively corresponded with RewP following gains and SI positively corresponded with RewP following losses at baseline. Yet, SI did not relate to subjective capacity for pleasure. Evidence of a distinct SI-RewP association suggests RewP may serve as a transdiagnositic brain-based marker of SI. Treatment outcome revealed that among participants with SI at baseline, SI significantly decreased regardless of treatment arm; also, consummatory, but not anticipatory, pleasure increased across participants regardless of treatment arm.

As pre-existing mental disorders are a risk factor of negative psychological consequences during pandemics, it is important to identify specific predictors of psychological distress caused by restrictive measures in patients with history of depressive episodes. The aims of this study were i) to determine whether depressive, anxious symptomatology and suicidal ideation (i.e. mental health outcomes) were influenced by stay-at-home orders, and ii) to identify the psychosocial dimensions that influenced these mental health outcomes in patients with pre-existing depression during/after COVID-19-related restrictions. This study concerned 296 psychiatric patients with history of depressive episode in the 2 years before the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants received a computerized form to self-measure depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety (5 times during 2020-2021, two lockdown periods and three non- lockdown periods). Loneliness, boredom, habits, substance consumption, and access to psychiatric care also were self-reported. Loneliness and boredom were independent risk factors of anxiety and depression, and their changes dynamically affected the psychological state. Suicidal ideation was mostly driven by depressive symptomatology.

The two groups did not differ in terms of mental health, but women with birth complications and an unplanned birth mode in the family room had significantly lower anxiety scores than women without a family room.Women with birth complications exhibited higher post-traumatic stress symptoms overall. Additionally, women in the family room were significantly more often primipara, they more often had an unplanned birth mode and they differed in the frequency of their birth complications.This study provides first evidence for a psychoprotective influence of family rooms on anxiety in patients with previous complications and unplanned birth modes.

History of any mental health condition was evaluated by gender and sport played. It was also evaluated in comparison to musculoskeletal injuries and concussions. The lifetime prevalence of any mental health condition was 14.0% for all athletes, 14.2% for male athletes, and 13.6% for female athletes. Individual sports reported a greater prevalence (17.2%) than did team sports (11.8%) (p = 0.010). The prevalence was also higher in contact sports (16.4%) than in non-contact sports (12.5%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.072). There was a significant association between mental health condition and all four major groups of injuries examined: upper extremity (p = 0.043), lower extremity (p = 0.007), axial skeletal (p < 0.001), and concussions (p = 0.039). Post-concussion depression occurred in 2.0% of all athletes reporting a concussion. The lifetime prevalence of mental health conditions in this population (14.0%) is far less than estimates in the general population. This observation may be due to a combination of factors including exercise/athletic participation mitigating depressive symptoms, competitive selection, and underreporting.

{"id": "38913704", "title": "Too depressed and anxious to speak up: The relationships between weekly fluctuations in mental health and silence at work.", "text": "While it is widely acknowledged that some employees are more prone to silence than others, emerging research suggests that silence is much more dynamic than previously indicated, as even the most vocal employee will withhold input in some situations. However, given scant empirical attention to intraindividual fluctuations in silence, several important questions remain regarding its etiological antecedents, the mechanisms underlying such effects, and potential factors mitigating them. We respond by integrating the silence and mental health literature to consider how fluctuations in employees' experiences of depression and anxiety relate to fluctuations in silence via distinct silence motives. Specifically, we propose that employees are likely to engage in silence while experiencing episodes of depression because depressive symptomology shifts perceptions toward voice being pointless (i.e., ineffectual silence motive). Likewise, we propose that employees are likely to engage in silence while experiencing flare-ups of anxiety because anxious symptomology shifts perceptions toward voice being dangerous (i.e., defensive silence motive). Finally, we argue that voice endorsement attenuates these relationships by interrupting the link between silence motives and behaviors, such that employees experiencing heightened ineffectual and defensive silence motives are less likely to remain silent during weeks in which they experience high voice endorsement. We find support for these predictions via an experience sampling methodology study conducted with 136 employees across 4 weeks. We discuss how these results enhance theoretical clarity on the dynamic links between mental health and silence and offer insights into how organizations can counteract intrapersonal variations in silence.

Significant improvements in SRF, psychiatric symptoms and alcohol misuse were observed from pretreatment to follow-up. Although SRF scores were significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms at all three time points, improvement in the former did not predict improvement in the latter. When measured at the same time points, SRF scores were not correlated with the measures of alcohol misuse. However, improvement in SRF (specifically in existential well-being) over the course of treatment was predictive of improvement in the alcohol misuse measures at follow-up. These results suggest that the association between SRF, emotional problems, and alcohol misuse is complex.

This study assessed MHL, access and barriers to mental health care for depression among early adults in Uganda. Data were collected from students in two of the largest universities in Uganda. Participants completed questionnaires on depression, MHL, sources of barriers and opportunities for MH service. Regression analyses and parametric tests were used to assess depression, access, barriers and opportunities to promote MH. About 12 per cent (<i>n</i> = 56) of the respondents were at the level of moderately severe to severe depression. Mental health literacy (MHL) scores were generally low ranging from \"Ability to recognize mental disorders\" (<i>mean</i> = 19.32, <i>SD</i> 3.22, <i>range</i> 18-32), and \"Knowledge of risk factors\" (<i>mean</i> = 4.39, <i>SD</i> 1.17, <i>range</i> 2-8), and \"Knowledge of available information\" (<i>mean</i> = 9.59, <i>SD</i> 2.53, <i>range</i> 5-20). Respondents reported barriers such as \"stigma/discrimination\" (65.53%), \"lack of knowledge of where to receive help\" (65.15%), \"lack of trust in health workers\" (62.56%), and \"distant health facilities\" (19.70%) that impede access to treatment and care.

School marks were taken as a measure of social function. QUALITATIVE: Some children identified as \"less well\" by qualitative methods denied having symptoms. Some children identified as \"well\" had symptoms with no pathological significance for them. The lifeline revealed that feeling \"less well\" could be more related to post-war circumstances than war events. QUANTITATIVE: The two symptom checklist items have shown good internal consistency and discriminant validity. However, comparison with the overall well being revealed that still in 9/40 of cases the reported presence or absence of symptoms did not correspond to the well being of the child. Items of the two questionnaires did not discriminate reliably between children identified as \"well\" and \"less well\" by other means.

In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of this transformation for the distress scale based on a variety of criteria.

In particular, the effect on the convergent- (operationalized by the General Health Questionnaire and the Maastricht Questionnaire), divergent- (operationalized by the Neuroticism scale of the NEO-FFI), and predictive validity (operationalized as obtrusion with daily chores and activities, the Biographical Problem list and the Utrecht Burnout Scale) of the distress scale was investigated. Results indicate that recoding leads to (i) better model fit as indicated by lower mean probabilities of exact test statistics assessing item fit, (ii) small (<.02) losses in the sizes of various validity coefficients, and (iii) a decrease (DIFF (SE's) = .10-.25) in measurement precision for medium and high levels of distress. For clinical applications and applications in longitudinal research, the current practice of recoding should be avoided because recoding decreases measurement precision for medium and high levels of distress.

In this study we investigate the intersection of anxiety, depression, and self-reported breast implant illness (BII) in females undergoing aesthetic breast surgery. The objective of our research was to enhance understanding about mental health history, psychotropic medication use, and its relation to BII symptoms. A cohort of 240 consecutive female patients undergoing elective breast surgery was studied. In the study we categorized patients by groups based on the presence of self-reported BII symptoms and the type of breast surgery performed. Mental health history, psychotropic medication use, and time spent in treatment for mental illness were scrutinized. Statistical analyses were conducted, including multiple regression analysis. Results revealed that patients with self-reported BII symptoms often had a preexisting anxiety/depression disorder treated medically before obtaining breast implants, and this disorder predicted the occurrence of BII symptoms. These patients tended to be diagnosed with anxiety and depression at a younger age, initiate medication therapy earlier, take more medications for their condition, and spend more time in therapy compared with others undergoing elective breast surgery. Implications of this study highlight the need for comprehensive counseling between plastic surgeons and patients with self-reported BII symptoms. Understanding the role of anxiety/depression in the pathogenesis of self-reported BII is crucial, and collaboration with psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can ensure improved supportive care.

White and African American students attending elementary, middle, and high school (n = 3,146) were administered a multi-dimensional measure of anxiety and depression. Racial differences were examined using categorical, dimensional, and latent-variable analytic methods. Although effect sizes were small across all levels of analysis, the categorical and dimensional approaches produced different patterns of significant anxiety-related findings. Additionally, confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the dimensional findings were not due to racial differences in the measurement of anxiety. The results of the current investigation suggest that, among school children, race has modest effects on symptoms of anxiety, but not depression. Further, the differential findings observed across analytic approaches reinforce the importance of measurement and methodology when studying psychopathology in children and adolescents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22168294/"}

We developed an online survey and distributed it to all categorical pediatric residents in 9 NYS programs. Items addressing self-concern for clinical anxiety and depression and use of MH services were pilot tested for content and construct validity. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) measured depressive symptoms. Analyses used descriptive and chi-square tests. Respondents included 227 residents (54% response rate) distributed across training levels and programs. Many reported \"often\" or \"almost always\" feeling stress (52%), physical exhaustion (41%), and mental exhaustion (35%); 11% had PHQ-2-defined depressive symptoms. Some thought that their stress levels raised concern for clinical depression (25%) or anxiety (28%); among these, only 44% and 39%, respectively, had sought care. More women reported physical exhaustion (P < .05). Only 45% of residents reported educational offerings on resident MH; 66% wanted to know more about available resources. Barriers to receipt of services included inflexible schedules (82%), guilt about burdening colleagues (65%), fear of confidentiality breach (46%), and difficulty identifying services (44%).

The aim is to examine how symptoms of depressiveness, anxiety, and somatization change over the course of the pandemic and which role social support plays in that. Using two written surveys of n = 156 elderly participants in the periods May to June 2020 and March to May 2021, sociodemographic data, factors of psychological strain (depressiveness, anxiety, and somatization), as well as the perceived social support were recorded. The mean age of the respondents was 87.20 years (SD = 4.65; age range = 77.68-96.75 years) and 88.03 years (SD = 4.63; age range = 78.52-97.62 years) for 2020 and 2021, respectively. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon t‑tests and generalized linear regression models. A significant increase in the expression of psychological strain with regards to depressiveness, anxiety, and somatization can be identified. Higher scores of psychological strains in 2020 are associated with a higher psychological strain in 2021. Higher perceived social support in 2020 is associated with lower depressiveness one year later. An increase in psychological strain has been observed in the elderly population over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic until May 2021.

At baseline, when asked who they would seek help from if they thought they were depressed, respondents preferred using friends and family (46.5%) over a psychiatrist (24.9%), psychologist (22.8%) or general practitioner (GP; 19.9%). The presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a lower intention to seek help from family and friends but had no effect on intention to seek help from a healthcare professional. Over 12 months, 24.3% of the screened-positive cohort reported receiving services from a mental health professional. Factors associated with service use included identification of depression by the GP at baseline, having a past history of depression or other mental illness, and being a public sector patient. Having a positive intention to seek professional help or more severe depressive symptoms at baseline was not associated with a greater likelihood of receiving treatment. Mental health service use appears to be very low in this setting with only one in four primary care patients with depressive symptoms receiving treatment from a psychiatrist, GP or psychologist over a year.

Factors associated with stigma remain unclear; the relationship between stigma and various personal factors may depend on both the type of disorder being stigmatised and what type of stigma is assessed. Different forms of stigma include personal stigma (negative attitudes towards others), perceived stigma (perceived attitudes of others) and self-stigma (self-attribution of others' negative attitudes). Three hundred and fifty university students and members of the general public completed an online survey assessing contact with and knowledge of both depression and anxiety, age, gender, current depression and anxiety symptoms, and personal, perceived and self-stigma for both depression and anxiety. Greater contact with, and knowledge of that illness predicted lower personal stigma for both anxiety and depression. Participants with greater levels of current depression symptomatology and females, reported higher perceived stigma towards depression. Males reported higher personal stigma for anxiety. For both anxiety and depression, higher current symptomatology was associated with greater levels of self-stigma towards the illness. Findings confirm the role of contact and knowledge in personal stigma for both disorders, consistent with previous findings. This finding also supports evidence that interventions addressing these factors are associated with a decline in personal stigma. However, lack of relationship between contact with, and knowledge of a mental illness and perceived and self-stigma for either depression or anxiety suggests that these factors may not play a major role in perceived or self-stigma. The identification of symptomatology as a key factor associated with self-stigma for both anxiety and depression is significant, and has implications for community-wide interventions aiming to increase help-seeking behaviour, as well as individual treatment strategies for clinicians.

Patients (N = 418; ages 13-21) were assessed at four time points: baseline; post-treatment (six-month follow-up); 12- and 18-month follow-ups. The primary analysis estimated the effect of perceived parental criticism on likelihood of severe depression (i.e., Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale ≥ 24) over post-intervention follow-ups using a repeated-measures logistic regression model. Secondarily, a linear mixed-effects growth model examined symptom trajectories from baseline through 18-months using the Mental Health Index-5, a measure of emotional distress available at all time-points. High perceived parental criticism emerged as a robust predictor of clinically-elevated depression (OR=1.66, p=.02) and a more pernicious symptom trajectory over 18-months (β =-1.89, p<.0001).

Yet, there are few widely available interventions to address the needs of this population. Reducing distress and improving coping skills of the parent who cares for the injured or disabled adult may improve child outcomes. This paper examines whether changes in caregiver psychosocial outcomes after a caregiver coaching intervention are associated with decreases in child anxiety. Using programmatic data collected between 2015 and 2019 from participants in a family caregiver coaching intervention (170 caregivers, 294 children), we apply linear mixed models to assess associations between changes in family caregiver well-being, including problem solving, depressive symptoms, burden, health complaints and quality of life, and changes in parent-reported child anxiety. The baseline median Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent score was 17; children aged 6-11 had slightly higher scores. Child anxiety scores decreased on average 2.8 points (SD 8.4) between baseline and follow-up. In adjusted models, decreases in caregiver depressive symptoms and health complaints were associated with decreases in child anxiety. Caregiver problem-solving skills, quality of life, and subjective burden were not associated with changes in child anxiety. Family caregiver-focused interventions that decrease caregiver stress may positively affect children in the household.

This suggests the identification of additional contributors is necessary to improve our understanding of suicide risk in rural regions. Investigating the independent contribution of depression, and the impact of co-existing psychiatric disorders, to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a rural community sample may provide clarification of the role of depression in rural suicidality. 618 participants in the Australian Rural Mental Health Study completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, providing assessment of lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts, affective disorders, anxiety disorders and substance-use disorders. Logistic regression analyses explored the independent contribution of depression and additional diagnoses to suicidality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to illustrate the benefit of assessing secondary psychiatric diagnoses when determining suicide risk. Diagnostic criteria for lifetime depressive disorder were met by 28% (174) of the sample; 25% (154) had a history of suicidal ideation. Overall, 41% (63) of participants with lifetime suicidal ideation and 34% (16) of participants with a lifetime suicide attempt had no history of depression. When lifetime depression was controlled for, suicidal ideation was predicted by younger age, being currently unmarried, and lifetime anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition to depression, suicide attempts were predicted by lifetime anxiety and drug use disorders, as well as younger age; being currently married and employed were significant protective factors. The presence of comorbid depression and PTSD significantly increased the odds of reporting a suicide attempt above either of these conditions independently. While depression contributes significantly to suicidal ideation, and is a key risk factor for suicide attempts, other clinical and demographic factors played an important role in this rural sample. Consideration of the contribution of factors such as substance use and anxiety disorders to suicidal ideation and behaviours may improve our ability to identify individuals at risk of suicide. Acknowledging the contribution of these factors to rural suicide may also result in more effective approaches for the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22873772/"}

However, scant data are still available on factors associated with a worse outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate mental health symptoms in 139 GPs in the aftermath of the first COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy, detecting groups of subjects with different depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptom severity. The impact of the mental health symptoms on quality of life and individual functioning were also evaluated. A cluster analysis identified three groups with mild (44.6%), moderate (35.3%), and severe psychopathological burden (20.1%). Higher symptom severity was related to younger age, fewer years in service as GPs, working in a high incidence area for the pandemic, having a relative at risk of medical complications due to COVID-19, besides more severe global functioning impairment, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. The present findings showed that GPs, forced to perform their professional activity in extremely stressful conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, were at high risk of developing mental health problems and a worse quality of life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35409690/"}

Yet, they are now known to be transdiagnostic, i.e. shared across a wide range of psychological disorders. A more pertinent clinical and theoretical question is whether these processes are themselves distinct, or whether they reflect a shared 'core' process that maintains psychopathology. The current study utilized a treatment-seeking clinical adult sample of 313 individuals with a range of anxiety disorders and/or depression who had completed self-report measures of widely ranging processes: affect control, rumination, worry, escape/avoidance, and safety-seeking behaviors. We found that only the first factor extracted from a principal components analysis of the items of these measures was associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Our findings supported the 'core process' account that had its origins in the field of anxiety disorders, and we discuss the implications for theory, clinical practice and future research across psychological disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27400661/"}

The current study examined the psychometric properties and multi-dimensionality of a revised 25-item version of CSS, and evaluated the scale's ability to identify individuals at risk for clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety. CSS development and validation were completed in multiple phases. Exploratory factor analysis was completed with 1436 individuals diagnosed with cancer to examine scale dimensionality, and nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine scoring thresholds for depression and anxiety risk scales. Internal consistency reliability and convergent and discriminant validity were also examined. Confirmatory factor analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients were subsequently calculated with a separate sample of 1167 individuals to verify the scale factor structure and examine test-retest reliability. Five factors were identified and confirmed: (1) emotional well-being, (2) symptom burden and impact, (3) body image and healthy lifestyle, (4) health care team communication, and (5) relationships and intimacy. Psychometric evaluation of the total scale and factors revealed strong internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and convergent and divergent validity. Sensitivity of CSS 2-item depression and 2-item anxiety risk scales were .91 and .92, respectively. Results indicate that CancerSupportSource is a reliable, valid, multi-dimensional distress screening program with the capacity to screen for those at risk for clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30980258/"}

Our patient's first hospitalization in our ED clinic was at the age of 25 in 2012. Her anorexia symptoms have been developing over 1.5 years. The body mass index (BMI) at admission was 12.21 kg/m². She was stimulated by use of a MAGSTIM Super Rapid 2 device, every Monday through Friday (5 days a week) with the frequency 10 Hz, 15 trains/day, 100 pulses/train, intertrain interval 107 s for 10 days. The specific spot of stimulation was over the left DLPFC. The therapy was evaluated, both by the team and by the patient, as ineffective. Shortly after the therapy was finished, the patient was discharged with final weight of 46 kg and BMI 13.15 kg/m². We showed, that despite our positive clinical experiences with rTMS therapy in depression and anxiety, the treatment of AN and comorbid depressive disorder with anxious distress, our patient's anorexic, anxious, and depressive symptoms remained unaffected. In this case, only invasive medical intervention helped the patient to reach normal weight, but without any significant changes in her psychology.

Despite a vast amount of research into the social determinants of mental health during Covid-19, little is known about whether the results are consistent with the social gradient in mental health. Here we report a systematic review of studies that investigated how socioeconomic condition (SEC)-a multifaceted construct that measures a person's socioeconomic standing in society, using indicators such as education and income, predicts emotional health (depression and anxiety) risk during the pandemic. Furthermore, we examined which classes of SEC indicators would best predict symptoms of emotional disorders. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted search over six databases, including Scopus, PubMed, etc., between November 4, 2021 and November 11, 2021 for studies that investigated how SEC indicators predict emotional health risks during Covid-19, after obtaining approval from PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021288508). Using Covidence as the platform, 362 articles (324 cross-sectional/repeated cross-sectional and 38 longitudinal) were included in this review according to the eligibility criteria. We categorized SEC indicators into 'actual versus perceived' and 'static versus fluid' classes to explore their differential effects on emotional health. Out of the 1479 SEC indicators used in these 362 studies, our results showed that 43.68% of the SEC indicators showed 'expected' results (i.e., higher SEC predicting better emotional health outcomes); 51.86% reported non-significant results and 4.46% reported the reverse. Economic concerns (67.16% expected results) and financial strains (64.16%) emerged as the best predictors while education (26.85%) and living conditions (30.14%) were the worst. This review summarizes how different SEC indicators influenced emotional health risks across 98 countries, with a total of 5,677,007 participants, ranging from high to low-income countries. Our findings showed that not all SEC indicators were strongly predictive of emotional health risks. In fact, over half of the SEC indicators studied showed a null effect. We found that perceived and fluid SEC indicators, particularly economic concerns and financial strain could best predict depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings have implications for policymakers to further understand how different SEC classes affect mental health during a pandemic in order to tackle associated social issues effectively.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38671542/"}

We ran analyses to find relationships between behavioural symptoms and neuroimaging measures of brain structure and function in adolescence. We found two symptom groups, consisting of anxiety/depression and executive dysfunction symptoms, respectively, that correlated with distinct sets of brain regions and inter-regional connections, measured by structural and functional neuroimaging modalities. We found that the neural correlates of these symptom groups were present before behavioural symptoms had developed. These neural correlates showed case-control differences in corresponding psychiatric disorders, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in independent clinical samples.

Little is known, however, concerning how this association may be modified by factors outside the working environment. This article examines the modifying role of private life social support in the relation between high strain work and the development of severe depressive symptoms. Data were questionnaire-based, collected from a cross-occupational sample of 1,074 Danish employees. At baseline, all participants were free of severe depressive symptoms, measured by the Mental Health Inventory. High strain work was defined by the combination of high psychological demands at work and low control, measured with multi-dimensional scales. Private life social support was operationalized as the number of life domains with confidants and dichotomized as low (0-1 domains) or high (2 or more domains). Using logistic regression we examined the risk of onset of severe depressive symptoms, adjusting for sex, age, occupational position, and prior depressive symptoms. Separately, neither high strain work nor low private life social support statistically significantly predicted depressive symptoms. However, participants with joint exposure to high strain work and low private life social support had an Odds ratio (OR) for severe depressive symptoms of 3.41 (95% CI: 1.36-8.58), compared to participants with no work strain and high private life social support. There was no increased risk for participants with high strain work and high private life social support (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.65-2.68). The interaction term for departure from additivity was, however, not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Our findings suggest that high strain work may increase risk of depressive symptoms in individuals with low private life social support, although the effect-modification was statistically non-significant.

One hundred seven consecutive in-patients with major depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III-R, DSM-III-R) and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRS-D) score of 18 points or more were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment. Two and four weeks after predefined blood levels had been obtained, the severity of depression was assessed using the HRS-D. The mean dosages used were 235 mg/day of imipramine and 77 mg/day of mirtazapine, the latter being in excess of the 15-45 mg/day range currently advised. Total HRS-D scores and seven symptom clusters were analyzed in the 85 patients (79%) who were not receiving any co-medication. Imipramine was more effective against the clusters related to core symptoms of depression: \"depression and guilt\", \"retardation\", and \"melancholia\", respectively. Mirtazapine showed a biphasic response with regard to the clusters \"sleep\" and \"anxiety/agitation\", respectively, which consisted of a marked response after two weeks of predefined blood level, but with a waning of this effect at four weeks. Imipramine produced a more gradual response on these clusters, which was more pronounced at four weeks than with mirtazapine. Two aspects of the present study could be related to this finding: blood level control resulted in optimal treatment with imipramine but not mirtazapine, and - most importantly - the patients were not receiving any anxiolytic or hypnotic co-medication. These findings suggest that mirtazapine may have anxiolytic and sedative properties and fewer antidepressant properties than imipramine in severely depressed in-patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10463374/"}

These somatic features are not among the usual diagnostic and research criteria for depression (DSM-III, Feighner Criteria and RDC) although they appear to be a major feature in the natural history of depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6224832/"}

Diagnostic heterogeneity poses a challenge toward the adoption of a measurement-based care approach toward outcome evaluation in clinical practice. In the present article, we propose adopting the concept of psychiatric vital signs to facilitate measurement-based care. Medical vital signs are measures of basic physiologic functions that are routinely determined in medical settings. Vital signs are often a primary outcome measure, and they are also often adjunctive measurements. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project, we examined the frequency of depression and anxiety in a diagnostically heterogeneous group of psychiatric outpatients to determine the appropriateness of considering their measurement as psychiatric vital signs. Three thousand psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV supplemented with items from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. We determined the frequency of depression and anxiety evaluated according to the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia items. In the entire sample of 3000 patients, 79.3% (n = 2378) reported clinically significant depression of at least mild severity, 64.4% (n = 1932) reported anxiety of at least mild severity, and 87.4% (n = 2621) reported either anxiety or depression. In all 10 diagnostic categories examined, most patients had clinically significant anxiety or depression of at least mild severity. These findings support the routine assessment of anxiety and depression in clinical practice because almost all patients will have these problems as part of their initial presentation. Even for those patients without depression or anxiety, the case could be made that the measurement of depression and anxiety is relevant and analogous to measuring certain physiologic parameters in medical practice such as blood pressure and body temperature regardless of the reason for the visit.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21550031/"}

The subjects were 327 consecutively evaluated inpatients and outpatients with primary unipolar depressive disorder at five university medical centers participating in the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Program on the Psychobiology of Depression--Clinical Studies. The authors restricted their sample selection to patients with primary depressive disorder so that patients with other preexisting psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety disorders, would not contaminate the symptom picture, family studies, or follow-up. The examined six anxiety symptoms and derived a new anxiety summary score to show the effect of anxiety in depression on family data and 5-year outcome. Depressed subjects with higher ratings for anxiety took longer to recover. There was also a significant relationship between anxiety in depressed probands and the risk for primary unipolar depressive disorder, but not anxiety disorders or alcoholism, among 832 blindly interviewed first-degree relatives. These data confirm the usefulness of subdividing depressed patients according to anxiety symptoms: psychic and somatic symptoms of anxiety, taken together, significantly predict family illness and course. The data also emphasize the wisdom of requiring that generalized anxiety disorder not be diagnosed in the presence of a mood disorder. Clearly, symptoms of anxiety coexist with depression and need to be recognized for the effective treatment of the underlying depressive disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1928465/"}

However, previous studies on mobile sensing for depression severity assessment were conducted on homogeneous mental health condition participants; evaluation of possible generalization across heterogeneous groups has been limited. Similarly, previous studies have not investigated the potential of free-living audio data for depression severity assessment. Audio recordings from free-living could provide rich sociability features to characterize depressive states. We conducted a study with 11 healthy individuals, 13 individuals with major depressive disorder, and eight individuals with schizoaffective disorders. Communication logs and location data from the participants' smartphones and continuous audio recordings of free-living from a wearable audioband were obtained over a week for each participant. The depression severity prediction model trained using communication log and location data features had a root mean squared error (rmse) of 6.80. Audio-based sociability features further reduced the rmse to 6.07 (normalized rmse of 0.22). Audio-based sociability features also improved the F1 score in the five-class depression category classification model from 0.34 to 0.46. Thus, free-living audio-based sociability features complement the commonly used mobile sensing features to improve depression severity assessment. The prediction results obtained with mobile sensing-based features are better than the rmse of 9.83 (normalized rmse of 0.36) and the F1 score of 0.25 obtained with a baseline model. Additionally, the predicted depression severity had a significant correlation with reported depression severity (correlation coefficient of 0.76, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>p</mi> <mo><</mo></mrow> </math> 0.001).

Factors including age, sex, smoking status, and caffeine intake also were analyzed. When comparing change in GAD-7 or PHQ-9 scores from baseline to follow-up during treatment for anxiety or depression, there was no significant difference based on Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity scores. Caffeine intake had a direct correlation with PHQ-9 scores from baseline to 12 to 24 weeks but no correlation with GAD-7 scores. Overall, the amount of physical activity a patient participates in before anxiety or depression treatment does not appear to affect improvement outcomes.

We analyzed ambulatory data from 45 individuals with mood and anxiety disorders prior to therapy. Data were collected four-times-daily for at least 30 days. Latent profile analysis was applied person-by-person to discretize each individual's continuous multivariate time series of rumination, worry, fear, anger, irritability, anhedonia, hopelessness, depressed mood, and avoidance. That is, each time point was classified according to its unique blend of emotional states, and latent classes representing discrete mood profiles were identified for each participant. We found that the modal number of latent classes per person was three (mean = 3.04, median = 3), with a range of two to four classes. After splitting each individual's time series into random halves for training and testing, we used elastic net regularization to identify the temporal and lagged predictors of each mood profile's presence or absence in the training set.

The outcome measures were repeated eight-weeks later (<i>N</i> = 103). At the first time-point, 66% of participants exceed the clinical cut off for generalised anxiety disorder and 63% exceeded that for a depressive disorder. Both had significantly reduced eights-weeks later. Greater self-compassion predicted lower anxiety and depression, and better well-being, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including when all confounders were controlled for.

Here, we investigated sex differences in MDD markers using multiplex immunoassay measurements of 171 serum molecules in individuals enrolled in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NMDD = 231; Ncontrol = 365). We found 28 sex-dependent markers of MDD, as quantified by a significant interaction between sex and log2-transformed analyte concentration in a logistic regression with diagnosis (MDD/control) as the outcome variable (p<0.05; q<0.30). Among these were a number of male-specific associations between MDD and elevated levels of proteins involved in immune response, including C-reactive protein, trefoil factor 3, cystatin-C, fetuin-A, β2-microglobulin, CD5L, FASLG receptor, and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2. Furthermore, only male MDD could be classified with an accuracy greater than chance using the measured serum analytes (area under the ROC curve = 0.63). These findings may have consequences for the generalization of inflammatory hypotheses of depression to males and females and have important implications for the development of diagnostic biomarker tests for MDD.

Between 1998 and 2009, we enrolled 263 intractable Ménière's patients and divided into two groups, 207 in surgical group and 56 in non-surgical group. We used the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) at the diagnosis in our hospital to evaluate their psychological condition before treatments. CMI domains III and IV were defined as neurosis and SDS scores more than 40 as depression as a matter of convenience.

Neurosis and depression were diagnosed in approximately 40% and 60%, respectively, of intractable Ménière's disease. Our results showed that surgical treatment significantly improved vertigo suppression and hearing gain in patients with no psychological symptoms compared with those exhibiting psychological symptoms both in surgical and non-surgical groups. Furthermore, surgical results in cases with mental disorder were superior to non-surgical results in cases without mental distress. All taken together, psychological supports could be necessary for improving results both in the surgical and non-surgical treatments for patients with intractable Ménière's disease.

Indicators of depression and anxiety were constructed based on diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and specific phobias. Factor reduction analyses yielded three factors: (1) indicators of childhood separation anxiety, (2) indicators of childhood depression and anxiety, and (3) indicators of adulthood depression and anxiety. Lesbian women scored higher on childhood separation anxiety than all other groups. Heterosexual men scored lower on indicators of childhood separation anxiety than gay men and lower on indicators of childhood and adulthood depression and anxiety than all other groups. No other significant group differences were observed. Correlational analysis suggested that for men, but not for women, gender-atypical behavior was associated with negative mental health.

Agreement between caregivers and girls on depression symptoms was low, with only 2% of the variance in caregiver-reported depression on the Child Symptom Inventory being accounted for by child report on the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire. The level of association between depression and anxiety scores suggested that these constructs are associated but relatively independent in young girls. Both caregiver report and child report of depressive symptoms were uniquely associated with impairment ratings. Although major depression appears to be rare among 5- to 8-year-old girls, continuous measures of depressive symptoms yield significant individual differences that are associated with impairment.

This cross-sectional observational epidemiological survey was conducted from June to October 2021. We interviewed a representative sample of the adult population in Serbia (18-65 years) in the second year of the pandemic, at a time when large parts of the population had been affected by the pandemic in different ways. A multistage probabilistic household sampling of the adult population in 60 municipalities was used. Mental disorders were assessed by in-person interviews using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. Covid-19-related stressors (Sars-CoV-2 infection, the infection of a close relative, self-isolation and lack of protective equipment at work), as well as other stressors during the pandemic (not directly related to the risk of the infection), were measured. The associations with mental disorders, depressive and anxiety symptoms were explored through univariable and multivariable regression analyses. In total, 1203 individuals (mean age 43.7 ± 13.6 years, 48.7% male) were interviewed. Most respondents (67.8%) of the sample had already experienced Covid-19-related stressors (20.1% had Sars-CoV-2 infection; 43.2% had a close relative member who had Covid-19; 28.2% reported lack of appropriate protection; 27.5% had been quarantined) and about 50% had already been vaccinated.

In particular, socially and physically vulnerable populations, such as people experiencing homelessness (PEH), may be more likely to have their mental health worsened by the pandemic due to having more difficulty meeting basic human needs. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of the homeless in Japan by evaluating depressive and anxiety symptoms and identifying the associated factors particularly, sociodemographic variables as age, employment status and the fear and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. A cross-sectional interview survey among 158 PEH in Osaka Prefecture was conducted from April to May 2022. The survey included sociodemographic questions and history and perceived risk of infection with COVID-19. Depressive symptoms were measured using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the fear of COVID-19 using the seven-item Fear of New Coronavirus Scale (FCV-19S). In this study, the prevalence of depression (PHQ-9≥10) was 38.6%, anxiety disorder (GAD≥10) was 19.0%, and high fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S≥19) was 28.5%. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PEH in younger age groups (18-34 years), and with joblessness, higher perceived infection risk, and higher fear of COVID-19 were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p<0.05). These results indicate that the younger PEHs with worsened economic conditions and therefore, feel threatened by COVID-19 the pandemic are at higher risk of mental health deterioration. More focused research and mental health services need to be provided to this population in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37847683/"}

This study aims to explore the relationship between 'imported' (pre-prison) factors and prisoner mental health status. Prisoners (N = 756) from two UK prisons completed an established measure of mental health (General Health Questionnaire: GHQ-12) and a bespoke survey on pre-prison characteristics and experiences (for example, dispositions, childhood abuse, substance misuse, learning difficulties and employment). Prevalence of mental health difficulties was high, with 40.3% reaching the 'caseness' threshold. Binary logistic regression and odds ratio analyses were used to explore the ability of imported factors to predict mental health 'caseness' and the direction of influence. Collectively, the imported factors correctly predicted the caseness category of 76.5% of participants (p < .001). Pre-prison dispositions proved to be strong predictors of caseness as did childhood sexual abuse and learning difficulties at school. We found the direction of influence of three imported factors differed from all others: unemployment, prior experience of prison and a history of substance misuse. These three factors are associated with a lower rate of mental health caseness. It is of concern that, on release, these same factors are likely to militate against re-integration into society. Imported factors can serve as powerful predictors of 'within-prison' mental health status, but practitioners need to be cognisant of the relative importance and direction of influence of factors, as evidenced by these findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29548505/"}

Mental health symptoms were measured with questionnaires targeting depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep problems (ISI), eating disorders (SCOFF), alcohol abuse (CAGE), and PTSD symptoms (PC-PTSD-5). To evaluate the connection between variables a χ2 was conducted. Phi and Cramer's V coefficient were stated to demonstrate the power of the relationships. Additionally, machine learning (the XGBoost regression model) was used to build a predictive model for depressive symptoms. Of all respondents, 66% screened positive for PTSD symptoms, 45% - moderate and severe anxiety symptoms, 47% - moderate and severe depressive symptoms. Regarding sleep, alcohol use and eating behavior, 19% of surveyed students had signs of moderate and severe insomnia, 15% reported alcohol abuse and 31% disordered eating. The severity of the aforementioned disorders varied depending on gender, year of study, social status, etc. According to the predictive model, lower initial psychological well-being, female gender, younger age, first years of study and any traumatic experience, including multiple trauma, predicted increases in depression score.

Both neuroticism and depression have been linked to these constructs (and to each other), but how each may contribute to the pain experience is unknown. This study tested associations between neuroticism, depression, and indices of catastrophizing and pain-related anxiety among persons seeking treatment for chronic non-malignant pain. We hypothesized, as a higher-order personality trait, neuroticism would remain uniquely associated with both pain catastrophizing and pain-related anxiety, even after accounting for current symptoms of depression. A retrospective study design assessed depression (as measured by the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale), neuroticism (measured with the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and the Pain Anxiety Symptom Score in a consecutive series of patients (n=595) admitted to a 3-week outpatient pain treatment program from March 2009 through January 2011. Hierarchical regression indicated that neuroticism was independently associated with greater pain catastrophizing and pain-related anxiety, above-and-beyond the contributions of sociodemographic characteristics, pain severity, and depression. A depression by neuroticism interaction was not observed, suggesting that associations between neuroticism and cognitive-affective pain constructs remained stable across varying levels of current depression. These findings represent an early but important step towards the clarification of complex associations between trait neuroticism, current depression, and tendencies toward catastrophic and anxiety-provoking appraisals of pain among persons seeking treatment for chronic pain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902153/"}

During this period, there is increased neuroplasticity and heightened vulnerability to stress and inflammation. The gut microbiome regulates stress and inflammatory responses and can alter brain chemistry and behaviour. However, the role of the gut microbiota during pubertal development remains largely uninvestigated. The current study examined gut manipulation with probiotics during puberty in CD1 mice on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune responses and enduring effects on anxiety- and depression-like behaviours and stress-reactivity in adulthood. Probiotics reduced LPS-induced sickness behaviour at 12 h in females and at 48 h following LPS treatment in males. Probiotics also reduced LPS-induced changes in body weight at 48 h post-treatment in females. Probiotic treatment also prevented LPS-induced increases in pro- and anti-inflammatory peripheral cytokines at 8 h following LPS treatment, reduced central cytokine mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and PFC, and prevented LPS-induced changes to in the gut microbiota. A single exposure to LPS during puberty resulted in enduring depression-like behaviour in female mice, and anxiety-like behaviour in male mice in adulthood. However, pubertal exposure to probiotics prevented enduring LPS-induced depression-like behaviour in females and anxiety-like behaviors in males. Moreover, probiotics altered toll-like receptor-4 activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in males in response to a novel stressor in adulthood. Our results suggest that the gut microbiome plays an important role in pubertal neurodevelopment.

Although the ITT analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in depressive symptoms of MBCT + TAU over TAU, MBCT + TAU seems to have beneficial effects for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients in terms of remission rates, rumination, quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Additionally, patients who completed MBCT showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Reasons for non-completion should be further investigated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30088834/"}

An epidemiological study.", "text": "The present study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between type of living environment (urban versus rural) and anxiety, depression and psychosis in the Scottish population. Data were obtained from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics database on Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and urban-rural classifications for 6505 data zones across Scotland. Multiple regression was used to test the association between prescriptions for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis, and type of living environment according to urban-rural classification, controlling for a range of socio-economic factors. Urban-rural classification significantly predicted poorer mental health both before (β=-.29) and after (β=-.20) controlling for a large number of socio-economic variables, with more urban areas having higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis. The current study focussed on macro-level variables and did not include individual level data. As such, the study did not include data on individual diagnoses, but instead used drug prescriptions for anxiety, depression and psychosis as a proxy for level of affective disorders within data zones. More urban living environments in Scotland are associated with higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23742829/"}

There are few studies undertaken on temperament and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of our study was to examine the independent association between affective temperaments and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The sample included 90 patients with type 2 diabetes from two outpatient clinics aged 53.54 (SD ± 8.05) years and with 66.7% female gender. Depression was evaluated by using the MADRS observer rating scale (mean value: 16.38 ± 11). Patients with excessive depressive and anxious temperaments had more depressive symptoms, worse psychological adjustment to diabetes and worse metabolic control. In logistic regression (crude model), only depressive temperament was independently associated with metabolic control. Affective temperaments are associated with psychological adjustment to diabetes and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients above threshold on depressive temperament should be considered for greater scrutiny and psycho-education by the diabetes clinic staff.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21641045/"}

The prevalence of psychological distress (which include depression and anxiety) among breast cancer patients is estimated to be 15 to 54%, but studies have shown that applying some psychological treatments has contributed to decreasing depression and anxiety. So, it is crucial to diagnose and treat patients with the appropriate means. After reviewing the literature, no studies discussed depression and anxiety among Syrian breast cancer patients. A cross-sectional study in Al-Bairouni hospital in Damascus, Syria carried out using face-to-face interviews based on a structured questionnaire. All breast cancer patients were included, except who refused to participate, and responses with missing data were excluded. The questionnaire consisted of 2 sections: the first included Socio-demographic characteristics, and the other evaluated patients' depression using PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scales. Data were gathered using the Kobo toolbox app and then entered into an Excel sheet. Five hundred patients were interviewed. 35.6% of the patients had a GAD-2 score greater than or equal to 3.00, while 35% had a PHQ-2 score greater than or equal to 3.00. There is a significant negative relationship between the age of the patient and the GAD-2 score and PHQ-2 score, which means the older the patient is, the lower the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores are. A multivariable regression model showed that younger (age ≤ 45 years) and being widowed were associated with being positive for further evaluation for generalized anxiety disorder. Similarly, patients younger than 45 are significantly associated with the need for further evaluation for major depressive disorder (MDD). Social status had a stronger association with the need for further assessment for MDD, with divorced women showing the strongest association, followed by widowed and married women compared to single women. This study showed high anxiety and depression among breast cancer patients. The patient's age and social status were significant factors in determining the need for further psychological assessment. In General, Younger patients showed higher levels of depression and anxiety, the size of the tumor did not show significant association with psychological distress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36528568/"}

All network analyses controlled for age, sex, race, and number of chronic illnesses as covariates. Contemporaneous and temporal networks yielded relations between elevated MDD and PD and increased receptiveness to influence. Heightened GAD symptom severity was associated with future increased difference from others and decreased connection to others, commitment to others, and receptiveness to influence.

General concordance between the BSI-18 GSI scale and SCID diagnosis was good (AUC = 0.848), but the 2 most widely used BSI-18 case rules failed to identify a majority of survivors with SCID diagnoses, and no alternative BSI-18 cut-off scores met study criteria for clinical screening. Analyses aimed at identifying survivors with significant SCID symptoms or a SCID diagnosis had similar results, as did analyses examining depression and anxiety separately. The BSI-18 shows good overall concordance with a psychiatric interview, but recommended cut-off scores fail to identify a majority of YACS with psychiatric diagnosis. Clinicians should not rely on the BSI-18 alone as a screening measure for YACS. Alternative BSI-18 scoring algorithms optimized for detecting psychiatric symptoms in YACS may be an important step to address this limitation.

Depression on these two occasions was positively correlated with gender, age, initial scores of BIS/BAS activity, and with Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire scores for self-blame, rumination, putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and blaming others, and negatively correlated with initial positive reappraisal scores. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that higher BIS activity, catastrophizing, rumination, and lower positive reappraisal predicted depression after one year. However, after controlling for initial depression, these variables were indirectly related to subsequent depression. Implications are discussed for assessments of depression and interventions targeted at the BIS, BAS, and emotion regulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26386601/"}

In this study, short- and longer-term effects of a brief self-affirmation intervention framed in terms of implementation intentions (if-then plans with self-affirming cognitions; S-AII) were evaluated against an active control group (non-affirming implementation intentions; N-AII), matched to the target condition, and mere goal intention condition (a non-active control) in adults with psoriasis. The three pre-registered primary outcomes captured depression, anxiety, and well-being. Adults with psoriasis (<i>N</i> = 175; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 36.53, s.d. = 11.52) were randomized into S-AII, N-AII, or control. Participants' mental health outcomes were assessed prior to randomization (at baseline), at week 2 (post-intervention), and at a 1-month follow-up. Linear mixed models were used and results were reported on the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses revealed that S-AII exerted significantly more improvement in the course of well-being (<i>d</i>s > 0.25), depressive symptoms (<i>d</i>s > -0.40), and anxiety (<i>d</i>s > -0.45) than the N-AII and control group at 2-week post-intervention. Though the differences between groups faded at 1-month follow-up, the within-group changes over time for S-AII in all mental health outcomes remained significant. Brief and low-intensity S-AII intervention exerted in the short-term a considerable impact on mental health outcomes. The S-AII shows promising results as a relevant public mental health strategy for enhancing well-being and reducing psychological distress. Future studies could consider whether these effects can be further enhanced with booster interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34736546/"}

At enrollment, measures of stress included: difficulty accessing basic goods, educational attainment, exposure to violence, fair or poor general health, perceived stress, and symptoms of depression, general anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Linear mixed models evaluated the association between each stress measure and absolute and relative changes in HCC. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) assessed correlations between HCC and continuous stress scores. Educational attainment of ≤12 years was associated with higher HCC in preconception and the 1st trimester, and general anxiety with lower preconception HCC. When modeling HCC patterns across the 4 hair segments, an educational attainment of ≤12 years was associated with higher HCC, high perceived stress with lower HCC, and general anxiety with steeper increases in HCC (group by time p value = .02). Only preconception HCC and GAD scores correlated (r = -0.22, p = .04). We observed few associations between stress and HCC.

Meta-analysis incorporated meta-regressions and a random-effects model. PROSPERO, CRD42021262345. From 5,742 records, 68 studies were included. According to Downs and Black checklist, the 65 NRSIs were of low to moderate methodological quality. According to Cochrane RoB2, the three RCTs ranged from low risk of bias to some concerns of bias. Thirty-eight studies reported rates of depressive symptoms after stoma surgery as a proportion of the respective study populations, and from these, the median rate across all timepoints was 42.9% 42.9% (IQR: 24.2-58.9%). Pooled scores for respective validated depression measures (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)) across studies reporting those scores were below clinical thresholds for major depressive disorder according to severity criteria of the respective scores. In the three studies that used the HADS to compare non-stoma versus stoma surgical populations, depressive symptoms were 58% less frequent in non-stoma populations.

Severe RNT often occurs in individuals with severe levels of MDD, which makes it challenging to disambiguate the neural circuitry underlying RNT from depression severity. We used a propensity score, i.e., a conditional probability of having high RNT given observed covariates to match high and low RNT individuals who are similar in the severity of depression, anxiety, and demographic characteristics. Of 148 MDD individuals, we matched high and low RNT groups (<i>n</i> = 50/group) and used a data-driven whole-brain voxel-to-voxel connectivity pattern analysis to investigate the resting-state functional connectivity differences between the groups. There was an association between RNT and connectivity in the bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS), an important region for speech processing including inner speech. High relative to low RNT individuals showed greater connectivity between right STS and bilateral anterior insular cortex (AI), and between bilateral STS and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Greater connectivity in those regions was specifically related to RNT but not to depression severity. RNT intensity is directly related to connectivity between STS and AI/DLPFC. This might be a mechanism underlying the role of RNT in perceptive, cognitive, speech, and emotional processing. Future investigations will need to determine whether modifying these connectivities could be a treatment target to reduce RNT.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36043367/"}

A web-based survey was adopted to collect information from these college students, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward the epidemic and its control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of perceived risk of infection and attitude toward COVID-19 among college students in different geographic locations. Binary logistic models were used to identify associations between geographic locations and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. A total of 11,787 participants were analyzed in this study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students was 17.8% (95% CI 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95% CI 25.1%-26.7%), respectively.

A scoping review was performed of PubMed and PsychInfo databases from January 2015 to December 2021 following PRISMA-ScR guidelines using a defined search strategy. The search yielded 66 unique studies. In research with other than pregnant women, 83% (19 of 23) studies reported that social support benefited symptoms of depression with the remaining 17% (5 of 23) reporting minimal or no evidence that lower levels of social support predict depression at follow-up. In research with pregnant women, 83% (24 of 29 studies) found that low social support increased postpartum depressive symptoms. Among 8 of 9 studies that focused on loneliness, feeling lonely at baseline was related to adverse outcomes at follow-up including higher risks of major depressive disorder, depressive symptom severity, generalized anxiety disorder, and lower levels of physical activity. In 5 of 8 reports, smaller social network size predicted depressive symptoms or disorder at follow-up. In summary, most recent relevant longitudinal studies have demonstrated that social connectedness protects adults in the general population from depressive symptoms and disorders.

The current study examined the relationship between three self-report measures of psychological distress and ratings obtained from the corresponding clinician-administered measures in women seeking assessment for mental health problems following IPV ( N = 185). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the self-report Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the interview-based Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Depression symptoms were assessed using the self-report Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the depressive disorders sections from the clinician-administered Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV). Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the self-report Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the clinician-administered GAD section from the ADIS-IV. Results indicated that psychological distress was prevalent in the sample, with 27% receiving a PTSD diagnosis, 40% diagnosed with a depressive disorder, and 55% meeting criteria for GAD. Although each self-report measure was significantly and positively correlated with its corresponding clinician-administered measure, rates of diagnostic concordance were mixed. The BDI-II showed a high degree of agreement with the ADIS-IV depression section, but the IES-R and the CAPS were discordant at classifying PTSD. The BAI had acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity in relation to the ADIS-IV GAD section. These findings suggest that multiple assessment modalities should be considered when rating symptoms and estimating the prevalence of diagnoses among survivors of IPV.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056154/"}

However, few studies have compared their effectiveness to an appropriate control group, and no RCT has been conducted to tease apart the role of the clinician, app and Digital Navigator components. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a blended hybrid care model, the Digital Clinic, in reducing anxiety and depression, compared to a large primary care control group. Effectiveness was assessed by comparing GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores from intake to end of follow-up. Independent t-tests were used to evaluate mean percentage score changes for each subgroup, with Cohen's d calculated to estimate effect sizes. We constructed univariate logistic regression models to identify predictors of improvement for depression and anxiety. Patients in the hybrid model (n = 208) experienced greater reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores compared to patients in primary care with 0-3 months follow-up (n = 1077), yielding effect sizes of 0.50 and 0.37, respectively. Improvements in self-efficacy predicted better outcomes for both depression and anxiety, while increases in emotional self-awareness were predictive of anxiety improvement. Total app time and therapist alliance were significant predictors of depression improvement. Eight-week blended hybrid care models can offer effective treatment outcomes for depression and anxiety, even when compared to the real-world setting of primary care. These findings can inform future research aimed at elucidating the mechanisms that drive individual clinical effects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39988138/"}

In the current study, firstly, we wanted to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among PWUD. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the prevalence of these disorders with that of members from the general population who did not use drugs. We used a matched cohort design based on two separate repeated cross-sectional online surveys (April and November 2020) among PWUD and the general population. Results of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used as outcome variables. We calculated absolute and relative risks for matched pairs for both affective disorders, and logistic regression to compare affective disorders over both waves for PWUD. In April, the prevalence of affective disorders was similar for PWUD and the general population. In November, the risks for anxiety disorders increased with 64% for PWUD compared to non-PWUD (RR = 1.64, 95%CI 1.42-1.88), whereas the risks for depressive disorders more than doubled (RR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.97-2.67). Having a job and being male were protective factors for PWUD for both anxiety and depressive disorders. As this study used self-reported data, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 give an indication of the presence of anxiety and depression which might differ from a clinician's judgement. PWUD might be disproportionally affected by COVID-19.

However, to advance research gaps in low-income settings, we need valid measures of common mental health disorders. Using primary data collected in five countries (Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), this study aims to assess the psychometric properties of the commonly used 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D 10) scale among poor, disadvantaged youth populations in sub-Saharan African (SSA). Youth samples from each country (sample sizes ranging from 651 to 2098) come from large household surveys with youth modules, collected for impact evaluations of cash transfer programs targeted to poor families. For each sample, we assessed internal consistency (alpha), conducted factor analysis, and then examined construct validity and measurement invariance. We performed both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine and confirm the structure of the CES-D 10 for each country and then used multigroup CFA to assess measurement invariance across gender and age. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess construct validity via test of the relationship between CES-D 10 and background characteristics. Results show the CES-D 10 had strong psychometric properties and was a reliable measure of depressive symptoms among disadvantaged youth in SSA. Across countries, there was high internal consistency (Cronbach alphas = 0.70-0.76) and the traditional two-factor solution showed good model fit. Full measurement invariance of the CES-D 10 was supported across gender. Consistent with previous literature on risk factors for depressive symptoms, the CES-D 10 was associated with increasing age, and female gender and being out of school in some locations. Results from this study support broad use of the CES-D 10 among poor youth populations in SSA. Between one-third and two-thirds of our samples demonstrated depressive symptoms as classified by recommended cut-offs for the CES-D 10, indicating a high burden of mental illness in disadvantaged youth populations. This tool can be used in future efforts to study prevalence and dynamics of depressive symptoms in this population, as well as effectiveness of policies and interventions to improve the mental health of youth in SSA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29914413/"}

The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of online psychotherapy tailored to depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. The pilot study used a pre-post design to evaluate the efficacy of a 9-week e-CBT program designed for individuals with depression and anxiety affected by the pandemic. Participants were adults (N=59) diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, whose mental health symptoms initiated or worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online psychotherapy program focused on teaching coping, mindfulness, and problem-solving skills. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, resilience, and quality of life were assessed. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety (P=.02) and depression (P=.03) after the intervention. Similar trends were observed in the intention-to-treat analysis. No significant differences were observed in resilience and quality-of-life measures. The sample comprised mostly females, making it challenging to discern the benefits of the intervention in males. Although a pre-post design is less rigorous than a controlled trial, this design was selected to observe changes in scores during a critical period. e-CBT for COVID-19 is an effective and accessible treatment option.

We utilized a cross-sectional design and a nationally representative sample of American adults (N = 2140) dealing with a wide range of major life stressors. We found that the interactions between r/s struggle and all potential moderators were significant in predicting happiness and/or depression. The linkage between r/s struggle and lower levels of happiness was moderated by higher levels of each of the four proposed religious buffers.

In addition, each of the depression and anxiety symptoms was considered to be an ordered categorical variable ranging in value from 0 to 3. The three depression symptoms including loss of energy, loss of interest, and worthlessness and the seven anxiety symptoms including faintness or lightheadedness, feeling of choking, feeling scared, fear of the worst happening, nervousness, inability to relax, and feeling shaky were identified as the ten most central nodes within a network of depression and anxiety symptoms. The inter-connection between irritability and nervousness was a strong trans-diagnostic edge within the network of depression and anxiety symptoms. Because our study was designed in a cross-sectional manner, the networks were estimated undirectionally. Our findings show that depression symptoms are not more central than anxiety symptoms within an estimated network structure of symptoms in patients with MDD. Moreover, the inter-connection between irritability and nervousness may suggests a probable trans-diagnostic association in MDD symptomatology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32312693/"}

The objective of this study is to investigate whether growing up with a parent suffering from mental health problems is associated with depressive symptoms in late-adulthood and how this association is influenced by life-course socio-economic, health and lifestyle factors in childhood and late adulthood. We used life-history data from the SHARE survey, consisting of 21,127 participants living in 13 European countries. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the EURO-D scale. Parental mental health was assessed by asking respondents to report whether any of their parents had mental health problems during the respondents' childhood. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between parental mental health status and depression. Variables on childhood and late-life socio-economic, health and lifestyle factors were sequentially added to the model to assess the extent to which this association is influenced by life-course circumstances. Individuals who were exposed during childhood to a parent with mental health problems suffered from depressive symptoms more often in late adulthood than those who were not (OR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.43-2.17). Adjustment for life-course socio-economic, health and lifestyle factors in childhood and late adulthood diminished this association to an OR of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.24-1.90) and OR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.16-1.82), respectively. Our results indicate a substantial association between parental mental health problems in childhood and depression in late adulthood and that this association is partly explained by childhood as well as late adulthood socio-economic, health and lifestyle factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27936078/"}

However, the nature of the models׳ three major constructs--perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and acquired capability - requires further investigation. In this paper, we test a number of hypotheses about the predictors and correlates of the IPTS constructs. Participants aged 32-38 from an Australian population-based longitudinal cohort study (n=1167) were assessed. IPTS constructs were measured by items from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) and Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS), alongside demographic and additional measures, measured concurrently or approximately 8 years earlier. Cross-sectional analyses evaluating the IPTS supported earlier work. Mental health was significantly related to all three IPTS constructs, but depression and anxiety caseness were associated only with perceived burdensomeness. Various social support measures were differentially associated with the three constructs. Stressful events and lifetime traumas had robust independent associations with acquired capability for suicide only. The IPTS model provides a useful framework for conceptualising suicide risk. The findings highlight the importance of perceived social support in suicide risk, identify the importance of personality and other factors as new avenues of research, and provide some validation for the independence of the constructs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24947914/"}

Participants were 1253 women from South East Anatolian region who were interviewed in their homes for their psychosocial needs and mental health status. PTSD was assessed by the Post Traumatic Stress Scale (PDS), psychiatric symptoms by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and trauma-exposure and explanations by single questions. Results show relatively high prevalence of PTSD, 61%. A dose-effect association was found between the number of earthquake-related traumatic events and PTSD and psychiatric symptoms. The nature of trauma was, to some extent, significant in the associations with psychiatric symptoms and PTSD. Experiences involving death were comprehensively associated with psychiatric symptoms, whereas material losses were not. About a half of the women explained the trauma as a will and guidance of the God, 41% as a natural event, and 9% blamed human irresponsibility. As hypothesized, women who blamed other humans for the disaster reported higher levels of depressive, somatization and paranoid symptoms than those explaining it as God's will or a natural event.

The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between sports career-related concussions and the subsequent occurrence of symptoms of CMD among former male professional athletes retired from football (soccer), ice hockey and rugby (union). Cross-sectional analyses were performed on baseline electronic questionnaires from three prospective cohort studies among former male professional athletes retired from football (soccer), ice hockey and rugby (union). The number of confirmed concussions was examined through a single question, while symptoms of distress, anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance and adverse alcohol use were assessed using validated questionnaires. From 1,957 former professional athletes contacted, a total of 576 (29%) completed the questionnaire. Of these, 23% had not incurred a concussion during their career, 34% had two or three, 18% four or five, and 11% six or more concussions. The number of sports career-related concussions was a predictor for all outcome measures (β = 0.072-0.109; P ≤ 0.040). Specifically, former professional athletes who reported a history of four or five concussions were approximately 1.5 times more likely to report symptoms of CMD, rising to a two- to five-fold increase in those reporting a history of six or more sports career-related concussions. These data demonstrate an association between exposure to sports concussion and subsequent risk of symptoms of CMD in former professional athletes across a range of contact sports. Further work to explore the association between sports concussion and symptoms of CMD is required; in the meanwhile, strategies for effective risk reduction and improved management appear indicated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28870119/"}

The impact of mental health problems on resilience is however rarely discussed. This study investigated the reciprocal relationship of resilience with depression and anxiety symptoms using a three-wave cross-lagged design. Resilience level, depression, and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline, the third and the sixth month in 125 university students without psychiatric disorders (62 females). No significant changes in resilience levels were observed across the 6 months. Depressive symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms significantly increased at the third and sixth months compared with baseline. The three-wave cross-lagged models revealed an unstable reciprocal relationship of resilience with depression and a stable reciprocal relationship between resilience and anxiety symptoms over time. The reciprocal relationship between resilience and mental health problems indicates the importance of cultivating resilience for the prevention of mental illness as well as the importance of managing mental health symptoms at non-clinical levels for monitoring resilience. The unstable reciprocal relationship between resilience and depression symptoms across time suggests the existence of potential moderators that impact the relationship between resilience and depression.

The results revealed that the six-factor model fit the best in all samples except among younger nonclinical children. The results extended the generalizability of the rationally derived six-factor structure of the DSM-oriented scales to clinic-referred youths and provided further support to the notion that younger children in nonclinical samples exhibit less differentiated symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24229545/"}

The aims of this study were to (a) compare two common forms of RNT (worry and rumination) across individuals with non-comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and (b) to examine the relationship between RNT and comorbidity. A structured diagnostic interview and measures of rumination, worry, anxiety, and depression were completed by a large clinical sample with an anxiety disorder or depression (N=513) presenting at a community mental health clinic. Patients without (n=212) and with (n=301) comorbid diagnoses did not generally differ across the principal diagnosis groups (depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder) on worry or rumination. As predicted, comorbidity was associated with a higher level of RNT. Cross-sectional design precluded causal conclusions and findings may not generalize to excluded anxiety disorders. Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, RNT was associated with a range of anxiety disorders and depression and with comorbidity for those with a principal depressive disorder, supporting recent evidence that RNT is a transdiagnostic process. The presence of RNT, specifically worry and rumination, should be assessed and treated regardless of diagnostic profile. Future research may show that both pure and comorbid depressed or anxious patients receive incremental benefit from transdiagnostic protocols developed to treat core pathological processes of RNT traditionally associated with separate disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23866301/"}

Secondarily, we examined the overlap of burnout and depressive symptoms. A total of 1046 French schoolteachers responded to an Internet survey in November-December 2015. The survey included measures of public stigma, help-seeking attitudes and behaviors, burnout and depressive symptoms, self-rated health, neuroticism, extraversion, history of anxiety or depressive disorder, social desirability, and socio-demographic variables. The burnout label appeared to be less stigmatizing than the depression label. In either case, however, fewer than 1% of the participants exhibited stigma scores signaling agreement with the proposed stigmatizing statements. Help-seeking attitudes and behaviors did not differ between burnout and depression. Participants considered burnout and depression similarly worth-treating. A huge overlap was observed between the self-report, time-standardized measures of burnout and depressive symptoms (disattenuated correlation: .91). The overlap was further evidenced in a confirmatory factor analysis. Thus, while burnout and depression as syndromes are unlikely to be distinct, how burnout and depression are socially represented may differ. To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare burnout- and depression-related stigma and help-seeking in the French context. Cross-national, multi-occupational studies examining different facets of stigma are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27529667/"}

However, most CSDS studies rely only on the analysis of stress-induced social avoidance. Moreover, the predictive validity of the model has been poorly analyzed, let alone its interaction with biological risk factors. Here, we explore the validity of CSDS as a depression model. Further, the effect of decreased vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), as a potential factor enhancing a depressive-like phenotype, was studied. Mice were exposed to CSDS (10 days) followed by saline, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, or tianeptine treatment (30 days). The battery of behaviors included motor activity, memory, anxiety, social interaction, helplessness, and anhedonic-like behavior. Moreover, the behavioral effect of CSDS in VGLUT1 heterozygous (VGLUT1+/-) mice was studied, as well as the regulation of VGLUT1 mRNA. CSDS induced anhedonia, helplessness, hyperactivity, anxiety, social avoidance, and freezing, as well as downregulation of VGLUT1 mRNA in the amygdala. Repeated venlafaxine showed antidepressant-like activity and both venlafaxine and tianeptine behaved as effective anxiolytics. CSDS-induced social avoidance was reverted by tianeptine. Fluoxetine failed to revert most of the behavioral alterations. VGLUT1+/- mice showed an enhanced vulnerability to stress-induced social avoidance. We suggest that CSDS is not a pure model of depression. Indeed, it addresses relevant aspects of anxiety-related disorders. Firstly, CSDS-induced anhedonia and social avoidance are not associated in this model. Moreover, CSDS might be affecting brain areas mainly involved in the processing of social behavior, such as the amygdala, where the glutamatergic mechanism could play a key role.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22707231/"}

The present study was designed to evaluate within a young Bangladeshi population, the psychometric properties of two widely used Western measures of internalizing distress in young people: the short form of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire. The sample included 1,360 children and adolescents aged 9-17 years (M = 12.3 years, SD = 2.12) recruited from six districts of Bangladesh, including both community and emotionally at-risk participants. A total of 179 children were re-tested on the measures within 3-4 weeks. Confirmatory factor analyses showed single-factor structures for both scales in the total sample and in both community and at-risk participants separately. Multiple group analyses across gender and age-group within the at-risk and community samples showed that the single-factor structure was suitable regardless of subgroup. Analyses also indicated acceptable internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity for both scales. The two measures show promise as brief, reliable, and valid instruments for the assessment of internalizing distress among young people from Bangla-speaking communities. Positive clinical implications: These two measures of internalizing distress in young people showed solid psychometric properties within samples collected from various parts of Bangladesh. The measures can therefore be used to assess anxiety and depression in Bangla-speaking youth. These measures should be of value in both clinical settings and at a community level to assess the need for services. Cautions and limitations: Resource limitations did not allow comparison against diagnostic criteria and therefore cut-off scores to indicate clinical status among Bangladeshi youth will require further research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25522662/"}

Whereas depression has been consistently associated with excess mortality, the association between anxiety and mortality is less clear. Our aim was to identify constellations of anxious and depressive symptoms and examine their associations with mortality. This study considers respondents from the 1970 (n = 1203) and 1992 (n = 1402) cohorts of the Stirling County study. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed using structured at-home interviews. Vital status of participants through 2011 was determined using probabilistic linkages to the Canadian Mortality Database. Exploratory factor analysis yielded three correlated factors in each cohort. Items loading on each factor varied slightly between cohorts, but roughly corresponded to (1) depressive symptoms, (2) anxious symptoms, and (3) somatic symptoms. The depressive factor was associated with increased risk of mortality in both the 1970 (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.62) and 1992 (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.48) cohorts. Anxious symptoms were associated with a reduced risk of mortality in the 1992 sample (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.90).

Barriers in recruiting these hard to reach ethnic groups are cited as major reasons behind this under representation. Once these barriers are encountered it becomes a challenge for the researchers to overcome them. As there is paucity of research in this specific area through this paper we want to share our strategies in recruiting British South Asians thus encouraging other researchers to consider ethnic minority inclusion into research. Our published systematic review on the barriers to recruitment of ethnic minority participants into mental health research developed a typology of thirty three ethnic recruitment barriers described under five themes. We aimed to find strategies to overcome these barriers from five depression trials for British South Asians conducted by our research group. Firstly we extracted data on recruitment strategies from the published papers. Later researchers involved in these five trials formed a working group to add to these extracted strategies. Finally these strategies were matched to the individual barriers described in the typology. Multiple recruitment strategies were described by the researchers. These strategies were matched to all but two recruitment barriers related to psychopathology/substance misuse by the participants and paucity of healthcare related resources. Multiple strategies were found to be effective against each barrier and appropriate ones could be selected by the researchers after considering available resources at hand. Findings from this paper have implications for the design of recruitment strategies for hard to recruit ethnic minority groups to health care research. There is need for wider training and support of researchers to give them the skills to recruit these ethnic groups. Further development and evaluation of these strategies will lead to increased recruitment accruals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26202166/"}

Several studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries before and during enforced isolation (ie, lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced in England, and compare the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we analysed data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study weighted to population proportions, which collects information on anxiety (using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment) and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire) weekly in the UK since March 21, 2020. We included data from adults living in England who had at least three repeated measures between March 23 and Aug 9, 2020. Analyses were done using latent growth models, which were fitted to account for sociodemographic and health covariates. Between March 23, and Aug 9, data from over 70 000 adults were collected in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. When including participants living in England with three follow-up measures and no missing values, our analytic sample consisted of 36 520 participants. The average depression score was 6·6 (SD=6·0, range 0-27) and the average anxiety score 5·7 (SD=5·6, range 0-21) in week 1. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in England (b=-1·93, SE=0·26, p<0·0001 for anxiety; b=-2·52, SE=0·28, p<0·0001 for depressive symptoms). The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period (between weeks 2 and 5), with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced (between weeks 16 and 20). Being a woman or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. These data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly, possibly because individuals adapted to circumstances. Our findings emphasise the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to future lockdowns to try to reduce distress, and highlight that groups already at risk for poor mental health before the pandemic have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.

This study included a total of 28,978 young adults aged 18 to 44 years old in Guangdong province in south China, which was conducted from September to December in 2022. We used latent class analysis to classify the patterns of unhealthy lifestyle among young adults and used multiple logistic regression to explore their associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms. The weighted prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were 28.0 % and 19.5 %, respectively. The cumulative effect of unhealthy lifestyles on depressive and anxiety symptoms was significant. Five patterns of unhealthy lifestyle were classified. Compared to the relatively healthy lifestyle class, the class with more unhealthy lifestyles (OR = 6.54, 95 % CI: 5.70-7.51) and insufficient sleep (OR = 6.16, 95 % CI: 4.92-7.70) had higher risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Meaningfully, having adequate mental health literacy could reduce the risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms from unhealthy lifestyle by half. The cross-section design study limited causal inferences, and the self-report information may lead to recall bias. Unhealthy lifestyles have a negative impact on depressive and anxiety symptoms through independent, cumulative and combined effects, and they could be interrelated. Unhealthy lifestyle patterns differed in younger population by socio-demographic characteristics and mental health literacy. Health-care professionals and policymakers may provide programs to intervene multiple unhealthy lifestyles and improve mental health literacy by integrating healthy lifestyle education to promote youngers' mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38378090/"}

Our objective was to construct and validate a prediction rule for an unfavourable course of late-life depression. For development and internal validation of the model, we used The Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO) data. We included participants with a major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline (n = 270; 60-90 years), assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). For external validation of the model, we used The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) data (n = 197; 50-66 years). The outcome was MDD after 2 years of follow-up, assessed with the CIDI. Candidate predictors concerned sociodemographics, psychopathology, physical symptoms, medication, psychological determinants, and healthcare setting. Model performance was assessed by calculating calibration and discrimination. 111 subjects (41.1%) had MDD after 2 years of follow-up. Independent predictors of MDD after 2 years were (older) age, (early) onset of depression, severity of depression, anxiety symptoms, comorbid anxiety disorder, fatigue, and loneliness. The final model showed good calibration and reasonable discrimination (AUC of 0.75; 0.70 after external validation). The strongest individual predictor was severity of depression (AUC of 0.69; 0.68 after external validation). The model was developed and validated in The Netherlands, which could affect the cross-country generalizability. Based on rather simple clinical indicators, it is possible to predict the 2-year course of MDD. The prediction rule can be used for monitoring MDD patients and identifying those at risk of an unfavourable outcome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655070/"}

This study investigated validation of the questions and women's views on assessment. Women (n = 191) booking at an inner-city hospital completed the Whooley and Arroll questions as part of their routine clinical care then completed a research questionnaire containing the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). A purposive subsample (n = 22) were subsequently interviewed. The Whooley questions 'missed' half the possible cases identified using the EPDS (EPDS threshold ≥ 10: sensitivity 45.7 %, specificity 92.1 %; ≥ 13: sensitivity 47.8 %, specificity 86.1 %), worsening to nine in ten when adopting the Arroll item (EPDS ≥ 10: sensitivity 9.1 %, specificity 98.2 %; ≥ 13: sensitivity 9.5 %, specificity 97.1 %). Women's accounts indicated that under-disclosure relates to the context of assessment and perceived relevance of depression to maternity services.

Two hundred and nine homosexuals were recruited to participate in the online survey. The Perceived Social Support Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-rating Depression Scale were completed through a questionnaire website. Correlation analysis and mediation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between perceived social support, self-efficacy and mental health of homosexuals.

The mediation effect analysis found that self-efficacy mediates between perceived social support and depression but does not mediate between perceived social support and anxiety. The results demonstrated that in the context of Chinese collectivist culture, homosexuals have certain mental health problems, and their perceived social support and self-efficacy are critical protective factors for mental health.

Bivariate analysis and logistic regression was performed to assess the association between mental health status and being identified as a bully with an age-stratified analysis and sub-analysis by type of mental health disorder. In 2007, 15.2% of U.S. children ages 6 to 17 years were identified as bullies by their parent or guardian. Children with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or depression had a threefold increased odds of being a bully. The diagnosis of depression is associated with a 3.31 increased odds (95% CI = [2.7, 4.07]) of being identified as a bully. Children with anxiety and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had similar odds. The diagnosis of a mental health disorder is strongly associated with being identified as a bully. In particular, depression, anxiety, and ADHD are strongly associated with being identified as a bully. These findings emphasize the importance of providing psychological support to not only victims of bullying but bullies as well. Understanding the risk profile of childhood bullies is essential in gaining a better grasp of this public health problem and in creating useful and appropriate resources and interventions to decrease bullying.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24920001/"}

A well-established theory is that this may affect the mental health patterns of women and men. This study aimed at examining associations between childhood and adulthood gendered life on mental ill-health symptoms. A follow-up study of a cohort of all school leavers in a medium-sized industrial town in northern Sweden was performed from age 16 to age 42. Of those still alive of the original cohort, 94% (n = 1007) participated during the whole period. Gendered life was divided into three stages according to whether they were traditional or non-traditional (the latter includes equal): childhood (mother's paid work position), adulthood at age 30 (ideology and childcare), and adulthood at age 42 (partnership and childcare). Mental ill-health was measured by self-reported anxious symptoms (\"frequent nervousness\") and depressive symptoms (\"frequent sadness\") at age 42. The statistical method was logistic regression analysis, finally adjusted for earlier mental ill-health symptoms and social confounding factors. Generally, parents' gendered life was not decisive for a person's own gendered life, and adulthood gender position ruled out the impact of childhood gender experience on self-reported mental ill-health. For women, non-traditional gender ideology at age 30 was associated with decreased risk of anxious symptoms (76% for traditional childhood, 78% for non-traditional childhood). For men, non-traditional childcare at age 42 was associated with decreased risk of depressive symptoms (84% for traditional childhood, 78% for non-traditional childhood). A contradictory indication was that non-traditional women in childcare at age 30 had a threefold increased risk of anxious symptoms at age 42, but only when having experienced a traditional childhood. Adulthood gender equality is generally good for self-reported mental health regardless of whether one opposes or continues one's gendered history. However, the childcare findings indicate a differentiated picture; men seem to benefit in depressive symptoms from embracing this traditionally female duty, while women suffer anxious symptoms from departing from it, if their mother did not.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22747800/"}

The most well-known example involves people of Chinese heritage, who are found to emphasize somatic symptoms in presenting depression as compared with people of Western European heritage. It remains unknown whether a similar cultural difference is found for anxiety disorders. Euro-Canadian (n=79) and Han Chinese (n=154) psychiatric outpatients with clinically significant concerns about both depression and anxiety were selected from a larger dataset based on their responses to a structured interview. They also completed two self-report questionnaires assessing somatization of depression and anxiety. As expected, Chinese participants reported a greater tendency to emphasize somatic symptoms of depression, as compared to the Euro-Canadians. Contrary to expectations, the tendency to emphasize somatic symptoms of anxiety was higher among the Euro-Canadians as compared to the Chinese participants. Characteristics of our participants limit the generalizability of our findings. The current study is preliminary and requires replication. Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the results suggest that the popular notion of 'Chinese somatization' should not be over-generalized. Our findings also imply that there may be important differences in the cultural understanding of depression and anxiety in both Chinese and 'Western' contexts. Future studies should seek to unpack potential cultural explanations for why Euro-Canadian outpatients may emphasize somatic symptoms in the presentation of anxiety to a greater degree than Chinese outpatients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21794924/"}

{"id": "39696764", "title": "Up for Debate: Does Regular Physical Activity Really Improve Mental Health?", "text": "Physical activity is frequently touted as beneficial for mental health. This article, based on a 2023 ACSM colloquium, highlights key strengths and limitations of the evidence regarding physical activity and mental health from three perspectives: epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trial experiments, and investigations that explicitly consider the potential role that contextual factors, such as the social climate in which physical activity is completed, can play in physical activity-mental health interactions. A large body of epidemiological evidence supports that regular leisure time physical activity is associated with less depression and anxiety. Higher amounts of physical activity are often associated with fewer depressive symptoms, but there may be a dose-response point where for some people more is not better but can plateau or even worsen. Epidemiological evidence is emerging but currently inadequate to support associations between mental health and occupational, transportation/active commuting, or domestic/household physical activity types. A large body of randomized controlled trials, typically small, short duration and conducted with samples biased toward middle-to-higher socioeconomic status Whites, supports that the adoption of regular exercise improves aspects of mental health; however, the mechanisms are unclear and for those without mental disorders the mean effects are small. Mental health benefits of exercise may be partially a placebo response or result from contextual factors surrounding exercise programs. A small body of evidence supports that contextual elements, such as the program implementation quality and social environment, can influence the mental health outcomes associated with physical activity programs, but the evidence is currently inadequate to identify which contextual variables have consistent moderate or larger effects. Greater progress will be made in this area when research designs are expanded to include consideration of the potential influence of contextual factors on relationships between physical activity and mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39696764/"}

In patient populations, the determination of common and distinct neurofunctional markers of MDD and SAD is often hampered by confounding factors, such as generally elevated anxiety levels and disorder-specific brain structural alterations. This study employed a dimensional disorder approach to map neurofunctional markers associated with levels of depression and social anxiety symptoms in a cohort of 91 healthy subjects using an emotional face processing paradigm. Examining linear associations between levels of depression and social anxiety, while controlling for trait anxiety revealed that both were associated with exaggerated dorsal striatal reactivity to fearful and sad expression faces respectively. Exploratory analysis revealed that depression scores were positively correlated with dorsal striatal functional connectivity during processing of fearful faces, whereas those of social anxiety showed a negative association during processing of sad faces. No linear relationships between levels of depression and social anxiety were observed during a facial-identity matching task or with brain structure.

The patient attrition rate for six-months follow-up data was about 50%. Finally, patients received individualized treatment, with some patients receiving both medication and psychotherapy. Female patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with major depression or dysthymia than with an adjustment disorder. Females were also more likely than males to score lower on the mental health related scales of the SF-36 at admission. Patients diagnosed with an adjustment disorder scored higher on all SF-36 scales than did the other diagnostic groups at baseline and again at follow-up. There was no significant difference among diagnostic groups with regard to treatment outcome, suggesting that the adjustment disorder group can benefit as much as the other groups from treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10512607/"}

Women with vulvovaginal atrophy from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases (01/2010-09/2016) with ≥365 days of continuous insurance coverage before and after the first vulvovaginal atrophy/dyspareunia diagnosis (index date) were selected. Women with vulvovaginal atrophy were matched 1:3 to women without (controls) according to age, calendar year, health plan, and region. The study period spanned from 12 months before to 12 months after index date. The ratios of diagnosed depression, major depressive disorder, and anxiety among women with vulvovaginal atrophy and the controls were calculated. Logistic regressions adjusting for proxies of menopause were used to compare prevalence. In all, 125,889 women with vulvovaginal atrophy and 376,057 controls were included (mean age 60.7 [45-101]). The prevalence of depression, major depressive disorder, and anxiety was higher among women with vulvovaginal atrophy compared with controls (23.9% vs 18.9%, 6.3% vs 4.7%, 16.6% vs 11.3%), with prevalence ratios of 1.26, 1.33, and 1.47, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Highest prevalences and differences were observed in younger women. Findings were consistent when analyzing newly diagnosed conditions. When adjusting for proxies of menopause (insomnia, vasomotor symptoms, dysuria, and estrogen therapy), vulvovaginal atrophy remained significant (prevalence odds ratios; depression 1.23, major depressive disorder 1.22, anxiety 1.39; all P < 0.0001). Vulvovaginal atrophy is associated with a significantly higher prevalence/incidence of depression, major depressive disorder, and anxiety. The higher prevalence/incidence and greater differences in younger women highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach and early diagnosis/management of vulvovaginal atrophy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31688416/"}

Health care reimbursement data allowed us to assess antidepressant consumption and psychiatric consultation prospectively more than 18 months. Multilevel logistic regression models were estimated. The risk of depressive symptoms increased with decreasing personal educational level and unemployment and slightly with decreasing neighborhood income. In a sample comprising participants with and without depressive symptoms, high individual and parental educational levels were both associated with the consultation of psychiatrists. In this sample, a low personal educational level increased the odds of consumption of antidepressants. No heterogeneity between neighborhoods was found for antidepressant consumption. However, the odds of consulting psychiatrists increased with median neighborhood income and with the density of psychiatrists, after adjustment for individual characteristics. Among depressive participants only, a particularly strong gradient in the consultation of psychiatrists was documented according to individual socioeconomic status.

Sixty-five breast cancer-affected women disease-free 6 months after mastectomy hospitalized for reconstructive surgery (mean age 46.3 ± 7.3) were enrolled. Their depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-BDI-II), HRQL, and every day life functioning/barriers and facilitators (ICF) were assessed. At the BDI-II, 6 patients (9.2 %) reported mild depression and 6 (9.2 %) severe depression; when the subscales were considered, 7 (10.8%) resulted depressed at the somatic-affective factor and 16 (24.6 %) at the cognitive factor. Compared to normative data no differences emerged at the HRQL Physical Component Summary (46.4 ± 9.3 vs 49.1 ± 10.1), whereas patients reported lower scores at the Mental HRQL Component Summary (45.9 ± 10.1 vs 51.5 ± 9.1; p = 0.00001 t = -4.3).

The addition of the ICF evaluation to the usual psychological assessment gives a more complete picture, enabling a broader perspective of the psychological-clinical implications.

So far the effects of anti-stigma campaigns are small, and studies demonstrate that negative attitudes have been quite stable through recent decades. Aims To investigate the relationships between mental health literacy, experience of mental illness and stigmatizing attitudes/social distance towards people with depression or psychosis. Methods A cross-sectional study in which staff members from public services in Sweden (n = 1027) completed questionnaires covering demographic data, self-reported experience of mental illness, identification of a vignette for depression or psychosis, beliefs about helpful interventions for the illness presented in the vignette, and attitudes and social distance towards people with the illness. Results About 50% of participants could identify depression and less than 40% psychosis. A higher degree of mental health literacy was related to less stigma and social distance but mainly towards people with depression. A similar relationship was shown for having personal or family experience of mental illness and attitudes/social distance. Negative attitudes and social distance were significantly higher in all aspects measured towards a person with psychosis than a person with depression. Conclusions A higher degree of mental health literacy relates to more positive attitudes and less desire for social distance towards people with depression.

For both anxiety and depression, a piecewise growth curve model provided the best fit for the data, with symptoms decreasing until age 12 (the \"developmental knot\") and then increasing into early adolescence. The trajectory of anxiety symptoms was best described by a discontinuous homotypic pattern in which childhood anxiety predicted adolescent anxiety.

We studied the effects of a year of psychotherapy and case management in a primary care setting on common symptoms and functioning for Karen refugees (a newly arrived population in St Paul, Minnesota) with depression. A pragmatic parallel-group randomized control trial was conducted at two primary care clinics with large resettled Karen refugee patient populations, with simple random allocation to 1 year of either: (1) intensive psychotherapy and case management (IPCM), or (2) care-as-usual (CAU). Eligibility criteria included Major Depression diagnosis determined by structured diagnostic clinical interview, Karen refugee, ages 18-65. IPCM (n = 112) received a year of psychotherapy and case management coordinated onsite between the case manager, psychotherapist, and primary care providers; CAU (n = 102) received care-as-usual from their primary care clinic, including behavioral health referrals and/or brief onsite interventions. Blinded assessors collected outcomes of mean changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (measured by Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25), PTSD symptoms (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale), pain (internally developed 5-item Pain Scale), and social functioning (internally developed 37-item instrument standardized on refugees) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

The disability of 75 elderly inpatients and outpatients with major depression whose cognitive function ranged from normality to mild dementia was assessed with the Philadelphia Multilevel Assessment Instrument. Age at onset of depression, chronicity of depression, severity of depression, cognitive impairment, medical burden, social support and living environment were assessed with standardized instruments. Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living was significantly associated with advanced age, severity of depression, and medical burden. The relationship of depressive symptoms to impairment in instrumental activities of daily living was not influenced by age or medical burden. Anxiety and depressive ideation as well as retardation and weight loss were significantly associated with impairment in instrumental activities of daily living. Interviewer-rated global disability was associated with advanced age at onset of depression, medical burden, and overall cognitive impairment. Specifically, a disturbance in initiation and perseveration was significantly related to global disability. Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living appears to be a relatively independent dimension of health status that is related to depressive symptoms, particularly anxiety and depressive ideation as well as retardation and weight loss. Global disability may be associated with impairment in initiation and perseveration and with late onset of depression.

Depressive and anxiety symptoms declined during a pandemic wave from February to May 2021 (β = -0.06 [-0.07, -0.06]; -0.06 [-0.07, -0.05]), and remained lower at longer-term follow-up than at the start of the wave.

Women and younger individuals had a faster improvement in mental health during the pandemic wave. Loneliness trajectories were associated with mental health trajectories throughout the study period. We cannot definitively conclude that the observed changes in mental health were due to experiences of the pandemic.

This study provides an overview of university students' symptomatology and help-seeking behaviour before and during the pandemic. It aims to evaluate the impact of the different phases of the pandemic on students' mental health. We collected data in four-time points between March 2019 and March 2021. A total of 454 students (F = 85; M = 15) were included in the study. Students answered a socio-demographic and a standardized questionnaire (i.e., SCL-90-R) to evaluate a broad range of symptomatology. The results suggest that students experienced moderate to severe levels of depressive, obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptomatology. About 14% of the sample met the criteria for at least one mental health disorder, but most were not receiving mental health care. During the lockdown, compared with other phases, female students reported worse symptoms in the obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism dimensions. The increasing symptomatology disappeared after the lifting of the lockdown. The results showed no difference in the male groups.

It also aimed to calculate the overall magnitude of observed differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms reported by YWE compared with healthy controls and investigate whether any factors moderated anxiety and depression outcomes in YWE. Following prospective registration, electronic databases were searched up until October 2018. Studies were included if they reported on the rate of anxiety or depression in samples of YWE, and/or if they used valid measures of anxious or depressive symptomatology in YWE compared with a healthy control sample. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders in YWE was 18.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.0%-28.5%), and for depression the pooled prevalence was 13.5% (95% CI 8.8%-20.2%). In samples of YWE compared with healthy controls, significantly higher anxiety (d = 0.57, 95% CI 0.32-0.83, p < .000) and depressive (d = 0.42, 95% CI 0.16-0.68, p < .000) symptomatology was reported. YWE report anxiety and depressive disorders and symptoms to a significantly higher degree than youth without epilepsy. There is also evidence that certain anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder) are particularly elevated, perhaps reflecting the unique impact of epilepsy on youth psychopathology. Research is needed to understand the risk factors associated with anxiety and depressive disorders in epilepsy, and better understand how these symptoms change across development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31904859/"}

The consequences affect personal, family, professional, and social life. They cause severe functional and cognitive impairments, limit the ability to perform normal daily activities, which can result in complete disability. The aim of the study was to monitor the occurrence of anxiety and depression in patients following cerebrovascular accidents hospitalized in neurological departments in the region of eastern Slovakia. A total of 101 patients following cerebrovascular accidents, aged from 48-86 years, were included in the descriptive study. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients and from medical records. We determined the occurrence of anxiety disorders, depression and emotional distress in patients following cerebrovascular accidents using a standardized Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Data analysis confirms a high incidence of anxiety in the HADS-A subscale (9.23 ± 4.13) and depression in the HADS-D subscale (9.09 ± 4.43) during the hospitalization phase of the disease. It demonstrates the pathological occurrence of anxiety states in 37%, depression in 36%, emotional distress in 36%, and a serious degree of combination of pathological values of the anxiety subscale and the depression subscale in 27% of patients. The existence of a strong positive correlation between anxiety and depression indicators was confirmed. The results confirm a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in the acute phase of the disease. The findings indicate that patients recovering from cerebrovascular accidents not only face physical difficulties and loss of independence but also struggle with anxiety and depression, which can negatively impact and slow their recovery. Given the high frequency of these psychological conditions, further research is needed to enhance the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cerebrovascular accidents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39832144/"}

A repeated cross-sectional study.", "text": "The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Cross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children; one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the school closures and implementation of lockdown and social distancing. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. Participants included children and adolescents between ages 6 and 16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric or chronic disorder. Data were collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. 832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years (IQR=4 years). The median (IQR) Spence Children's Anxiety Scale score was 24 (12) at the pre-COVID-19 point and 31 (13) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001, r=-0.27). 11% and 16% of children reported being depressed at these two-time points, respectively (p=0.004, φ<sub>c</sub>=-0.063). Regression analysis showed that many factors, including the duration of smartphone use, female gender and only child status, were associated with increased anxiety or depression levels.

Data sources used were English and non-English language articles published between January 1970 and July 2000, retrieved using a keyword search of a number of biomedical, social science, educational, and general reference electronic databases. Two independent reviewers selected the relevant abstracts and articles. Only controlled trials were included in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental and a control group, the latter being a waiting-list, no-treatment or a placebo control group. Studies had to include at least one group-based parenting programme and one standardised instrument measuring maternal psychosocial health. Means, standard deviations, and information regarding study quality were selected from the included studies by two independent reviewers. The treatment effect for each outcome in each study was standardised by dividing the mean difference in post-intervention scores for the intervention and treatment group, by the pooled standard deviation, to produce an effect size. The results were then combined in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. A total of 23 studies met all the inclusion criteria and 17 of these provided sufficient data with which to calculate effect sizes. Fifteen of these studies provided data on the five main outcomes of interest: depression, anxiety/stress, self-esteem, social support, and relationship with partner. The meta-analyses show statistically significant results favouring the intervention group for depression (-0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.4 to -0.1), anxiety/stress (-0.5, 95% CI = -0.7 to -0.3), self-esteem (-0.4, 95% CI = -0.6 to -0.1), and relationship with partner (-0.4, 95% CI = -0.7 to -0.2). However, the meta-analysis of the social support data showed no evidence of effectiveness (-0.04, 95% CI = -0.3 to 0.2). Follow-up data were available for only three of the five outcomes. The results show that there were changes favouring the intervention group for self-esteem (-0.4, 95% CI = -0.7 to -0.2), the mother's relationship with her partner (-0.3, 95% CI = -0.8 to 0.1), and depression (-0.2, 95% CI = -0.4 to 0.002), although the confidence intervals for the mother's relationship with her partner and depression both cross zero. It is concluded that parenting programmes can make a significant contribution to the short-term psychosocial health of mothers. While the limited follow-up data are promising, further evidence of their effectiveness in improving maternal mental health is required. It is also suggested that some caution should be exercised before the results are generalised to parents irrespective of the level of pathology present.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12030667/"}
{"id": "31029797", "title": "Factor analyses differentiate clinical phenotypes of idiopathic and interferon-alpha-induced depression.", "text": "The discovery that prolonged administration of interferon-alpha (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) readily precipitates depressive symptoms has played a key role in development of the inflammation theory of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it remains unclear whether the clinical phenotype of patients with inflammation-associated depression significantly overlaps with, or can be distinguished from that of patients with 'idiopathic' depression. Here we explored the Hamilton depression scale factor structure of 172 patients undergoing interferon-alpha treatment for hepatitis-C at the point of transition to a depressive episode of DSM IV defined major depression severity. The resulting factor structure was first compared with a model derived from 6 previous studies of 'idiopathic' MDD (Cole et al., 2004). This confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of HAMD scores in our interferon-alpha treated cohort did not plausibly fit that previously described for 'idiopathic' MDD. Instead, subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed a distinct four factor model with a novel primary factor grouping cognitive symptoms of depression and anxiety (HAMD items 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 15). The second sleep disorder factor (items 4, 5, 6) replicated previous findings in 'idiopathic' depression. A third and unique factor grouped somatic symptoms and function (items 7, 12, 13, 14 and item 1). The final factor (also common in idiopathic depression studies), grouped gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss (items 12 and 16). Severe depression items (3, 8, and 17) were excluded from analysis due to very low variance. At transition, interferon-alpha induced major depressive episodes therefore appears to have more associated anxiety features that covary with depressed mood than classical or 'idiopathic' MDD and a low likelihood of severe features such as suicidal ideation. Identification of this clinical phenotype may help identify patients with an inflammatory depression etiology and support the development of more effective and personalized therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31029797/"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the biological correlates along with other health-related factors of long-term life dissatisfaction in a population-based sample. As part of the Kuopio Depression Study, health questionnaires were sent to a randomly selected population-based sample in 1998, 1999, and 2001.

We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on health, financial situation and families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, and higher prevalence. Interestingly, German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. As 25% of both German and UK responders reported a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of German and UK responders reached the clinical cut-off for depressive and dysthymic symptoms as well as anxieties, it specifically shows the need for tailored intervention systems to support large proportions of the general public.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33892807/"}

The secondary aim was to examine whether mental health symptoms and BMI were predictive of one another. Two models were tested: the first depicted depressive or anxiety symptoms predicting BMI, and the second model depicted BMI predicting depressive or anxiety symptoms. Women completed questionnaires at three time points throughout pregnancy, which comprised of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and self-reported weight. Height and weight were also reported retrospectively at T1 to calculate pre-pregancy BMI category. To calculate total gestational weight gain (GWG), pre-pregnancy weight was substracted from weight at 36 weeks gestation. 183 women were tracked during pregnancy; Time (T)1 (mean=16.50 weeks of gestation, SD=.92), T2 (mean=24.40 weeks of gestation, SD=.92), and T3 (mean=32.61 weeks gestation, SD=.88). The sample was divided into those for whom weight gain exceeded the guidelines for GWG (excessive gestational weight gain; EGWG), and those who for whom it did not. Multigroup path analyses compared the longitudinal relationships between depressive or anxiety symptoms and BMI during pregnancy for women with and without EGWG. BMI did not predict depressive or anxiety symptoms. Depressive symptoms at T1, did however predict higher BMI at T2 for women without EGWG. Anxiety symptoms and BMI were not related, regardless of GWG status. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms may precede increased BMI during pregnancy in women who do not gain weight excessively. There may be longitudinal relationships between depressive symptoms and BMI during pregnancy; however, further research is required to identify the mechanisms that link these health outcomes and inform the focus of intervention design.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25086989/"}

Applying the Rasch models, it was found that 10 items have an additive relationship for the severity of depression and that 5 items were additively related for endogenous depression, whereas five other items were additively related for reactive depression. Moreover, it was found that the dimension of severity should be transformed to three categories: no depression, minor depression and major depression. The two dimensions: endogenous and reactive depression, respectively, should be transformed to the categories: definite endogenous depression, combined endogenous and reactive depression, definite reactive depression, probable endogenous depression and probable reactive depression.

In an observational study, we investigated whether depressive patients' neuroticism and extraversion scores covary with antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and if so, whether this remains significant after accounting for depressive or anxiety symptoms. Major depressive disorder patients (N=237) were interviewed at up to four time-points in a five-year prospective longitudinal study. Changes in neuroticism plus extraversion scores were compared with changes in antidepressant pharmacotherapies and depressive plus anxiety symptoms to uncover any covariation between them. Autoregressive path models were used to examine this covariation at the sample level. Within-subject change was estimated using a random-effects latent change model. Significant covariation is present in the change trajectories between personality scores and depressive symptoms; declining depression scores were associated with rising extraversion and declining neuroticism. Although the personality scores of many patients changed significantly over the five-year study, none of these changes were associated with changes in antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The study covered only two dimensions of personality. Single drug-specific analysis could not be done. Antidepressant blood levels were not measured. No evidence emerged for significant covariation of antidepressant pharmacotherapy with neuroticism or extraversion scores. By contrast, changes in both personality dimensions were associated with changes in depressive symptoms, those in neuroticism also in anxiety symptoms.

We assessed the feasibility of a perioperative mental health intervention composed of medication optimization and a wellness program following principles of behavioral activation and care coordination for older surgical patients. We included orthopedic, oncologic, and cardiac surgical patients aged 60 and older. Feasibility outcomes included study reach, the number of patients who agreed to participate out of the total eligible; and intervention reach, the number of patients who completed the intervention out of patients who agreed to participate. Intervention efficacy was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Anxiety and Depression (PHQ-ADS). Implementation potential and experiences were collected using patient surveys and qualitative interviews. Complementary caregiver feedback was also collected. Twenty-three out of 28 eligible older adults participated in this study (mean age 68.0 years, 65% women), achieving study reach of 82% and intervention reach of 83%. In qualitative interviews, patients (n = 15) and caregivers (complementary data, n = 5) described overwhelmingly positive experiences with both the intervention components and the interventionist, and reported improvement in managing depression and/or anxiety. Preliminary efficacy analysis indicated improvement in PHQ-ADS scores (F = 12.13, p <0.001). The study procedures were reported by participants as feasible and the perioperative mental health intervention to reduce anxiety and depression in older surgical patients showed strong implementation potential. Preliminary data suggest its efficacy for improving depression and/or anxiety symptoms. A randomized controlled trial assessing the intervention and implementation effectiveness is currently ongoing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37798223/"}

Using the ABC-X Model to frame our model, we tested whether financial distress (C) mediates the associations between COVID-19 impact (A) and anxiety and depressive symptoms (X), and whether or not romantic relationship quality (B) moderates these indirect associations. Our sample comprised of 1950 U.S. emerging adults in a romantic relationship. Mediation and first-stage moderated mediation were tested using structural equation modeling. Financial distress partially mediated the association between COVID-19 impact and anxiety symptoms and fully mediated the association between COVID-19 impact and depressive symptoms. Strong evidence of moderated mediation was found but in the opposite direction expected: the indirect associations of COVID-19 impact with anxiety and depressive symptoms (through financial distress) were stronger for those in high-quality romantic relationships. The findings may inform policy and practice aimed at optimizing the mental health of emerging adults, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: specifically, alleviating financial distress may improve the mental health of emerging adults, while focusing on the quality of their romantic relationships may not.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36293701/"}
{"id": "27349578", "title": "[Psychometric approach of metacognition: Pilot study in clinical population].", "text": "Metacognition describes the process of thinking about one's own thought processes. This concept was introduced by Flavell in 1979 and has since been widely developed in the cognitive approach to mood and anxiety disorders. As it happens, many recent studies have underlined the links between metacognition and anxio-depressive symptoms, pointing out the interest of assessing its various dimensions. The short form of the Metacognitions Questionnaire is a brief multidimensional measure of a range of metacognitive processes and metacognitive beliefs about worry and cognition relevant to the vulnerability to and the maintenance of emotional disorders. The aim of this study was twofold: firstly to adapt and validate a French version of the short form of the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) and to assess its psychometric properties in a clinical sample, and secondly to investigate metacognitive predictors of anxiety and depression in this sample. The sample included 55 clinical participants (24 men, 31 women, mean age=51.33±14.62) with DSM-IV-TR psychiatric disorders (major depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder). Instrument reliability (internal consistency), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and convergent validity were measured. The total score and the five subscale scores were also compared with previous results in non-clinical samples. Reliability analyses indicated that the French version of the MCQ-30 possessed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach α=0.84), and confirmatory factor analysis supported the MCQ's original five-factor structure. Correlation with measurements of depression, anxiety and pathological worry demonstrated convergent validity (r=0.62, P<0.01 for anxiety; r=0.47, P<0.01 for rumination; r=0.33, P<0.05 for depression). Moreover, our clinical sample scored higher on the global scale when compared to previous non-clinical samples (mean score=71.85±13.57 while previous studies global scores ranged from 48.41±13.31 to 65.89±17.17). Consistent with others studies, negative beliefs about worry concerning uncontrollability and danger, as well as beliefs about the need to control thoughts were the strongest predictors of pathological worry (respectively r=0.68, P<0.01 and r=0.48, P<0.01) and depression (respectively r=0.45, P<0.01 and r=0.39, P<0.01), providing further support for the validity of the measure. These findings provide general support for the internal consistency of the French version of the MCQ-30, as well as its five-factor structure and its good concurrent validity in a clinical sample. They also confirm that this version is a valuable tool for the assessment of various dimensions of metacognition, in relation to the anxio-depressive symptomatology and the subsequent management of patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27349578/"}

The analysis included 735 women at the mean age of 39.61 years. The survey was conducted using the questionnaire form on the website. Based on Beck’s depression test, depressive disorders were disclosed in 32.65%, and both the presence and severity of depressive syndromes were inversely correlated with age. Using a cluster analysis, three adaptation strategies could be identified, related to the different prevalence of depressive disorders. Relationships proved the most crucial area of the balance model, responsible for the effectiveness of the coping strategy.

The data stem from the so-called Dallund Scale which was adapted from the NCCN Distress Thermometer and comprised questions to identify problems and concerns of a physical, psychosocial, and spiritual/religious nature. Descriptive statistics were performed using means for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. Odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression. In total, 6640 participants filled in the questionnaire. Among participants, 21% reported one or more spiritual/religious concerns, the most reported concerns related to existence and guilt. Having one or more spiritual/religious concerns was significantly associated with age (OR 0.88), female gender (OR 1.38), and by those reporting emotional problems such as being without hope (OR 2.51), depressed (OR 1.49), and/or anxious (OR 1.95). Among participants, 8% stated they needed help concerning spiritual/religious concerns. Cancer patients, living in a highly secular country, report a significant frequency of spiritual/religious and existential concerns. Such concerns are mostly reported by the young, female survivors and by those reporting emotional challenges. Spiritual/religious and existential concerns are often times tabooed in secular societies, despite being present in patients. Our results call for an increased systemic attention among health professionals to these concerns, and a particular focus on identifying and meeting the spiritual/religious and existential concerns of women, the young and those challenged by hopelessness, depression, and anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30963295/"}

Electronic databases PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched using an established methodology and pre-determined search terms for studies that reported the association between social media use, mental health, and sleep. The search yielded 6108 articles, of which 182 (n = 1,169,396) were eligible for the systematic review, and 98 (n = 102,683) could be included in the meta-analyses. The systematic review identified a high level of heterogeneity in the study results. Meta-analyses found small but significant positive associations between social media use, depression, and anxiety. In addition, problematic social media use was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and negatively associated with wellbeing. Geographical location, anxiety measure type, study design, age, and gender were identified as potential moderators. Associations for specific social media platforms as well as some moderator effects were not examined due to an insufficient number of studies.

However, the role of these as risk factors is less clearly established. The aims of this systematic review were to investigate: (1) whether anxiety and/or depression predict IBS onset; (2) the size of the relative risk (RR) of anxiety versus depression in IBS onset. Subgroup analyses explored if methodological factors affected the overall findings. Prospective cohort or case-control studies were included if they: (1) focused on the development of IBS in population-based or gastroenteritis cohorts; (2) explored the effects of anxiety and/or depression at baseline as predictors of IBS onset at a future point. In all, 11 studies were included of which eight recruited participants with a gastrointestinal infection. Meta-analyses were conducted. The risk of developing IBS was double for anxiety cases at baseline compared with those who were not [RR 2.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58-3.60]. Similar results were found for depression (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44-2.96). Anxiety and depression seemed to play a stronger role in IBS onset in individuals with a gastrointestinal infection although this could be attributed to other differences in methodology, such as use of diagnostic interviews rather than self-report. The findings suggest that self-reported anxiety and depression provide a twofold risk for IBS onset. There is less support for the role of anxiety or depressive disorder diagnosed using clinical interview.

This article describes the study protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), motivational interviewing (MI) against a non-directive supportive therapy (NDST) control, in treating problem gambling. This study was a mixed-methods design, with a parallel group, pragmatic RCT as the primary component, and embedded qualitative studies conducted alongside. A total of 297 participants were recruited from the community in Victoria, Australia. Individuals aged 18 years and over, could communicate in English and wished to receive treatment for a gambling problem were eligible. Participants were randomly allocated in to 1 of the 4 psychological interventions: CBT, BT, MI and NDST. Repeated measures were conducted at pretreatment and post-treatment, and 6 and 12 months post-treatment. The statistical analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach. Multilevel mixed modelling will be used to examine changes in the primary outcome measures: gambling symptom severity, using the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale, and gambling behaviours (frequency, time and expenditure).

Item characteristics, different aspects of reliability and validity of the HADS test parameters have been analysed on the basis of a follow-up study of 747 patients after acute coronary events participating in a hospital rehabilitation program. Short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Anxiety and Hamilton Depression Questionnaires were used as references. Criterion validity and cut-off points of HADS subscales were determined according to MINI+, a standardised diagnostic interview. The Depression (D) and Anxiety (A) subscales of the Hungarian version of HADS demonstrated high internal consistency (HADS-D: Cronbach =0,81, HADS-A: =0,85). Explorative factor analysis yielded a two-factor (1st: anxiety and 2nd: depression) structure. HADS subscales have shown high correlations with scales measuring similar constructs and validated in Hungarian. Empirical cut-off points of both subscales were determined with ROC analysis (HADS-D: 9 points, HADS-A 8 points). Sensitivity and specificity at these cut-off points fell into the acceptable 0.7 - 0.9 range.

It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety. The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women ≥18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1.

In a sample of <i>n</i> = 1938 university students (67.6% female), we investigated protective factors that are associated with mental health (defined as the absence of any mental disorder) and more specifically, the absence of major depression during the pandemic despite social restrictions. Investigated protective factors were social support, sense of coherence and situational coping strategies. The results of the multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that male gender, high sense of coherence and specific coping strategies could be identified to be associated with mental health in general and the absence of major depression. Protective coping strategies that were related to mental health in general were lower substance use, lower behavioral disengagement, higher positive reframing and lower self-blame. Protective coping strategies that were associated with the absence of major depression specifically were higher use of instrumental support, lower substance use, lower behavioral disengagement, higher positive reframing, higher emotional support, lower self-blame and lower humor. Social support was related to the absence of major depression, but not to mental health in general. Higher age in university students was associated with better mental health, but not with the absence of major depression specifically. These findings indicate that sense of coherence and situational coping strategies can buffer the adverse effect of social restrictions on mental health and thus, can serve as important resilience factors. Moreover, they highlight the political relevance of promoting specific coping strategies to foster mental health in students encompassing adverse events and social restrictions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36554304/"}

This was an open-label pilot study targeting mothers with mood or anxiety disorders, and their infants aged 6 to 12 months. We conducted three 12-week groups combining evidence-based maternal and mother-infant dyadic strategies to enhance mood, insight, parenting, and mentalizing capacity. We measured recruitment and retention rates, reasons for nonparticipation, and missed sessions. Acceptability of the intervention was assessed via questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Efficacy outcomes were the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), measured pretreatment and posttreatment. The feasibility and acceptability were excellent. There was a significant reduction in mean depressive symptom scores (t 3.31; p 0.008 sig) and a trend toward decreasing anxiety scores (t 1.96; p 0.08). The total PSI score decreased, approaching statistical significance (t 2.23; p 0.057). Enhanced insight, parenting capacity, affect regulation, and positive interaction with baby were supported with self-report surveys and interviews. This resource-efficient novel mother-baby dyadic group intervention shows excellent feasibility, acceptability, and has good preliminary efficacy results.

Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28870754/"}

Description of important patients experiences and mechanisms, according to which they operate, is the key issue in diagnostics, therapy, prevention and planning of further studies. Definitions of life events differ depending on theoretical conceptions. At the same time they can be divided on the basis of time relation between the occurrence of event and disorder. Events that can play important role in bipolar disorders are the following: early childhood traumas, early loss of important family member and current stressful events. Taking the latter into account, positive experiences connected with performances can affect manic symptoms, and negative events--depressive ones. The other group of important life events in this context consists of life events that are dependent on the patients' psychopathology. Hypotheses of kindling, \"manic denial\" or stress-diathesis model can explain mechanisms of these relations. The role of life events is probably modified by personality, temperament and coping mechanisms. Congruency of life events with personality styles is being underlined. There is a substantial lack of research in this field. Their integration with knowledge of genetic vulnerability and connection with neurobiological base with life events' reactions (e.g. catechol-o-methyl transferase, BDNFVal66Met genotype) is needed.

We examined (i) the associations between digital media use and mental health outcomes, anxiety, depression, and ADHD, (ii) whether family resilience and neighborhood factors attenuate the associations, and (iii) whether sleep mediates these associations. We used the National Survey of Children's Health data from 2019 to 2020. A total of 45,989 children's (6-17 years) data were analyzed in this study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between digital media use and anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Path models and Paramed command in STATA were used to test the role of sleep as a mediator of these associations. The prevalence of heavy digital media users (who spent 4 or more hours per day) among the analytic sample was 30.52%, whereas anxiety was 13.81%, depression was 5.93%, and ADHD was 12.41%. Children in the heavy media user group had 63% increased odds of anxiety (95% CI: 1.32-2.01) and 99% increased odds of depression (95% CI: 1.35-2.94) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, compared to the children in light media user group (who spent < 2 h per day), and these relations were significant at 0.01 level.

This protocol describes a cross-sectional study of a pan-India, web-based convenience sample of young adults (18-24 y) with access to digital devices with a screen and a minimum of secondary school education. Participants will be recruited through people in the professional networks of the investigators, which includes pediatricians. The survey will also be distributed via the social media pages of our organization (X [X Corp], Instagram [Meta], Facebook [Meta], etc). Sociodemographic details will be collected through a questionnaire designed by the authors; screen use time and patterns will be assessed using an adaptation of the Screen Time Questionnaire to include data on different apps and websites used on digital devices; and mental health parameters will be gauged using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire. For statistical analysis, we will consider the following variables: (1) the primary independent variable is screen use time; (2) other independent variables include age, gender, residence: rural or urban, educational qualifications, employment status, stress associated with familial financial status, average sleep time, number of people living in a house or rooms in that house, BMI, substance use, and past psychiatric history; and (3) dependent variables include mental well-being, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. To quantify the association between screen use time and mental health, we will perform a Bayesian multivariate multiple regression analysis that models the possibility of multiple alternative hypotheses while accounting for relevant sociodemographic covariables.

The German sample of N = 78 mother-infant dyads is composed of n = 30 mothers with postpartum anxiety disorders but without major or minor depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) and n = 48 healthy mothers. Subjects were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders at an average infant age of M = 4.1 months. Moreover, mothers filled out the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire-16. The Anxiety Cognitions Questionnaire, the Body Sensations Questionnaire and the Mobility Inventory were chosen to assess different aspects of anxious symptomatology. To control for concurrent subclinical depressive symptoms, we used the German Edinburgh-Postnatal-Depression Scale. Mothers with postpartum anxiety disorder reported significantly lower bonding than healthy mothers. However, in a linear regression analysis, concurrent subclinical depressive symptoms and avoidance of anxiety-related situations in company explained 27 % of the overall variance in maternal bonding. The perceived lower bonding of mothers with anxiety disorder could be due to aspects of a concurrent subclinical depressive symptomatology. This notion emphasizes the need to target even mild depressive symptoms in the treatment of postpartum anxiety disorders.

In contrast, cisgender girls showed increases in internalizing symptomatology (with the exception of parent-reported anxiety) as they got older, and cisgender boys showed decreased self-reported anxiety and increased, followed by decreased, parent-reported depressive symptoms. By mid-adolescence, levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms among transgender girls and transgender boys generally fell between those of cisgender girls and cisgender boys. Results demonstrate that transgender youth who are socially and medically supported in their gender identity can experience stable and positive mental health throughout the notoriously challenging developmental period of adolescence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39520461/"}

Association networks of anxiety and depressive symptoms were developed in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; N=52, mean age: 15.4±1.6 years) who had not yet developed major depressive disorder. Community analyses were used to create consensus clusters of depressive and anxiety symptoms and to identify \"bridge\" symptoms between the clusters. In a subset of this sample (n=39), correlations between cortical thickness and depressive symptom severity was examined. Ten symptoms clustered into an anxious community, 5 clustered into a depressive community and 5 bridged the two communities: impaired schoolwork, excessive weeping, low self-esteem, disturbed appetite, and physical symptoms of depression. Patients with more depressive cluster burden had altered cortical thickness in prefrontal, inferior and medial parietal (e.g., precuneus, supramarginal) regions and had decreases in cortical thickness-age relationships in prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices. Data are cross-sectional and observational. Limited sample size precluded secondary analysis of comorbidities and demographics. In youth with GAD, a sub-set of symptoms not directly related to anxiety bridge anxiety and depression. Youth with greater depressive cluster burden had altered cortical thickness in cortical structures within the default mode and central executive networks. These alternations in cortical thickness may represent a distinct neurostructural fingerprint in anxious youth with early depressive symptoms. Finally, youth with GAD and high depressive symptoms had reduced age-cortical thickness correlations. The emergence of depressive symptoms in early GAD and cortical development may have bidirectional, neurobiological relationships.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33221716/"}

We used data from the Danish 'Life with a heart disease' survey, in which 10 000 patients with a hospital contact and discharge diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, heart valve disease, or atrial fibrillation in 2018 were invited. Potential participants received an electronic questionnaire including 51 questions on health, well-being, and evaluation of the health care system. Crosswalks between WHO-5/ASS-2 and HADS anxiety dimension (HADS-A) and between WHO-5/MDI-2 and HADS depression dimension (HADS-D) were generated and tested using item response theory (IRT). A total of 4346 patients responded to HADS, WHO-5, ASS-2, and MDI-2. Model fit of the bi-factor IRT models illustrated appropriateness of a bi-factor structure and thus of essential uni-dimensionality [root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (P value) range 0.000-0.053 (0.0099-0.7529) for anxiety and 0.033-0.061 (0.0168-0.2233) for depression]. A combination of WHO-5 and ASS-2 measured the same trait as HADS-A, and a combination of WHO-5 and MDI-2 measured the same trait as HADS-D.

After performing principal-component factor analysis, we carried out logistic regressions, in order to investigate differences in depressive symptoms between people with and without disabilities, and examine the factors affecting depressive symptoms for people with disabilities. People with disabilities in the UK were 2.8 times more likely to experience depressive symptoms compared to people without disabilities (95% C.I.: 2.51-3.05, p < .001), while in Greece, they were 2.2 times more likely to do so (95% C.I.: 1.90-2.64, p < .001). Our findings regarding people with disabilities showed that women, older people (in Greece), unemployed and inactive people (in Greece), and better-educated people (in the UK) were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Married people, older people (in the UK), people living in densely-populated areas (in Greece), people who assessed their health as 'average' or 'good', and people who enjoyed social support (in Greece) were less likely to face depressive symptoms.

A convenience sample of 70 cancer patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was screened for DD using an abbreviated version of the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SCID) and for depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Demographic, psychosocial, psychiatric, and physical health characteristics were also assessed, along with past treatments for colon cancer. Bivariate and multivariate analyses identified predictors of DD and symptoms. The 1-month prevalence of DD was 30.0% (12.9% major depression, 5.7% minor depression, and 11.4% for dysthymia) and significant depressive symptoms were present in 57.1% (HDRS 8 or higher), including having persistent suicidal thoughts for 2 weeks or longer wthin the past month (14.3%) . Low social support and having a co-morbid psychiatric illness (particularly anxiety) independently predicted DD based on the SCID. Saudi nationality, poor financial situation, low social support, and co-morbid psychiatric illness independently predicted depressive symptoms on the HDRS. Surprisingly, stage of cancer, duration of cancer, and treatments for cancer were unrelated to DD or depressive symptoms. DD and significant depressive symptoms are common in patients with colon cancer in Saudi Arabia, and are predicted by a distinct set of demographic and psychosocial risk factors that may help with identification.

An online survey was disseminated to CMP users registered with a Canadian licensed producer. Respondents completed demographic and validated self-report questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, MINI-SPIN, and panic disorder/agoraphobia DSM-5 criteria). Cannabis use behaviors were also discussed. Overall, 2032 completed responses with a verified user number were collected. Of the total sample, 888 (43.7%) reported CMP authorization to treat anxiety symptoms and completed all psychometric screening instruments. Rates of probable disorders were high (Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 45.6%, Social Anxiety Disorder: 42.4%, Major Depressive Disorder: 25.7%, Panic Disorder/Agoraphobia: 25.7%); 63.4% met screening criteria for ≥1 disorder. Most (92%) reported that cannabis improved their symptoms, despite continuing to endorse moderate-level severity. Nearly half (49%) reported replacing a non-psychiatric (53.7%) or psychiatric medication (46.3%) prescribed to them by their physician with CMP. Respondents endorsed daily CMP use and severity of anxiety (GAD-7, p < 0.001) and depressive (PHQ-9, p < 0.001) symptoms were positively associated with the amount of cannabis used/day. The vast majority perceived symptom improvement with CMP use and did not believe CMP use was associated with impairment or an inability to control use.

The 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing provided data from employed individuals reporting lifetime major depression with 12-month symptoms (N=320). Survey adjusted multivariable logistic regression assessed classification of 12-month, depression-related presenteeism on the basis of socio-demographic, financial, work and health factors. Acceptable classification of cases was 70% or greater. Classification of cases based on socio-demographic factors, age, sex and marital status, was reasonable (62%). Adding work factors (work hours and occupation type) produced a 1% increase in successfully classified cases (63%). Health factors further increased correctly classified cases (67%). Marital status, housing tenure and co-morbid mental disorders were important indicators of presenteeism behavior. Work-related variables were restricted to available measures. Potentially important psychosocial work environment factors were unavailable. Cross-sectional data precluded causal inference.

The bifactor model comprised of 2 general factors-self-compassion and self-coldness-and 6 specific factors demonstrated the best fit to the data. Results also indicated the Self-Coldness factor accounted for unique variance in depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas the Self-Compassion factor only accounted for unique variance in its association with depression, providing further evidence for the presence of 2 distinct factors. Results did not provide support for the 1-factor composition of self-compassion currently used in research. Implications for using, scoring, and interpreting the SCS are discussed.

Impaired social support is also considered an important predictor of coronary heart disease prognosis and, as there is a complex interplay between social isolation and depression, interventions to address both may be required. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions addressing both depression and social support for people with coronary heart disease and depression. PRISMA guidelines were used to search major health databases to identify randomised controlled trials that evaluated psychosocial interventions compared with usual care in patients with coronary heart disease and depression; the primary outcome was depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes were mortality (all-cause and cardiac), myocardial infarction, revascularisation, anxiety, social support and quality of life. Data, when suitable, were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Five studies (n=1358 participants) were eligible and included. The psychosocial intervention group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.27 to -0.03; P=0.02) and higher levels of social support (SMD 0.17; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30; P=0.01) but no differences were found for mortality (all-cause and cardiac), myocardial infarction, revascularisation, anxiety or quality of life. Psychosocial interventions for patients with coronary heart disease and depression result in modest reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in social support. However, caution is warranted in view of the small number of studies included in the review and potential heterogeneity in outcomes and in differences in treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26475227/"}

Can we reliably distinguish one from the other? Are the boundaries of illness and disorder really so distinct? If not, how can we know that treatment of 'depression' with Prozac in any given instance constitutes a cosmetic as opposed to, say, a medical or clinical use of psychopharmacology - a distinction that seems to turn on our ability to clearly differentiate the clinical from the cosmetic. If we cannot reliably distinguish between such conditions, can we even have a cosmetic psychopharmacology that is not a form of malpractice, broadly speaking? What if we unplugged Prozac from all the amplitude and hype that resulted in Listening to Prozac becoming an instant best-seller and simply asked whether or not we can clearly distinguish an appropriate cosmetic use of Prozac for 'depression' from an inappropriate cosmetic use of Prozac, and both of those from Prozac's appropriate clinical, that is, non-cosmetic uses?

However, little is known about the neurobiological correlates of anxious distress in MDD. We probed the relation between the DSM-5 ADS and task-related reactivity to emotional faces, as well as resting-state functional connectivity patterns of intrinsic salience and basal ganglia networks in unmedicated MDD patients with (MDD/ADS+, N = 24) and without ADS (MDD/ADS-, N = 48) and healthy controls (HC, N = 59). Both categorical and dimensional measures of ADS were investigated. MDD/ADS+ patients had higher left amygdala responses to emotional faces compared to MDD/ADS- patients (p = .015)-part of a larger striato-limbic cluster. MDD/ADS+ did not differ from MDD/ADS- or controls in resting-state functional connectivity of the salience or basal ganglia networks. Current findings suggest that amygdala and striato-limbic hyperactivity to emotional faces may be a neurobiological hallmark specific to MDD with anxious distress, relative to MDD without anxious distress.

The aim of this qualitative research was to gather young people's experiences of depression stigma and its impact on loneliness, social isolation, and mental health disclosure and secrecy. This novel information can then be used to guide psychosocial interventions for young people with depression. This qualitative study included N = 28 young people aged 18-25 years (Mage = 21.30). Participants were recruited from the community who had high symptoms of depression (assessed through a pre-screen using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) with a benchmark score > 27) or had been recently diagnosed with depression by a medical professional. Semi-structured interviews were based on conceptual model drawings created by participants and analyzed using thematic analysis. Four main themes emerged: 1) Depression secrecy: positive and negative aspects; 2) Depression disclosure: positive and negative aspects; 3) The solution is selective disclosure; and 4) Participants' recommendations do not align with personal preferences. In particular, the young people described non-disclosure as a way to be in control, but that secrecy prevented authentic engagement with others. Young people also described disclosure as eliciting more stigma but as necessary to gain help. Finally, the young people described struggling with knowing how much to disclose in relation to their mental health and with whom they could disclose. This study provides new evidence of how young people with depression experience stigma and its effects on disclosure and mental health secrecy. Knowing how young people struggle with these issues can allow us to develop interventions to encourage them to come forward and discuss their mental health in order to receive appropriate support and treatment. We recommend young people be signposted and have access to mental health champions or nominated teachers in their schools or universities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38180968/"}

We hypothesized that deletion of RGS2 would enhance nicotine-induced anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects, which were assessed using the elevated plus maze and tail suspension tests, respectively. Anxiolytic-like effects were observed in both RGS2 WT and KO mice after administration of low dose of nicotine (0.05 mg/kg, base) compared to respective saline controls. Additionally, administration of nicotine (0.1 mg/kg, base) compared to saline resulted in anxiolytic-like effects in RGS2 KO mice, but not RGS2 WT mice, suggesting genetic deletion of RGS2 facilitated anxiolytic-like effects of nicotine. Administration of nicotine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, base) compared to saline resulted in antidepressant-like effects in RGS2 WT mice. Antidepressant-like effects were observed in RGS2 KO mice only at the highest tested dose of nicotine (1 mg/kg, base) compared to saline controls, suggesting that genetic deletion of RGS2 decreased sensitivity to antidepressant-like effects of nicotine. Together, the data suggest that RGS2 differentially regulated nicotine-induced affective behavioral responses.

In this cross-sectional postal survey, cancer survivors were recruited through 2 regional cancer registries in Germany. Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were assessed. Survivor data were compared to age- and gender-matched comparison groups (CG) randomly drawn from large representative samples (N > 5,000). Out of 2,001 eligible patients, 46% participated (n = 922). Survivors were significantly more likely than the CG to report elevated depressive (relative risk [RR] = 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2-4.3) and anxious symptomatology (RR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3). Depression scores remained high even in the survivor Group 12-26 years after diagnosis. RR for anxiety decreased to values comparable to the CG. Younger and middle-aged survivors (≤65 years) were at highest relative and absolute risk to be psychologically impaired.

The questionnaire was sent to 885 male workers in a large industrial company and its related companies, and the consultation cases were 84 male workers coming from the area where the questionnaire survey was conducted. The work problem questionnaire was factored and the four work factors that were obtained were used in the succeeding analyses. The results of the questionnaire survey showed that depression had a higher multiple correlation with the four work factors than did the state anxiety. Similarly, the consultation cases, in which the main symptom was depression, accounted for a little more than 40% of all cases, but the anxiety cases accounted for only 10%-20%. Both studies indicated that depression is a more important manifestation of work stress than anxiety. The questionnaire survey also showed that the \"quality-of-work\" factor and the \"work-quantity/environment\" factor had relatively high standardized partial regression coefficients, when depression was predicted by the four work factors. In the case of the consultation cases, more than 50% of the depressive cases were caused by overload.

Predictors of change in positive anxiety and depressive symptom screens (based on exceeding validated symptom threshold scores) were identified using logistic regression. Increased university connectedness reduced the odds of emergent significant depressive and anxiety symptoms in healthy students and increased the odds of recovery in students who screened positive at the start of university. Students who screened positive for depression or anxiety at university entry were less likely to recover if they had a lifetime history of internalising disorders. Healthy students who increased their drug use over their first year had higher odds of developing significant levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms by completion of the academic year. Moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among students at entry to university and persist over the first year.

The relationship between TRD and psychological well-being (PWB) appears to be more complex than a simple antithesis. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-tolerated treatment for TRD. However successful, a drawback for TMS is that it has a lack of predictive biomarkers for treatment response. Our study focuses on the relationship between PWB and treatment resistant depression, and how PWB relates to TMS treatment response. We hypothesized that TMS treatment responders would have higher levels of PWB at baseline. In this study of 21 patients with TRD, we used the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-Being and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We found a significant relationship between environmental mastery, purpose in life, self-acceptance, and total PWB with baseline depression but no significant correlation between autonomy, personal growth, and positive relations with others and baseline PHQ-9 scores. No Ryff domain of PWB significantly predicted change in PHQ-9 score.

We calculated greenness within walking distance of home addresses as the maximum NDVI for the year of each participant interview averaged within a 1 km buffer. Reflecting clinical criteria, a score of ≥5 on the CIDI-SF indicated major depression in the preceding 12-months. We characterized climate using Köppen-Geiger classifications. To estimate prevalence ratios, we used Poisson regression. Our models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, geography, annual sunshine, and bluespace.

We evaluated the relationship between insomnia symptom severity and the clinical, economic, and patient-centric burden among community-dwelling individuals with MDD. Respondents with diagnosed depression who reported insomnia symptoms in the past 12 months (N = 4402) were identified from the 2019 United States National Health and Wellness Survey. Multivariable analyses assessed the association of Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) with health-related outcomes while controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics. Further analyses also controlled for depression severity (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire). Mean ISI score was 14.3 ± 5.6. Higher ISI was associated with greater depression severity (r = .51, p < .001). After adjustments, a one-standard deviation (5.6-point) increase in ISI score was significantly associated with higher depression (rate ratio [RR] = 1.36), anxiety (RR = 1.33) and daytime sleepiness (RR = 1.16) levels, more healthcare provider (RR = 1.13) and emergency room visits (RR = 1.31), hospitalizations (RR = 1.21), work productivity and activity impairment (RRs = 1.27 and 1.23, respectively), and poorer mental and physical health-related quality of life (β = -3.853 and -1.999, respectively) (p < .001). These findings remained statistically significant when controlling for concurrent depression severity. In adults with MDD, greater insomnia symptom severity is associated with worse health-related outcomes, which suggests the importance of addressing insomnia symptoms as a clinical target for treating MDD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37435894/"}

When questioned by their health practitioner about their emotional wellbeing in the perinatal period, 20.7% of women indicated they had not always responded honestly. Reasons for not being honest reflected four main themes: normalizing of symptoms/coping; negative perceptions (self-and others); fear of adverse repercussions; and fear of involvement of health services (trust and confidentiality). The 38.9% of women who did not feel comfortable when questioned by their health practitioner about their emotional wellbeing were four times more likely to report perinatal depression (odds ratio = 4.09; 95% confidence interval = 2.55, 6.57) and nearly twice as likely to report perinatal anxiety (odds ratio = 1.90; 95% confidence interval = 1.24, 2.94) than other women. Women who are most likely to need mental health care during the perinatal period are also those least likely to be honest about their mental health.

To that end, we tested models to determine mediators between problems with marijuana use (via Marijuana Problem Scale), stress (via Early Life Stress Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale), and negative affect (via Beck Depression Inventory; Beck Anxiety Inventory) in 157 current heavy marijuana users. Mediation tests and bootstrap confidence intervals were carried out via the \"Mediation\" package in R. Depression and anxiety scores both significantly mediated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic marijuana use. Only depression significantly mediated the relationship between early life stress and problematic marijuana use. Early life stress, perceived stress and problematic marijuana use were significant only as independent variables and dependent variables. These findings demonstrate that (1) depression mediated both early life stress and perceived stress, and problematic marijuana use, and, (2) anxiety mediated perceived stress and problematic marijuana use. This mediation analysis represents a strong first step toward understanding the relationship between these variables; however, longitudinal studies are needed to determine causality between these variables.

Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected, and their levels of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Our findings indicated that heroin users exhibited higher levels of anxiety and depression, but the heroin use-associated left uncinate fasciculus was only related to their anxiety level, suggesting that association between heroin and anxiety has an incremental organic basis but that for depression could be a threshold issue.

The bifactor model fits the data significantly better than both the original bidimensional model and Dunbar's higher-order three-factor model. These results, from a large international sample of patients with IHD, suggest that the HADS scale is dominated by a single general distress factor. Although the best CFA model fit was a hierarchical bifactor solution, the subscales had weak item loadings, providing little psychometric evidence of the ability of the HADS to differentiate anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Penny George Institute for Health and Healing, Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN. A total of 40 actively working healthcare professionals age 18-65 years. RT is an eight-week mindfulness-based program that synergizes elements of mindfulness meditation with nutrition and exercise. The first 20 consecutive individuals meeting all eligibility criteria were assigned to the RT group. The next 20 consecutive eligible individuals were placed into the wait-list control group and had an eight-week waiting period before starting the RT program. Psychological/behavioral outcomes were measured before and after completion of the RT program and two months after completion. Wait-list participants also had measures taken just before starting on the wait-list. The RT group exhibited a 63-70% (P ≤ .01) reduction in depression, a 48% (P ≤ .01) reduction in stress, a 23% (P ≤ .01) reduction in trait anxiety, and a 52% (P ≤ .01) reduction in presenteeism (a per-employee savings of $1846 over the eight-week program).

However, studies examining the associations between maternal distress and the development of attention in infancy are few. This study investigated the longitudinal relationships between maternal distress (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and exposure to childhood trauma) and the development of focused attention in infancy in 118 mother-infant dyads. We found that maternal exposure to non-interpersonal traumatic events in childhood was associated with the less focused attention of the infants to audio-visual stimuli at 6, 10, and 18 months. In addition, exposure to interpersonal traumatic events in childhood was identified as a moderator of the negative effect of maternal anxiety during the 2nd trimester on the development of focused attention in infants. We discuss the possible mechanisms accounting for these cross-generational effects. Our findings underscore the importance of maternal mental health to the development of focused attention in infancy and address the need for early screening of maternal mental health during pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921204/"}

We determined the prevalence of infidelity-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among unmarried adults who experienced a partner's infidelity and whether probable infidelity-related PTSD was associated with additional psychological health outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety symptoms). We also investigated whether negative post-traumatic cognitions mediated the associations between infidelity-related PTSD symptoms and psychological health.

Controlling for gender, race, and exposure to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders Criterion A traumas, 45.2% of our sample reported symptoms suggesting probable infidelity-related PTSD. Whether used as continuous or categorical predictor, infidelity-related PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with depressive symptoms, although results for perceived stress and anxiety symptoms were mixed. Post-traumatic cognitions acted as a partial mediator for depressive symptoms and full mediator for perceived stress and anxiety symptoms. This empirical evidence suggests that infidelity may produce PTSD symptoms at a relatively high rate, even in unmarried young adults, and may put individuals at risk for poorer psychological health, partially through post-traumatic cognitions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31199042/"}

With the purpose of gathering and summarizing the main findings of studies using animal models of sepsis-induced psychiatric symptoms, we performed a systematic review of the literature on this topic. Thus, 140 references were reviewed, and most of the published studies suggested a time-dependent recovery from behavior alterations, despite the fact that some molecular alterations persist in the brain.

However, it remains unclear whether the degrees of genetic correlations between adjustment disorder and other psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes are similar or different to those between MDD, anxiety disorders or risk-tolerant personality and these other psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes. To compare patterns of genetic correlations, we utilized large-scale genome-wide association study summary statistics for adjustment disorder-related disorders and personality trait, eleven other psychiatric disorders and fifteen intermediate phenotypes. Adjustment disorder had highly positive genetic correlations with MDD, anxiety disorders, and risk-tolerant personality. Among other psychiatric disorders, adjustment disorder, MDD, anxiety disorders and risk-tolerant personality were positively correlated with risks for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), SCZ + BD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and cross disorders. In contrast, adjustment disorder was not significantly correlated with risks for obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, or posttraumatic stress disorder despite significant genetic correlations of MDD or anxiety disorders with these disorders. Among intermediate phenotypes, adjustment disorder, MDD, anxiety disorders, and risk-tolerant personality commonly had a younger age at first sexual intercourse, first birth, and menopause, lower cognitive ability, and higher rate of smoking initiation. Adjustment disorder was not genetically correlated with extraversion, although the related disorder and personality were correlated with extraversion. Only adjustment disorder was correlated with a higher smoking quantity.

All respondents provided data on 26 indicators of psychosocial employment quality drawn from the Job-Strain Model, other job stressors, and indicators of working time stressors (i.e., shift work, night work, and long working hours). We performed 272 statistical tests, of which 37 were significant following adjustment for age, poor socio-economic position during childhood, unemployment status at wave one, and anxiety or depression at wave two. Females with a lifetime diagnosis of any mental illness reported higher psychological and emotional demands at work, whilst males reported low decision latitude, tensions with the public, and work-life imbalance. In both genders a lifetime diagnosis of any mental illness was associated with role and ethical conflict. A lifetime diagnosis of major depression appeared to have stronger associations for females, whilst substance use disorder was associated with poorer psychosocial employment quality in males. Adolescent-onset mental illness might be associated with poorer psychosocial employment quality among men more so than among women. Results suggest that people with a history of mental illness who obtain employment tend to be employed in jobs characterized by poor psychosocial quality.

Recently, the overlap with anxiety disorders is frequently observed. The study was aimed at evaluating a relationship between trait-anxiety and symptoms of PPND, in order to highlight trait-anxiety in onset of depressive syndrome. A total number 79 participants have been recruited by convenience sampling method. Partners of pregnant women at the second trimester of pregnancy (17 ÷ 21 weeks of gestation) were consecutively recruited. At baseline, in 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and at 2nd months after childbirth, the psychiatric interview and socio-demographic data collection, were carried out and all subjects completed a self-administered STAI questionnaire. In postpartum period, the subjects completed the screening for postpartum depressive symptoms with PDSS scale. Severity of \"Anxiety proneness,\" assessed by STAI-Y, was \"moderate in total sample (mean 58.7 ± 4.2). All fathers reported scores in clinical range, with one subject (1.3%) described as \"mild,\" 56 \"moderate\" (70.9%), and 22 \"severe\" (27.8%). For symptoms of PPND, considering total sample, severity of depressive symptoms, was at the upper normal limit (mean score ± S.D. = 59.2 ± 33.1) and according to cutoff, in 35 subjects \"normal adjustment\" (44.3%), \"significant symptoms\" (13.9%) and \"positive\" in 33 (41.8%).

One hundred and thirty four patients completed a battery of questionnaires including measures of neuroticism, worry, rumination (brooding and reflection), anxiety and depression. Multiple mediation analyses indicate that worry may act as a mediating mechanism linking neuroticism and anxiety symptoms in the three diagnostic groups, whereas brooding-rumination may play a mediating role between neuroticism and depressive symptoms in patients with MDD and MADD and, with less certainty, in patients with GAD. Overall, our findings suggest that neuroticism may increase the risk of anxious and depressive symptoms via specific links involving either worry or brooding, respectively, and that both worry and brooding may operate in the three groups examined, irrespectively of whether anxiety or depression are the main emotions or whether they coexist without any clear predominance; consequently, we hypothesize the existence of \"specific transdiagnostic\" mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27243462/"}

We found that 37.7% of the women in this community sample scored above the cutpoint of 12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; prenatal depressive and somatic symptoms, as well as marital quality, were the best predictors of postpartum depressive symptomatology. An examination of differing trajectories from pregnancy to the postpartum period suggests that women with relatively few somatic complaints, low levels of perinatal stress, and satisfactory marital relations were less likely to exhibit mental health problems during pregnancy and postpartum. Women who were not depressed prenatally but reported postpartum depressive symptomatology exhibited several predisposing risk factors during pregnancy: many somatic complaints, high perinatal anxiety, and premigration stress. Women who were depressed during pregnancy but not postpartum reported improved physical function after childbirth.

We will first carry out a multi-site randomized pragmatic clinical trial (N = 1500) of students seeking treatment at student mental health clinics in participating universities or responding to an email offering services. Students on wait lists for clinic services will be randomized to unguided iCBT (33%), guided iCBT (33%), and treatment as usual (TAU) (33%). iCBT will be provided immediately whereas TAU will be whenever a clinic appointment is available. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 90 days and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will use ensemble machine learning to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of unguided versus guided iCBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to optimize individual student outcome. We will then conduct a second and third trial with separate samples (n = 500 per arm), but with unequal allocation across two arms: 25% will be assigned to the treatment determined to yield optimal outcomes based on the PTR developed in the first trial (PTR for optimal short-term outcomes for Trial 2 and 12-month outcomes for Trial 3), whereas the remaining 75% will be assigned with equal allocation across all three treatment arms. By collecting comprehensive baseline characteristics to evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effects, we will provide valuable and innovative information to optimize treatment effects and guide university mental health treatment planning.

The present work aimed to address this gap by assessing depression and anxiety symptoms at four measurement points during a season using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener. The study involved N = 204 youth and professional soccer players (79 % male, M<sub>age</sub> = 16.13, SD<sub>age</sub> = 4.17) of a German Bundesliga club. Over the study period, several players reported experiencing depressive (12.7 %) and anxiety symptoms (15.6 %) exceeding clinical thresholds at least once. Further analyses revealed significant fluctuations in mental health over the season. Depressive symptoms showed a linear increase, possibly indicating the taxing nature of a soccer season. Anxiety symptoms showed a moderate increase at the beginning of the second half of the season and decreased as the season progressed towards its end. Further, female players reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms compared to male players. Regarding the stability of symptoms across the competitive season, the variance decomposition of latent-state-trait models revealed that the stable components (i.e., the consistent characteristics that remain stable over time) were larger than the unstable components (i.e., the measurement-dependent differences that change depending on the time point).

Therefore, data from the population-representative Gutenberg COVID-19 cohort, collected between October 2020 and April 2021, in the city of Mainz and the County of Mainz-Bingen, Germany, were used. Out of the whole cohort, people living with children in the household were included (N = 2,043). Feeling burdened by care work and mental health outcomes were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. Descriptive analyses and multilinear regression analyses were performed. Results showed that feeling burdened by care work was more likely for women than for men. For men, feeling burdened by care work was significantly associated with depressiveness, anxiety, and somatization. For women, difficulties with child raising were associated with depressiveness. Part-time working men and women did not differ with respect to mental health or care work burden, whereas unemployed and full-time working women showed significantly worse mental health and reported more burden of care than unemployed and full-time working men. Hence, this study showed gender inequalities. For women, worsening external conditions for childcare appeared to be a risk factor. Men with care work responsibilities seem to benefit, concerning their mental health, from full-time paid work. The data underscore the importance of mitigating the burden of care work, especially to improve conditions for women and part-time workers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40695939/"}

To elucidate the relationship between empathy and stress, we established a chronic stress contagion (SC) procedure combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to investigate (1) whether depressive rats show impaired empathy-like behavior toward fearful conspecifics, (2) whether frequent social contact with normal familiar conspecifics (social support) alleviates the negative effects of CUMS, and (3) the effect of long-term exposure to a depressed partner on emotional and empathic responses in normal rats. We found that the CUMS group showed less empathy-like behavior in the social transfer of fear model (STFM), as indicated by less social interaction with the demonstrator and reduced freezing behavior in the fear-expression test. Social contact partially alleviated depression-like behaviors and the negative effect of CUMS in the fear-transfer test. The normal rats who experienced stress contagion from daily exposure to a depressed partner for 3 weeks showed lower anxiety and increased social response in the fear-transfer test than the control group. We concluded that chronic stress impairs empathy-like behaviors, while social contact partially buffers the effect of CUMS. Thus, social contact or contagion of stress is mutually beneficial to both stressed individuals and nonstressed partners. Higher dopamine and lower norepinephrine levels in the basolateral amygdala probably contributed to these beneficial effects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36899132/"}

Here, 19 untreated patients (9 males, 10 females) suffering from primary aldosteronism were investigated using sleep EEG and several rating scales for anxiety, depression, quality of life and sleep before starting specific treatment. Parameters were compared to age and sex matched healthy controls and patients with depression and correlated with laboratory findings and blood pressure. Patients had higher values for anxiety and depression compared to the general population, although a psychiatric disorder in their history was ruled out. Although sleep disturbances were reported in the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, sleep EEG did not show significant changes between patients and healthy controls. No depression specific pattern in sleep EEG was found. But in contrast to females, several sleep-EEG parameters of male PA patients differed significantly from patients with depression.

In addition to descriptive statistics and intercorrelations, structural equation modelling was used to compare three models of the potential role (predictor or moderator/mediator) that the three abovementioned COVID-19-related variables could play in psychological wellbeing. The results showed high levels of psychological distress among the current sample. Generally, better knowledge of COVID-19 and engaging in protective behaviours were found to be related to lower levels of psychological distress, whereas increased risk perception was found to be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression.

In this quasi-experimental study, we evaluate the effect of a living wage intervention on depressive symptoms of apparel factory workers in the Dominican Republic. Two apparel factories in the Dominican Republic. The final sample consisted of 204 hourly wage workers from the intervention (99) and comparison (105) factories. In 2010, an apparel factory began a living wage intervention including a 350% wage increase and significant workplace improvements. The wage increase was plausibly exogenous because workers were not aware of the living wage when applying for jobs and expected to be paid the usual minimum wage. These individuals were compared with workers at a similar local factory paying minimum wage, 15-16 months postintervention. Workers' depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Ordinary least squares and Poisson regressions were used to evaluate treatment effect of the intervention, adjusted for covariates. Intervention factory workers had fewer depressive symptoms than comparison factory workers (unadjusted mean CES-D scores: 10.6 ± 9.3 vs 14.7 ± 11.6, p = 0.007). These results were sustained when controlling for covariates (β = -5.4, 95% CI -8.5 to -2.3, p = 0.001). In adjusted analyses using the standard CES-D clinical cut-off of 16, workers at the intervention factory had a 47% reduced risk of clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms compared with workers at the comparison factory (23% vs 40%). Policymakers have long grappled with how best to improve mental health among populations in low-income and middle-income countries.

The associations of cumulative ACEs with depression and anxiety among 104,205 children and adolescents were assessed via multivariable logistic regression, including adjustment for age, sex, race, household income, and parental educational attainment. ACEs were associated with depression and anxiety in a linear, dose-dependent manner. After adjustment for covariates, compared to no ACE exposures, participants with exposures to one, two, and three ACEs exhibited significantly higher odds of depression (fully-adjusted ORs and 95 % CIs = 2.18 [2.03, 2.35], 4.95 [4.55, 5.39], and 11.39 [10.18, 12.75], respectively).

This systematic review aims to describe, evaluate and synthesize the acceptability and potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for the psychological well-being of people with advanced cancers. Eight databases were searched and terms related to advanced stages of cancer and mindfulness were combined systematically to identify relevant published literature.

There was considerable variety in the MBI treatment packages including in the extent and centrality of mindfulness in the interventions. Of 312 identified studies, only 8 included MBIs for people with advanced cancer rather than their families or carers. Results from these studies suggests that MBIs are acceptable and beneficial to the advanced cancer population, improving quality of life, use of mindfulness skills, acceptance of their cancer situation and reduction in depression and anxiety. Some adaptations were recommended however regarding delivery, simplified briefer MBIs, abbreviated session time, flexibility concerning locality of treatment and a minimized questionnaire burden for this group. MBI packages reviewed in this study had evidence of acceptability and of effectiveness, indicating potential benefit for this population.

Validity and internal consistency were tested by confirmatory factor analysis, including tests of factorial invariance over time. As an overall assessment, the results showed that the composite measures (based on more than 30-year-old single item questions) are likely to have acceptable factorial invariance as well as internal consistency over time. Testing the properties of the mental health measures used in older studies according to the standards of today is of great importance in longitudinal research. Our study demonstrates that composite measures of mental health problems can be constructed from single items which are more than 30 years old and that these measures seem to have the same factorial structure and internal consistency across a significant part of the life course. Thus, it can be possible to overcome some specific inherent methodological challenges in using historical data in longitudinal research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26743433/"}

The current study investigated differences in safety behavior subtype use in 132 individuals with principal diagnoses of social anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 69), major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 30), and nonpatient controls (n = 33) across two social contexts: an interpersonal relationship-building task (social affiliation) and a speech task (social performance). We examined whether diagnostic groups differed in safety behavior subtype use and whether group differences varied by social context. We also explored relationships between avoidance and impression management safety behaviors, respectively, and positive and negative valence affective and behavioral outcomes within the social affiliation and social performance contexts. Safety behavior use varied by diagnosis (SAD > MDD > nonpatient controls). The effect of diagnosis on impression management safety behavior use depended on social context: use was comparable for the principal SAD and MDD groups in the social performance context, whereas the SAD group used more impression management safety behaviors than the MDD group in the social affiliation context. Greater use of avoidance safety behaviors related to higher negative affect and anxious behaviors, and lower positive affect and approach behaviors across contexts. Impression management safety behaviors were most strongly associated with higher positive affect and approach behaviors within the social performance context. These findings underscore the potential value of assessing safety behavior subtypes across different contexts and within major depression, in addition to SAD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088511/"}

The data utilized for AA analysis were sourced from the FinnGen release 9 databases, including 682 cases and 361,822 controls. Summary statistics for major depression disorder (MDD) were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis dataset, incorporating 170,756 cases and 329,443 controls. The anxiety disorder data was conducted by the Anxiety Neuro Genetics Study Consortium, including 5580 cases and 11,730 controls. We employed four distinct approaches, including MR-Egger, weighted median, random-effect inverse variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode, to conduct the MR analysis. Genetic liability to AA was associated with an increased risk of Major depression disorder (MDD) and anxiety demonstrated an odds ratio (OR) of 1.01 (βivw = 0.011, PIVW = 0.023) and OR of 1.16 (βivw = 0.150, PIVW = 0.002).

In the context of a larger study on child protection outcomes in refugee settings, researchers explored the relationship between caregiver depression and adolescent mental health in two refugee settlements, Kiryandongo and Adjumani, in Uganda. Adolescents between 13 and 17 and their caregivers participated in a household survey, which included measures of adolescent anxiety and depression, and caregiver depression. Analysis was conducted using multiple logistic regression models, and results were reported for the full sample and for each site separately. In Kiryandongo, a one-unit increase in a caregiver's depression score tripled the odds that the adolescent would have high levels of anxiety symptoms (AOR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.1), while in Adjumani, caregiver depression did not remain significant in the final model. Caregiver depression, gender and exposure to violence were all associated with higher symptoms of adolescent depression in both sites and the full sample, for example, a one unit increase in caregiver depression more than tripled the odds of higher levels of symptoms of adolescent depression (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI: 2.0, 6.2). Caregiver depression is a consistently significantly associated with adverse mental health outcomes for adolescents in this study. Adolescent well-being is significantly affected by caregiver mental health in this refugee context.

In the BELLA study, the mental health module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a representative sample of young people aged 7-17 years was enrolled. Depressiveness, assessed by the CES-DC, as well as other mental health problems were examined in the context of risk and protective factors. Depressive symptoms showed high prevalence in parent- and self-reports. Higher depression scores were found in those with a high number of psychosocial risks existing in the family, and they decreased as the number of protective factors the children and adolescents had at their disposal increased. Although only half of the boys and girls with high depression scores were regarded as significantly impaired, all of them had a much higher risk for additional mental health problems. Furthermore, their health-related quality of life was limited compared to their peers who had low depression scores. To differentiate between clinically significant depression and milder forms, it is necessary to take into account the different perspectives of children and their parents.

The mechanisms underlying rumination are examined, and a model (H-EX-A-GO-N - Habit development, EXecutive control, Abstract processing, GOal discrepancies, Negative bias) is proposed to account for the onset and maintenance of rumination. H-EX-A-GO-N outlines how rumination results from dwelling on problematic goals developing into a learnt habit that involves the tendency to process negative information in an abstract way, particularly in the context of poor executive control and negative information-processing biases. These proximal factors integrate experimental evidence to provide a partial answer to the critical question of what maintains rumination.

However, despite the significant amount of work and sophisticated technology is not fully elucidated which genes or regions of nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, or which types of genetic changes, alone or in combination, can represent reliable genetic markers of anxiety and/or depression. To identify whether there are genetic changes that can cause depression or anxiety and if there are genetic markers that can be used to detect these changes. A systematic review of 01.01.2004 to 03.28.2014 was held by VHL (Virtual Health Library). The search was performed with the descriptors ׳׳anxiety׳׳, ׳׳depression׳׳, \"mutation\" and \"genetic markers׳׳. The selected articles were indexed in MEDLINE. The information pertinent to the study was selected, categorized and analyzed. Of the 374 articles found, 29 met the eligibility criteria. FMR1 gene polymorphisms, dopaminergic (DAT, DRD, COMT), serotonin (5-HTTLPR, HTR1A, HTR2A), interleukins, MCR1, HCN (potassium channel), neurorregulinas, GABAergic (GABA, GAD, DBI) DBI, GABA (Gabra) receptors and GAD genes (GAD1, GAD2) appear to contribute to generate condition of depression or anxiety like. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA in 124pb allele of D2S2944 in ofil 1 and 2 loci of chromosomes 4 and 7, respectively, and the chromosomes 8p, 17p and 15q appear to be associated with the origin of depression or anxiety. Some studies show only associations with one of the disorders, mainly anxiety. Few have shown association with both simultaneously. Other studies showed specific association of gender, or even specific ethnic groups. It was noticed, controversies over certain markers. Interesting results were observed in combination of changes, especially in cases of SNPs, indicating that perhaps this is the most appropriate way to find reliable markers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25106036/"}

However, when it comes to maternal mental health during pregnancy, the last examination in Lebanon dates far back to 2005. Our study's aim was to help delineate the factors associated with Lebanese women's mental health disorders during pregnancy, namely antepartum depression and anxiety. We launched a cross-sectional study among Lebanese pregnant women (age ≥ 18 years) between June and July 2021, during the COVID-19 lockdown (N = 433). In total, 87.8% of the participants experienced depression (mild to severe), where severe depression was observed in 7.9%. In addition, 70.3% had a significant level of anxiety. Increased pregnancy-specific hassles (beta = 0.93), being Muslim compared to Christians (beta = 3.19), being afraid of an existing aggressor (beta = 8.75), urinary tract infections (beta = 2.02), and higher gestational age (beta = 0.07) were significantly associated with higher depression, whereas higher physical activity index (beta =  - 0.09) and increased disordered eating attitudes during pregnancy (beta =  - 0.27) were significantly associated with less depression, all accounting for 60.4% of the model's variance. Additionally, increased pregnancy-specific hassles (beta = 0.54), being Muslim compared to Christians (beta = 2.42), urinary tract infections (beta = 1.72), and having been emotionally or physically abused (beta = 1.19) were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and could predict 49% of the total variance. Our study has suggested the existence of factors that have additive effects in potentiating the risk for depression and anxiety among Lebanese pregnant women, namely cultural beliefs, pregnancy-related distress, medical complications during pregnancy, and a history of abuse. Therefore, it would be judicious to implement screening programs targeting pregnant women at risk for antepartum depression and anxiety. In addition, high rates of prenatal depression and anxiety were detected among our sample, supporting that recognizing and treating maternal mental health disorders should be prioritized during antenatal care in Lebanon.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37081286/"}

Adults with ≥ 2 claims with depression diagnosis codes identified from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database were invited to participate in this study linking survey data with retrospective claims data (12-mo presurvey and postsurvey periods). Patient surveys included measures for depression (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology), fatigue (Fatigue Associated with Depression Questionnaire), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), sleep difficulty (Athens Insomnia Scale), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory). After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics using propensity scores, postsurvey costs were compared between patients with and without fatigue using nonparametric bootstrapping methods. Of the 1982 patients who had completed the survey and had complete claims data, 653 patients had significant levels of fatigue. Patients with fatigue reported significantly higher scores, indicating greater severity, on measures of depression, pain, sleep difficulty, and anxiety (all p < 0.05). These patients also had higher levels of overall medication use and were more likely to have lower measures of socioeconomic status than patients without significant levels of fatigue (all p < 0.05). Mean annual total costs were greater for patients with fatigue than those without fatigue ($14,462 vs $9971, respectively, p < 0.001). These cost differences remained statistically significant after adjusting for clinical and demographic differences. Clinically significant fatigue appears to add to the economic burden of depression.

The course of depression was assessed in 2 follow-up years with a structured telephone interview based on the format of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Baseline severity of depressive symptoms was greatest in patients with double depression, but initial functional status was poor in those with dysthymia with or without concurrent major depression. Patients with dysthymia had the worst outcomes, those with current major depression alone had intermediate outcomes, and those with subthreshold depressive symptoms had the best outcomes. Even the latter group, however, had a high incidence (25%) of major depressive episode over 2 years. Initial depression severity and level of functional status accounted for more explained variance in outcomes than did type of depressive disorder. The findings emphasize the poor prognosis associated with dysthymia even in the absence of major depression; the prognostic significance of subthreshold depressive symptoms; and the clinical significance of assessing level of severity of symptoms as well as functional status and well-being, regardless of type of depressive disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1417431/"}

Hence, this study aimed to (1) assess the acceptance of IBIs in primary care patients with depressive symptoms and to (2) examine the effects of a brief acceptance facilitating intervention in the form of an informational video on patients' acceptance of IBIs. Primary care patients (N=128) with Minor or Major Depression were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG) or control group (CG). Patients in the IG were shown a brief informational video about IBIs before receiving a questionnaire that assessed their acceptance of IBIs and other secondary outcomes. Patients of the CG filled out the questionnaire immediately. Baseline acceptance of IBIs in the CG was high for 6.3%, moderate for 53.1% and low for 40.6% of patients. Acceptance of IBIs was significantly higher in the IG when compared to the CG (d=.71, 95%-CI:.09-2.91). Except for social influence and the general attitude towards psychological treatment, all secondary outcomes were also significantly improved (e.g. effort- (d=.40) and performance-expectancy: d=.65; knowledge about Internet interventions d=.35). Depression of the participants was only assessed using a self-report measure (PHQ-9). Primary care patients' acceptance of IBIs for depressive symptoms was low but could be increased significantly using a brief acceptance facilitating intervention on the basis of an informational video.

Underpinned by the conceptual model of selfhood, this meta-analytic review investigated the strength of associations of different facets of selfhood and their associated traits with depression and anxiety, moderating factors that attenuate or exacerbate these associations, and their causal influences. Using mixed-effects modeling, which included 558 effect sizes from 298 studies and 274 370 adolescents from 39 countries, our findings revealed that adolescents' self-esteem/self-concept [<i>r</i> = -0.518, <i>p</i> < 0.0001; (95% CI -0.49 to -0.547)] and self-compassion [<i>r</i> = -0.455, <i>p</i> < 0.0001; (95% CI -0.568 to -0.343)] demonstrating largest effect sizes in their associations with depression. Self-esteem/self-concept, self-compassion, self-awareness, self-efficacy, and self-regulation had similar moderate negative associations with anxiety. Meta-regressions revealed that adolescent age and type of informants (parents <i>v.</i> adolescents) were important moderators. Findings on causal influences indicated bidirectional causations, particularly low self-esteem/self-concept, self-awareness and self-efficacy drive higher depression and vice-versa. In contrast, the different self traits did not demonstrate specific causal direction with anxiety.

However, the effectiveness of mental health mobile applications for managing, moderating and treating anxiety and depression in CYP is uncertain. The purpose of this scoping review is to outline the extent of the clinical evidence base of mental health apps with monitoring functions for depression and anxiety in CYP, to categorise the range of monitoring features, to understand their various purposes, and to analyse these 'technical mechanisms' in apps from the perspective of critical ecological analysis. It provides a novel conceptual framework for researching how CYP may use and critically engage with mental health apps. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases, and 39 studies met the inclusion criteria. The analysis focuses attention on the ecological (mental, social and environmental) dimensions of life, health and emotional experience and the purposes of mental health monitoring apps. We evaluate the way that technical mechanisms, such as metrics are used in apps, examine their effects on responsibility for managing and treating distress and consider the rationalities that guide their development. The paper concludes that examination of the bioethics and neuroethics of these technologies is necessary and urgent. This requires paying closer attention to the social practices of technology-enabled self-monitoring, and the ways in which these frame mental health as a form of individualised emotional regulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35192989/"}

Participants from the UK-based GLAD and COPING NBR cohorts (N = 58,400) completed an online questionnaire between 2018 and 2020. Responses to detailed symptom reports were compared to DSM-5 criteria to generate symptom-based diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. Participants also self-reported any prior diagnoses from health professionals, termed self-reported diagnoses. \"Any anxiety\" included participants with at least one anxiety disorder. Agreement was assessed by calculating accuracy, Cohen's kappa, McNemar's chi-squared, sensitivity, and specificity. Agreement between diagnoses was moderate for MDD, any anxiety, and GAD, but varied by cohort. Agreement was slight to fair for the phobic disorders. Many participants with self-reported GAD did not receive a symptom-based diagnosis. In contrast, symptom-based diagnoses of the phobic disorders were more common than self-reported diagnoses. Agreement for MDD, any anxiety, and GAD was higher for cases in the case-enriched GLAD cohort and for controls in the general population COPING NBR cohort.

Co-morbid depression and anxiety are associated with increased mortality and healthcare utilisation and impact upon functional disability and quality of life. Despite these negative consequences, the identification and management of co-morbid depression and anxiety in these two diseases is inadequate. There is some evidence for the positive role of pulmonary/cardiac rehabilitation and psychotherapy in the management of co-morbid depression and anxiety, however, this is insufficient to guide recommendations.

The aim of this study was to provide an assessment of the mental health burden in a cohort of Italian HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing their condition with that before the emergency, to direct the promotion of mental well-being among HCWs worldwide. In this retrospective study, we included physicians, physical therapists, and nurses working in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, Neurology Unit, and Rehabilitation Unit from a Southern Italy University Hospital. All study participants underwent a battery of psychological tests, aimed at verifying their state of mental health during the COVID-19 emergency and before it. Depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms were assessed using the following questionnaires: Maslach Burnout Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder-7. Depressive, anxiety, and burnout clinical relevance symptoms were present in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic more than those before the emergency. Fifty percent of the HCWs obtained a score clinically significant during the emergency. Moreover, a depersonalization factor showed a statistically significant increase in average scores (p < 0.0001). The PHQ-9 scale showed that 47.1% of the operators reported depressive state presence. The number of operators scoring above the cut-off for the anxiety scale tripled during the emergency (p < 0.0001). The female gender conferred greater risks for depression.

This study replicated and extended the psychometric evaluation of the Worry Behaviors Inventory (WBI), a brief self-report measure of avoidant behaviors associated with GAD. The WBI was administered to a hospital-based sample of adults seeking treatment for symptoms of anxiety and/or depression (n = 639) and to a community sample (n = 55). Participants completed measures of symptom severity (GAD, depression, panic disorder, health anxiety, and personality disorder), and measures of checking, reassurance-seeking and behavioral inhibition. Analyses evaluated the factor structure, convergent, divergent, incremental, and discriminant validity, as well the temporal stability and treatment sensitivity of the WBI. The two-factor structure found in the preliminary psychometric evaluation of the WBI was replicated. The WBI was sensitive to changes across treatment and correlated well with measures of GAD symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors. The WBI was more strongly related to GAD symptom severity than other disorders. The WBI discriminated between clinical and community samples. The WBI provides clinicians and researchers with a brief, clinically meaningful index of problematic behaviors that may guide treatment decisions and contribute to our understanding of maintaining factors in GAD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28756794/"}

This study assesses the impact of persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms on QoL among patients with HF in Jordan. This was a prospective observational study of a consecutive sample with a confirmed diagnosis of HF, recruited from four hospitals in Jordan during the period 1-31 March 2020. QoL was measured using the Arabic version of the Short Form 36 Health Survey, while anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and stepwise multiple regression. Of 127 patients who participated in the study, 72 (56.7%) were persistently anxious and 60 (47.3%) were persistently depressed. In multiple regression models, persistent anxiety, persistent depression, and higher levels of New York Heart Association functional class were independent predictors for both Physical Component Summary (of which history of DM was another predictor) and Mental Component Summary. The model explained 78.4% of the variance for PCS, P < 0.05. These predictors reduced QoL/(PCS) by 0.261, 0.398, 0.09, and 0.325 units respectively. Mental Component Summary (MCS) regression model explained 76.1% of the variance, P < 0.001. These predictors reduced QoL/(MCS) by 0.286, 0.346, and 0.359 units respectively. Persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with poor QoL among patients with HF.

However, PsyCap's influence on these outcomes in young people is unclear. The present exploratory study investigated changes in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms (measured via the RCADS-SV) and subjective wellbeing (measured by the Flourishing Scale) from pre-pandemic levels to 3 months into the pandemic and explored gender differences at each time point in a sample of Australian Year 10 students (N = 56, Mage = 14.93 years, SD = 0.50, 51.8% male). The longitudinal predictive role of baseline PsyCap on follow-up assessments of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms and flourishing were also examined. There were no significant changes in levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms between the timepoints, but flourishing significantly declined from T1 to T2. Baseline PsyCap was not a significant predictor of T2 anxiety and depressive symptoms but was a significant predictor of T2 flourishing. Further, different baseline HERO constructs predicted T2 mental health symptoms and flourishing. Future larger studies building on the current preliminary findings investigating the roles of student PsyCap, mental health and subjective wellbeing are warranted to better understand these constructs in the COVID-19 era and beyond.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37418072/"}

Multilevel analyses were performed to examine the association between the DM-TRD score at baseline and clinical course, defined by symptom severity according to scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) over time. We also investigated whether an extra item measuring childhood adversity improved the model. The model including the DM-TRD and its interaction with time was superior to previous models. The addition of childhood adversity and its interaction with time did not improve the model. In depressed outpatients receiving treatment as usual, the solid longer-term association between higher DM-TRD scores and worse clinical course supports its usefulness in clinical practice.

Preadolescents with depression (N = 42) were randomly assigned FB-IPT or CCT. Pre- and posttreatment assessments included clinician-administered measures of depression, parent- and child-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and parent-child conflict and interpersonal impairment with peers. Preadolescents receiving FB-IPT had higher rates of remission (66.0% versus 31%), a greater decrease in depressive symptoms from pre- to posttreatment, and lower depressive symptoms at posttreatment (R(2) = 0.35, ΔR(2) = 0.22; B = -8.15, SE = 2.61, t[37] = -3.13, p = .002, F(2) = 0.28) than did preadolescents with depression receiving CCT.

Although longitudinal relationships between the two have been studied, within-person associations between these variables, which are important for informing interventions, have not been adequately examined. To bridge that research gap, this study examined the within-person associations between aggression (i.e., reactive, proactive, and cyber aggression) and mental health problems (i.e., depressive and anxious symptoms), as informed by the frustration-aggression theory and the failure model. Three-wave longitudinal data were collected from a sample of Chinese adolescents (N = 1422; 50.9% girls; mean age = 13.56 years) at three time points, each separated by one-year intervals. The data were analyzed using a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), revealing several within-person relationships. The presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety at T2 predicted increased cyber aggression at T3, and depressive symptoms at T2 also predicted an increase in reactive aggression at T3 (p < 0.1). In addition, proactive aggression at T2 predicted an increase in depressive symptoms at T3 (p < 0.1), and reactive aggression at T1 predicted a reduction in symptoms of anxiety at T2. All aggression- and mental health-related variables were significantly correlated at the between-person level. Moreover, the results of the multiple-group RI-CLPMs showed that gender influenced the relationships between proactive aggression and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The study's results lend partial support to the notion of bidirectional relationships between adolescent aggressive behaviors and mental health conditions, as well as to the frustration-aggression theory and the failure model.

Six depression patients and twelve psychiatric nurses were chosen for semi-structured interviews through a purposive sampling method from a tertiary Grade A psychiatric hospital in Shandong Province, China. The group of depressed patients included in the study had a male to female sex ratio of 1:1 with a mean age of 46years. The psychiatric nurse group had a male to female ratio of 1:2 with a mean age of 42.42 years. We used descriptive qualitative research techniques.

This study found that multiple factors influence the self-management of depression patients, including disease impact, the degree of symptom control, and support. In addition to helping patients integrate social resources and seek social support, medical staff should also pay attention to changes in the patient's condition and disease control.

An important goal in ERT is to teach clients adaptive emotion regulation, including healthier metacognitive abilities such as decentering and cognitive reappraisal. A few studies thus far have demonstrated a mediating role for these metacognitive abilities in other cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) for GAD. However, a drawback to most of these has been the ability to demonstrate a causal role for improved metacognitive abilities in outcome. In the present study, we utilized multilevel time-lagged segment analyses to explore the temporal dynamics between session-by-session changes in metacognition and anxiety outcomes from ERT. Thirty-one young adults diagnosed with GAD with and without co-occurring depression received 16 sessions of ERT. Prior to each session, participants completed questionnaires pertaining to metacognition (i.e., decentering and cognitive reappraisal) and anxiety symptoms (i.e., worry, trait anxiousness, and generalized anxiety). Changes in decentering temporally preceded changes in worry and trait anxiousness of a medium to large magnitude, and changes in cognitive reappraisal temporally preceded changes in all three outcomes of a medium to large magnitude. The reverse direction, where mediators were predicted by outcomes, was nonsignificant. These findings support the notion that adaptive metacognitive emotion regulation is involved in reducing worry and anxiety in GAD.

They also correlate with other markers of depression vulnerability, but little is known about the other psychometric properties. Our aim was to examine the factor structure and validity of the LEIDS-R. We used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA; N = 1,696) and a student sample (N = 811) for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA, respectively). CFA showed that model fit of the 6-factor structure was satisfactory in the NESDA sample, but some factors were highly correlated. After removing 4 poor items, EFA yielded an alternative 5-factor structure and could not replicate the original 6-factor model. Testing for measurement invariance across recruitment groups of NESDA showed support for strong invariance. Due to high interfactor correlations, a bifactor model with 1 general factor and 5 specific factors was fitted in 2 samples. This model supported use of a general factor, but high factor loadings in specific factors supported retaining a 5-subscale structure. Higher scores on the general factor were associated with a history of depression, especially in participants with a history of comorbid anxiety.

Various models have been proposed to explain this relationship. We explored the following research questions. First, using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), will the symptoms that define anxiety and depression (as in the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25, HSCL-25) appear together in 1 factor, or are they separable into the hypothesized dimensions of the disorders? Second, using confirmatory factor analysis, how will the structural integrity of the resulting factors compare with those of the various models that have been proposed to explain the relationship between the symptoms of anxiety and depression? This issue has not been investigated in an Arab setting. Participants (n = 624) were Kuwaiti national college students, who completed the HSCL-25 in class. EFA was done by principal axis factoring. Seven models were generated for comparison in confirmatory factor analysis, using 8 'fit' indices in Analysis of Moment Structures, version 16. The 5 factors from EFA were similar in construct to the subscales of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, on which the tripartite model of anxiety and depression was validated ('core anxiety', 'core depression', 'general distress mixed', 'general distress anxiety', 'general distress depression'). The hierarchical bifactor model and the dimensional model characterized by the correlation of these factors were best at meeting the fit indices, followed by the correlated 2-factor anxiety/depression model. In line with theory, the correlation between the specific anxiety/depression factors was lower than that between each of them and the general distress mixed factor; and there was no significant gender difference in the summed score for core depression. The findings support the impression that, although the core symptoms of anxiety are separable from the core symptoms of depression, there is an overlapping set of symptoms which contribute to the experience of comorbidity. The relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression probably has dimensional and hierarchical elements. The findings broaden the evidence base of the cross-cultural validity of the tripartite model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21502775/"}
{"id": "24866818", "title": "Social anxiety, submissiveness, and shame in men and women: a moderated mediation analysis.", "text": "Research suggests a positive relationship between social anxiety and shame; however, few studies have examined this relationship or potential mechanisms. Common behaviours of persons with social anxiety disorder (SAD), such as submissive behaviours, may be more consistent with societal expectations of women than men and therefore more likely to be associated with shame in socially anxious men than women. We examined the hypothesis that submissive behaviours would mediate the relationship between social anxiety and shame in men, but not in women, with SAD. Moderated mediation was examined in a cross-sectional dataset. Gender was modeled to moderate the paths from social anxiety to submissive behaviours and from submissive behaviours to shame. We also examined an alternative model of the relationships among these variables and the potential contributory role of depression. Men (n = 48) and women (n = 40) with SAD completed the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Submissive Behaviour Scale, Internalized Shame Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Analyses supported the hypothesized model. The relationship between submissive behaviours and shame was greater in men than women with SAD; the relationship between social anxiety and submissive behaviours was not. Controlling for depression, moderation remained evident although diminished. Results for the comparison model did not support gender moderation. Submissive behaviours mediated the relationship between social anxiety and shame in men, but not women, with SAD. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a model of shame in SAD and may help to further elucidate specific features of SAD that differ between men and women. Although researchers have argued that the display of submissive behaviours might allow the socially anxious individual to limit or prevent attacks on the self, our results suggest that there are greater costs, with regard to feelings of shame, associated with such behaviours for men. In men with SAD, the greater shame associated with submissive behaviours can be understood when considering that socially anxious individuals appear to be particularly concerned with concealing aspects of the self believed to violate perceived societal norms and that traditional masculine gender roles revolve around the theme of dominance. Because the study was conducted in individuals with SAD, it is possible that the restricted range of social anxiety severity may have precluded the observation of gender differences in the relationship between social anxiety and submissive behaviour. Measures were administered in a cross-sectional design, which limits potential inferences of causality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24866818/"}

Learned response outcome expectancies are important contributors to health. Individual differences in the expectancy to cope with workplace and general life demands may be important for how work conditions influence health. Method A survey was conducted among 1746 municipal employees (mean age 44.1, SD = 11.5, 81.5 % female), as part of a randomized controlled trial. This cross-sectional study used baseline data. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Outcome variables were anxiety and depression; response outcome expectancies, work conditions, and number of SHC were independent variables. Results A high number of SHC was a significant factor in explaining anxiety (OR 1.26), depression (OR 1.22) and comorbid anxiety and depression (OR 1.31). A high degree of no and/or negative response outcome expectancies was a significant factor in explaining depression (OR 1.19) and comorbid anxiety and depression (OR 1.28). The variance accounted for in the full models was 14 % for anxiety, 23 % for depression, and 41 % for comorbid anxiety and depression. Conclusion A high number of SHC, and a high degree of no and/or negative response outcome expectancies were associated with anxiety and depression. The strongest association was found for number of SHC. However, previous studies indicate that it may not be possible to prevent the occurrence of SHC. We suggest that workplace interventions targeting anxiety and depression could focus on influencing and altering employees' response outcome expectancies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27342242/"}

Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a psychosocial intervention recommended by the World Health Organisation to address distress experienced by adults affected by humanitarian crises. We are investigating its application for the first time in a high-income country. In a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), PM+ will be delivered to AS&Rs in contact with NGOs in Liverpool City Region, UK by lay therapists who have lived experience of forced migration. Following systematic review and stakeholder engagement, PM+ has been adapted to the local context, and lay therapists have been trained in its delivery. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of five 90-min sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups by lay therapists to AS&Rs experiencing emotional distress and functional impairment, compared with each other and with usual support offered by local NGOs. Distress and impairment at baseline will be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). We aim to recruit 105 participants, 35 per arm. Primary health outcomes are anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months, measured by HADS. Secondary outcomes include subjective wellbeing, functional status, progress on identified problems, presence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorder and service usage.

References to depressive thoughts can be found in philosophical writings and other literature since antiquity. They were always approached in a religious or medical way, with arguments for a mix of psychological and mystical origins. With the advent of psychiatry as a medical discipline, depressive syndromes were integrated into classifications of mental disorders. The definition of depression is multifactorial, integrating psychosocial, social and biological factors. In this article we use an historical perspective to describe the sociological, psychopathological and biological concepts relating to depressive illness. Over one century, the sociology of mental illness has evolved from the Durkheimian position to psychosocial models which incorporate environmental stressors, social support and coping mechanisms. Psychology encompasses psychoanalytical, cognitive-behavioural and phenomenological theories. Finally, biological psychiatry suggests various approaches--genetic, biochemical, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical.... The therapeutic directions are central to these concepts, just like public health, which seeks to promote the concept of mental health rather than to limit itself to the definition of the various psychiatric disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16433008/"}

The SLIT and NTRK-like 1 (SLITRK1) protein is important for synaptic remodeling and is highly expressed in the amygdala, an important brain region involved in various emotional behaviors. We examined whether SLITRK1 protein in the amygdala participates in NPP and comorbid ADD. A chronic NPP mouse model was constructed by L5 spinal nerve ligation; changes in chronic pain and ADD-like behaviors were measured in behavioral tests. Changes in SLITRK1 protein and excitatory synaptic functional proteins in the amygdala were measured by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Adeno-associated virus was transfected into excitatory synaptic neurons in the amygdala to up-regulate the expression of SLITRK1. Chronic NPP-related ADD-like behavior was successfully produced in mice by L5 ligation. We found that chronic NPP and related ADD decreased amygdalar expression of SLITRK1 and proteins important for excitatory synaptic function, including Homer1, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and synaptophysin. Virally-mediated SLITRK1 overexpression in the amygdala produced a significant easing of chronic NPP and ADD, and restored the expression levels of Homer1, PSD95, and synaptophysin.

This study aims to (1) characterize digital interventions targeting mental health outcomes in patients with cancer; (2) quantify their effectiveness in reducing anxiety and depression; and (3) examine whether intervention duration and stakeholder involvement moderate treatment outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement guidelines and was retrospectively registered in PROSPERO on May 25, 2025 (CRD420251058005). A total of 8 databases (Cochrane Central Trials Registry, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, Global Health, Embase, and Medline) were searched from inception to 2024. Eligible randomized controlled trials evaluated digital interventions for mental health in patients with cancer. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs). Pooled results were reported as the odds ratio and 95% CI. The heterogeneity was assessed with the I² test (%). Subgroup analyses explored the potential effects of intervention duration and stakeholder involvement. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias assessments were performed to ensure the robustness of findings. Twenty-two randomized controlled trials were included in the review. The geolocation involves 4 continents worldwide: Asia (n=9), Europe (n=5), North America (n=6), and Oceania (n=2). Interventions comprised meditation or mindfulness (n=3), education (n=8), self-management (n=11), physical exercise (n=4), and patient community communication (n=8). Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, digital interventions showed nonsignificant effects on depression (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -1.00 to 0.03; P=.07; 9 studies) or anxiety (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.06; P=.08; 8 studies) with substantial heterogeneity (I2>90%). Subgroup analyses revealed interventions (<1 month) significantly reduced anxiety (SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.04; P=.04), while interventions (1-2 months) reduced depression (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.01; P=.04). Interventions showed no statistically significant differences when stratified by stakeholder involvement. Sensitivity analyses excluding 1 outlier yielded significantly lower heterogeneity but preserved unchanged overall and subgroup patterns. While DMHIs overall showed no effect on anxiety or depression interventions, exploratory analyses suggest potential benefits of duration-tailored approaches. High heterogeneity and methodological limitations indicate that DMHIs may be most effective when integrated into personalized care models rather than standalone treatments.

Of the 363 participants in our study, the majority were female (71.3%), 57% were White identifying, 43% were Black identifying, and the average age was 54.4 (SD = 12.3). Model 4 accounted for 58% of the variance of anxiety symptoms and included a combination of depressive symptoms, perceived stress, self-esteem, experiences of everyday discrimination, and interaction terms. Within this model, perceived stress (<i>t</i> = 3.81, <i>p</i> < .01), experiences of everyday discrimination, (<i>t</i> = 2.33, <i>p</i> < .01), and income (<i>t</i> = -1.96, <i>p</i> < .01) were significantly associated with increased anxiety. Multiple contextual factors influence the relationship between race and anxiety. In particular, anxiety increases with lower rates of self-esteem and income. Conversely, anxiety increases with higher rates of stress, discrimination, and depressive symptoms. Social workers should consider each of these factors when treating patients presenting with symptoms of anxiety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39533510/"}

The objective of the current study was to examine the basic parameters of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive power of the measure as a screening tool. One hundred and fifty patients in a correctional community center filled out the measure prior to a psychiatric evaluation, including the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview screen. The above parameters were calculated for the domains of depression, mania, anxiety, and psychosis. The results showed that the sensitivity and positive predictive power of the studied domains was poor because of a high rate of false positive answers on the measure. However, when the lowest threshold on the Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure was used, the sensitivity of the anxiety and psychosis domains and the negative predictive values for mania, anxiety and psychosis were good. In conclusion, while it is foreseeable that some clinicians may use the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure as a screening tool, it should not be relied on to identify positive findings. It functioned well in the negative prediction of mania, anxiety and psychosis symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28523431/"}

{"id": "32585509", "title": "Attachment impacts cortisol awakening response in chronically depressed individuals.", "text": "Early life experiences shape individual attachment, creating a template for regulating emotions in interpersonal situations, likely to persist across the lifespan. Research has shown that individual attachment creates vulnerability for depression, and also impacts the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. Still, the relationship between attachment and the HPA axis in depressed individuals is unclear. Cortisol awakening response (CAR) has been recently investigated as a possibly useful physiological marker related to attachment insecurity and depression risk. However, research exploring the relationship between the CAR and attachment in individuals with chronic depression in either the presence or the absence of comorbid anxiety is lacking. The purpose of the current study was to fill this gap, by comparing the CAR in individuals with chronic depression with/without comorbid anxieties and controls. In addition, we also wanted to explore the relationship between attachment and the CAR in this group and to explore their predictive role for later depression severity. Individuals experiencing a current depressive episode at least six months in length (cMDD; n = 63) and healthy controls (HC; n = 57) were enrolled in the study (total n = 120). Participants completed a structured clinical diagnostic interview (SCID-I) as well as measures of depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and attachment dimensions (Experiences in Close Relationships scale; ECR) at baseline. In addition, participants provided salivary samples at four time points (i.e. 0 (S1), 30, 45 and 60 min) following awakening on two consecutive days. S1 cortisol, the area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) and increase (AUCi) were calculated based on the average values across both days. The HC and cMDD groups were compared on all measures. The CAR for individuals with cMDD alone (n = 14) and individuals with cMDD with two or more comorbid anxiety disorders (cMDD ≥ 2Anx; n = 30) were also compared. A subset of participants (n = 59) agreed to return for follow up one year later. Participants returning for follow up repeated the BDI-II and ECR. No salivary samples were collected at follow-up. The cMDD group had significantly lower S1 cortisol and AUCg compared to the HC group (both p ≤ 0.02). cMDD and cMDD ≥ 2Anx groups did not differ in their CAR. Regression analyses revealed that depression severity and the attachment interaction term was associated with lower S1 and AUCg cortisol (p < 0.01). Greater attachment avoidance was positively associated with S1 cortisol (p = 0.02), while mean awakening time on sample days was negatively associated with S1 cortisol. We also found a significant interaction between the attachment dimensions such that at low levels of attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance had a positive relationship with S1 cortisol and AUCg. The opposite relationship existed when attachment anxiety was high. Higher baseline BDI-II score and higher baseline attachment anxiety were predictive of higher scores on the BDI-II one-year later (both p < 0.05). The current findings bring evidence that depression severity is associated with blunting of the CAR irrespective of the comorbid status with anxiety disorders. In addition, attachment avoidance may protect against the CAR blunting in individuals with low attachment anxiety. However, individuals with high attachment anxiety and avoidance might have additional CAR blunting. Attachment anxiety might be a good predictor of future depression severity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32585509/"}

Evidence suggests that a lifetime history of mental health disorder/s and elevated depressive symptoms prior to conception increase risk for men's post-natal depression. Less is understood about the role of positive mental health, or wellbeing, as a protective factor for future depressive outcomes during the transition to fatherhood. The present study investigated whether men's post-natal depressive outcomes were associated with pre-conception levels of wellbeing and whether wellbeing during the post-natal period predicted depressive outcomes post-infancy. Secondary analysis of data from a national, longitudinal cohort study of men's health, namely, The Ten to Men (TTM) Study, was conducted. Participants in the pre-conception sample were n = 350 men for whom data were available at both a pre-conception baseline and post-natal follow-up period. The post-natal sample were n = 427 men with post-natal baseline data and post-infancy follow-up data. Multivariate negative binomial regressions and logistic regression models were used to determine pre-conception and post-natal predictors of future depressive outcomes. Men's pre-conception depressive symptoms were the best predictor of post-natal depressive symptoms (IRR = 1.089, p < 0.001) and risk of moderate-severe depression (IRR = 1.193, p = 0.005) the latter of which was also predicted by a previous mental health diagnosis (IRR = 3.079, p = 0.029). Similarly, post-natal depressive symptoms were the best predictor of post-infancy depressive symptoms (IRR = 1.089, p < 0.001) and risk of moderate-severe depression (IRR = 1.193, p = 0.005) alongside lifetime prevalence of a mental health disorder (symptoms: IRR = 1.317, p = 0.011; moderate-severe depression: IRR = 2.606, p = 0.023). Pre-conception levels of wellbeing predicted lower post-natal depressive symptoms (IRR = 0.988, p < 0.001) and reduced risk of moderate-severe depression (IRR = 0.940, p = 0.002) after controlling for baseline symptoms and socio-demographic and behavioural confounds; however, wellbeing during the post-natal period did not predict either of the depressive outcomes post-infancy. Fatherhood-specific risk factors for mental health outcomes (e.g., conception difficulties, maternal post-natal mental health) were not assessed in the present study, and only one aspect of wellbeing was captured. Screening for history of common mental health disorders and current symptoms is recommended to inform preventative approaches to paternal mental health care during early fatherhood.

Of these, mothers diagnosed with major depressive disorder (n = 22), anxiety disorders (n = 19), and controls (n = 59) were visited at 9 months. Mother-infant interaction was microcoded for maternal and infant's social behavior and synchrony. Infant negative and positive emotional expression and self-regulation were tested in 4 emotion-eliciting paradigms: anger with mother, anger with stranger, joy with mother, and joy with stranger. Infants of depressed mothers displayed less social gaze and more gaze aversion. Gaze and touch synchrony were lowest for depressed mothers, highest for anxious mothers, and midlevel among controls. Infants of control and anxious mothers expressed less negative affect with mother compared with stranger; however, maternal presence failed to buffer negative affect in the depressed group. Maternal depression chronicity predicted increased self-regulatory behavior during joy episodes, and touch synchrony moderated the effects of PPD on infant self-regulation. Findings describe subtle microlevel processes by which maternal depression across the postpartum year disrupts the development of infant emotion regulation and suggest that diminished social synchrony, low differentiation of attachment and nonattachment contexts, and increased self-regulation during positive moments may chart pathways for the cross-generational transfer of emotional maladjustment from depressed mothers to their infants.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomatology, probable post-traumatic stress disorder and resilience in school-attending adolescents in a post-conflict area of Tolima, Colombia during the COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 657 adolescents from 12 to 18 years old, recruited by convenience sampling in 8 public schools in the south of Tolima, Colombia, who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Mental health information was obtained through screening scales for anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptomatology (PHQ-8), probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-5) and resilience (CD-RISC-25). The prevalence observed for moderate to severe anxiety symptoms was 18.9% (95% CI 16.0-22.1) and for moderate to severe depressive symptomatology was 30.0% (95% CI 26.5-33.7). A prevalence of probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of 22.3% (95% CI 18.1-27.2) was found. The CD-RISC-25 results for resilience had a median score of 54 [IQR 30]. These results suggest that approximately two-thirds of school-attending adolescents in this post-conflict area experienced at least one mental health problem such as anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomatology or probable PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients aged 18 and above with a diagnosis of epilepsy for at least one year were consecutively enrolled during a six-month period. Patients anonymously filled out a questionnaire which included data on the gender, age, education, marital status and degree of seizure control. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were used to evaluate the presence or absence of anxiety and depression. Total number of study patients was 70, including 52 patients with partial seizures and 18 patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The mean patient age was 37 ± 7.92 years. The prevalence of depression in our sample was 32.8%, whereas the prevalence of anxiety was 21.4%. Patients with partial seizures were more depressed, while those with idiopathic generalized seizures were more anxious (p < 0.01). Depression was associated with a lower educational level, unemployment and poor seizure control (p < 0.05). The number of antiepileptic drugs showed a trend towards negative association with depression (p = 0.005). Anxiety was associated with the level of education and uncontrolled seizures (p < 0.01). Neither depression nor anxiety was associated with age, gender, marital status, age at onset and duration of epilepsy.

Participants (N = 554) were drawn from a representative community sample of German children, 7-11 years old, who were followed over four measurement points (baseline, 1, 2 and 6 years later). Dysregulation profile, derived from the parent report of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, was measured at the first three measurement points, while symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression were assessed at the fourth measurement point. We used latent class growth analysis to investigate developmental trajectories in the development of the dysregulation profile. The predictive value of dysregulation profile trajectories for later ADHD, anxiety and depression was examined by linear regression. For descriptive comparison, the predictive value of a single measurement (baseline) was calculated. Dysregulation profile was a stable trait during childhood. Boys and girls had similar levels of dysregulation profile over time. Two developmental subgroups were identified, namely the low dysregulation profile and the high dysregulation profile trajectory. The group membership in the high dysregulation profile trajectory (n = 102) was best predictive of later ADHD, regardless of an individual's gender and age. It explained 11% of the behavioural variance. For anxiety this was 8.7% and for depression 5.6%, including some gender effects. The single-point measurement was less predictive.

Both prevention and treatment interventions tended to be effective overall, with treatment interventions producing larger effect sizes than prevention interventions. The clearest evidence for particular intervention approaches emerged for prevention-level Cognitive Therapy/CBT, followed by prevention-level work-related interventions, although neither produced entirely consistent effects. Risk of bias was generally high across studies. Low numbers of studies within subgroups precluded any comparisons between long-term and short-term unemployment, limited comparisons among treatment studies, and reduced the power of meta-analyses. Both prevention- and treatment-level mental health-focused interventions have merit for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression among those experiencing unemployment. Cognitive Therapy/CBT and work-related interventions hold the most robust evidence base, which can inform both prevention and treatment strategies implemented by clinicians, employment services providers, and governments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37201898/"}

This study aims to determine the prevalence and independent predictors of likely generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and likely major depressive disorder (MDD) among teachers in the Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, and Nova Scotia. The study used a cross-sectional design. Educators from the 3 Canadian provinces participated by completing a web-based survey after enrolling in the Wellness4Teachers program, a free, self-subscription, daily, supportive SMS text messaging initiative. The program was launched at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year, and all teachers in the 3 provinces were eligible to enroll. Likely GAD and likely MDD among subscribers were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 28.0). Of the 1912 Wellness4Teachers subscribers, 763 (39.9%) completed the survey. The prevalence of likely MDD was 55.7% (425/763) and that of likely GAD was 46% (349/759). After controlling for all other variables in the regression model, participants who reported high stress were 7.24 times more likely to experience MDD (odds ratio [OR] 7.24, 95% CI 4.22-12.42) and 7.40 times more likely to experience GAD (OR 7.40, 95% CI 4.63-11.80) than those with mild to moderate stress. Participants with emotional exhaustion were 4.92 times more likely to experience MDD (OR 4.92, 95% CI 3.01-8.05) and 4.34 times more likely to experience GAD (OR 4.34, 95% CI 2.47-7.62) than those without. Moreover, respondents with a lack of professional accomplishment were 2.13 times as likely to have MDD symptoms (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.41-3.23) and 1.52 times more likely to experience GAD symptoms (OR 1.524, 95% CI 1.013-2.293) than those without. Similarly, respondents with low resilience were 1.82 times more likely to have likely MDD than those with normal to high resilience (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.24-2.66). In addition, respondents with low resilience were 3.01 times more likely to experience likely GAD than those with normal to high resilience (OR 3.01, 95% CI 2.03-7.62). Participants with >20 years of teaching experience were 0.28 times less likely to experience GAD symptoms than those with ≤5 years of teaching experience (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Sociodemographic and work-related variables did not independently predict likely GAD and likely MDD. This study underscores the need for governments and policy makers in the education sector to implement comprehensive mental health support programs. Addressing the unique stressors faced by educators, reducing emotional exhaustion, and enhancing resilience are crucial steps toward mitigating anxiety and depression, promoting educators' well-being, and improving the quality of educational delivery.

In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment. Between 17 May and 10 June, 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21.99 ± 3.10 years; 31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery). Restorative quality of the home (the \"being away\" dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale; PRS) and the neighborhood (the \"being away\" and \"fascination\" dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators. Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables. Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively. The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates. Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health. As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home. Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health. Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery. Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home. However, causal interpretation of these associations is not straightforward.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33157110/"}

To our knowledge, no existing studies have investigated the relationship between community engagement and adverse mental health among mothers in a Canadian context, nor has this relationship been studied over time. The current study aims to address these gaps by modelling the association between community engagement and anxiety and depression longitudinally using a cohort of prenatal and postnatal mothers living in Calgary, Alberta. We used data from the All our Families (AOF) study, a prospective cohort study of expectant and new mothers in Calgary, Alberta from 2008 to 2017 across seven timepoints. We used three-level latent growth curves to model the relationship between individual-level community engagement and maternal depression and anxiety scores, while adjusting for both individual and neighborhood-level characteristics. The study sample consisted of 2129 mothers across 174 neighborhoods in Calgary. Adjusted latent growth curve models demonstrated that community engagement was associated with lower depression (b = - 0.28, 95% CI - 0.33, - 0.23) and anxiety (b = - 0.07, 95% CI - 0.12, - 0.02) scores among mothers over time. Adjusted results show that community engagement has a protective effect against depression and anxiety amongst mothers.

The body of research investigating its potential impact on mental health has risen exponentially. We systematically reviewed the present literature exploring potential linkages between social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety in this vulnerable group. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses framework, articles were searched across Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases from inception to February 2024. Quantitative studies with social media as exposure and anxiety/depressive symptoms as outcomes in children and adolescents 5-18 years of age were included. Of the 4850 studies retrieved, 67 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The most frequent measures of social media were \"time spent on social media\" and \"frequency of use.\" Depressive symptoms were the outcome of 61 studies, whereas anxiety was measured in 27 studies. Most studies were of fair quality (<i>n</i> = 53). A meta-analysis was not possible due to study heterogeneity. Our review shows that (1) problematic social media use is associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms among children and adolescents, (2) duration of social media use was more consistently linked with anxiety and depression in girls compared with boys, and (3) mediating and moderating mechanisms were sleep deprivation, social comparison, and feedback-seeking behaviors, exercise, social support, and type of social media use.

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) provides a translational framework for identifying transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms, but its application in perinatal affective disorders (PNAD) is yet limited. Here, we identified RDoC-based transdiagnostic features of PNAD in 140 primarily low-income Black and Hispanic women at 272 total longitudinal visits across the perinatal period. Women completed RDoC self-report measures of potential threat and reward valuation-Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System scale (BIS/BAS) and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS)-and measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7). Longitudinal mixed effects models assessed associations of between-person (\"trait-like\") and within-person (\"state-like\") measures of potential threat (BIS/IUS) and reward valuation (BAS-Drive) with depression and anxiety symptoms. Higher \"trait-like\" BIS (standardized b = 2.33, p < .001) and IUS (b = 2.97, p < .001) scores, higher \"state-like\" BIS (b = .71, p < .001), and lower \"state-like\" BAS-Drive (b =  - .58, p = .04) scores were associated with worse depressive symptoms. Higher \"trait-like\" BIS (b = 2.22, p < .001) and IUS (b = 2.73, p < .001) and higher \"state-like\" BIS scores (b = .92, p < .001) were associated with worse anxiety symptoms. Potential threat may be a prominent, transdiagnostic feature of perinatal anxiety and depression, whereas reward valuation may be a non-transdiagnostic, weaker feature of perinatal depression. Potential threat is important as both a \"trait-like\" feature that is sustained across the perinatal period and a \"state-like\" feature that varies within a woman across pregnancy.

This review summarizes current neurobiological knowledge regarding anxious depression. Peer-reviewed articles, published January 1970 through September 2012, were identified via PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, using the following key words: anxious depression electroencephalography (EEG), anxious depression functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anxious depression genetics, anxious depression neurobiology, and anxious melancholia neurobiology. Despite a general dearth of neurobiological research, the results suggest that anxious depression-when defined either syndromally or dimensionally-has distinct neurobiological findings that separate it from nonanxious depression. Structural neuroimaging, EEG, genetics, and neuropsychiatric studies revealed differences in subjects with anxious depression compared to other groups. Endocrine differences between individuals with anxious depression and those with nonanxious depression have also been noted, as evidenced by abnormal responses elicited by exogenous stimulation of the system. Despite these findings, heterogeneity in the definition of anxious depression complicates the results. Because exploring the neurobiology of this depressive subtype is important for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, enrichment strategies to decrease heterogeneity within the field should be employed for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23495126/"}

This study investigates the relationship between the effectiveness on depression/anxiety symptoms and positive mental health of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It draws on RCT data (n = 250) of a self-help ACT. Patients' depression/anxiety symptoms and positive mental health were completed at baseline, at post-intervention after nine weeks, and at follow-up after five months. Percentage of unique variance of depression/anxiety symptoms explained by positive mental health (and vice versa), and the degree of classificatory agreement between improvements in positive mental health and depression/anxiety, were examined using regression analysis and Reliable Change Index (RCI). Positive mental health, i.e. baseline and change, explained 15% and 12% of the variance in follow-up depression and anxiety symptoms, beyond the 7% and 9% that was explained by baseline levels of depression and anxiety. Depression and anxiety symptoms, i.e., baseline and change, explained 10% and 9% of the variance in follow-up positive mental health, on top of the 35% that was explained by baseline levels of positive mental health. Cross-classification of the Reliable Changes showed that 64% of the participants that improved during the ACT-intervention, improved on either depression symptoms or positive mental health, and 72% of the participants improved on either anxiety symptoms or positive mental health.

Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (\"rapid eye movement sleep instability\"), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious-like wake experience, reflecting pre-sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38811745/"}

Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID-19 experiences with mental health outcomes. Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self-harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID-19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self-harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self-harm.

Several anxiety and ED symptoms were also central, including physical anxiety, social anxiety, body dissatisfaction, and desire for thinness. The central symptom crying predicted six-month depression with a medium effect size. These findings suggest anxiety and ED symptoms may influence the day-to-day course of depression in some individuals with comorbid diagnoses, but predictors of symptoms across hours may differ from predictors across longer time scales (i.e., months).

Extracted data were synthesised using meta-aggregation. Eight studies met inclusion criteria and three synthesised findings were generated. (1) Facilitators of men's eMH use: finding apps and technology motivating and convenient, support and encouragement from important others, and interventions allowing men to take action, gain control over their mental health, and resulting in positive outcomes; (2) Barriers to men's eMH use: lack of free time, predicted or experienced lack of benefit from use, and technical difficulties; (3) What men want in eMH: personalised, tailored, relevant interventions that are bright and easy to use, with information presented in multiple formats, psychoeducation, exercises, self-monitoring, information on further resources, and the option of clinician involvement, without any repetitive questioning, boring tools, or negative feedback. All included studies were conducted in high income, 'Western' countries; most data related to experiences of using an existing eMH intervention within a trial, rather than in 'real world' settings where eMH acceptability is generally lower and experiences may differ.

The electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science Core Collections and the China Academic Journals (CAJ) offered through the Full-text Database (CNKI) were searched for relevant studies published from the inception of the databases to December 2024. The initial search strategy was performed using keywords, MeSH terms, and free text words such as \"forest bathing\", \"forest medicine\", \"mental health pressure\", \"anxiety\", \"depression\", \"cortisol\", etc. The synthesis of the findings in the included studies revealed that forest bathing interventions might improve mental and physical health, reduce blood pressure, improve sleep quality and boost immunity, as well as alleviate depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, the effect of forest bathing on mental health indicators and the differences in these results among different populations varied. Forest environment, tree species, exposure duration, season, composition and concentration of volatile organic compounds have an impact on the effect of forest bathing. Forest bathing were effective in lowering cortisol levels, reducing sympathetic nerve activity, as well as improving negative mood, which could serve as a non-pharmacological treatment for mental health in the general population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40051516/"}

This prospective, longitudinal study examines data on the mental health of the mother from prior to the birth of her child to when the child reaches 14 years of age. Child behavior is measured at 14 years of age using reports from mother and child. Mother and child responses are compared to provide an indication of the possible magnitude of maternal observation bias in the reporting of child behavior problems. Anxious and/or depressed mothers tend to report more cases of child behavior problems than do their mentally healthy counterparts or children themselves. Differences between mothers and youths in reporting behavior problems appear to be related to the mothers' mental health. Current maternal mental health impairment appears to have a substantial effect on the reporting of child behavior problems by the mother, thereby raising questions about the validity of reports of child behavior by persons who are currently emotionally distressed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10802977/"}

Drop in clinic is a common form of organizing health care; however the visits are short and focus on solving the most urgent problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and severity of depression among women visiting the GPs' drop in clinic and to identify possible clues for depression among women. The two-stage screening method with \"high risk feedback\" was used. Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to screen 155 women visiting two GPs' drop in clinic. Women who screened positive (BDI score > or =10) were invited by the GP to a repeat visit. Major depression (MDD) was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and the severity was assessed with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Women with BDI score <10 constituted a control group. Demographic characteristics were obtained by questionnaire. Chart notations were examined with regard to symptoms mentioned at the index visit and were categorized as somatic or mental. The two-stage method worked well with a low rate of withdrawals in the second step, when the GP invited the women to a repeat visit. The prevalence of depression was 22.4% (95% CI 15.6-29.2). The severity was mild in 43%, moderate in 53% and severe in 3%. The depressed women mentioned mental symptoms significantly more often (69%) than the controls (15%) and were to a higher extent sick-listed for a longer period than 14 days. Nearly one third of the depressed women did not mention mental symptoms. The majority of the women who screened as false positive for depression had crisis reactions and needed further care from health professionals in PHC. Referrals to a psychiatrist were few and revealed often psychiatric co-morbidity. The prevalence of previously undiagnosed depression among women visiting GPs' drop in clinic was high. Clues for depression were identified in the depressed women's symptom presentation; they often mention mental symptoms when they visit the GP for somatic reasons e.g. respiratory infections.

According to Hippocrates, therapy was not just a question of medicine and diet, in fact the cure he gave to his patients included also a trip to an island in order to temporarily move away from their environment, and therefore from the context that, somehow, had contributed to the emergence of the disease. Furthermore, the journey in itself, produces extraordinary beneficial effects. According with another study, for example, conducted by the Global Commission on Aging and Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, in partnership with the U.S. Travel Association, women who vacationed every 6 years, or less, had a significantly higher risk of developing a heart attack or a coronary death, compared to women who vacationed at least twice a year. Similarly, another study showed that men who did not take an annual vacation had a 20 percent higher risk of death and 30 percent greater risk of death from heart disease. (www.globalcoalitiononaging.com, 2013) As regards the therapeutic value, the idea of facing a fascinating \"Journey\" in a Journey, could prepare the individual to enter in a sort of a suspended space, in which, according to many authors, the travel can induce both psychophysical and psychosomatic beneficial changes. For this reason, Body and Mind project, prepared by the Genius Academy Research and Psychological Studies Center, started in 2015, thanks to a protocol of intervention which includes associated psycho-physical inductions, with the aim of demonstrating the increase in the level of well-being (from the 30% to the 60% ). The research, continued in 2016/17 with the objective of raising the level of well-being perceived and measured, has shown a further health improvement. This improvement was evaluated and compared to data expressed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, hours of night time sleep, headache, sense of anxiety recorded an increase in well-being of 67% by stimulating the organisms affected by a specific suffering such as depression in the oncological patient. As the results of three years of study have been so encouraging, it was decided to continue the research by making the necessary changes to contextualize the Body and Mind project within a travel situation. The project a \"Journey\" in the Journey, which for the last five years optimizes the opportunities offered by a trip to promote the psychological growth of individuals through prescriptions, work shops, seminars, drinking and talking, social dreams, has therefore widened the research space, also bonding the objectives of the Body and Mind project. A \"Journey\" in the Journey in the places of Body and Mind, develops along two main directions: 1) the places of Body and Mind; 2) the Body and Mind project. But the red thread that binds and unites the study and research initiatives we have talked about is always the same: the innovative strategic approach where the individual is at the center of the scene, in contexts where life is live and where it is always the person to have the role of leading actor.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30439826/"}

Nonetheless, it is frequently cited that the disorder is under-diagnosed. In this article we examined the utility of a two phase case detection strategy for depression in primary care clinics in Israel. We compared screening findings with the medical charts diagnoses. A three-question screening test for depression taken from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was answered by 551 primary care patients. Those who answered positively on one or more questions were asked to answer a more specific and detailed questionnaire in order to detect depression: The Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD). The results were compared with the diagnoses on the medical charts, and treatment for depression. In addition the number of visits to the primary care physician was compared, between depressed and non-depressed patients. The first questionnaire (from the DIS) was completed by 551 patients. A total of 222 (40%) of these patients gave at least one positive answer. Only 113 (51%) agreed to answer the second questionnaire (IDD). According to the IDD, 15 were depressed: 9 fulfilled the criteria for major depression (1.6% of the 551) and 6 fulfilled the criteria for minor depression (1.1%). Of the 9 that the IDD identified as suffering from major depression only one was diagnosed as such according to his medical chart. Two of the patients that the IDD found to be suffering from minor depression were diagnosed according to their medical chart as depressive. Five patients that were diagnosed by their physicians as suffering from depression were not diagnosed by the IDD. In a sample of patients who answered positively to one or more questions of the DIS, but refused to answer the IDD, it was found that 10 (20% of the sample) were diagnosed as depressed and 32% of the sample had some psychiatric diagnosis according to their charts. We discovered that patients who suffer from a depressive disorder visited their physicians more often than those that were not depressed: 12.7 and 7.14 respectively (during 6 months) (p < 0.028). The combined two phase screening instrument was found to be impractical and problematic for use as a screening tool. There was a difference between the diagnoses that appeared in the charts and those resulting from the screening tool. Using the 3 questions from the DIS as a case finding tool for depression in high risk populations (such as frequent attenders) might prove useful in primary care setting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14702744/"}

We used content analysis to examine the dialogues of CAs previously included in three assessments of mental health apps (depression education, self-guided cognitive behavioural therapy, and suicide prevention) performed between 2019 and 2020. Two standardized user personas with depression were developed to interact with the CA. All conversations were saved as screenshots, transcribed verbatim, and coded inductively. Nine CAs were included. Seven CAs (78%) had Android and iOS versions; five CAs (56%) had at least 500,000 downloads. The analysis generated eight categories: self-introduction, personalization, appropriateness of CA responses, conveying empathy, guiding users through mood-boosting activities, mood monitoring, suicide risk management, and others. CAs could engage in empathic, non-judgemental conversations with users, offer support, and guide psychotherapeutic exercises. CA evaluations were performed using standardized personas, not real-world users. CAs were included for evaluation only if retrieved in the search strategies associated with the previous assessment studies. Assessed CAs offered anonymous, empathic, non-judgemental interactions that align with evidence for face-to-face psychotherapy. CAs from app stores are not suited to provide comprehensive suicide risk management. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of CA-led interventions in mental health care and in enhancing suicide risk management strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36150405/"}

Only in 25% of this group depressive disorders are recognised, even less patients receive effective help. Physicians employed in basic health service often treat depression inappropriately (an erroneous selection of medicines, inappropriate, usually too low dosage of the drug, too short the period ot treatment). In order to improve the effectiveness of medical help provided to the patients with depressions, various educational actions for physicians employed in the basic health service are organised. Their aim is to improve the physicians' competence in diagnosing and treatment of depression.

Digital interventions can be delivered at scale to bridge critical gaps in mental health care but must address the needs and preferences of adolescents. This study aims to conduct qualitative research involving adolescents aged 18 years to inform both the design of digital mental health interventions for adolescents broadly and new features and refinements to incorporate in an automated SMS text messaging intervention, Small Steps SMS, that was originally designed for young adults. We recruited non-treatment-engaged older adolescents who were aged 18 years, lived in the United States, and had experienced depression or anxiety. In total, 12 participants were recruited through social media advertising and online self-screeners hosted by Mental Health America, a mental health advocacy organization. For 24 days, participants answered researcher prompts and engaged with one another in an asynchronous online discussion group, with a new discussion prompt released every 3 days. In parallel, partway through the discussion group, participants received interactive messages from Small Steps SMS, an automated SMS text messaging intervention that delivers daily dialogues supporting mental health self-management. Questions in the discussion group pertained to mental health challenges, help-seeking attitudes, perceptions of Small Steps SMS, and ways the program and other digital mental health interventions could meet the needs of older adolescents. A subset of participants (n=4, 33%) also completed interviews to elaborate on their responses. Thematic analysis was applied to transcripts of the discussion group and interviews to characterize user needs and design priorities when making Small Steps SMS and similar interventions available to adolescents. Participants reported factors that contributed to their experience of mental health symptoms, including the transition from adolescence to adulthood, fears that the world is unstable and their futures are uncertain, and ineffective use of social media to cope with symptoms. Participants were proud of their generation's mental health acceptance but also observed a generational divide in mental health stigma and literacy that could impede seeking help from parents and other adults. Participants appreciated that Small Steps SMS allowed them to pursue mental health self-management conveniently and independently. They suggested that the program and similar interventions address adolescent-specific challenges and facilitate intergenerational communication about mental health. They also recommended possible ways to increase engagement through peer-to-peer communication, gamification, and greater explanation of self-management strategies. Major life transitions affected adolescent participants' mental health needs and preferences for digital mental health tools. While interactive automated messaging programs have the potential to support self-management in this population, program content and features should be adapted to adolescents' needs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40882198/"}

The Prospective Epidemiological Research on Functioning Outcomes Related to Major depressive disorder (MDD) (PERFORM) study was a 2-year observational cohort study in outpatients with MDD in five European countries. Enrolled patients were either initiating or undergoing the first switch to an antidepressant monotherapy. Baseline data on patients' clinical status, functioning, productivity, quality of life and medical-resource use were compared in a cross-sectional baseline analysis. A total of 1402 patients were enrolled, of whom 1159 (82.7%) provided analysable baseline data. The majority (78.7%) of the analysable population were initiating antidepressant treatment and most (83.6%) were enrolled and followed up by general practitioners. Compared with patients initiating antidepressants, those switching antidepressants (21.3%) tended to have more severe depressive symptoms, greater anxiety, worse health-related quality of life, greater functional impairment, greater medical-resource use and had a different medical history. Limitations included an over-representation of switches due to lack of efficacy among patients who were switching treatment, as patients were selected based on presence of depressive symptoms. Patients with MDD who are switching treatment for the first time have a different profile and different depression-associated health needs compared with those initiating treatment. Therapeutic management should therefore be adapted for patients who switch.

Data were collected at baseline (age 14-17) and at two follow-up interviews within an observation period of 42 months. Diagnostic assessment was based on the Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). Our data suggest that RBD is a prevalent (2.6%) clinical condition among depressive disorders (21.3%) being at least as prevalent as dysthymia (2.3%) in young adults over lifetime. Furthermore, RBD is associated with significant clinical impairment sharing many features with major depressive disorder (MDD). Suicide attempts were reported in 7.8% of RBD patients, which was similar to MDD (11.9%). However, other features, like gender distribution or co-morbidity patterns, differ essentially from MDD. Furthermore, the lifetime co-occurrence of MDD and RBD or combined depression represents a severe psychiatric condition.

An electronic search was conducted using the MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases. The inclusion criteria were original studies that assessed aspects of depression in a population aged 18 or older, were conducted in primary care settings in Israel, and had sufficient detailed description of depression-related measures, study sample and outcome measures. Twelve articles reporting results from seven studies met these criteria. The prevalence of current depression in primary care varied considerably across studies: 1.6-5.9% for major depression, 1.1-5.4% for minor depression, 14.3-24% for depressive symptoms. Depression was consistently related to female gender and fewer years of education, and was associated with disability, decreased quality of life, and increased health-related expenditure. Many cases of depression were undiagnosed and most patients had persistent depression or achieved only partial remission. Depression represents a serious challenge for the primary health care system in Israel. Greater efforts should be focused on screening and treating depression in primary care. However, the studies reviewed here used different methodologies and assessed different aspects of depression and, therefore, should be generalized cautiously. Systematic research on the prevalence, correlates and management of depression in primary care, with emphasis on collaborative care models, is strongly needed to inform research, clinicians and health care policy makers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17877061/"}

To address this evidence gap, we investigated the associations between microaggressions and poor mental health (depression; anxiety; non-suicidal self-harm [NSSH]; suicidal thoughts; suicide attempt) amongst trans people. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 787 trans adults in the UK, measuring mental health and exposure to microaggressions using the Gender Identity Microaggressions Scale (GIMS). Using univariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression models we tested for an association of microaggressions with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), lifetime NSSH, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and lifetime suicide attempt. Of the 787 participants, 574 (73%) provided complete data. Microaggressions were a common experience, affecting 97.6% of participants over their lifetime. In adjusted analyses, using sociodemographic and clinical variables, increased microaggression scores were associated with increased depressive symptoms (adjusted coefficient: 1.86 (95%CI = 1.35 to 2.36)), anxiety symptoms (adjusted coefficient: 1.57 (95%CI = 1.09 -2.05)) and with increased odds of NSSH (Odds Ratio [OR]<sub>adj</sub> 1.83 (95%CI = 1.45 -2.30)), suicidal thoughts (OR<sub>adj</sub> 2.18, (95%CI = 1.52 -3.13)), and suicide attempt (OR<sub>adj</sub>, 1.59, (95%CI = 1.32 -1.92)).

Paternal perinatal depression (PPND) and the mental health of fathers in the perinatal period continues to receive significantly less public attention. Overall prevalence rates of up to 25% have been documented in first-time fathers. The presence of maternal depression, unsatisfactory couple relationships, and certain psychosocial and biological risk factors are associated with poor paternal bonding and increased depression risk. Depressed fathers experience excessive self-criticism, restlessness, irritability, and aggression rather than low mood. Depression in new fathers can lead to drug and alcohol abuse, food behavior disorders, and lack of impulse control. PPND leads to developmental delay, mental health disorders, and emotional or behavioral problems in the offspring. PPND may also adversely affect a child's ability to learn new information, with lasting intellectual and scholastic consequences. There currently are no official criteria to diagnose PPND, and neither are there validated screening tools available to fathers. A family-focused approach should be considered in place of the historically gender-focused mood assessment. Nontraditional interventions such as Internet communities, e-therapy, or group workshops are shown to combat a father's contextual understanding of therapy. Group therapy with integrated cognitive behavioral therapy can address masculine norms surrounding the parenting roles of fathers and can help cultivate support networks that are otherwise absent among new dads.

Patients with severe depression symptoms showed significantly higher abundance of Phascolarctobacterium and Akkermansia, while enrichment of Akkermansia, Coprococcus and Streptococcus were observed with severe anxiety symptoms. In addition, fecal microbial metabolite indole-3-carboxyaldehyde proved useful to discriminate the severity of depression or anxiety symptoms.

Subjects with higher self-esteem levels had more depressive (β=0.726, P<0.001) and anxiety (β=0.335, P<0.001) disorders, associated with lower quality of life levels (β=-0.447, P<0.001 and β=-0.276, P=0.012), suggesting that self-esteem was defensive and inadequate. Our study found a high frequency of psychiatric disorders associated with low levels of self-esteem and quality of life.

The purpose of the current study was to determine if Time 2 (T2) trait self-esteem mediated levels of Time 1 (T1) retrospectively recalled parental child abuse predicting (T3) past-year major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms. The 18-year Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study included participants (N = 3294; T1 average age of 45.62 years) assessed at three different time points, each spaced about nine years apart. We performed structural equation mediation modeling analyses to determine how maternal and paternal child abuse at T1 would independently predict T3 MDD, GAD, PD, AUD, and SUD symptoms. We also examined whether T2 self-esteem mediated these relations while controlling for adulthood T1 psychopathology symptoms, demographics, socioeconomic status, somatic symptoms, and parental psychopathology. Consistent with our hypotheses, higher T1 maternal and paternal abuse predicted increased T3 GAD, PD, AUD, and SUD symptoms via diminished T2 self-esteem as the mediator (% proportion mediated = 33.0-100). However, childhood paternal, but not maternal, abuse predicted adulthood MDD symptoms via reduced self-esteem. Findings remained after adjusting for covariates.

Currently, the mental health issues among Chinese workers are becoming increasingly severe, especially under the backdrop of increased uncertainty in career advancement, where depression and anxiety issues among young workers are prominent. Based on the panel data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2018 and 2020, this paper constructs an OLS regression model to empirically analyze the impact of career advancement constraints on workers' mental health and its mechanism of action. The study finds that limited career advancement significantly increases workers' depression index. Pathways such as extended working hours, deteriorated health conditions, and distorted labor value concepts play a partial mediating role, thereby reducing mental health levels. Heterogeneity analysis shows that compared to female, low-income, and low-educated individuals, male, those with medium to high income, and higher education levels are more likely to experience a decline in mental health due to career advancement constraints. This study provides empirical evidence for understanding the impact of career advancement uncertainty on mental health and offers important insights for improving occupational mental health policies and enhancing worker welfare.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40802649/"}

A novel genetically sensitive design was used to test the extent of environmental links between maternal depression symptoms and child depression/anxiety symptoms, accounting for inherited effects, shared adversity, and child age and gender. Eight hundred fifty-two families with a child born by assisted conception provided questionnaire data. Mothers and fathers were genetically related or unrelated to the child depending on conception method. Parental depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Child depression/anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings questionnaire and six items tapping generalized anxiety disorder symptoms. Associations between maternal and child symptoms were examined separately for genetically unrelated and related mother-child pairs, adjusting for three measurements of shared adversity: negative life events, family income, and socioeconomic status. Analyses were then run separately for boys and girls and for children and adolescents, and the role of paternal depression symptoms was also examined. Significant associations between parent and child symptoms were found for genetically unrelated mother-child (r = 0.32, p < .001) and father-child (r = 0.17, p < .05) pairs and genetically related mother-child (r = 0.31, p < .001) and father-child (r = 0.23, p < .001) pairs and were not explained by the shared adversity measurements.

However, people with depressive disorders may experience episodes in response to minor stressors or \"out of the blue.\" Similar episodes can occur in people who do not have a disorder in response to severe events. This plurality of symptom patterns, occurring as it does in the absence of precise demarcation from normality has led to controversy over how depressive disorders should be defined, how common they are, and when treatment should be offered. Much of the controversy, however, may be illusory, arising from a tendency to view depressive disorders as defects or disease processes (the \"clincian's illusion\"). Avoiding the illusion involves understanding depression as a defense rather than a defect and requires consideration of aspects of signal detection theory and the associated \"smoke detector\" principle. This perspective may help to understand aspects of depressive disorders that are otherwise puzzling and controversial. In this paper, implications of signal detection theory and the \"smoke detector principle\" are explored: (1) conceptually, (2) using calculations performed in a spreadsheet and (3) using an agent-based model. Depressive episodes are conceptualized or represented as all-or-nothing phenomena activated in response to stressful life events. These events occur in an environment that also includes variable levels of baseline stress, creating a signal detection problem. The agent-based framework allows interaction with the environment as agents attempt to achieve an ideal level of adaptation. The smoke detector principle, if valid, may explain otherwise puzzling and controversial features of the depressive disorders, such as their lack of precise demarcation from normality, the role of life events and stressors and their patterns of prevalence. Signal detection concepts help to avoid the \"clinician's illusion\" in which aspects of functioning of the body's defenses are mistaken for a disease entity or defect. These principles emphasize inevitable difficulties that are encountered in attempts to conceptualize depressive disorders without reference to the environment in which they occur, and without addressing possible stochastic (randomly varying) elements. Because of the \"clinicians illusion\", current research priorities, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies, may be flawed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30572862/"}

It is however largely unknown to what extent affective disorders and its risk factors affect dispositional optimism. We examined the association between (lifetime) affective disorders and childhood trauma with dispositional optimism in a sample of 2104 subjects (aged 18-65 years) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Dispositional optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R). Diagnoses of depressive and anxiety disorders were based on the Composite Interview diagnostic Instrument (CIDI).Childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Interview (CTI) and life-events with the List of Threatening Events Questionnaire (LTQ). The 2104 participants were on average 46.0 (SD 13.1) years old and 65.8% were female. Multivariate analyses showed that dispositional optimism was inversely associated with current affective disorders (depression: B=-1.089 and anxiety: B=-1.066, both p<0.001), but also with remitted affective disorders (depression: B=-0.822 and anxiety: B=-0.558, both p<0.001) and severity of depression (B=-4.230; p<0.001). A history of childhood emotional maltreatment (B=-0.905, p<0.001) was related to lower optimism, whilst positive life-events were associated with higher levels of optimism (B=0.235, p>0.001). The cross-sectional design hampers inferences about causality. Lower levels of dispositional optimism are associated with stage of affective disorders, even after remission, and a history of childhood emotional maltreatment.

Yet, there is little empirical work that addresses affective vulnerability processes for mental health problems in such settings. To help address this gap in knowledge, the present investigation examined an interactive model of negative affectivity (tendency to experience negative mood states) and anxiety sensitivity (fear of the negative consequences of aversive sensations) among a Latino sample in primary care in terms of a relatively wide range of anxiety/depression indices. Participants included 390 Latino adults (Mage=38.7, SD=11.3; 86.9% female; 95.6% reported Spanish as first language) from a primary care health clinic. Primary dependent measures included depressive, suicidal, social anxiety, and anxious arousal symptoms, number of mood and anxiety disorders, and disability. Consistent with prediction, the interaction between negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity was significantly related to suicidal, social anxiety, and anxious arousal symptoms, as well as number of mood/anxiety diagnoses and disability among the primary care Latino sample. The form of the interactions indicated a synergistic effect, such that the greatest levels of each outcome were found among those with high negative affectivity and high anxiety sensitivity. There was a trending interaction for depressive symptoms. Overall, these data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is a clinically-relevant interplay between anxiety sensitivity and negative affectivity in regard to the expression of anxiety and depressive symptoms among a Latino primary care sample.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27359301/"}

The analysis, specifically, tests our prior model using a third time point, The following positive constructs were examined in relation to later positive mental health: resilience, social support, social rhythm, family affluence, physical health and expectations for fertility. Negative predictors depression, anxiety, and stress were also examined in relation to time 3 positive mental health. Participants included university student samples from Germany (N = 591) and China (N = 8,831). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of predictors on mental health. In China, three of the six salutogenic predictors (social rhythm regularity, positive mental health, resilience) at baseline were predictive of positive mental health at both follow-ups with generally small, but significant effects. Social support at baseline predicted more, and stress and anxiety predicted less positive mental health at follow-up 1, with generally small effects. Depression at baseline predicted less positive mental health at follow-up 2. In Germany, two of the six salutogenic predictors (positive mental health, social support) at baseline were predictive of positive mental health at both follow-ups, with generally small effects. Pathogenic predictors were not predictive of positive mental health at either follow-up. According to multi group analysis, the paths from positive mental health baseline to positive mental health follow-up 1 (FU1) as well as the path positive mental health FU1 to positive mental health follow-up 2 (FU2) were found to differ between Germany and China.

A probabilistic tractography approach was used to characterize differences in the size and anatomical trajectory of WM fibers traversing psychosurgery targets historically useful in the treatment of MDD (anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, and subcaudate tractotomy) in patients with MDD and low (n = 53) or high (n = 52) RNT, and healthy control subjects (n = 54). MDD samples were propensity matched on depression and anxiety severity and demographics. WM tracts traversing left hemisphere targets and reaching the ventral anterior body of the corpus callosum (thus extending to contralateral regions) were larger in the high-RNT MDD group compared with low-RNT (effect size D = 0.27, p = .042) and healthy control (D = 0.23, p = .02) groups. MDD was associated with greater size of tracts that converge onto the right medial orbitofrontal cortex regardless of RNT intensity. Other RNT-nonspecific findings in MDD involved tracts reaching the left primary motor and right primary somatosensory cortices.

Targeted disruption of the BBB in the female prefrontal cortex (PFC) induces anxiety- and depression-like behaviours. By comparing the endothelium cell-specific transcriptomic profiling of the mouse male and female PFC, we identify several pathways and genes involved in maladaptive stress responses and resilience to stress. Furthermore, we confirm that the BBB in the PFC of stressed female mice is leaky. Then, we identify circulating vascular biomarkers of chronic stress, such as soluble E-selectin. Similar changes in circulating soluble E-selectin, BBB gene expression and morphology can be found in blood serum and postmortem brain samples from women diagnosed with MDD.

The present study investigated whether acupuncture improves depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced using a single prolonged stress (SPS) as a PTSD rat model. In addition, we investigated whether the effects were mediated by increased mTOR activity and its downstream signaling components, which contribute to protein synthesis required for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. We found that acupuncture at HT8 significantly alleviated both depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by SPS in rats, as assessed by the forced swimming, elevated plus maze, and open field tests; this alleviation was blocked by rapamycin. The effects of acupuncture were equivalent to those exerted by fluoxetine. Acupuncture regulated protein translation in the mTOR signaling pathway and enhanced the activation of synaptic proteins, PSD95, Syn1, and GluR1 in the hippocampus.

Furthermore, external challenges were perceived as hindering more frequently than internal challenges. These findings can guide practitioners by providing potential starting points for improving the mental health of transitioning elite athletes, as well as information on helpful strategies and barriers during the transition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38608852/"}

These differences may be due to their unique social experiences. Despite these, studies that directly compare the rates and social factors of mental health conditions among men, women, and LGBT+ individuals including depression, anxiety, and stress, remain sparse. This study aimed to compare the rates and social factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among young adult Filipino heterosexual cisgender men and women and LGBT+ individuals. This study utilized a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Daily Discrimination Scale, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) to determine the difference between the rates and social factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among the respondents. A total of 959 young Filipino adults completed the questionnaire. Afterward, logistic regression, chi-square, and descriptive statistics were done. LGBT+ respondents experienced the highest rates of significant depression (92.0%), anxiety (93.8%), and stress (81.3%). Discrimination had the largest effect size among men and LGBT+ individuals. While age may be a risk factor for anxiety among heterosexual cisgender males, it was protective for stress among LGBT+ individuals. Working, studying, and living with peers had protective effects against anxiety and stress among heterosexual cisgender men and women. Rates and factors of depression, anxiety, and stress varied according to gender. This variation may be accounted for by unique social experiences and contexts including violence, discrimination, cultural expectations, and social roles. Thus, gender-sensitive mental healthcare may need to extend beyond binary views limited to men and women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35734786/"}

It is important to identify those at risk of harm to provide more effective psychological support. We aimed to identify participant characteristics associated with changes in depression and anxiety in participants of a behavioural weight management programme. In the Weight loss Referrals for Adults in Primary care trial, 1,267 adults with body mass index ≥28 kg/m2 were randomized to brief intervention, or WW (formerly weight watchers) for 12-weeks or 52-weeks and followed for 5 years. We used linear and multinomial regression to explore the association between participant characteristics and changes in depression and anxiety (measured by the hospital anxiety and depression scale). Where possible, the impact of missing data was investigated using multiple imputation. Higher baseline anxiety was associated with decreases in anxiety symptoms and increases in depression symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Higher baseline depression was associated with decreases in depression symptoms and increases in anxiety symptoms from baseline to follow-up. The magnitude of the associations was small. No further characteristics were consistently associated with changes in mental health. Evidence suggests that baseline depression and anxiety may indicate how depression and anxiety symptoms change during and after attending WW. Measurement of depression and anxiety at the start of a behavioural weight management programme and subsequent monitoring may facilitate timely psychological support if a deterioration in mental health is identified. Further research in large and diverse participant samples is required to clarify the findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35417915/"}

We focused on quantitative studies presenting primary data from Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development(OECD)countries. Language was restricted to English or German. To be eligible, a study had to involve (former) URM who immigrated to an OECD country. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, LIVIVO, PSYNDEX and PsycINFO were searched from 1990 to 2017. Studies were judged for eligibility by two independent reviewers each. We narratively summarised our results. 9 primary studies, all from Europe, examined gender differences in the mental health of URM. The majority of the included studies found female URM to be more often affected by post-traumatic or depressive symptoms than their male counterparts. There is only weak evidence regarding other mental health outcomes. Two studies each conducted gender-specific analyses on anxiety and externalising behaviour, but no statistically significant differences between female and male URM were detected. Female gender is associated with a higher vulnerability towards certain mental health problems among URM residing in Europe. However, the lack of representative studies using reliable diagnostic methods indicates that the findings so far should be treated with caution. Further research is needed to clarify the role of gender for mental health in URM and to examine underlying mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30061445/"}

We compared group and person-specific models of SAD-MDD comorbidity and hypothesized that individuals would demonstrate person-specific patterns of comorbidity factors that differed from the group. Cisgender women (N = 35) with SAD and a current or past major depressive episode were recruited. Ages ranged from 18 to 37 years old and a majority of women were White (n = 18; 51.43%).

Intra-daily depressed mood demonstrated the strongest connections to other variables and exhibited additional, unexpected temporal effects. All models demonstrated person-specific patterns relevant to SAD-MDD comorbidity. These results are descriptive in nature from women with a similar psychiatric profile. Future research integrating intensive EMA and personalized modeling within the context of experimental design is needed to determine the extent to which individuals truly differ from the group.

Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy for cardiac rehabilitation patients with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy plus usual cardiac rehabilitation to usual cardiac rehabilitation alone. Cardiac rehabilitation patients (target sample n = 332) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited across five UK National Health Service Trusts. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive six weekly sessions of group-based metacognitive therapy delivered by either cardiac rehabilitation professionals or research nurses. The intervention and control groups will both be offered the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme within their Trust. The primary outcome is severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score. Secondary outcomes are severity of anxiety/depression at 12-month follow-up, health-related quality of life, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and strength of metacognitive beliefs at 4- and 12-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will help to develop an account of barriers and enablers to the effectiveness of the intervention. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiac rehabilitation patients.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of depression among inmates and identify factors associated with it. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Jhumka Regional Prison, the largest prison in eastern Nepal, from September 2014 to August 2015. A total of 434 randomly selected inmates were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire examining socio-demographic characteristics, detention status, self-reported health problems, substance use status, and suicidal ideation. Depression was screened using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analysis were applied to determine the association between depression and related variables. The mean age of the participants was 35.7 years (SD 13.3). The prevalence of depression among the inmates was 35.3%. Approximately 2.3% reported suicidal ideation during imprisonment and 0.9% had attempted suicide inside the prison. In bivariate analysis, depression was significantly associated with previous incarceration (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.05-3.47, p = 0.033), poor self-rated health (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.16-2.64, p = 0.007), frequent appointments when encountering health problems (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.06-2.61, p = 0.028), suicidal ideation (OR = 4.44, 95%CI = 1.13-17.44, p = 0.038) and loss of weight (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.00-2.23, p = 0.049).

Food security is paramount to maintaining not only physical, but also mental health. There is an increasing need to understand the interplay between food insecurity (FI) and mental health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of FI on psychological health (anxiety and depression) as well as to examine the modifying effect of socioeconomic position on this relationship. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Maputo City, Mozambique, in 1,842 participants. Data were collected through structured interviews using a modified version of the US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Module to measure FI, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure anxiety and depression. A composite variable for psychological health was created. Propensity score matching and interaction effect analyses were employed to examine the effects of FI on psychological health and the moderating role of socioeconomic position. Of the 1,174 participants randomly assigned to propensity score matching, 787 were exposed to FI while 387 were unexposed. The analysis revealed stark disparities in psychological health outcomes associated with FI. The risk of poor psychological health among those exposed to FI was 25.79%, which was significantly higher than the 0.26% in unexposed individuals. The risk difference was 25.54% points (95% CI: 22.44-28.63), with a risk ratio of 99.82. Our assessment of population attributable fractions indicated that nearly all the risk for poor psychological health in the exposed group could be ascribed to FI. The interaction effects analysis revealed that socioeconomic status modifies this relationship. Specifically, heads of food-insecure households with a lower socioeconomic position tended to report poor mental health compared to their food-secure counterparts with a higher position. The findings underscore the profound impact of FI on the mental health of household heads in Maputo City, socioeconomic position being a significant modifier. Addressing household FI along with the socioeconomic position of household heads could be pivotal to mental health promotion, especially among vulnerable populations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39334082/"}

Two short versions of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (i.e., RCADS-25 and RCADS-20) seem to be feasible for administering at schools. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the RCADS-25 and RCADS-20 used as screening instruments for anxiety and depression in a general population of schoolchildren and adolescents. The RCADS-25 was completed by 69,487 schoolchildren and adolescents aged 8 to 18. The RCADS-25 and RCADS-20 broad anxiety scales are equal (15 items), but there are two versions of the major depressive disorder (MDD) scale: the RCADS-25 MDD scale (10 items) and the RCADS-20 MDD scale (5 items). The three scales were assessed on structural validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and hypotheses for construct validity. The RCADS-25/RCADS-20 broad anxiety scale demonstrated a sufficient structural validity (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.03), internal consistency (alpha = 0.82), test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.73), criterion validity (AUC = 0.79), and all four hypotheses concerning construct validity were confirmed. The RCADS-25 MDD scale demonstrated a sufficient test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.70) and three out of four hypotheses concerning construct validity were confirmed, but its structural validity was suspect (CFI = 0.89, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.09, SRMR = 0.06). The RCADS-20 MDD scale demonstrated a sufficient structural validity (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.04) and internal consistency (alpha = 0.72). Two out of four hypotheses concerning construct validity were confirmed. The test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.60) was insufficient. Since both MDD scales showed shortcomings, the shortening of the RCADS-25 MDD scale was re-examined post hoc by principal component and reliability analyses. The result was an MDD scale with seven items. The RCADS-25/RCADS-20 broad anxiety scale is valid and reliable for screening schoolchildren and adolescents, but the RCADS-25 and RCADS-20 MDD scales showed shortcomings.

Two convenience samples from Norway and Denmark were recruited during the early phase of the first lockdown in May 2020 using snowball sampling primarily by social media. Measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) for screening anxiety and depression, COVID-19 distress, and coping strategies applied during the lockdown. Descriptive analyses were applied as well as bivariate correlations for associations between coping and mental health measures. Levels of anxiety and depression were not alarmingly high, but being young, single, and female constituted a higher risk for poorer mental health. Applying positive reframing strategies was negatively associated with poor mental health and high COVID-19 stress, whereas distraction coping strategies were positively correlated with poor mental health and high COVID-19 stress. Applying positive reframing as a coping strategy may constitute a protective factor for mental health in the early phase of a crisis such as a pandemic.

We study the self-reported mental health of U.S. PwMS during COVID-19, prior to vaccine rollout. Methods A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to PwMS through iConquerMS (12/18/2020-02/10/2021). Depressive and anxiety symptom burdens and general mental health status were measured via the Patient-Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and PROMIS Global Mental Health scales. Linear regression models assessed associations between mental health variables and age, sex, disability status, comorbidities, and social determinants of health. Results Of 610 U.S. PwMS (mean age 56 years, standard deviation 11, range 20-85; female, 81%; relapsing remitting disease, 62%; previous depression diagnosis, 40%), the prevalences of moderate-to-severe depressive and anxiety symptom burden were 27.4% and 14.7%, respectively; 55.1% endorsed fair/poor general mental health. PwMS who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 47, 7.7%) reported higher depressive and anxiety symptom burdens (p < 0.05). Increased disability status score and social determinants of health were each associated with more depressive symptoms and worse general mental health. Younger age was associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptom burdens and worse general mental health. Female sex was associated with greater anxiety symptoms. Conclusion There are specific associations for worse mental health among PwMS during COVID-19 that reflect a combination of clinical, demographic, and social determinants of health.

We operationalized leaders' mental health using depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress reactivity. Our sample consisted of 322 followers of 75 leaders. Followers rated the LMX quality with their respective leader. Leaders rated depressive symptoms, anxiety, levels of stress reactivity, and LMX quality with their followers. Results of multilevel modeling showed that stress reactivity was negatively related to LMX quality and anxiety was positively linked to LMX agreement.

Data come from the Greater Beirut Area Cardiovascular Cohort (GBACC), with baseline and 5-year assessments of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and biological factors (n=198). Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7) symptoms were assessed at follow-up. We investigated associations between glycemic indicators and continuous mental health scores using first linear and then piecewise regression models. Adjusted piecewise regression models showed different associations with mental outcomes across glycemic indicators in the diabetic/clinical compared to the non-diabetic range: Among participants with <126 mg/dl baseline FBG, higher FBG levels in this range were significantly associated with lower depressive (beta=-0.12, 95%CI= [-0.207, -0.032]) and anxiety symptoms (beta=-0.099, 95%CI= [-0.186, -0.012]).

This study aims to investigate the association between having a public social media account and anxiety and depression in school-going adolescents. Overall, 80 secondary schools and further education colleges in England were sampled using a cross-sectional web-based survey as part of the 2023 OxWell Student Survey. Social media exposure was categorized among the adolescents as having a public social media account versus not having a public social media account. The risk of clinical anxiety and depression was determined using the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-11. Adolescents self-reported the content and platforms accessed in the previous 24 hours. Associations between having a public social media account and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using logistic regression controlling for age, sex, the experience of being bullied, parental guidance of online behavior (describing perceived parental approaches to adolescents' online activity), the proportion of close friendships engaged with online, poverty status, and placement in statutory care. Age, sex, and parental guidance of online behavior were assessed for primary association effect modification. Data collected from 16,655 adolescents (aged 11-18 y) were analyzed. Of these 16,655 adolescents, 6734 (40.43%) had a public social media account, while 9921 (59.57%) either had a private social media account or no social media account. Moreover, 32.6% (5429/16,655) of the adolescents screened positive for symptoms of anxiety and depression. Those with a public social media account had higher odds of anxiety and depression (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.32-1.50) than those without a public social media account in an unadjusted and fully adjusted model (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.29-1.49). Adolescents reporting active parental guidance had lower odds of anxiety and depression (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.93) than those reporting no parental guidance, and these parental approaches to online behaviors significantly modified the association between having a public social media account and symptoms of anxiety and depression (P=.004; χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>=11.1). Our OxWell study findings suggest a potential mental health risk for adolescents with a public social media account. We show evidence indicating some protection from anxiety and depression among adolescents who do not have a public social media account and those reporting some form of parental guidance of their online behavior. This was pronounced in adolescents reporting active parental guidance compared to stricter regulatory approaches or no guidance at all.

The Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI) is a clinical measure designed to differentiate melancholic and non-melancholic depression. This study aimed to investigate whether melancholic depression (as measured by the clinician rated version of the SMPI) predicted a better response to ECT than non-melancholic depression. The study included data collated from four participating sites in the Clinical Alliance for ECT and Related treatments (CARE) network. The primary outcome was response (>50% improvement) on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the secondary outcome was raw change in MADRS score. Of the 329 depressed patients included in the study, 81% had melancholic features and 76% met criteria for clinical response. SMPI defined melancholia was associated with older age, higher pre-treatment mood scores and presence of psychosis. Melancholia as defined by the SMPI, however, did not significantly predict either clinical response or overall mood improvement with ECT in multivariate analyses.

Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but little is known about its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression. The sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression. Irritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%. Children with higher levels of irritability or DMDD were more likely to have comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and a family history of depression. Results are based on a clinical sample, so may not be generalizable to children with ADHD in the general population. Irritability and DMDD were common, and were associated with markers of depression liability. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association between irritability and depression in youth with ADHD as they get older.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28363151/"}

This is being followed by a sustained rise of illnesses, especially mental health issues. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between depression and the factors associated with depression among the elderly. In a cross-sectional study, 299 elderly living in Hanoi, Vietnam, were approached for data collection. Self-reported depression among the elderly was 66.9% (32.8% mild, 30.4% moderate, and 3.7% severe cases). In multivariate analysis, there were significant associations between age, number of physical activities, number of medicine intake, and 3 domains of quality of life (physical health, psychological health, and environmental health) and depression. Age and the number of medicine intake are positively correlated with depression, accounting for 57.94% and 58.93%, respectively. On the contrary, the number of physical activities and the 3 domains of quality life mentioned above are negatively correlated with depression. In the urban setting of a developing country like Vietnam, the elderly have experienced common depression. Recognizing depression among the elderly-which is individual and social-helps us design public health programs.

Young people report using the internet for connecting with their peers and mental health support. However, how they may have used the internet for support during COVID-19 is not clear. We wanted to know how mood and internet use may have changed in young people during COVID-19 and if this was different for those with and without depression symptoms. 108 adolescents were recruited. Participants with high and low levels of depressive symptomatology answered questions about their mood, internet use, loneliness and life satisfaction during July and August 2020. We found that the high depression group reported significantly more loneliness and less life satisfaction than the low depression group. We found that most young people used the internet for mental health information during COVID-19 but that the high depression group used the internet more for mental health information than the low depression group. The high depression group also had a worsening of mood compared to the low depression group during COVID-19. We found that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic participants reported increased use of the internet compared to White participants during COVID-19 and that the role of the family facilitated coping during COVID-19 for some adolescents, but for others, it made the lockdown more difficult. Finally, we found that adolescents perceived school anxiety as stressful as COVID-19. To conclude this study supports the use of the internet as a way to help young people with mental health challenges. It also suggests that the internet is a way to help young people from ethnic minorities, who otherwise might be hard to reach, during challenging times. This study also shows that supportive family units can be important during times of stress for young people and that school anxiety is a major issue for young people in today's society even outside of the pandemic.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35897302/"}

This study used data from 9668 individuals who participated in waves 1 (1994-1995) and 4 (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Individuals were included if they had complete data on exposure to ACEs (physical and sexual abuse, emotional neglect, parental alcohol misuse, parental incarceration, and living with a single parent) and a valid sample weight. Statistical analysis was performed from November 6, 2017, to January 4, 2019. The association between team sports participation in grades 7 to 12 (wave 1) and diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and current depressive symptoms (determined by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale-10 scores) at ages 24 to 32 years (wave 4) among individuals exposed to ACEs. Multivariable logistic regression models were weighted based on propensity scores for factors associated with team sports participation and controlled for individual, family, and school characteristics. Interaction terms tested whether associations between team sports participation and mental health varied by sex. Of 9668 individuals included in the study (4470 male [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 15.2 [1.75] years), 4888 (49.3%) reported 1 or more ACE and 2084 (21.3%) reported 2 or more ACEs.

{"id": "27063089", "title": "Theory of psychological adaptive modes.", "text": "When an individual is facing a stressor and normal stress-response mechanism cannot guarantee sufficient adaptation, special emotional states, adaptive modes, are activated (for example a depressive reaction). Adaptive modes are involuntary states of mind, they are of comprehensive nature, they interfere with normal functioning, and they cannot be repressed or controlled the same way as many emotions. Their transformational nature differentiates them from other emotional states. The object of the adaptive mode is to optimize the problem-solving abilities according to the situation that has provoked the mode. Cognitions and emotions during the adaptive mode are different than in a normal mental state. These altered cognitions and emotional reactions guide the individual to use the correct coping skills in order to deal with the stressor. Successful adaptation will cause the adaptive mode to fade off since the adaptive mode is no longer necessary, and the process as a whole will lead to raised well-being. However, if the adaptation process is inadequate, then the transformation period is prolonged, and the adaptive mode will turn into a dysfunctional state. Many psychiatric disorders are such maladaptive processes. The maladaptive processes can be turned into functional ones by using adaptive skills that are used in functional adaptive processes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27063089/"}

BDHI scores in the different groups were investigated by Generalized Linear Model Analysis. Association between dependent and independent variables in the model was tested by the likelihood ratio Chi-square statistic. Diagnosis and genotype showed a significant association with several aggressive/hostile traits. Interaction of the two main effects was also significant in case of several subscales. Post hoc analyses indicated a significant association between BDHI subscales and s allele only in the depressed group. Only women were studied and since gender differences are present both in aggressive behavior and putatively in the behavioral effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype, our findings pertain only to females. Our results indicate a robust relationship between aggression/hostility and 5-HTTLPR genotype, but this association is more marked in the presence of depression. The presence of the s allele thus not only contributes to a higher risk of depression, but in depressives also leads to higher aggression/hostility. Our results have important implications for suicide research, since the s allele is associated with violent suicide, and this association may be mediated through the emergence of increased aggression/hostility in depressed patients carrying the s allele.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21492940/"}

Linear regression was used to test the association between ACEs' and mental health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness). Split-sample regressions were conducted on rural/small town/suburban and urban MSM. ACEs were associated with all three mental health outcomes in the full sample. However, ACEs were significantly linked to anxiety and depressive symptoms only in urban MSM. Limitations include a smaller sample size with limited racial/ethnic variations. Results suggest that living in an urban environment may amplify the risks of ACEs, rural/small town/suburban MSM may acquire outside, unique support networks which work to limit the effect of ACEs, or that rural/small town/suburban MSM may manifest the effects of ACEs differently (or a combination of the three).

In patients meeting FM criteria, moderate drinking was associated with lower pain severity, interference, and depression, and higher physical function. Results in non-FM patients were similar to the total sample. Moderate alcohol consumption in chronic pain patients was associated with decreased pain severity and interference, fewer painful body areas, lower somatic and mood symptoms, and increased physical function.

Participants completed three waves of measurement (T1, T2, and T3) spaced nine years apart. GAD and MDD symptom severity were assessed at T1, T2, and T3 (Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form). Stress reactivity (Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire) was measured at T2. Structural equation mediation modeling demonstrated that higher T1 GAD symptoms positively predicted more severe T3 MDD symptoms via T2 stress reactivity, controlling for T1 MDD (d = 0.45-0.50). However, T2 stress reactivity was not a significant mediator in the relationship between T1 MDD severity and T3 GAD symptoms after controlling for T1 GAD. Direct effects indicated that T1 GAD positively predicted T3 MDD 18 years later and vice versa (d = 1.29-1.65). Stress reactivity was assessed using a self-report measure, limiting conclusions to perceived (vs. physiologically indexed) stress reactivity. These findings indicate that stress reactivity may be one mechanism through which GAD leads to later MDD over prolonged durations.

An example of such technology is the Q-Life app which aims to improve people's resilience to stress and adverse life events through various coping mechanisms, including journaling. Using a combination of sentiment analysis and thematic analysis methods, this paper presents the results of analyzing 6023 journal entries from 755 users. We uncover both positive and negative factors that are associated with resilience. First, we apply two lexicon-based and eight machine learning (ML) techniques to classify journal entries into positive or negative sentiment polarity, and then compare the performance of these classifiers to determine the best performing classifier overall. Our results show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the best classifier overall, outperforming other ML classifiers and lexicon-based classifiers with a high F1-score of 89.7%. Second, we conduct thematic analysis of negative and positive journal entries to identify themes representing factors associated with resilience either negatively or positively, and to determine various coping mechanisms. Our findings reveal 14 negative themes such as stress, worry, loneliness, lack of motivation, sickness, relationship issues, as well as depression and anxiety. Also, 13 positive themes emerged including self-efficacy, gratitude, socialization, progression, relaxation, and physical activity. Seven (7) coping mechanisms are also identified including time management, quality sleep, and mindfulness. Finally, we reflect on our findings and suggest technological interventions that address the negative factors to promote resilience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35139031/"}

We used data from an 18-country survey to explore these issues (n = 18,838), taking self-reported doctor-prescribed medication for depression and/or anxiety as an indicator of a CMD (n = 2698, 14%). Intrinsic motivation for visiting nature was high for all, though slightly lower for those with CMDs. Most individuals with a CMD reported visiting nature ≥ once a week. Although perceived social pressure to visit nature was associated with higher visit likelihood, it was also associated with lower intrinsic motivation, lower visit happiness and higher visit anxiety. Individuals with CMDs seem to be using nature for self-management, but 'green prescription' programmes need to be sensitive, and avoid undermining intrinsic motivation and nature-based experiences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159132/"}

SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined multimodally by self-report, throat swabs (acute infections) and antibody measurements (previous infections). Participants completed self-report questionnaires on mental health. Neither unknowing nor knowing SARS-CoV-2 infection had an impact on mental health. However, symptom severity and previous depression or anxiety predicted higher levels of depressiveness, anxiety and somatic complaints. Our results confirm findings suggesting that the severity of the initial infection and previous mental illness, but not knowledge of the infection, are the most important predictors of negative mental health outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is hypothesized to be a syndromatic manifestation of multiple pathological processes leading to similar clinical manifestation. MDD is associated with at least three categories of peripheral hormone-type factors including neurotrophic factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and processes that impair regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Neuroimaging studies have identified functional abnormalities including subcortical systems associated with reward and emotion processing, medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions and the lateral prefrontal cortical systems involved in cognitive control and voluntary emotion regulation. Studies investigating the effects of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy on functional brain measures show normalization of brain function with return to euthymia. Nevertheless, approximately 50% of patients with MDD will not respond sufficiently and 60 to 70% will not achieve full remission with first-line pharmacotherapy, therefore clinicians strive to improve patient responses through the use of adjunct therapies. This review discusses recent research in the various biological processes associated with MDD as well as recent data in support of the use of adjunctive non-pharmacological therapies including psychotherapy, bibliotherapy, Internet therapy, \"natural\" or herbal approaches, exercise therapy, and somatic therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25539873/"}
{"id": "9268773", "title": "The depressive spectrum: diagnostic classification and course.", "text": "The spectrum of depression is much wider than that reflected in the current diagnostic nomenclature. A large proportion of subjects with depression both in treatment and in the community fail to meet diagnostic criteria for either major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia. Inclusion of subthreshold categories of depression dramatically improves the coverage of treated depression, particularly in community samples, and better enables the characterization of its longitudinal course. This paper investigates the application of diagnostic criteria for both threshold and subthreshold categories of depression in a prospective longitudinal community study of young adults from Zurich, Switzerland. We present the prevalence and treatment rates of each of the depressive subtypes, the degree of diagnostic overlap and the longitudinal stability of subthreshold and threshold categories of depression. The findings indicate that the prevalence rates of subthreshold categories of depression are quite high in the community, and that a substantial proportion of subthreshold depressives, particularly those with recurrent depression, receive treatment. There is a strong tendency for individuals to meet multiple depressive subtypes over time, with little stability of individual categories among those who continue to manifest depression over a 15-year period. The prospective longitudinal data reveal that major depression is both an antecedent to and sequela of subthreshold categories, providing evidence for the validity of the spectrum concept of depression. However, the need for a threshold for the symptom criteria is suggested by the lack of predictive value of minor depression and depressive symptoms only. These result suggest that both the current symptom threshold for a depressive syndrome and recurrence, but not the minimum duration of depressive episodes, are important components of the classification of depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9268773/"}

We investigated whether a walking intervention program may decrease the occurrence of depressive symptoms in inactive post-menopausal women without depression. A total of 121 participants aged 57-75 years were randomly assigned to a six-month moderate intensity walking intervention (three times a week, 40 minutes per session, supervised and home-based) or to a control group (waiting list). Inactivity was assessed using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for the Elderly. Depression levels were measured pre- and post-intervention with the Beck depression inventory (BDI). Several baseline measures were considered as possible predictors of post-intervention BDI score. Participants in the walking intervention showed a significant decrease in depression as compared with controls. Baseline cognitive-BDI subscore, subjective health status, body mass index and adherence were post-intervention BDI score predictors. A six-month, three-session per week, moderate intensity walking intervention with a minimal 50% adherence rate reduces depression in post-menopausal women at risk for depression due to physical inactivity.

In contrast, sustained quality social connections (QSCs) can improve mental health outcomes. However, few studies have examined how these quality connections affect depression and anxiety outcomes within digital interventions, and conceptualization is limited. The aim of this study is to conceptualize, appraise, and synthesize evidence on QSC within digital interventions (D-QSC) and the impact on depression and anxiety outcomes for young people aged 14-24 years. A systematic scoping review and meta-analysis was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological frameworks and guided by experts with lived experience. Reporting was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases were searched against a comprehensive combination of key concepts on June 24, 2020. The search concepts included young people, digital intervention, depression, anxiety, and social connection. Google was also searched. A reviewer independently screened abstracts and titles and full text, and 9.99% (388/3882) of these were screened by a second reviewer. A narrative synthesis was used to structure the findings on indicators of D-QSC and mechanisms that facilitate the connection. Indicators of D-QSC from the included studies were synthesized to produce a conceptual framework. Of the 5715 publications identified, 42 (0.73%) were included. Among the included studies, there were 23,319 participants. Indicators that D-QSC was present varied and included relatedness, having a sense of belonging, and connecting to similar people. However, despite the variation, most of the indicators were associated with improved outcomes for depression and anxiety. Negative interactions, loneliness, and feeling ignored indicated that D-QSC was not present. In 24% (10/42) of the applicable studies, a meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in depression (-25.6%, 95% CI -0.352 to -0.160; P<.001) and anxiety (-15.1%, 95% CI -0.251 to -0.051; P=.003) after a D-QSC. Digital mechanisms that helped create a quality connection included anonymity, confidentiality, and peer support. In contrast, mechanisms that hindered the connection included disconnection from the real world and inability to see body language. Data synthesis also identified a 5-component conceptual framework of D-QSC that included rapport, identity and commonality, valued interpersonal dynamic, engagement, and responded to and accepted. D-QSC is an important and underconsidered component for youth depression and anxiety outcomes. Researchers and developers should consider targeting improved QSC between clinicians and young people within digital interventions for depression. Future research should build on our framework to further examine relationships among individual attributes of QSC, various digital interventions, and different populations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927592/"}

Although they often co-occur, the relationship between symptoms of depression and loneliness remains poorly understood. This study investigates: (a) the symptoms of depression that are connected to loneliness; (b) the role played by loneliness in the network of depression symptoms; and (c) whether the method used to measure loneliness (single-item direct or multi-item indirect) affects the relationship of loneliness with depressive symptoms. Participants were 496 Polish adolescents (50.8% girls) aged 11 to 13, who completed: (a) the 10-item Major Depressive Disorder subscale of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; (b) the 11-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (indirect loneliness), and (c) a single direct question evaluating loneliness: 'I'm lonely'. Networks were estimated using a Gaussian Graphical Model. Loneliness shows a direct relationship with three affective symptoms of depression: sadness, worthlessness, and anhedonia, which mediate relationships with somatic symptoms. In contrast to previous studies, loneliness has the lowest level of centrality among all elements of the network. The method used to assess loneliness did not significantly affect the connections between loneliness and depressive symptoms. Loneliness and depression overlap since they are formed by the same cognitive biases and deficits in emotion regulation but differ in the level of generality. In loneliness, they have an interpersonal context, while symptoms of depression can be intrapersonal. This helps us to understand why cognitive interventions, as compared to those which are social, are more effective in reducing loneliness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37550521/"}

How Perceived Neighbor Attitudes Toward Latinos Influence Mental Health Among a Pregnant Latina Cohort.", "text": "Latina women living in the USA experience disproportionately higher rates of psychological distress compared to their non-Latina White counterparts. Poor maternal mental health during pregnancy can contribute to intergenerational mental health disparities. Through this pathway, mothers' experiences, environments, and exposures (henceforth \"exposures\") during pregnancy become biologically embodied and can negatively affect the fetus and life-long developmental trajectories of her child. One of the exposures that can affect mother-offspring dyads is the neighborhood. With the goal of integrating anthropological and sociological theories to explain mental health disparities among pregnant Latina women, we explored how perceptions of neighbor attitudes may influence mental health during pregnancy. We analyzed self-reported responses from 239 pregnant Latina women in Southern California (131 foreign-born, 108 US-born) on their mental health and perceived attitudes of their neighbors using multiple linear regression models. Among foreign-born Latina women, living in neighborhoods with more favorable views of Latinos was associated with lower depression scores (pooled β =  - .70, SE = .29, p = .019) and lower pregnancy-related anxiety scores (pooled β =  - .11, SE = .05, p = .021), but greater state anxiety scores (pooled β = .09, SE = .04, p = .021). Among US-born women, there were no associations between neighbor attitudes and mental health. Overall, results suggest that social environments are correlated with mental health and that foreign-born and US-born Latinas have varied mental health experiences in the USA.

Addressing the mental health challenges of Ukrainian refugees is critical to promoting their resilience and successful integration into host communities. Traditional support group interventions might be challenging to implement for geographically dispersed populations, making the metaverse an innovative and inclusive platform for providing much-needed support to such populations. Displaced Ukrainian refugee adults (18 years or older) without current psychiatric diagnoses or current involvement in therapeutic interventions are included in the study. Participants are randomized to one of three conditions: (1) Metaverse Support Groups, (2) In-Person Support Groups, or (3) Waitlist. Both intervention groups (Metaverse and In-Person) undergo 5 support group sessions, and data are collected at baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are depressive symptomatology and anxiety. Secondary outcomes are perceived social support, well-being, and gender-based violence awareness. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to test the efficacy of support groups in the Metaverse for the Ukrainian refugee population.

Independent variables consisted of a range of demographic, psychiatric, and disease-specific markers. In the most parsimonious model of persistent anxiety, higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, a history of anxiety, fewer years of education, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, lower Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores, female sex, and complications of therapy (higher Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part IV scores) were all associated with more severe persistent anxiety. Markers associated with more severe episodic anxiety included PD-specific disturbances of activities of daily living, complications of therapy, higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, female sex, and a history of anxiety. Finally, higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, a history of anxiety, complications of therapy, and longer disease duration were associated with avoidance behavior. After excluding clinically depressed patients with PD, disease severity and longer disease duration were significantly associated with episodic anxiety, but not with persistent anxiety.

Religiosity and spirituality have been found to be associated with a variety of mental health and illness parameters. In the last decades there is an increasing number of publications with interesting results on the relationship between religiosity and mental health, both on a theoretical and a clinical level. Recent research suggests the presence of clinically important interactions between religious beliefs and mental health, although the exact nature of the associations remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to investigate subjective health status in relation to specific dimensions of religiosity and spirituality in Greek students; 202 students of the faculty of Theology of the University of Athens were interviewed using the Brief Multidimensional Measurement of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS), which assesses the dimensions of \"daily spiritual experiences\", \"meaning\", \"values/beliefs\", \"forgiveness\", \"private religious practices\", \"religious/spiritual coping\", \"religious support\", \"religious/ spiritual history\", \"commitment\", \"organizational religiousness\", and \"religious preferences\". Subjective health status was measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) which examines four areas of health in the following sub-scales: (a) somatic symptoms, (b) anxiety and insomnia, (c) social dysfunction and (d) severe depression. Pearson correlations coefficients and linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations of GHQ-28 subscales with religiosity dimensions. High scores in each dimension of BMMRS corresponded to a low level of religiosity. The dimension of \"daily spiritual experiences\" was positively correlated with the subscales of anxiety/ insomnia, social dysfunction and severe depression, while the dimension of \"values/beliefs\" with social dysfunction and severe depression and the dimension of \"forgiveness\" with all GHQ-28 subscales. The \"organizational religiousness\" dimension was positively correlated with anxiety/ insomnia, while overall self-ranking with social dysfunction and severe depression. Additionally, the dimension of \"meaning\" had a negative correlation with somatic symptoms. Moreover, in the multiple linear regression analyses, \"meaning\" was independently negative associated with somatic symptoms (p=0.032), whilst \"daily spiritual experiences\" were positively associated with anxiety/insomnia (p=0.023).

GDS-15 score six months after initial completion of GDS-15. 895 (88.6%) of the 1010 participants randomised into REFORM had a valid baseline and six-month GDS-15 score and were included in this study. The mean GDS-15 baseline score was 3.5 (SD 3.0, median 3.0, range 0-15); 639 (71.4%) scored 0-4, 204 (22.8%) scored 5-9 indicating mild depression, and 52 (5.8%) scored 10 or higher indicating severe depression. At six months follow-up, those scoring 10 points or higher at baseline had, on average, a reduction of 1.08 points on the GDS-15 scale (95% confidence interval -1.83 to -0.33, p = 0.005) compared to those scoring less than 10, using the simplest linear regression model. Case finding of depression in podiatry patients based on a GDS-15 score of 10 or more followed by a letter to their General Practitioner significantly reduced depression severity. Whether this applies to all older patients in primary care is unknown. Further research is required to confirm these findings.

Reports from parents and teachers suggest that AD patients may also have attention problems. However, attention has not yet been directly assessed in AD patients. We utilized an objective, computer-based continuous performance test (CPT) validated for use in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis to formally evaluate attention in adolescent AD subjects. This was a single-visit, cross-sectional, non-interventional study of moderate-to-severe (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] ≥ 3) AD subjects aged 12-17 years without clinician-diagnosed ADHD. Attention was evaluated using two performance-based measures: Conners, CPT-3 and the Stroop Color and Word Test. The primary parameter was CPT-3 detectability (d') measure. Lesional severity measures included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and body surface area (BSA) involvement. Subjects completed self-report rating scales assessing sensory responsiveness patterns (Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile [AASP]), itch (Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [PP-NRS]), skin pain, quality of life, sleep, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. A total of 44 subjects were included in the study (61.4% female; mean age 15.0 [SD 1.78] years; mean EASI 20.4 [SD 7.8]; mean PP-NRS 7.0 [SD 1.8]). Results indicated substantial disease impact on sleep, quality of life, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.

As a part of standard care, the CES-D and the PHQ were administered to YLWH. A Retrospective review of patient records was conducted. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and reports from mental health providers, researchers compared the utility of the screeners. The sample consisted of 121 cases from 2017.

This study examined the potential mediating role of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in the association between parent psychopathology and child mental disorder. Data come from 100 children diagnosed with a mental disorder [major depression (66 %), generalized anxiety (58 %), attention-deficit hyperactivity (33 %), oppositional defiant (35 %)] and their parents. Parent psychopathology was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Child mental disorder was measured using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and hair samples were assayed using high-sensitivity ELISA for cortisol extraction. Sex-specific path models were specified to estimate mediating effects (αβ). Children were, on average, 14.4 (SD 2.3) years of age and 70 % were girls. Adjusting for child age, parent sex, and family income, HCC mediated the association between symptoms of parent psychopathology and major depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity in all children (αβ ranging -0.07 to 0.19; 38-46 % effect mediated). Mediating effects for generalized anxiety and opposition defiant were evident for boys only (αβ ranging -0.26 to 0.14; 31-38 % effect mediated). Evidence suggests HCC partially mediates the association between parent psychopathology and child mental disorder, and for generalized anxiety and oppositional defiant, this effect is specific to boys. Family inventions to reduce child stress may be effective in buffering the consequences of parent psychopathology. Further research that considers sex effects is needed to clarify how HCC conditions risk for mental disorder in children.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32088544/"}

Pandemics are inherently social phenomena, and public health measures intended to curtail transmission of COVID-19 (e.g., quarantine and social distancing) have consequences for individuals with anxiety and depression. Using qualitative methods, respondents with previously diagnosed anxiety or depression identified ways in which COVID-19 affected their symptoms at multiple levels of the social ecological model (SEM). Key themes reported were organized following the SEM. Emergent themes at the individual level are isolation/loneliness, fear of contracting COVID-19, and uncertainty about the future. Themes at the interpersonal level are: fears of family contracting COVID-19, separation from family members, and domestic relationships. Themes at the level of community and societal stressors are: employment, community and societal systems, media, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings demonstrate the ways that mental health, physical health/safety, and social environments are interrelated in the experience of COVID-19 for individuals diagnosed with anxiety or depression.

Adolescents in eighth, ninth, or 11<sup>th</sup> grade self-reported sports team participation, elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, experiencing past-month SOGIE-BB, specific gender identity, race/ethnicity, and access to resources. We identified groups with highest prevalences of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms by sports team participation (any/none), experiences of SOGIE-BB (any/none), and social positions using Exhaustive Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detections. Via post-hoc tests, we determined whether prevalences differed between adolescents with the same social positions 1) without SOGIE-BB, 2) with sports participation, and 3) without SOGIE-BB and with sports participation. <b>Results:</b> Experiencing SOGIE-BB comprised each of the highest prevalence elevated depressive and anxiety groups. Four of 7 groups with elevated depressive symptoms and 3 of 4 groups with elevated anxiety symptoms reported no sports participation. Among adolescents sharing social positions, experiencing no SOGIE-BB was significantly associated with lower prevalences of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Measures of well-being, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, barriers self-efficacy, self-regulation and behavioural predictors (e.g., attitudes and behavioural intentions) were taken at baseline, 1-month (post-intervention) and 2-months (follow-up). Linear regression examined intervention effects between and within groups. Longitudinal mediation analyses explored indirect effects through health behaviour cognitions. Three hundred participants completed post-intervention measures. Those receiving mindfulness training reported significantly better well-being (M<sub>difference</sub> = 2.34, 95%CIs .45-4.24, p = .016), lower depression (M<sub>difference</sub> = -1.47, 95%CIs -2.38 to -.56, p = .002) and anxiety symptoms (M<sub>difference</sub> = -.77, 95%CIs -1.51 to -.02, p = .045) than controls. Improvements in well-being and depression were maintained at follow-up. Intervention effects on primary outcomes were mediated by attitudes towards health maintenance and behavioural intentions. Mediating effects of attitudes remained when controlling for prior scores in models of depression and well-being. Digital, self-administered mindfulness practice for 30 days meaningfully improved psychological health, at least partially due to improved attitudes towards health behaviours and stronger behavioural intentions. This trial found that digital mindfulness is a promising and scalable well-being tool for the general population, and highlighted its role in supporting health behaviours.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39169217/"}

The present study examined the ability to recognize cases of depression as a function of respondent and target gender, as well as individual psychological differences in attitudes toward persons with depression. In a representative British general population survey, the ability to correctly recognize vignettes of depression was assessed among 1,218 adults. Respondents also rated the vignettes along a number of attitudinal dimensions and completed measures of attitudes toward seeking psychological help, psychiatric skepticism, and anti-scientific attitudes. There were significant differences in the ability to correctly identify cases of depression as a function of respondent and target gender. Respondents were more likely to indicate that a male vignette did not suffer from a mental health disorder compared to a female vignette, and women were more likely than men to indicate that the male vignette suffered from a mental health disorder. Attitudes toward persons with depression were associated with attitudes toward seeking psychological help, psychiatric skepticism, and anti-scientific attitudes. Initiatives that consider the impact of gender stereotypes as well as individual differences may enhance mental health literacy, which in turn is associated with improved help-seeking behaviors for symptoms of mental ill-health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23166769/"}

Surveys from 111 African American women, ages 18-44, who reside in Allegheny County, PA, were used to gather demographic information and measures of depressive symptoms and financial distress/financial well-being. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that perceived financial distress was significantly associated with levels of depressive symptoms. To assess financial priorities and needs, responses to two open-ended questions were analyzed and coded for common themes: \"Imagine you won a $10,000 prize in a local lottery. What would you do with this money?\" and \"What kinds of programs or other help would be beneficial to you during times of financial difficulties?\" The highest five priorities identified by the participants were paying bills and debt, saving, purchasing a home or making home repairs, and/or helping others.

Conversely, children's mental health symptoms may impact parents' experiences of negative emotions. Therefore, mental health symptoms can have bidirectional effects in parent-child relationships, particularly during moments of distress or frustration (e.g., when a parent or child makes a costly mistake). The present study used simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of parent-adolescent dyads to examine how brain activity when responding to each other's costly errors (i.e., dyadic error processing) may be associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. While undergoing simultaneous fMRI scans, healthy dyads completed a task involving feigned errors that indicated their family member made a costly mistake. Inter-brain, random-effects multivariate modeling revealed that parents who exhibited decreased medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex activation when viewing their child's costly error response had children with more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Adolescents with increased anterior insula activation when viewing a costly error made by their parent had more anxious parents. These results reveal cross-brain associations between mental health symptomatology and brain activity during parent-child dyadic error processing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31766006/"}
{"id": "21451189", "title": "Neurocognition and psychogenetic vulnerability in depression.", "text": "The clinical symptoms of major depression are paralleled by typical neurocognitive deficits. The relation of STin2 - one of the polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene - to major depressive disorder (MDD) is less widely investigated. The aim of the present study was to measure the neurocognitive functions of major depressive patients and healthy controls, and identify vulnerability markers of the disease. The frequency of STin2 polymorphism and its effect on neurocognition was investigated in major depression. The gender differences in neurocognitive impairment in patients with major depressive disorder were also studied. Relative to controls, patients with depression showed significant impairment on most neurocognitive tasks, but not in tasks measuring visuo-spatial function, which may suggest intact hippocampal function in depression. We found a significantly higher frequency of the STin2 10/10 genotype in the MDD patient group compared to controls. Our results suggest that the presence of STin2.10 and absence of STin2.12 may be considered a possible genetic endophenotype for cognitive dysfunction detected in major depressive disorder. Depressed women performed significantly worse on tests of cognitive interference and visual recall threshold compared to depressed men. In the light of neuroimaging studies our results suggest that the lateralisation of hippocampal function may play an important role in the background of gender differences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21451189/"}
{"id": "32359726", "title": "Attentional biases in depression: Relation to disorder severity, rumination, and anhedonia.", "text": "According to cognitive models of depression, selective attentional biases (ABs) for mood-congruent information are core vulnerability factors of depression maintenance. However, findings concerning the presence of these biases in depression are mixed. This study aims to clarify the presence of these ABs among individuals with clinical and subclinical depression. We compared three groups based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview and a depressive symptoms scale (BDI-II): 34 individuals with major depressive disorder (clinically depressed); 35 with a dysphoric mood but without the criteria of major depressive disorder (i.e., subclinically depressed), and 26 never been depressed individuals. We examined AB for sad and happy materials in three modified versions of the exogenous cueing task using scenes, facial expressions, and words. Brooding, anhedonia, and anxiety were also evaluated. In contrast to our hypotheses, there were no ABs for negative or positive information, regardless of the task and the groups. Neither the association between AB toward negative information and brooding nor the one between AB away from positive stimuli and anhedonia was significant. Bayes factors analyses revealed that the present pattern of findings does not result from a lack of statistical power. Our results raise questions about how common AB is in depression. From a theoretical point of view, because individuals with depression did not exhibit AB, our results also seemingly challenge the claim that AB figures prominently in the maintenance of depression. We believe the present null results to be particularly useful for future meta-research in the field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359726/"}
{"id": "36192794", "title": "Real-world depression, anxiety and safety outcomes of intramuscular ketamine treatment: a retrospective descriptive cohort study.", "text": "Ketamine has emerged as a promising pharmacotherapy for depression and other mental illnesses, and the intramuscular (IM) administration of ketamine is now offered at many North American outpatient psychiatric clinics. However, a characterization of the outpatient population receiving IM ketamine treatment and an evaluation of the real-world depression, anxiety, and safety outcomes of long-term psychiatric IM ketamine treatment has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and adverse events of patients receiving IM ketamine treatment. Patient data from the electronic health records of a private outpatient psychiatric clinic network in the United States were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Adults with any psychiatric diagnosis who received ketamine treatment only by IM administration from January 2018 to June 2021 were included. A total of 452 patients were included in the cohort. Patients receiving IM ketamine treatment had a mean of 2.8 (SD 1.4) psychiatric diagnoses. 420 (93%) patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, 243 (54%) patients had a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, and 126 (28%) patients had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients received a median of 4 (range 1-48) IM ketamine treatments. Median depression scores (PHQ-9) improved 38% from 16.0 (IQR 11.3-21.8) at baseline to 10.0 (IQR 6.0-15.0) at last treatment (p < .001). Median anxiety scores (GAD-7) improved 50% from 14.0 (IQR 8.0-17.0) at baseline to 7.0 (IQR 4.3-11.8) at last treatment (p < .001). With maintenance ketamine treatments, average improvements in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scores of at least 4.7 and 4.9 points were maintained for over 7 months. An adverse event occurred during 59 of 2532 treatments (2.3%). IM ketamine is being utilized to treat psychiatric outpatients with multiple mental illnesses not limited to depression. Average depression and anxiety levels significantly improve throughout IM ketamine treatment and do not regress to baseline during patients' maintenance treatment phase. Prospective studies are recommended to confirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of IM ketamine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36192794/"}
{"id": "37644768", "title": "Positive psychology interventions can improve mental health for chronic pain patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "text": "This study examines the efficacy of positive psychology interventions (PPIs) for patients with chronic pain through a systematic review and meta-analysis. PPIs are defined as strategies that involve focusing on positive emotions, thoughts, and behaviors that improve mental health by increasing mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. The search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Subjective, psychological, and social well-being were used as indicators of mental well-being, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were used as indicators of psychological distress. Results: Nine studies were included. Eight studies evaluated subjective well-being, seven evaluated depression, and three evaluated anxiety symptoms. No studies examined psychological well-being, social well-being, or stress. PPIs were found to be effective in promoting subjective well-being post-treatment (Hedges' <i>g</i> = 0.40; 95% CI [0.06, 0.73]) and reducing anxiety (Hedges' g = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.59, -0.06]), but no significant results were found for depression (Hedges' g = -0.23, 95% CI [-0.50, 0.04]). The included investigations, while limited, suggest the utility of PPIs in mitigating the psychological consequences of chronic pain. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to implement PPI practices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37644768/"}
