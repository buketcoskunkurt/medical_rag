Despite enthusiasm for the notion of population-based approaches to mental health, concrete guidance about what such approaches entail is lacking, and evidence of their effectiveness has not been integrated. Drawing from research and scholarship across multiple disciplines, this review provides a concrete definition of population-based approaches to mental health, situates these approaches within their historical context in the United States, and summarizes the nature of these approaches and their evidence. These approaches span three domains: (<i>a</i>) social, economic, and environmental policy interventions that can be implemented by legislators and public agency directors, (<i>b</i>) public health practice interventions that can be implemented by public health department officials, and (<i>c</i>) health care system interventions that can be implemented by hospital and health care system leaders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905323/"}

This study aims to start an international, interdisciplinary and inclusive dialogue to answer the question: What are the core concepts of mental health? 50 people with expertise in the field of mental health from 8 countries completed an online survey. They identified the extent to which 4 current definitions were adequate and what the core concepts of mental health were. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted of their responses. The results were validated at a consensus meeting of 58 clinicians, researchers and people with lived experience. 46% of respondents rated the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC, 2006) definition as the most preferred, 30% stated that none of the 4 definitions were satisfactory and only 20% said the WHO (2001) definition was their preferred choice. The least preferred definition of mental health was the general definition of health adapted from Huber et al (2011). The core concepts of mental health were highly varied and reflected different processes people used to answer the question. These processes included the overarching perspective or point of reference of respondents (positionality), the frameworks used to describe the core concepts (paradigms, theories and models), and the way social and environmental factors were considered to act. The core concepts of mental health identified were mainly individual and functional, in that they related to the ability or capacity of a person to effectively deal with or change his/her environment. A preliminary model for the processes used to conceptualise mental health is presented. Answers to the question, 'What are the core concepts of mental health?' are highly dependent on the empirical frame used. Understanding these empirical frames is key to developing a useful consensus definition for diverse populations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26038353/"}

Social media use research has revealed positive and negative impacts on users' mental health and well-being. However, such impacts among adults have not been examined in any reviews. A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O'Malley and reported based on the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eight databases were searched from 2005 to December 2021. Articles were included after being reviewed by three independent teams, with discrepancies resolved through consensus with the senior author. Publication-related information (i.e., authors, year of publication, aims, study population, methodology, interventions, comparisons, outcome measures and key findings) were extracted from each study. Thematic analysis was conducted to answer the research questions. Among the 114 eligible articles, young adults (69.6%) represented the main age group. Most studies (78.6%) focused on the negative impacts of social media use on mental health and well-being, with nearly a third (32.1%) assessing such impacts on depression. Notably, this scoping review found that more than three-quarters (78.6%) of the included studies revealed that excessive and passive social media use would increases depression, anxiety, mood and loneliness. Nevertheless, a third (33.0%) also reported positive impacts, where positive and purposeful use of social media contributes to improvements in mental health and well-being, such as increased perceived social support and enjoyment. This review has provided an overview of the existing knowledge on how social media use affects adults and identified areas of research that merit investigation in future studies. More attention should be given to maximizing the positive impacts of social media use on mental health and well-being among adults.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38736207/"}

Research indicates that colonialism and its associated processes are important determinants of Indigenous peoples' health internationally. In Canada, despite an abundance of health research documenting inequalities in morbidity and mortality rates for Indigenous peoples, relatively little research has focused on mental health. This paper provides a critical scoping review of the literature related to Indigenous mental health in Canada. We searched eleven databases and two Indigenous health-focused journals for research related to mental health, Indigenous peoples, and Canada, for the years 2006-2016. Over two hundred papers are included in the review and coded according to research theme, population group, and geography. Results demonstrate that the literature is overwhelmingly concerned with issues related to colonialism in mental health services and the prevalence and causes of mental illness among Indigenous peoples in Canada, but with several significant gaps. Mental health research related to Indigenous peoples in Canada overemphasizes suicide and problematic substance use; a more critical use of the concepts of colonialism and historical trauma is advised; and several population groups are underrepresented in research, including Métis peoples and urban or off-reserve Indigenous peoples. The findings are useful in an international context by providing a starting point for discussions, dialogue, and further study regarding mental health research for Indigenous peoples around the world.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28135694/"}

Twenty-five studies were included in the review, mostly cross-sectional studies. A wide range of mental health outcomes were identified. Out of the 25 included studies, 23 showed positive associations between mental health and green space characteristics. Our findings suggest that while green spaces are associated with positive mental health outcomes, most studies were cross-sectional in nature and provided limited evidence for association.

{"id": "30563811", "title": "The Use of Social Networking Sites in Mental Health Interventions for Young People: Systematic Review.", "text": "The onset of mental health problems peaks between adolescence and young adulthood; however, young people face barriers to treatment and are often reluctant to seek professional help. Many are instead seeking support and information regarding their mental health via the Web, especially via social networking sites (SNSs), and hence, there is a promising opportunity to use SNSs to deliver or integrate with youth-focused online mental health interventions. Previous reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of SNSs for specific disorders in young people; however, none of the reviews have covered the breadth of SNS-based youth mental health interventions available across all mental health issues. This review aimed to systematically identify available evidence regarding the use of SNS-based interventions to support the mental health of young people aged up to 25 years, to evaluate their effectiveness, suitability, and safety, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings terms and exploded keywords and phrases. Retrieved abstracts (n=974) were double screened, yielding 235 articles for screening at the full-text level. Of these, 9 articles met the review inclusion criteria. Given the small number of studies, and the variety of outcome measures used, a quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. The 9 articles (quantitative studies, qualitative studies, and descriptions of the iterative design process) covered 5 separate interventions. Of the 5 interventions, 2 interventions used purpose-built platforms based on the moderated online social therapy (MOST) model, 2 used Facebook, and 1 evaluated a purpose-built mobile app. The 2 MOST interventions targeted specific mental health issues (depression and psychosis), whereas the others focused on improving mental health literacy, social support, and general well-being. Only 3 quantitative studies were identified, and all used a pre-post design (without a control group) to establish proof of concept. Of the outcome variables assessed, there were significant improvements in mental health knowledge and number of depressive symptoms but no improvement in anxiety or psychosis symptoms. Acceptability of and engagement with the SNS platforms were generally high, as were perceptions of usefulness and safety. Moderation by clinical experts was identified as a key component of the more successful interventions. When offered a choice, users showed a preference for mobile apps over Web-based interfaces. The evidence reviewed suggests young people find SNS-based interventions highly usable, engaging, and supportive. However, future studies need to address the current lack of high-quality evidence for their efficacy in reducing mental health symptoms. Given young people are already turning to SNSs to engage in knowledge seeking and peer-to-peer support, SNS-based youth mental health interventions provide an opportunity to address some of the barriers young people face in accessing qualified mental health support and information.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30563811/"}

Awareness and concerns around poor mental health in adolescents is rising among the general public and in academic circles, but there is little research on adolescent mental health policies in China. This article reviews the national policies on adolescent mental health from 2000 to 2023, and analyzes and evaluates the selected policy texts through the PMC index model. The study indicates growing national attention towards adolescent mental health policies in terms of both quantity and quality, with improved policy feasibility and synergy. However, shortcomings exist in the policy formulation process, including a lack of advocacy and supervision-oriented policies, a focus on short to medium-term effects, and inadequate comprehensive planning, hindering their swift implementation. In conclusion, facing the escalating crisis of adolescent mental health, the previous requirements of the education system are no longer sufficient. The government needs to further improve the top-down policy system, weave a safety net for mental health education and preventive intervention, and effectively promote the development of adolescent mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39247227/"}

Studies that used subsample analyses offer initial evidence that multiracial persons are at greater risk to experience worsened mental health in comparison to white monoracial peers, and that this disparity is compounded for multiracial persons from gender and/or sexual minoritized groups.

Primary outcome was the 4-item SF-36 Vitality Subscale, which assesses mental health as life satisfaction, social participation, energy and enthusiasm. Structural, individual and intermediary factors were assessed using study-specific and standardised measures. Trajectories were identified using Growth Mixture Modelling and associations with baseline characteristics with Structural Equation Modelling. 12,432 women completed Survey One. Three mental health trajectories: stable high (77%); stable low (18.2%) and declining from high to low (4.8%) were identified. Compared to the stable high group, women in the stable low group were significantly less physically active, had more nutritional risks, more recent adverse life events, fewer social interactions and less social support, reported more stress and were more likely to have a serious illness or disability at Survey One. The declining group had similar characteristics to the stable high group, but were significantly more likely to report at baseline that they had experienced recent financial, physical and emotional elder abuse. These interact, but not directly with socioeconomic position and marital status. Mental health among older women is related to social relationships, general health, access to physical activity and healthy nutrition, coincidental adverse life events and experiences of interpersonal violence, in particular elder abuse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29790785/"}
{"id": "26552342", "title": "Sexuality and mental health: Issues and what next?", "text": "Human sexuality plays a major role in an individual's existence and functioning. In addition, rightly or wrongly sexuality often defines people and also affects social attitudes. These attitudes, if negative, can contribute to stigma and prevent people from help seeking if they are suffering from mental health problems. Recent changes in policy towards same-sex relationships have been positive in many countries including the UK and the USA, whereas in others such as Russia and Uganda attitudes have become more negative and punitive. Sexual activity is seen as having both pleasurable and procreational functions which contribute to society's attitudes to homosexual behaviour. Inevitably, individual responses to their own sexuality and sexual behaviour will be influenced by social attitudes. To ensure that those with various sexual variations can access psychiatric services without discrimination, various levels of interventions are needed. Here we discuss different levels of intervention and organizational change that may make it possible. Social organization and institutional organization of services need to be sensitive, especially as rates of many mental disorders are high in individuals who may be sexually variant. Those providing services need to understand their own negative attitudes as well as prejudices to ensure that services are emotionally accessible.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552342/"}

Its purpose is to identify the impact on mental health in Europe of the economic downturn and the measures that may be taken to respond to it. We performed a review of the existing literature that yields 350 articles on which our conclusions and recommendations are based. Evidence-based tables and recommendations were developed through an expert consensus process. Literature dealing with the consequences of economic turmoil on the health and health behaviours of the population is heterogeneous, and the results are not completely unequivocal. However, there is a broad consensus about the deleterious consequences of economic crises on mental health, particularly on psychological well-being, depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, alcohol abuse, and suicidal behaviour. Unemployment, indebtedness, precarious working conditions, inequalities, lack of social connectedness, and housing instability emerge as main risk factors. Men at working age could be particularly at risk, together with previous low SES or stigmatized populations. Generalized austerity measures and poor developed welfare systems trend to increase the harmful effects of economic crises on mental health. Although many articles suggest limitations of existing research and provide suggestions for future research, there is relatively little discussion of policy approaches to address the negative impact of economic crises on mental health. The few studies that addressed policy questions suggested that the development of social protection programs such as active labour programs, social support systems, protection for housing instability, and better access to mental health care, particularly at primary care level, is strongly needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26874960/"}

Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine \"Google Scholar,\" and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as appropriate. Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.

Electronic databases of Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane Reviews were searched using keywords. The databases were also searched using the titles of surveys known to include the SRMH single item. The search was supplemented by manually searching the bibliographic sections of the included studies. Two independent reviewers coded articles for inclusion or exclusion based on whether articles included SRMH. Each study was coded by theme and data were extracted about study design, sample, variables, and results. Fifty-seven studies included SRMH. SRMH correlated moderately with the following mental health scales: Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, mental health subscales of the Short-Form Health Status Survey, Behaviour and Symptom Identification Scale, and World Mental Health Clinical Diagnostic Interview Schedule. However, responses to this item may differ across racial and ethnic groups. Poor SRMH was associated with poor self-rated health, physical health problems, increased health service utilization and less likelihood of being satisfied with mental health services. Poor or fair SRMH was also associated with social determinants of health, such as low socioeconomic position, weak social connections and neighbourhood stressors. Synthesis of this literature provides important information about the relationships SRMH has with other variables. SRMH is associated with multi-item measures of mental health, self-rated health, health problems, service utilization, and service satisfaction. Given these relationships and its use in epidemiologic surveys, SRMH should continue to be assessed as a population health measure.

However, while the modes of communication have developed, the issues involved remain essentially the same. Most practitioners have sought to understand and to innovate, though not always with positive results. Some lost sight of patients as people; patients have felt and have been ignored or silenced by doctors and carers. Money has always talked, for without adequate investment services and care have suffered, contributing to the stigma surrounding mental illness.

A central theme emerges from these contributions: if we are to make genuine progress in explaining, predicting, and treating mental illness, we must study the systems from which psychopathology emerges. As the articles in this collection make clear, the systems that give rise to psychopathology encompass a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions. The task of advancing our understanding of these systems will be a challenging one. Yet, this challenge presents a unique opportunity. From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems. This work provides clear guidance for psychiatric research, opportunities for collaboration, and a set of tools and concepts from which we can draw in our efforts to understand mental health, helping us move toward our ultimate aim of improving the prevention and treatment of psychopathology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32660482/"}
{"id": "33317756", "title": "Mental health, normativity, and local knowledge in global perspective.", "text": "Approaching mental health on a global scale with particular reference to low- and mid-income countries raises issues concerning the disregard of the local context and values and the imposition of values characteristic of the Global North. Seeking a philosophical viewpoint to surmount these problems, the present paper argues for a value-laden framework for psychiatry with the specific incorporation of value pluralism, particularly in relation to the Global South context, while also emphasizing personal values such as the choice of treatment. In sketching out this framework, the paper aims to overcome the clash between universalism and relativism about psychiatric categories by focusing on how overlaps between cultures can contribute to ontology-building. A case study analyzing ethnopsychiatric research in the context of South India will illustrate the proposed view, while also pointing out avenues for further research on the causal efficacy of local shared beliefs about mental disorder. If approaches across different traditions and theoretical frames are shown to work in treating similar ailments, causal connections appear to cut across the different ontologies. Ethnopsychiatry would play a central role in such research, namely in disclosing the variables and mechanisms at work within the local approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33317756/"}

This review aims to improve the understanding of physicians' mental health, identify gaps in research, and propose evidence-based solutions. A scoping review of the literature was conducted using Arksey and O'Malley's framework, which examined peer-reviewed articles published in English during 2008-2018 with a focus on North America. Data were summarized quantitatively and thematically. A total of 91 articles meeting eligibility criteria were reviewed. Most of the literature was specific to burnout (n = 69), followed by depression and suicidal ideation (n = 28), psychological harm and distress (n = 9), wellbeing and wellness (n = 8), and general mental health (n = 3). The literature had a strong focus on interventions, but had less to say about barriers for seeking help and the effects of mental health concerns among physicians on patient care. More research is needed to examine a broader variety of mental health concerns in physicians and to explore barriers to seeking care. The implication of poor physician mental health on patients should also be examined more closely. Finally, the reviewed literature lacks intersectional and longitudinal studies, as well as evaluations of interventions offered to improve mental wellbeing of physicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31651294/"}

Given its significance, it has consistently been a priority for health policy makers. The aim was to provide a comprehensive assessment of mental disorder-related policy events and related interventions in Iran. A content analysis of the literature and published and unpublished official documents and local media as well as a comprehensive network analysis of the text taken from the main databases of laws and regulations and the official websites of ministries and institutions related to mental health in Iran from 1907 to 2024 were carried out. A co-occurrence network analysis and degree centrality measures were performed on the collected corpus. A total of 196 documents were identified. Following the removal of duplicate documents and content irrelevant to the topic of mental disorders, 131 documents were extracted. A substantial number of documents pertained to the years 1930-1978, which were concerned primarily with the admission and dispatch of patients to the mental health clinic and psychiatric hospitals and the financial aspects of the care and treatment of patients with mental disorders by the trustee organizations. Following the 1979 revolution, the focus shifted to the expansion of social and insurance support for these patients and their families. The advancements related to severe mental disorders in Iran highlight the critical importance of public interventions in this field. Nevertheless, over the past century, no discernible pattern or coherence has been identified in this area between responsible agencies and ministries. Future policies related to mental disorders should be based on the principles of increasing community-based care, sustainable financing and economic and social support for mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39825394/"}

Neuroethics, too, is a relatively new field, lying at the intersection of bioethics and neuroscience; it has studied the implications of neuroscientific findings for age-old questions in philosophy, as well as questions about the ethics of novel neuroscientific methods and interventions. In this essay, we address a number of issues that lie at the intersection of these two fields: an emphasis on a naturalist and empirical position, a concern with both disease and wellness, the importance of human rights in neuropsychiatric care, and the value of social inclusion and patient empowerment.

{"id": "38836843", "title": "A Scoping Review of Military Culture, Military Identity, and Mental Health Outcomes in Military Personnel.", "text": "The military is a unique cultural institution that significantly influences its members, contributing to the development and transformation of their identities. Despite growing interest in identity research in the military, challenges persist in the conceptualization of military identity, including understanding how it forms, assessing the influence of military culture on identity development, and evaluating the implications for mental health. The primary objective of this scoping review was to map the complexities of military culture's impact on military identity and its effects on mental health. A scoping review of the literature was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology. Studies were included if they described military culture, military identity, and mental health, resulting in 65 eligible studies. The extracted data were thematically analyzed to identify how military culture impacts military identity and mental health and well-being. Multiple identities were evident within the military population, with 2 overarching identities, loyalty and military, overall conferring positive mental health outcomes. Where these identities were hidden or disrupted, poorer mental health outcomes were observed. The scoping review conducted in this study challenges the notion of military identity as a singular concept promoting positive mental health outcomes. It highlights its multifaceted nature, revealing that individuals may face identity concealment and disruptions during periods of transition or adjustment, resulting in adverse mental health outcomes. To capture the complexity of military identity, the authors developed the Military Identity Model (MIM). Military leaders, policymakers, and health care professionals are encouraged to recognize the complex nature of military identity and its impact on mental health and well-being. We recommend using the Military Identity Model to explore military identity and adjustment-related difficulties.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38836843/"}

From April 6, 2016, to May 7, 2016, we collected anonymous conversations posted on Yik Yak at 19 universities in 4 different states and performed statistical analyses and text classification experiments on a subset of these messages. We found that prosocial messages were 5.23 times more prevalent than bullying messages. The frequency of cyberbullying messages was positively associated with messages seeking emotional help. We found significant geographic variation in the frequency of messages offering supportive vs bullying messages. Across campuses, bullying and political discussions were positively associated. We also achieved a balanced accuracy of over 0.75 for most messaging behaviors and topics with a support vector machine classifier. Our results show that messages containing data about students' mental health-related attitudes and behaviors are prevalent on anonymous social networks, suggesting that these data can be mined for real-time analysis.

Based on this model, this study examined the prevalence and correlates of three mental health categories among older adults in China. Cross-sectional data were derived from Wave 1 of the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health. Participants were categorized into complete mental health (CMH), complete mental illness (CMI), and moderate mental health (MMH) groups. Multinomial logistic regressions were used. The prevalence of CMH, CMI, and MMH in China was 18%, 16%, and 66%, respectively. Being female, unmarried, younger, and feeling unhealthy were more likely to result in placement in the CMI category. Employment, education, and cognitive function were identified as important protective factors of CMH. Age, income, urban or rural residence, and physical function difficulty were associated with all three categories. We demonstrated the utility of the two continua model in identifying mental health needs in Chinese contexts. The findings suggest that future policy reforms and clinical interventions should establish a more comprehensive mental health category as a screening tool nationwide.

Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have introduced AI systems capable of understanding and producing humanlike language in real time. These developments present new opportunities to enhance mental health care. We aimed to systematically examine the current applications of GenAI in mental health, focusing on 3 core domains: diagnosis and assessment, therapeutic tools, and clinician support. In addition, we identified and synthesized key ethical issues reported in the literature. We conducted a comprehensive literature search, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines, in PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Embase, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2024. After screening 783 records, 79 (10.1%) studies met the inclusion criteria. The number of studies on GenAI applications in mental health has grown substantially since 2023. Studies on diagnosis and assessment (37/79, 47%) primarily used GenAI models to detect depression and suicidality through text data. Studies on therapeutic applications (20/79, 25%) investigated GenAI-based chatbots and adaptive systems for emotional and behavioral support, reporting promising outcomes but revealing limited real-world deployment and safety assurance. Clinician support studies (24/79, 30%) explored GenAI's role in clinical decision-making, documentation and summarization, therapy support, training and simulation, and psychoeducation. Ethical concerns were consistently reported across the domains. On the basis of these findings, we proposed an integrative ethical framework, GenAI4MH, comprising 4 core dimensions-data privacy and security, information integrity and fairness, user safety, and ethical governance and oversight-to guide the responsible use of GenAI in mental health contexts. GenAI shows promise in addressing the escalating global demand for mental health services. They may augment traditional approaches by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, offering more accessible support, and reducing clinicians' administrative burden. However, to ensure ethical and effective implementation, comprehensive safeguards-particularly around privacy, algorithmic bias, and responsible user engagement-must be established.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40577783/"}

Previous studies identified, based on traditional approaches, that physical activity is a relevant factor in the prevention or management of mental health. However, upcoming artificial intelligence methods have not yet been fully established in the research field of physical activity and mental health. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of studies that integrated passive monitoring of physical activity data measured via wearable technology in machine learning algorithms for the detection, prediction, or classification of mental health states and traits. We conducted a review of studies processing wearable data to gain insights into mental health parameters. Eligibility criteria were (1) the study uses wearables or smartphones to acquire physical behavior and optionally other sensor measurement data, (2) the study must use machine learning to process the acquired data, and (3) the study had to be published in a peer-reviewed English language journal. Studies were identified via a systematic search in 5 electronic databases. Of 11,057 unique search results, 49 published papers between 2016 and 2023 were included. Most studies examined the connection between wearable sensor data and stress (n=15, 31%) or depression (n=14, 29%). In total, 71% (n=35) of the studies had less than 100 participants, and 47% (n=23) had less than 14 days of data recording. More than half of the studies (n=27, 55%) used step count as movement measurement, and 44% (n=21) used raw accelerometer values. The quality of the studies was assessed, scoring between 0 and 18 points in 9 categories (maximum 2 points per category). On average, studies were rated 6.47 (SD 3.1) points. The use of wearable technology for the detection, prediction, or classification of mental health states and traits is promising and offers a variety of applications across different settings and target groups. However, based on the current state of literature, the application of artificial intelligence cannot realize its full potential mostly due to a lack of methodological shortcomings and data availability. Future research endeavors may focus on the following suggestions to improve the quality of new applications in this context: first, by using raw data instead of already preprocessed data. Second, by using only relevant data based on empirical evidence. In particular, crafting optimal feature sets rather than using many individual detached features and consultation with in-field professionals. Third, by validating and replicating the existing approaches (ie, applying the model to unseen data). Fourth, depending on the research aim (ie, generalization vs personalization) maximizing the sample size or the duration over which data are collected.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40053765/"}

The intake data of 881 people referred to the program following the Queensland (Australia) natural disasters of 2010-11 was evaluated. Those referred scored >2 on the Primary Care PTSD scale. Assessment included the disaster exposure experience, demographic and clinical information, and measures of coping and resilience. Descriptive analyses and a Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) were undertaken to ascertain which factors may predict treatment participation. The treatment group (TG) in comparison to the non-treatment group (NTG) were more likely to perceive their life was threatened (85.1% vs 8.1%), less able to cope (67% vs 25.8%) and less resilient (4.2% vs 87.5%). The CTA using all the assessment variables found the Connor-Davidson (2-item scale) (<i>P <</i> 0.001), degree of property damage (<i>P <</i> 0.001), financial losses (<i>P</i> < 0.001), perception their life was threatened (<i>P <</i> 0.001) and insurance claims (<i>P <</i> 0.003) distinguished the TG from the NTG.

The growing interest in social risk factors for mental health coincides with the development of social capital research which may further inform the social model of mental health. The objective of the study reported here was to discover if there is an independent association between social capital and mental health when taking into account an array of demographic and violence variables. A total of 1168 youth (15-25 years) in a low income community in Cali, Colombia were surveyed. Mental health was measured by a 20 item self-report questionnaire. The instrument used to measure social capital covered structural and cognitive social capital. Twenty-four per cent of the sample were probable cases of mental ill health. Females had a prevalence rate three times higher than males. Using a model which considered demographic and social capital measures as potential risk factors for mental ill health, the significant risk factors emerged as being female, having limited schooling, working in the informal sector, being a migrant, and having low trust in people. The 'classic' poverty type variables (poor education and employment) were more important than social capital, as was the commonly dominant risk factor for mental ill health-being a woman. When violence factors were added to the model, the 'trust' factor fell out and the most important risk factors became (in descending order of importance): being female; no schooling/incomplete primary; and being a victim of violence. The dominance of poverty related factors, as opposed to social capital, prompts renewed attention to the explanatory mechanisms that link income inequality and poor mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15047083/"}

This paper provides a sociohistorical perspective for the theme issue \"Responsible Design, Integration, and Use of Generative AI in Mental Health.\" It evaluates ethical considerations in using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for the democratization of mental health knowledge and practice. It explores the historical context of democratizing information, transitioning from restricted access to widespread availability due to the internet, open-source movements, and most recently, GenAI technologies such as large language models. The paper highlights why GenAI technologies represent a new phase in the democratization movement, offering unparalleled access to highly advanced technology as well as information. In the realm of mental health, this requires delicate and nuanced ethical deliberation. Including GenAI in mental health may allow, among other things, improved accessibility to mental health care, personalized responses, and conceptual flexibility, and could facilitate a flattening of traditional hierarchies between health care providers and patients. At the same time, it also entails significant risks and challenges that must be carefully addressed. To navigate these complexities, the paper proposes a strategic questionnaire for assessing artificial intelligence-based mental health applications. This tool evaluates both the benefits and the risks, emphasizing the need for a balanced and ethical approach to GenAI integration in mental health. The paper calls for a cautious yet positive approach to GenAI in mental health, advocating for the active engagement of mental health professionals in guiding GenAI development. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring that GenAI advancements are not only technologically sound but also ethically grounded and patient-centered.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39417792/"}

The implementation of mental health policy varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with some countries having better implementation outcomes than others. Low implementation poses challenges relating to addressing the high burden and wide treatment gaps of mental health conditions. While different implementation strategies are applied to implement mental health policy in different contexts, there is little knowledge of what category of strategies are being used and how and why their implementation produces varied outcomes. To this end, we propose to conduct a realist synthesis to explain how, why, for whom, and under what health system conditions certain policy implementation strategies work or not in LMICs. This paper will detail the protocol on conducting a realist review of the literature on mental health policy implementation in LMICs. Realist reviews/syntheses are theory-driven reviews designed to formulate and test (confirm, refute, or refine) initial programme theories to explain how, why, for whom and under what contexts a programme, intervention or policy works as intended or not. Theory is built by exploring and abstracting context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations in the data. These CMO configurations are identified through retroductive theorizing, a mechanism-centred approach to theory development. We will adopt these steps to guide the process of realist synthesis: i) identify the research question, clarifying the scope of the review and formulating the initial programme theory (ii) conducting background searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, Africa-Wide Information, African. Index Medicus (AIM), CINAHL and Scopus databases, and grey literature (iii) appraising the quality of studies and data extraction and (iv) synthesising data. The review is part of a realist evaluation exploring mental health policy implementation in LMICs and is registered under PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024580312). Findings will inform the development of initial mental health policy implementation programme theories explaining why and how mental health policy implementation in LMICs works.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131984/"}

In order to develop interventions to prevent and treat perfectionism and promote resilience for children, rigorous testing and examination of theoretical models is needed as well as having access to valid and reliable assessment tools. The aim of the current literature review was to examine the validity and reliability of the measures currently being used to measure perfectionism in children under the age of 15. A systematic review of the literature identified six instruments that had been utilised in children. Preliminary support with respect to reliability and validity was established for each of these measures, and there was evidence supporting the existence of both perfectionistic striving and perfectionistic concerns in this population. However, many of the measures lacked evaluation of key psychometric properties by independent authors. Further work distinguishing adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism will be necessary to promote future interventions and treatment in this area.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29098468/"}

It sponsored multiple projects, initiatives and research, and involved state, non-state and European institutional actors. This paper attempts to understand how EUMHG operated and the structure of political relations within it, attending especially to opportunities for citizen participation. It adopts a global governmentality approach that focuses on practices and discourses. It finds that EUMHG practices including benchmarks, best practices and risk-thinking reinforced larger EU policy goals of market-optimisation, and that the central discourses of de-institutionalisation (DI) and community mental health (CMH) shifted meaning over time, first apprehending mental health as a public-health goal, then targeting mental ill-health as a burden to states. Finally, it finds that non-governmental organisations' (NGOs) work within EUMHG rendered them both objects and subjects of government. Through these dynamics, citizens usually were positioned outside governance, and NGO identities were altered, though CMH's transformative potential remained. Citizen participation in EUMHG was heavily conditioned. NGO and citizen power will need vigilant protection in any future EUMHG.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32799952/"}

To report the establishment of the Online Ethics Consultation and describe and evaluate its effectiveness. The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This evaluation describes the outcomes of 5 years of operation of the Online Ethics Consultation on mental health in Japan. The Online Ethics Consultation received 12 emails requesting consultation. Consultees included mental health nurses, psychiatrists, and service users. The most common questions directed to the service were about seclusion and physical restraint. Response time from receipt of email to sending a reply was between 1 and 14 days. Despite the disappointing number of consultations, feedback has been positive. The Online Ethics Consultation was established to assist morally sensitive nurses in resolving their ethical problems through provision of unbiased and encouraging advice. Mental health care in Japan has been less than ideal: long-term social hospitalization, seclusion, and restraint are common practices that often lead to moral distress in nurses and the questions received reflected this. The head of the Online Ethics Consultation sent a supportive, facilitative response summarizing the opinions of several consultants.

I begin by framing LGBTQ (mental) health disparities in a life course perspective and discuss how research focused on the timing of events could offer insight into the optimum targets and timing of prevention and intervention strategies. Next, I argue the importance of expanding notions of \"mental health\" to include perspectives of wellbeing, positive youth development, and resilience. I then consider how research might attend to the complexity of LGBTQ youths' lived experience within and across the various contexts they traverse in their day-to-day lives. Similarly, I discuss the importance of exploring heterogeneity in LGBTQ youth experiences and mental health. I also offer suggestions for how community partnerships may be a key resource for developing and evaluating evidence-informed programs and tools designed to foster the positive development and mental health of LGBTQ youth.

A dataset containing registration data for all patients receiving public mental health service was constructed and subsequently matched, on age and sex, in a final patient to comparison patient ratio of 1:8, with health care users who did not receive treatment in the mental health system. Three groups emerged: a patient PD group-patients with psychiatric disorders treated in public mental health care (n = 76 677); a comparison patient PD group-comparison patients with PDs treated in physicians only (n = 277 627); and a patient- comparison patient non-PD group-patients (treated in specialized publicly funded care or by their physician) without PDs (n = 329 177). Examining over 42 million billing records for all of these patients, we compared the average number of visits and the average health only (nonpsychiatric) billing cost per each patient during the 9-year study period across the groups. Among all health care users in the data, the health costs (Total Costs - Mental Health Costs) were greater on average for the patients with PD group ($3437) and the comparison patient PD group ($3265), compared with patient-comparison patient non-PD group ($1345). Forty-six percent of the comparison sample had a PD. Having a mental health problem is related to greater health-related expenditures.

Psychometric properties of the assessments were assessed against set quality criteria. Data on psychometric properties were available for 4 measures. The Client Assessment of Strengths, Interests and Goals (CASIG) had the strongest psychometric evidence. The SAW and CASIG assessments can be tentatively recommended within clinical practice, although the evidence for all strengths assessments is currently limited. To describe the content of the strengths assessment, the items used to operationalize the concept of strengths in each assessment were extracted and themed. Twenty-four themes were identified and organized into 3 overarching categories: individual factors, environmental factors, and interpersonal factors. These categories form the basis of an empirically based definition of strengths that could be used as a conceptual foundation for new clinical assessments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22708573/"}

After excluding routine and administrative codes, the relative burden of disease by diagnostic category and subcategory was calculated, with further classification of musculoskeletal conditions by anatomic site. For all conditions accounting for at least 1.0% of the burden of care, incidence density rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare males and females. A total of 1,269 MTIs received 32,601 non-administrative, non-routine diagnoses while accumulating 50,376 person-months of exposure during the surveillance period. Musculoskeletal conditions were the greatest contributor to overall disease burden, accounting for 39.1% of all diagnoses, followed by mental health (10.4%), respiratory (10.1%), and neurologic and sensory (9.8%). The burden attributed to mental health conditions decreased by 54% over the 5-year period. Twenty-three conditions accounted for at least 1.0% of the healthcare burden. The highest incidence conditions were connective tissue disease (27.18 per 1,000 person-months), non-traumatic joint disorders (25.74), upper respiratory infections (25.14), and back pain (23.70).

The data from 1,619 students (response rate: 90.6%; male: 1,074; female: 545) were analyzed. We used the Japanese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to measure mental health status. Poor mental health status (GHQ-12 score of 4 points or higher) was observed in 36.6% and 48.8% of the male and female medical students, respectively. The ratio of the age-adjusted prevalence of poor mental health status in female versus male medical students was 1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.62). The universities were categorized into two groups based on the university type (national/public: 15 vs. private: 5) or location (in a large city: 7 vs. in a local city: 13 cities). The prevalence of poor mental health status in both men and women differed between these groups, although not significantly. The GHQ-12 scores in men significantly differed between the categorized groups of universities. These results suggest that adequate attention must be paid to the mental health of medical students, especially females, and that a system for providing mental health care for medical students must be established in the context of actual conditions at each university.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25519027/"}

Specific social and financial factors mediate the effects of financial crisis on mental health, such as poverty, financial difficulties and unemployment. During the recent international financial crisis, studies in many countries have shown that the worsening of various mental health indicators was related to financial difficulties and unemployment. In Greece, which is one of the countries that experienced intense and prolonged economic and social burden due to the recent crisis, the epidemiological findings were similar and the increase of the prevalence of major depression and suicide was excessive. However, the information about the mental health of the population deriving from health services is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the crisis on community mental health -more specifically the rates of mental disorders and suicide, as well as the role of unemployment- among the new cases of a community mental health unit. The sample consisted of 1,865 adult users, men and women, who came seeking for help to the Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) during the years 2008-2013, i.e. the early years of the current crisis. Regarding the rates of the diagnostic categories in the new cases of CMHC per year, no significant differentiation was observed. There was an increase in the proportion of the unemployed individuals in the total sample of new cases during the study, from 9.65% in 2008 to 26.17% in 2013 and a significant association between unemployment and the occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders, as indicated by the increase in the proportion of unemployed individuals among new cases with disorders of these categories. There was an upward trend in the rate of new patients referred to CMHC after a suicide attempt, which was doubled during the first years of the crisis. There was also an increase in the rate of unemployed individuals among these cases, from 10% in 2008 to 41.7% in 2009, reaching the highest level in 2011 (53.3%). The findings of this study suggest that during economic crisis unemployment plays an important role in the development of anxiety and depressive disorders and is closely related to suicide attempts.

{"id": "24526587", "title": "Mental health and risky sexual behaviors: evidence from DSM-IV Axis II disorders.", "text": "Several economic studies link poor mental health and substance misuse with risky sexual behaviors. However, none have examined the relationships between DSM-IV Axis II mental health disorders (A2s) and risky sexual behaviors. A2 disorders are a poorly understood, yet prevalent and disabling class of mental health conditions. They develop early in life through an interaction of genetics and environment, and are persistent across the life course. Common features include poor impulse control, addiction, social isolation, and elevated sexual desires, although the defining features vary substantially across disorder. To investigate the association between A2 disorders and three measures of risky sexual behavior. We obtain data on adults age 20 to 50 years from Wave II of the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Our outcome measures include early initiation into sexual activity, and past year regular use of alcohol before sex and sexually transmitted disease diagnosis. NESARC administrators use the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule to classify respondents as meeting criteria for the ten A2 disorders recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. We construct several measures of A2 disorders based on the NESARC administrators' classifications. Given their comorbidity with A2 disorders, we explore the importance of Axis I disorders in the estimated associations. We find that A2 disorders are generally associated with an increase in the probability of risky sexual behaviors among both men and women. In specifications that disaggregate disorders into clusters and specific conditions, the significant associations are not uniform, but are broadly consistent with the defining features of the cluster or disorder. Inclusion of A1 disorders attenuates estimated associations for some risky sexual behaviors among men, but not for women. We find positive associations between A2 disorders and our measures of risky sexual behaviors. Our findings are subject to several data limitations, however. The NESARC lacks information on more advanced risky sexual behaviors and our measure of early initiation into sexual activity is retrospective. Identifying the causal effects of mental health and risky sexual behaviors is complicated due to bias from reverse causality and omitted variables. We believe these sources of bias are less of a concern in our study, however. Specifically, A2 disorders develop early in life and pre-date the risky sexual behaviors, thus negating reverse causality. Because the NESARC contains a rich set of personal characteristics, we are also able to minimize potential omitted variable bias. A2 disorders are significantly associated with risky sexual behaviors, which could lead to greater utilization and cost of health care services. Health care providers should consider A2 disorders when developing health promotion recommendations as these disorders may place individuals at elevated risk for unsafe sexual behaviors. Future studies should examine the causal mechanisms between A2 disorders and risky sexual behaviors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526587/"}

We wished to examine how age transfers its effect to SRH through comorbid disease and mental illness and whether these processes remained stable from 1994 until 2008. The hypothesis is that ageing and/or the increased age-related burden of pathology explains the declining SRH. The Tromsø Study (TS) is a cohort study using a survey approach with repeated physical examinations. It was conducted in the municipality of Tromsø, Norway, from 1974 to 2008. A total of 21 199 women and 19 229 men participated. SRH is the outcome of interest. We calculated and compared the effect sizes of age, comorbidity and mental health symptoms using multimediator analysis based on OLS regression. Ageing had a negative impact on SRH, but the total effect of age decreased from 1994 to 2007. We assessed the direct effect of age and then the proportion of indirect age-related effects through physical illness and mental health symptoms on the total effect. The direct effect of age represented 79.3% of the total effect in 1994 and decreased to 58.8% in 2007. Physical illness emerged as an increasingly important factor and increased its influence from 15.7% to 41.2% of the total effect. Age alone had a protective effect on mental health symptoms and this increased (2.5% to 17.3%), but we found a stronger association between mental health symptoms and physical disease in the later waves of the study (increasing from 3.7% to 14.8%). The results suggest that the effect on SRH of mental health symptoms caused by physical illness is an increasing public health problem. Treatment and care for specific medical conditions must therefore focus more strongly on how these conditions affect the patient's mental health and address these concerns accordingly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28100564/"}

Perspectives from India.", "text": "The mental health gap has been a persistent concern globally, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). In an attempt to mitigate resource limitations, the psychiatric practice has been undergoing a paradigm shift into digitalized mental health interventions. One such innovation involves digital gaming utilizing the principles of 'gamification' to incorporate both the playfulness component of online gaming as well as the domain-targeted design of gaming elements. Digital gaming-based interventions have been to deliver psychotherapy, biofeedback, cognitive training and rehabilitation, as well as behavioural modification and social skills training. Research shows their utility in autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress, eating disorders, neurocognitive disorders and also to promote healthy aging. Though promising in scope, these interventions face pragmatic challenges for implementation in developing countries. Even though increased use of technology, internet penetration and growing digital literacy have enhanced their accessibility and feasibility, various factors like socio-cultural diversity, lack of standardization, poor infrastructural support, bandwidth issues and lack of practice can impair their use and acceptability. Keeping this in the background, this commentary critically discusses the scope, applications and challenges of digital gaming in mental healthcare delivery in one of the rapidly globalizing LMIC nations, India.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210563/"}

Mental health was reported as number of mentally unhealthy days (MUDs) in the past 30. Support service needs comprised caregiving classes, service access, support groups, counseling, and respite care. Multivariable linear regression models were performed adjusting for sociodemographics and sampling weights. A total of 1,831 caregivers were included in the study, representing approximately 1.1 million cancer caregivers in the 18 US states, distributed with the following intensity: 122 (8.3%) caregivers reported care at high hours/long duration, 213 (13.1%) high hours/short duration, 329 (18.4%) low hours/long duration, and 910 (60.2%) low hours/short duration. Mean MUDs was 6 (SE, 0.5). The highest reported unmet service need was help with service access (48.4%). Higher caregiving intensity and support service need were associated with more MUDs ( P < .05), with a significant interaction ( P = .02) between caregiving intensity and unmet support service needs. High hour/long duration caregivers reporting any unmet needs had a mean of 15 versus 8 MUDs for those with no unmet needs.

There is also some evidence suggesting perceiving other Black individuals experiencing racial discrimination (group-level discrimination) can protect one's health in Black adults. This study examined the role of personal- and group-level discrimination in Black adolescent health. The study was a secondary analysis of survey data collected from 186 Black adolescents that included reports of discrimination, physical function, anxiety, and depression. Black adolescents who reported greater, as opposed to lower, personal-level discrimination were more likely to experience poorer physical and mental health outcomes. While group-level discrimination was also associated with physical health outcomes, it was not directly associated with mental health outcomes. Importantly, across all three health outcomes, awareness of group-level discrimination mitigated the negative health consequences of personal-level discrimination. Among adolescents who reported low levels of group-level discrimination, personal-level discrimination was associated negatively with physical function and positively with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Among adolescents who reported high levels of group-level discrimination, there was no association between personal-level discrimination and any of the health outcomes. Consistent with prior research with Black adults, awareness of high group-level discrimination may protect Black adolescents from the negative health consequences of personal-level discrimination. The pattern of the results is also consistent with the literature of the personal-group discrimination discrepancy (PGDD) and psychological wellbeing. Future research should investigate the psychological mechanisms implicated in PGDD (e.g., external attribution of discrimination and intragroup comparison) as potential coping strategies for Black adolescents against the negative health consequences of personal-level discrimination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37624537/"}

A first step is to identify which social determinants could be of importance for intervention. We used the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, a longitudinal population-based health survey, completed by 31,000 inhabitants in the Stockholm County. We focused on the 18⁻29 age group, <i>n</i> = 3373 (60% females, 40% males) and aimed at assessing which social determinants predict stable mental health, measured as scoring <3 points on the General Health Questionnaire 12 at all time points: 2002, 2007, 2010, and 2014. Forty-six percent of males and 36% of females reported stable mental health. Among the 17 predictors on sociodemographics, socioeconomics, social capital, health behavior, and victimization, six predicted stable mental health in the following order: occupation and especially employment, emotional support, male gender, being born in Sweden, absence of financial strain, and consumption of fruit and berries. In the 30⁻84 age group, 66% males and 55% females reported stable mental health. Nine determinants in the following rank predicted stable mental health: absence of financial strain, occupation and especially being self-employed, emotional support, male gender, physical activity, instrumental support, interpersonal trust, community trust, and absence of hazardous alcohol consumption. Interaction analysis showed significant difference between the younger and older group regarding physical activity and absence of financial strain with importance being higher for the older group. Our findings indicate that the determinants of health differ across the life-course with fewer predictors related to social capital and health behavior in the younger group compared to the older.

This is especially important for young people exposed to trauma and adversity. Few countries give sufficient attention to safeguarding and improving the mental health of young people and few have developed policies and programs to support this.

After controlling for age, the change in employment and income among men prompted an increase in the prevalence of GHQ+, while the change in somatic illness and limitations tended to mitigate this effect. After the recession, unemployed men showed a better level of somatic health. The same effects were not detected in women.

The mental health priorities of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2010 signalled a mutual Nordic exchange of knowledge in the following thematic areas: child and adolescent mental health; working life and mental health; mental health in older people; strengthening the role of primary care in mental health service provision; stronger involvement of users and carers; and reduction of use of coercion in psychiatric care. Efforts to realize these priorities included commissioning the Nordic Research Academy for Mental Health, an NHV-based network of research institutions with a common interest in mental health research across the Nordic countries, to develop, organize and follow-up projects on public mental health. The research initiatives included mental health policy analysis, register-based research and research focused on the users' perspective in a Nordic context, as well as EU-level research policy analysis. The public mental health research conducted at the NHV highlighted the complexity of mental health and emphasized that the broad determinants of mental health need to be increasingly addressed in both public health research and practice.

Although urban living offers increased access to critical resources and can help to mitigate climate change, densely populated neighborhood environments are often higher in many of the physical and psychological stressors that are detrimental to health, and lower in the social capital that is beneficial to health. One component of urban form that can reduce these stressors and improve social capital is nature: greenspace, such as parks and street trees, and bluespace, such as rivers and oceans. In this project, we applied measures from a Natural Space Index previously developed for the Vancouver, Canada census metropolitan area to explore the relationship between distinct measures of natural space and prevalence of (1) major depressive disorder, (2) negative mental health, and (3) psychological distress. In addition, we examined direct associations between natural space exposure and neighborhood social capital, as measured via self-reported sense of community belonging (SoC), as well as the potential mental health benefits of natural space mediated via SoC. Using data from the population-based, cross-sectional 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (weighted n = 1,930,048), we found no direct associations between any measure of natural space and mental health in models adjusted for 11 demographic, socioeconomic, household arrangement, health, and urban design variables. However, publicly accessible neighborhood nature was associated with increased odds of higher SoC. A 1% increase in the percentage of natural space (combined greenspace and bluespace) within 500 m had an odds ratio [95% confidence interval] of 1.05 [1.00, 1.10] for very strong vs. very weak SoC and 1.04 [1.01, 1.08] for somewhat strong vs. very weak SoC. In addition, higher levels of SoC were associated with improvements in all three mental health outcomes. Mediation tests indicated significant indirect effects of both publicly accessible neighborhood nature variables on reductions in psychological distress and reduced odds of negative mental health via increased sense of SoC. This suggests that natural space has the potential to address the pressing issue of social isolation and, in turn, poor mental health faced by residents of dense urban environments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30716514/"}

Using data from a large-scale representative survey (N = 1825) in Flanders, Belgium, we find that each of the forms of capital has a net effect on perceptions of physical and mental health, which persists after controlling for the other forms of capital and for the effects of other correlates of perceived health. The only exception is that the cultural capital indicators are not related to mental health.

Its originality is seen in the fact that practically all speaking and writing about it noted the importance of this principle for the protection of rights and legal interests of citizens, failing into the field of psychiatry. However, expressing this opinion, doctors and lawyers offer very few arguments in support of this view. Traditional arguments in favor of the presumption of mental health, scattered and unsystematic, prove to be absolutely insolvent. It was also found out that the similarity of the presumption of mental health with the presumption of innocence is capable to entail negative consequences. The noted similarity strengthens stigmatizing effect of psychiatric diagnosis, making it extremely undesirable for the patient, and the basis of the relationship between the patient and the doctor laid counterproductive antagonistic model as the model of mutual relations of the accused with the prosecutor. The main conclusion of authors is that the supporters of the presumption of mental health have yet to prove its right to exist, to work out its content and try to neutralize some of the negative consequences of its possible implementation in practice. Without compliance with the listed conditions to bring the presumption of mental health to the level of one of the fundamental principles of Russian psychiatry would be premature.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28638041/"}

The objective of the study was to assess the changes in the mental health of the working-age population in the Basque Country (Spain) and its social inequalities following the onset of the 2008 recession, with special focus on the role of unemployment. Repeated cross-sectional study on the population aged 16-64, using four Basque Health Surveys (1997-2013). Age-adjusted prevalences of poor mental health and incremental prevalence ratios (working status and social class adjusted) between years were calculated. Absolute/relative measures of social inequalities were also calculated. From 2008, there was a clear deterioration in the mental health, especially among men. Neither changes in employment status nor social class accounted for these changes. In men, the deterioration affected all working status categories, except the retired but significant changes occurred only among the employed. In women, poor mental health significantly increased among the unemployed. Students were also especially affected. Relative inequalities increased only in men. The Great Recession is being accompanied by adverse effects on mental health, which cannot be fully explained by the increase of unemployment. Public health professionals should closely monitor the medium and long-term effects of the crisis as these may emerge only many years after the onset of recessions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26810112/"}

This standard should be adopted because of the greater availability of, and familiarity with, recording technology on the part of mental health professionals, the greater use and proven effectiveness of recording in other contexts of the criminal justice system, and the improvement in court presentation and accuracy of judicial determinations involving forensic assessments that recording will provide. The experience of practitioners with recording since professional associations last studied the issue should be taken into account, as informal data suggest it has been positive. Unfortunately, the legal system is unlikely to prompt this advance without its reconsideration by the forensic mental health professions, because current constitutional jurisprudence does not require recording and effectively makes it contingent upon request by examiners. Forensic evaluators thus have a valuable opportunity to educate the legal system on the utility and importance of this key reform, and so should adopt it as a best practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29696698/"}

The present study relates this 'mental health scarring' to the trade cycle, exploring if those exposed to youth unemployment during boom differ from those exposed during recession with respect to mental health in the middle age. The sample consists of two cohorts from the same industrial town in Northern Sweden: the cohort born in 1965 and the cohort born in 1973 included all pupils attending the last grade of compulsory school, respectively, in 1981 and in 1989. Their depressiveness and anxiousness were assessed by questionnaires at age 21 and again at age 43/39. Mental health at follow-up was related to exposure to unemployment during age years 21-25. Statistical significance of the cohort*exposure interactions from binary logistic regression analyses were used to assess the cohort differences in the mental health between Cohort65 and Cohort73, entering the labour market, respectively, during a boom and a recession. Compared to the unexposed, high exposure to unemployment at the age from 21 to 25 was associated to increased probability of poor mental health in the middle age in both in Cohort65 (odds ratio 2.19 [1.46-3.30] for anxiousness and 1.85 [1.25-2.74]for depressiveness) and in Cohort73 (odds ratio 2.13 [1.33-3.39] for anxiousness and 1.38 [0.89-2.14] for depressiveness). The differences between the cohorts also turned out as statistically non-significant. The scars of unemployment exposure onto future health seem to be rather insensitive to economic trades. Thus, at the population level this would mean that the long-term health costs that can be attributed to youth unemployment are more widespread in the generation that suffers of recession around the entry to the work life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26792092/"}

For the five-level version of the EQ-5D, there are two methods of estimating utility [crosswalk and stated preference (5L-SP)]. This paper explores potential impacts for researchers and decision-makers when comparing utility values derived from either method in the specific context of mental health. Baseline EQ-5D-5L data from three large randomised controlled trials of interventions for mental health conditions were analysed. Utility values were generated using each method. Mean utility values were compared using a series of t tests on pooled data and subgroups. Scenario analyses explored potential impacts on cost-effectiveness decisions. EQ-5D data were available for 1399 participants. The mean utility value for each trial was approximately 0.08 higher when estimated using the 5L-SP approach compared to crosswalk (p < 0.0001). The difference was greatest among people reporting extreme anxiety/depression (mean utility 5L-SP 0.309, crosswalk 0.084; difference = 0.225; p < 0.0001). Identical improvements in health status were associated with higher costs to gain one QALY with the 5L-SP approach; this is more pronounced when improvements are across all domains compared to improvements on the anxiety/depression domain only. The two approaches produce significantly different utility values in people with mental health conditions. Resulting differences in cost per QALY estimates suggest that thresholds of cost-effectiveness may also need to be reviewed. Researchers and decision-makers should exercise caution when comparing or synthesising data from trials of mental health interventions using different utility estimation approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29248995/"}

Interactive activities were designed to capture participants' immediate reactions to apps and websites designed to support mental health and to explore their experiences of using technology for these purposes in their own lives. Template analysis was used to analyze transcripts of the group discussions. Older adults were motivated to turn to technology to improve mood through mechanisms of distraction, normalization, and facilitated expression of mental states, while aiming to reduce burden on others. Perceived barriers to use included fear of consequences and the impact of low mood on readiness to engage with technology, as well as a lack of prior knowledge applicable to digital technologies. Participants were aware of websites available to support mental health, but awareness alone did not motivate use. Older adults are motivated to use digital technologies to improve their mental health, but barriers remain that developers need to address for this population to access them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758292/"}

Information from 4 cross-sectional samples was compared over a 24-year period. The target population was Finnish-speaking children born in 1981 (n = 1,038), 1991 (n = 1,035), 1997 (n = 1,030), and 2004 (n = 1,114) and living in selected school districts in the Turku University Hospital area in southwestern Finland. The participation rates varied from 84% (2005) to 95% (1989). Information about the children's psychiatric symptoms, bullying experience, and service use was obtained from parents and teachers using Rutter questionnaires. Child depression was measured using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Parental reports showed that emotional (p < .001) and conduct (p = .001) problems among boys and emotional (p = .002) problems among girls decreased over the 24-year period. In teacher reports, there were no significant changes in hyperactivity, emotional, and conduct problems between 1989 and 2013. Girls' self-reported depression scores increased between 1989 and 2005, but leveled off in 2013. There were no significant decreases in bullying behavior between 2005 and 2013 despite the introduction of a nationwide school-based anti-bullying program in 2009. Mental health service use increased constantly during the study period: in 1989, 4.2% of boys and 0.9% of girls were in contact with services, and by 2013 this had risen to 15.1% and 6.1% (p < .001). No substantial increases in children's mental health problems were seen between 1989 and 2013. Service use increased constantly, indicating lower thresholds for seeking help. Bullying behavior is strongly related to mental health problems, and that is why school-based bullying interventions, including mental health perspectives, are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27453086/"}

Law enforcement officers have been applying for early disability retirement pensions at an increased rate for stress-related psychiatric and medical conditions. As a result, law enforcement agencies are prematurely losing valuable resources, officers with training and experience. Departments have become proactive in trying to address mental health issues to prevent psychiatric disability by implementing employee wellness plans and stress reduction interventions. Programs have been developed to mitigate the effects of stress on law enforcement personnel. Many law enforcement agencies have developed strategies to encourage early confidential referral for psychiatric treatment. They utilize peer support groups and employee assistance programs and develop alliances with mental health professionals. When these approaches fail, a fitness for duty process can be used to identify impairment in work functioning due to psychiatric factors with the prospect of later returning the officer to full duty.

These disparities appear to be growing, probably in part because we do not understand how to address their underlying causes. Many believe the underlying causes are thought to arise directly or indirectly from the psychosocial problems underlying poverty, such as hunger, poor housing, drug use, or crime. One logical solution is therefore to provide more community services targeted at addressing these problems within the most disadvantaged communities. However, to date, data on the efficacy of this approach is lacking. China serves as a possible laboratory for studying the efficacy of community-based programs. This is because the extensive community-based programs present prior to economic reforms in 1978 were removed, and then later re-instated in a quasi-experimental manner. In this issue, Yuying Shen uses multi-level models to explore the impact of this experiment on community mental health in a multi-level associational study. She finds that the quantity (but not their length of time in the community) of such services is positively associated with mental health. This study opens the door to more rigorous analyses that might motivate formal social experiments at the community level worldwide. If successful, such experiments might not only transform what we currently know not just about improving health in disadvantaged communities, but also prove transformative for health policy as a discipline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24636421/"}

This requires a model that can deal with the endogeneity in the relationship between health, occupation and work choices. We specify such a model and estimate it on a unique UK panel survey. The survey, called the National Child development Survey (NCDS), follows a cohort since their birth in 1958 until age 42. The analyses show us that early childhood health and ability have long lasting consequences for the mental health at the later ages. Females have lower levels of mental health. Mental health deteriorates with age for males and females, but the rate of deterioration is substantially lower for females. We also find that the rate of depreciation is lower when individuals work. For females we find large effects of occupation, for males we do not find this. Employment status is important for males, but not for females. For both genders we find very large effects of the onset of a long-standing illness. The probability of experiencing such an event depends on employment status, occupation and life style variables.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15386691/"}
{"id": "23114802", "title": "Environment and mental health.", "text": "Environments seen as the physical, chemical, and biological conditions to which organisms are subjected, define the ways we obtain various resources, their quantity and their quality. In interplay with our organisms, environments determine how 'fit' we are. An aspect of that fitness is the quality of mental functioning. Although there is a traditional view that there is something like an 'objective environment' and an 'effective environment', a part of the objective environment that actually affects the organism, the dividing line between the two is rather obscure. Environment in general cannot be defined without taking into account the behaviour of the organism, and it is especially challenging to define what environment means to humans, given the enormous variation and scope of human behaviours; what it is that we require and tolerate. Simultaneously, that physical environment is the broader context of what we usually term 'social environment'. This paper outlines the conceptual problems in determining and evaluating the relationship between environmental conditions and more proximal determinants of mental health, at the same time reviewing the assumptions of some of the well-known examples of that relationship.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23114802/"}

This study investigates the role of financial literacy in the nexus between household indebtedness and mental health, addressing a significant gap in the literature. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2014 wave, a nationally representative dataset, we analyze how financial literacy interacts with household debt and mental health outcomes. Multiple model specifications are employed to assess the moderating and mediating effects of financial literacy. Our findings reveal two key roles of financial literacy: (1) it improves mental health by reducing household indebtedness, and (2) it moderates the negative relationship between debt and mental health. Notably, basic financial literacy is a critical factor, particularly in explaining the effects of non-housing debt (as opposed to housing debt). The study highlights the dual function of financial literacy in mitigating the adverse psychological effects of household debt. Policymakers and financial educators should consider promoting financial literacy as a tool to enhance mental health, especially in contexts of high indebtedness. Future research could explore additional mediators and cultural variations in this relationship.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40401073/"}

Its origin can be traced to Plato, who argued that immorality is to the soul what disease is to the body. The purpose of this argument was to answer those who thought that morality is a set of social conventions, and in that sense, is contrary to nature. Plato responded by turning to those who made a systematic study of nature--the medical writers of his day--and claiming that if proper balance is needed to maintain a healthy body, the same is true of the soul. Thus the natural state of the soul is one in which the various parts agree on which should rule. This does not mean that Plato sought to excuse immoral behavior by treating it as a medical condition, only that he regarded immoral behavior as contrary to nature and thus treatable. Although later attempts to define mental health are not as rigid as Plato's, it is remarkable how many of his insights are still applicable, in particular the claim that morality and mental health, though not identical, are nonetheless linked. A case in point is the experience of wanting something but not liking the fact that you want it. Plato regarded internal conflict of this sort as a paradigm case of psychic dysfunction. I argue that we can regard it as either a moral failing or a mental one.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18962894/"}

Participants were 318 adolescents (age 14 to 15 at the beginning of the study). Structural equation modeling revealed (1) that SOC had long-term incremental validity over N, E, and GSE for tobacco use and alcohol use, whereas cannabis use was predicted by E and GSE; and (2) that long-term mental health after four years was only predicted by SOC. Two studies provide further evidence for the importance of considering salutogenic factors when forecasting mental health and health-related behavior beyond classical constructs such as N, E, and GSE.

Analyses included descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess for associations between variables, particularly MH model of care and perceived competence. Ninety-nine PDs (51%) responded. A total of 87% of PDs reported that MH care was taught as part of another rotation, yet PDs were receptive to curricular changes. Only 45% of PDs were aware of the 2009 American Academy of Pediatrics competencies, and PDs infrequently rated their residents' MH skills and knowledge to be above average. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was an exception: 64% reported above-average ADHD knowledge in diagnoses and 57% in treatment. There was an association between enhanced MH services in continuity clinics and perceived resident systems-based practice (P < .01) and medical knowledge (P = .04).

This guideline refers to the basic philosophy of suicide prevention in Chapter 1, risk factors for suicide in Chapter 2, and systems and activities for suicide prevention in Chapter 3. The Health Service Center, Okayama University plays central roles in mental health and suicide prevention measures on the Medical Campus. The primary prevention includes a mini-lecture on mental health, classes on mental health, and periodic workshops and lectures for freshmen. The secondary prevention includes interviews with students with mental health disorders by a psychiatrist during periodic health check-ups and introducing them to a hospital outside the university. The tertiary prevention includes support for students taking a leave of absence to return to school, periodic consultation with such students with mental disorders, and postvention following a suicide.

However, evidence on the cumulative effect of social support over the life course remains scarce, and even less is known about the impact of broader neighborhood-level social support on individuals' cognition-a crucial dimension in many countries, where neighborhoods serve as key support units for individuals. Using data from 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2020 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we employed mediation analysis to explore how individual and neighborhood social support accumulated across life stages are associated with cognition and depression at older ages. Our findings indicate that receiving individual support in youth was associated with a 0.5-point improvement in later-life cognitive scores, although no direct association was observed with depression. In addition, a one-point increase in the neighborhood support score was associated with a 1.2-point improvement in cognitive scores and 0.5 fewer depressive symptoms at older ages. These associations persist among individuals who were socioeconomically disadvantaged in their youth. Furthermore, both individual and neighborhood support in youth exert indirect effects on later-life cognition and depression by helping individuals maintain social support as they age. Our findings contribute theoretical insights into the importance of social support across life stages and highlight the stronger role of neighborhood support in shaping cognition and depression. Strengthening neighborhood social support and fostering lifelong supportive environments may help mitigate disadvantages in earlier life stages and reduce health disparities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40479799/"}

The revolving door patient was a category that had been spoken of for some time, but became a formal legal subject with the introduction of the Alberta Mental Health Act 2010 and Community Treatment Orders (CTOs). I demonstrate how a rationale of control over unpredictable and dangerous individuals was primary in creating this new category, and that the characterization of the revolving door patient required a disciplinary technology to reduce danger. I argue that the CTO is a medical-legal technology that solves the problem of governing a subject in order to produce a patient that manages mental illness. I conclude by reflecting on how the narrative of the revolving door patient, and of mental illness more broadly, has implications for personal identity and tensions between care and control. Dans cet article, je décris comment des 'pratiques divisées' ont créé une catégorie spécifique médico-légale - le « revolving door patient » - afin d'identifier, d'étiqueter et de contrôler les comportements de certains individus vivants avec une maladie mentale.

Je soutiens que le OTC est une technologie médico-légale qui résout le problème de contrôle d'un sujet en produisant un patient qui gère une maladie mentale.

Nurse-led monitoring using the structured Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRe) Profile identifies and addresses adverse effects of mental health medicines. This study investigated the implementation and clinical impact of ADRe, and barriers to and facilitators of sustained utilisation in routine practice. Administration of ADRe was observed for 30 residents prescribed mental health medicines in ten care homes. The study pharmacist reviewed completed ADRes against medication records. Policy context was explored in 30 interviews with service users, nurse managers and strategic leads in Wales. Residents were aged 60-95, and prescribed 1-17 (median 9 [interquartile range (IQR) 7-13]) medicines. ADRe identified a median of 18 [IQR 11.5-23] problems per resident and nurses made 2 [1-2] changes to care per resident. For example: falls were reported for 9 residents, and care was modified for 5; pain was identified in 8 residents, and alleviated for 7; all 6 residents recognised as dyspnoeic were referred to prescribers. Nurses referred 17 of 30 residents to prescribers. Pharmacists recommended review for all 30. Doubts about administering ADRe, sometimes expressed by people who had not yet used it, diminished as it became familiar. ADRe was needed to bridge communication between resident, nurses and prescribers. When barriers of time, complacency, and doctors' non-availability were overcome, reporting with ADRe made prescribers more likely to heed nurses' concerns regarding residents' welfare. Clinical gains were facilitated by one-to-one time, staff-resident relationships, and unification of documentation. To our knowledge, ADRe is the only instrument that brings a full account of patients' problems to medication reviews. This juxtaposition of signs and symptoms against prescriptions facilitates dose adjustments and de-prescribing and leads to: reduced pain and sedation; early identification of problems linked to ADRs, such as falls; and timely medication reviews e.g. for dyspnoea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509537/"}

The main message delivered to laypeople, however, is that mental disorders are brain diseases cured by scientifically designed medications. Here we describe how this misleading message is generated. We summarize the academic studies describing how biomedical observations are often misrepresented in the scientific literature through various forms of data embellishment, publication biases favoring initial and positive studies, improper interpretations, and exaggerated conclusions. These misrepresentations also affect biological psychiatry and are spread through mass media documents. Exacerbated competition, hyperspecialization, and the need to obtain funding for research projects might drive scientists to misrepresent their findings. Moreover, journalists are unaware that initial studies, even when positive and promising, are inherently uncertain. Journalists preferentially cover them and almost never inform the public when those studies are disconfirmed by subsequent research. This explains why reductionist theories about mental health often persist in mass media even though the scientific claims that have been put forward to support them have long been contradicted. These misrepresentations affect the care of patients. Indeed, studies show that a neuro-essentialist conceptualization of mental disorders negatively affects several aspects of stigmatization, reduces the chances of patients' healing, and overshadows psychotherapeutic and social approaches that have been found effective in alleviating mental suffering. Public information about mental health should avoid these reporting biases and give equal consideration to the biological, psychological, and social aspects of mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33156157/"}

Expert consensus existed with regard to the importance of three challenges in the field of clinical mental health research: (1) the development of new, safe and effective interventions for mental disorders; (2) understanding the mechanisms of disease in order to be able to develop such new interventions; and (3) defining outcomes (an improved set of outcomes, including alternative outcomes) to use for clinical mental health research evaluation. Proposed actions involved increasing the utilization of tailored approaches (personalized medicine), developing blended eHealth/mHealth decision aids/guidance tools that help the clinician to choose between various treatment modalities, developing specific treatments in order to better target comorbidity and (further) development of biological, psychological and psychopharmacological interventions. The experts indicated that addressing these priorities will result in increased efficacy and impact across Europe; with a high probability of success, given that Europe has important strengths, such as skilled academics and a long research history. Finally, the experts stressed the importance of creating funding and coordinated networking as essential action needed in order to target the variety of challenges in clinical mental health research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25337940/"}

Previous research found that parity significantly lowered average out-of-pocket (OOP) spending on MH/SUD treatment of children. No evidence is available on how parity affects OOP spending by families of children with the highest MH/SUD treatment expenditures. We used a difference-in-differences study design to examine whether parity reduced families' (1) share of total MH/SUD treatment expenditures paid OOP or (2) average OOP spending among children whose total MH/SUD expenditures met or exceeded the 90th percentile. By using claims data, we compared changes 2 years before (1999-2000) and 2 years after (2001-2002) the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program implemented parity to a contemporaneous group of health plans that did not implement parity over the same 4-year period. We examined those enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program because their parity directive is similar to and served as a model for the new federal parity law. Parity led to statistically significant annual declines in the share of total MH/SUD treatment expenditures paid OOP (-5%, 95% confidence interval: -6% to -4%) and average OOP spending on MH/SUD treatment (-$178, 95% confidence interval: -257 to -97). This study provides the first empirical evidence that parity reduces the share and level of OOP spending by families of children with the highest MH/SUD treatment expenditures; however, these spending reductions were smaller than anticipated and unlikely to meaningfully improve families' financial protection.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23420919/"}

Although different studies claim that migration could be a potential risk factor for self-harming behaviours, an in-depth exploration of the presence and characteristics of self-harm in the context of asylum is needed. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across the databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and PsycArticles, regarding the main features of self-harming behaviour among refugees in Europe. Twelve articles and 3 main trajectories were identified: (1) A context at-risk: self-harm and detention centres; (2) A target at-risk: self-harm and unaccompanied minors; (3) A comparison between the mental health of asylum seekers and natives. Research on this topic in Europe is still underdeveloped and disorganised. Studies have mainly carried out wider quantitative investigations on mental health, usually overlapping self-harm with suicide. Detention centres emerged as the most widely investigated context and the one with the highest risk for self-harming behaviours. Instead, unaccompanied minors emerged as a particularly vulnerable category. Research in this field should be improved, combining quantitative and qualitative methods for a deeper understanding of the meanings of self-harm across cultures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557612/"}

Emergency department syndromic surveillance is recognized as a valuable tool for informing public health activities during and immediately following a disaster. Data typically consist of daily visit reports from hospital emergency departments (EDs) of basic patient data and free-text chief complaints. To develop keyword lists, comparisons were made with existing CDC categories and then integrated with lists from the New York City and New Jersey health departments in a collaborative effort. Two comprehensive lists were developed, each containing multiple subcategories and over 100 keywords for both mental health and injury. The data classifiers using these keywords were used to assess impacts of Sandy on mental health and injuries in New York State.

Japan experienced severe damage following the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, and some survivors continue to live in prefabricated temporary housing, built collectively in damaged areas. Previous studies have shown that social relationships in such communities have the potential to protect the mental health of disaster survivors. We examined the association between survivors' social support and social participation in 2012 and their psychological distress in 2013 using the K6 scale. Self-reported questionnaires were distributed to all 15,979 households in prefabricated temporary housing in eight municipalities in Miyagi prefecture in 2012, and 19,284 adults from 9366 (58.6%) households responded. One year later, 10,880 adults responded to a follow-up survey. Multivariate multilevel linear regression analyses with multiply imputed datasets showed that survivors' psychological distress at follow-up significantly differed between communities (community-level variance [standard error] = 0.38 [0.13]). The variance was reduced to 0.25 [0.09] after considering individual demographic characteristics and psychological distress at baseline. Individual- and community-level social relationships of 7.1% and 15.8%, respectively, explained the difference. After adjusting for covariates including K6 scale at baseline, individual-level social support, community-level social support, and individual-level social participation were significantly associated with low psychological distress at follow-up (coefficients [95% confidence intervals] were: -0.54 [-0.79, -0.30]; -0.43 [-0.72, -0.14]; and -0.22 [-0.40, -0.04], respectively). Community-level social participation was not significantly associated with psychological distress. The present study showed that: 1) survivors' psychological distress varied between temporary housing communities in 2013; 2) individual- and community-level social relationships contributed to the difference; and 3) individual- and community-level social relationships in 2012 were protectively associated with survivors' psychological distress in 2013.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of transition into parenthood on mental health and psychological distress using longitudinal survey data.

Parenthood was classified as first time parent (first and only child <12 months at interview date), subsequent parent (child <12 months and other children in the family), existing parent (no children <12 months but other existing children in the family) and not a parent. We used fixed effects generalised linear modelling, controlling for all time-invariant and time-varying sources of confounding in a sample of 6670 adults within families. After adjusting for confounding from time-varying partner status, area deprivation, labour force status and household income, those who became first time parents reported an increase in mental health (β 1.22, 95% CI -0.06 to 2.50; mean=83.8, SD=14.1) and a decrease in psychological distress (β -0.70 95% CI -1.10 to -0.29; mean=13.4, SD=5.0). Subsequent parents reported a decrease in psychological distress (β -0.60 95% CI -0.95 to -0.24).

They were all located in the asylum along with severe and chronic cases. Dr Helen Boyle worked among London's poor in the 1890s and observed the deterioration of cases of nervous disorder and borderline insanity due to their lack of treatment. The early treatment of borderline cases was the aim of Boyle's charitable hospital, founded in 1905, for nervous disorders in women and girls. Boyle's interest in mental disorder included the mentally defective and she was a founder member of the Guardianship Society which sought to keep those defined as such within the community. The history of the care and treatment of the 'insane' has concentrated largely on the public and private asylums. London-based facilities such as the Tavis-tock clinic and the Maudsley Hospital, which both treated rate-aided patients in the inter-war period, have been given a great deal of attention because of wealthy benefactors and the involvement of high profile individuals. Boyle's unique in-patient facility in Brighton preceded the Maudsley by almost 20 years and as such fills an important gap in mental health history. Boyle's work challenged the lunacy laws and set out to establish a holistic system of care for recoverable conditions outside the asylum system. This essay concentrates on the work of Dr Helen Boyle in Brighton but also highlights other facilities that were available for rate-aided patients, which have been neglected in the historiography of mental health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11811188/"}

In-depth interviews were conducted with 112 Native American men between the ages of 18 and 24 years. The mean age reported was 21 years. Thirty-eight percent of the young men reported having children. The young men reported experiences of historical trauma during their lifetime as well as emotional responses due to historical losses. Ninety-five percent reported that it was very important that they use some form of birth control to prevent their partner from getting pregnant within the next year. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, as age increased, young men were less likely to use birth control to prevent pregnancy. The young men who reported feelings of loss due to experiences related to historical trauma and loss were more likely to use birth control. Findings from this study suggest that public health efforts to educate AI men about planned pregnancies and the use of birth control may be most effective in adolescence.

However, little consideration is often given to the influence that headteachers' and school staff's prior beliefs have on the implementation of public health interventions. This study examined primary school headteachers' and school health co-ordinators' views regarding child health in order to provide greater insights on the school's perspective for those designing future school-based health interventions. A qualitative study was conducted using 19 semi-structured interviews with headteachers, deputy headteachers and school health co-ordinators in the primary school setting. All transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Whilst many participants in this study believed good health was vital for learning, wide variance was evident regarding the perceived health of school pupils and the magnitude of responsibility schools should take in addressing child health behaviours. Although staff in this study acknowledged the importance of their role, many believed the responsibility placed upon schools for health promotion was becoming too much; suggesting health interventions need to better integrate school, parental and societal components. With mental health highlighted as an increasing priority in many schools, incorporating wellbeing outcomes into future school based health interventions is advocated to ensure a more holistic understanding of child health is gained. Understanding the health beliefs of school staff when designing interventions is crucial as there appears to be a greater likelihood of interventions being successfully adopted if staff perceive a health issue as important among their pupils. An increased dependability on schools for addressing health was expressed by headteachers in this study, highlighting a need for better understanding of parental, child and key stakeholder perspectives on responsibility for child health. Without this understanding, there is potential for certain child health issues to be ignored.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25925554/"}

In India, recent reforms include transforming public psychiatric institutions from sites of treatment to research and training institutes, known as \"Centres of Excellence,\" to combat acute manpower shortages and modernize psychiatry. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at a public psychiatric hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir, one of the institutions selected to be a future \"Centre of Excellence,\" this article focuses on how these reforms have affected psychiatric institutions themselves. Efforts at modernizing and increasing access to mental health care-that is, emphasizing shortened stays, increasing outpatient treatment, and providing care in the \"community\"-depend on quarantining stigmatized, chronically ill, long-term patients who reside in custodial conditions with fewer resources and limited attention from providers. Psychiatrists have a radically different vision for redressing manpower shortages than the MGMH and Indian state, revealing contradictions in the reform process. This paper demonstrates how modernizing mental health care splits mental institutions spatially, ontologically, temporally, and epistemologically, so that the process of modernizing the institution is neither seamless nor complete.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27510925/"}

In this Invited Commentary, the author describes his experience leading that effort as the associate dean for curriculum to help inform more nascent efforts taking shape across the medical education continuum and in practice.Starting in 2006, a simple model with three components was developed to guide the new well-being initiative: (1) Reduce unnecessary stressors and enhance the learning environment; (2) teach students skills to better manage their stress and provide and encourage them to use a range of psychological and emotional support resources; and (3) create more opportunities for students to find meaning in their work. Over the next 10 years, striking decreases in adverse mental health outcomes were seen with an 85% reduction in the depression rate and a 75% decrease in the anxiety rate in first-year medical students.The author argues that the following factors contributed to the initiative's effectiveness: addressing the problem largely as one stemming from the learning environment, developing a deep understanding of the lived experience of students and avoiding making assumptions about what they need, reducing students' cognitive load, addressing problematic student mind-sets through a modest resilience curriculum, treating students with respect and compassion, and creating greater opportunity for students to find meaning in their work.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30489287/"}

Interview questions were based on a modified health beliefs model exploring the \"readiness to act\" among providers. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Interviews continued until theme saturation was reached. Saturation was achieved after 26 ED and 19 PC interviews. Emergency department/primary care providers were similar in their perception of patient susceptibility to childhood adversity. Childhood mental health problems were the most frequently referenced adverse outcome, followed by poor childhood physical health. Adult health outcomes because of childhood adversity were rarely mentioned. Many providers felt that knowing about childhood adversity in the medical setting was important because it relates to provision of tangible resources. There were mixed opinions about whether or not pediatric health care providers should be identifying childhood adversities at all. Although providers exhibited knowledge about childhood adversity, the perceived effect on health was only immediate and tangible. The effect of childhood adversity on lifelong health and the responsibility and potential accountability health systems have in addressing these important health determinants was not recognized by many respondents in our study. Addressing these provider perspectives will be a critical component of successful transformation toward more accountable health care delivery systems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112109/"}

LCA was used to identify subgroups of birthing parents with different symptom informedness and preparedness using 10 binary variables (N = 148). Bivariate analysis was conducted to examine the association between characteristics and each typology. The 3-class models had better fit indices and interpretability for both informedness and preparedness typologies: High, High-moderate, and Moderate-low. The sample characteristics were different by typologies. In the modified discrimination in medical settings assessment, we found higher discrimination scores in the moderate-low informedness and preparedness typologies. The moderate-low preparedness typology had a higher percentage of birthing parents who did not have private insurance, underwent cesarean section, and planned for formula or mixed infant feeding. The median PHQ-4 scores at 4 weeks postpartum were lower among those in high informedness and preparedness typologies.

The emerging field of implementation science has begun to systematically investigate strategies for more efficiently integrating evidence-based practices into community settings. Significantly less translational research has focused specifically on the school setting. To address this need, we examined the implementation of a school-based trauma intervention across three distinct regions. We conducted key informant interviews guided by Mendel's Framework of Dissemination in Health Services Intervention Research with multiple school stakeholders to examine what school organizational characteristics influence the adoption and implementation process and sustainability of Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS). Participants were selected from schools in three geographic regions in the United States: Western, Midwestern, and Southern. Our findings reveal that while sites had some common organizational factors that appeared to facilitate implementation, regions differed in how they compensated for less robust implementation domains. Across all regions, school stakeholders recognized the need for services to support students impacted by trauma. In the Western region, there was no centralized district policy for implementation; therefore, implementation was facilitated by school-level change agents and supervision support from the district mental health unit. In the Midwestern region, centralized district policies drove implementation. In both the Midwestern and Southern regions, implementation was facilitated by collaboration with a local mental health agency. This study contributes to the paucity of empirical information on the organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based mental health interventions in schools. Our findings reveal that different implementation strategies across policies, structures, and resources can result in implementation of a school-based intervention. Frameworks such as Mendel's can be helpful in identifying areas of strength and improvement of implementation within a school organization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30202196/"}

There is a strong link between indebtedness and psychiatric morbidity at the individual level, with interest rates being an important factor determining ability to repay debt. However, no prior research has explored whether central bank interest rate changes directly influence mental health, nor whether this varies by levels of indebtedness. We use British data (N = 93,255) to explore whether the Bank of England base-rate affected how perceived burden of non-mortgage debt (low, medium, and high) influenced psychiatric morbidity. Psychiatric morbidity was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Our primary outcome measure was a binary indicator of \"psychiatric caseness\" (>3 on a 0-12 scale). We also used the GHQ-12 as a continuous measure of distress. When interest rates are high (low) there is an increased (decreased) risk of psychiatric morbidity only among those with a high debt burden (b = 0.026, p =  0.02). This result was robust to alternative explanations. Thus a 1 percentage point base-rate increase is associated with a 2.6% increase that someone with a high debt burden will experience psychiatric morbidity. Our study uses subjective indicators of debt burden. We were unable to determine the mechanism behind our effect. Changes in central bank interest rates to meet economic objectives pose a threat to mental health. Mental health support is needed for those in debt and central banks may need to consider how their decisions influence population mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29602060/"}

{"id": "24159013", "title": "From Kraepelin to a modern and integrative scientific discipline: the development of transcultural psychiatry in Germany.", "text": "The roots of transcultural psychiatry in Germany can be traced back to Emil Kraepelin, who made the first culturally comparative observations on mental disorders in Southeast Asia at the start of the 20th century. Since the beginning of the 1970s, contributors to the literature of transcultural psychiatry in Germany have been predominantly concerned with the mental health of migrant workers from Mediterranean countries, particularly the practical difficulties and therapeutic implications of inpatient psychiatric treatment of these migrant groups. The inauguration of the Section on Transcultural Psychiatry of the German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy 20 years ago reflected an increasing scientific interest in this topic. In addition to the psychic impact of migration, research into transcultural care is currently focused on disparities in the utilization of health care and conjectured barriers to access to health and mental health care among migrants. Furthermore, studies based on epidemiological approaches have been carried out in order to resolve the question of whether migrants are as affected by mental disorders as the ethnic German population, and which issues contribute to the so-called \"healthy migrant\" effect. Other topics that have been explored in the last 10 years are the particular psychosocial situation of asylum seekers and refugees in Germany, and the effects of inadequate integration and discrimination on their mental health. In summary, after a short historical and theoretical overview, this article reviews the current major themes in transcultural research in German contemporary psychiatry, and concludes with an overview of future developments in this field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24159013/"}

Comparing these cohorts born 12 years apart, we ask whether psychological distress has increased, and, if so, whether this increase can be explained by differences in their childhood conditions. Data were utilized from two well-known population-based birth cohorts, the National Child Development Study and the 1970 British Cohort Study. Latent variable models and causal mediation methods were employed. After establishing the measurement equivalence of psychological distress in the two cohorts we found that men and women born in 1970 reported higher levels of psychological distress compared with those born in 1958. These differences were more pronounced in men (b = 0.314, 95% confidence interval 0.252-0.375), with the magnitude of the effect being twice as strong compared with women (b = 0.147, 95% confidence interval 0.076-0.218). The effect of all hypothesized early-life mediators in explaining these differences was modest. Our findings have implications for public health policy, indicating a higher average level of psychological distress among a cohort born in 1970 compared with a generation born 12 years earlier. Due to increases in life expectancy, more recently born cohorts are expected to live longer, which implies - if such differences persist - that they are likely to spend more years with mental health-related morbidity compared with earlier-born cohorts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27733211/"}

The current cross-sectional study, conducted with 231 veterans, examines the relationship between socio-demographic features and both anxiety and depression in navy veterans after retirement. Spielberg's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used for anxiety assessment, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used for depression assessment. The analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.0. It was found that the mean score of state anxiety was 41 and trait anxiety, 38. Severe depression was found in 6.5% of the veterans, moderate in 8.3% and mild in 21.7%. The presence of a serious health problems was an independent predictor of both anxiety and depression's more serious symptoms. Inversely, the stability in terms of retirement choice was negatively related to depression, while the development of new interests and activities after retirement was negatively related to both anxiety and depression. Further, life satisfaction after retirement was a predictor of lower current anxiety levels among veterans.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32127021/"}

While interventions have sought to address this issue, the literature on these efforts has not been synthesised. This paper presents a systematic mapping of interventions that have been implemented to address cultural factors that affect women's use of skilled maternity care. It identifies and develops a map of the literature; describes the range of interventions, types of literature and study designs; and identifies knowledge gaps. Searches conducted systematically in ten electronic databases and two websites for literature published between 01/01/1990 and 28/02/2013 were combined with expert-recommended references. Potentially eligible literature included journal articles and grey literature published in English, French or Spanish. Items were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding 96 items in the final map. Data extracted from the full text documents are presented in tables and a narrative synthesis. The results show that a diverse range of interventions has been implemented in 35 countries to address cultural factors that affect the use of skilled maternity care. Items are classified as follows: (1) service delivery models; (2) service provider interventions; (3) health education interventions; (4) participatory approaches; and (5) mental health interventions. The map provides a rich source of information on interventions attempted in diverse settings that might have relevance elsewhere. A range of literature was identified, from narrative descriptions of interventions to studies using randomised controlled trials to evaluate impact. Only 23 items describe studies that aim to measure intervention impact through the use of experimental or observational-analytic designs. Based on the findings, we identify avenues for further research in order to better document and measure the impact of interventions to address cultural factors that affect use of skilled maternity care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25268940/"}

This information can have key implications for the development of comprehensive interventions and psychological treatment programmes. This study investigated the shared and unique contribution of financial well-being, social support, and trait EI on different types of psychological distress. A total of 309 patients seeking psychological treatment at an outpatient mental health clinic in the United States provided consent to participate in this study. Patients responded to online questionnaires corresponding to symptomatology, demographic characteristics, and psychometric assessments. Hierarchical linear regressions identified the common and unique role of each set of variables in predicting nine different symptom clusters of psychological distress. Financial well-being, social support, and trait EI were negatively related to the majority of symptom clusters, together explaining between 20% and 53% of the variance. Whereas financial well-being and social support uniquely captured a significant amount of the variance in all outcomes, trait EI, most notably the well-being and self-control dimensions, captured the most. The results highlight the importance of all factors in understanding variations in mental health among help-seeking urban individuals. Furthermore, the results identify well-being and self-control as emotional facets to consider in therapeutic programmes in as much as to mitigate the risk of severe psychological distress within this population. Together, financial well-being, social support, and trait emotional intelligence (EI) can help prevent psychological distress in help-seeking urban individuals. Perceived social support and social contact differentially contributed to improved symptoms of psychological distress. Studies should examine the impact of targeting well-being and self-control in psychological treatment. The correlational nature of this study highlights the need to replicate findings via experimental or longitudinal designs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31889323/"}

Our study aimed to assess fidelity to Mindset recommendations in Canadian newspaper reports of a recent celebrity suicide. A secondary aim is to identify common themes discussed in these newspaper articles. Articles about Robin Williams' suicide from major Canadian newspapers were gathered and coded for presence or absence of each of the 14 recommendations in the \"Covering Suicide\" section of Mindset. A threshold of 80% was set to test for high fidelity to the guidelines. A qualitative content analysis of the articles was also undertaken to discern common themes and social issues discussed in the articles. Fifty-five per cent of articles surpassed the 80% threshold for high fidelity, while 85% applied at least 70% of the recommendations. The recommendation most commonly overlooked was \"Do tell others considering suicide how they can get help,\" which was absent in 73% of articles. The most common themes discussed were those of addictions and stigma. The news articles generally follow the evidence-based guidelines regarding the reporting of suicide set out in Mindset. This is a welcome development. Future research should continue to examine reporting of suicide to assess for further improvements, while also examining the wider impact of Mindset on the reporting of mental illness per se.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27600531/"}

This article examines traditional and alternative models of resilience through analyses of quantitative and qualitative data from an evaluation of a year-long empowerment program for 33 Black girls (mean age = 14.97 years). Based on critical consciousness theory and Black feminism, this program was designed to empower participants through critical reflection and development of positive gendered racial identity. Quantitative analyses found no change over time in traditional measures of individual resilience. However, alternative measures of collective resilience show positive change. Specifically, quantitative analyses reveal that participants developed increased awareness of structural inequalities faced by Black girls/women and decreased adherence to neoliberal ideologies of personal responsibility and individual striving. Additionally, qualitative analyses show that participants critically reflected on their experiences of oppression, developed mutual support and positive gendered racial identity, and engaged in collective action. These findings demonstrate positive effects of empowerment-based programing, challenge the utility of traditional, individually-focused models of resilience, and reframe Black girls' resistance to injustice as an alternative, collective form of resilience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32787728/"}

When Canada ratified the CRPD, it reserved the right to continue using substitute decision making schemes even if the CRPD was 'interpreted as requiring their elimination'.

Many international legal scholars have called this interpretation unrealistic. We agree and, in this article, describe how this unrealistic approach would result in extensive harm and suffering for people with severe cognitive or psychotic disorders.

Status incongruence and psychological well-being in contemporary China.", "text": "During recent decades, China has experienced rapid economic growth, but the authoritarian state has continued to hold tight control over the access to political power. Scholars have long suspected that the incongruence between growing economic resources and lack of political power may spawn dissatisfaction and anxiety. But little empirical research has systematically assessed the incongruence and its psychological consequences in China. Moreover, social theorists have disagreed on the consequences of status incongruence and empirical examination has been inconclusive so far. Therefore, we ask: 1) do Chinese people perceive the incongruence between their economic conditions and access to power? And 2) does this incongruence affect their psychological well-being? We applied the diagonal mobility model from stratification research to analyze data from a nationally representative survey in China so as to assess the incongruence between power and wealth status and adjudicate its consequences. We found that Chinese people perceived substantial gaps in their power and wealth status. Contrary to what theorists of status inconsistency expect, the incongruence between power and wealth status does not harm psychological well-being. Consistent with the prediction of the synthesizing approach, individuals tend to emphasize the status dimension in which they enjoy advantages and discount the dimension in which they suffer detriments. Adding to the literature on the social determinants of health, this study shows how the multi-dimensional nature of social stratification affect the disparities of psychological well-being in contemporary China.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276967/"}

Previous studies have shown a correlation between speaking an Indigenous language and improved social and emotional wellbeing among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the population nationally. This study considers the rich variety of contemporary Indigenous language contexts and the extent to which traditional languages, new contact languages and English are spoken. It adopts the concept of 'language ecologies' - the different configurations of languages spoken in a location - to investigate how the relationship between Indigenous language use (traditional or new), and social and emotional wellbeing varies by ecology type. We classify the country geographically into five language ecology types, and use regression analysis to investigate associations between Indigenous language use and social and emotional wellbeing by language ecology type. We find heterogenous associations across different language ecologies Speaking an Indigenous language is associated with lower than average levels of wellbeing in areas where English is frequently spoken as a first language, while it is associated with greater than average wellbeing in other areas. Associations between wellbeing and speaking an Indigenous language are relatively larger in areas where traditional Indigenous languages are frequently spoken as a first language than in other areas.

One of the unresolved issues in gerontological research has concerned the definition and measurement of quality of life (Lawton, 1991). This article focuses on subjective well-being, one of the four components proposed by Lawton (1991). There seems to be a growing consensus that most scales of well-being have at least two concepts in common, positive and negative affect. To test this hypothesis, two well-being scales, the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (Lawton, 1975) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), were subjected to confirmatory factor analyses, using data on 1717 participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing aged between 70 and 103 years. Each scale was shown to contain factors of positive and negative affect. The article concludes with a suggestion that the measurement of quality of life in elders should include, at a minimum, scales of positive and negative affect as well as other measures relevant to the aspect of quality of life under consideration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11087107/"}

The concept of a sign is crucial in psychiatry. How do signs emerge, and what gives them validity and legitimacy? What are the boundaries of 'normal' and 'pathological' behaviour and mental experiences? To address these issues, we analyse the characteristics and rules that govern semiological signs and clinical elements. We examine 'normality' from the perspective of Georges Canguilehm and compare the differences of 'normal' in physiology and psychiatry. We then examine the history and the philosophical, linguistic and medical-psychiatric origins of semiology during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (the Age of Revolution). The field of rhetoric and oratory has emphasized the importance of passions, emotions and language as applied to signs of madness. Another perspective on semiology, provided by Michel Foucault, lays stress on the concept of 'instinct' and the axis of voluntary-involuntary behaviour. Finally, we analyse how statistics and eugenics have played an important role in our current conceptualization of the norm and therefore the scientific discourse behind the established clinical signs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26847555/"}

The 2024 Bill proposes useful new definitions (e.g., 'mental disorder', 'treatment') and provisions governing specific practices (e.g., 'physical restraint'). Revision is needed to better provide care and protect rights: (a) proposed treatment criteria for involuntary admission should be retained, but 'risk' criteria deleted; (b) treatment provisions should ensure mental health legislation provides for timely, accountable treatment for all patients; (c) detailed provisions about the content of treatment plans do not belong in primary legislation, which is ill-suited to micro-managing individual care and (d) the Mental Health Commission should be incorporated into the Health Information and Quality Authority.

Worldwide, a vast amount of research findings converge to the stigmatizing representation of people with mental illness by the media, with reference to the dominant stereotype of violence. The present study aims to explore the representations of mental illness in the Greek Press using a quantitative and qualitative approach. Potential changes in the media portrayal of mental illness during the last decade are also being examined: findings are compared to those of a previous research that took place in 2001, following the same methodology. The sample consisted of press articles referring to mental illness, that were indexed daily from the Greek newspapers during the period July-November 2011. The items were categorized into thematic categories and further analyzed taking in account the use of stigmatizing vocabulary, the reproduction of common myths concerning mental illness, the overall valence of each article (stigmatizing, neutral or anti-stigmatizing) towards people with mental illness, as well as the contextual implications conveyed in the use of psychiatric terms as a metaphor. The largest thematic category that emerged from the sample was that referring to the repercussions of the economic crisis to mental health, followed by the category of articles where psychiatric terms are used as a metaphor. The comparisons made between 2001 and 2011 revealed an improved representation of mental illness in terms of stigma, especially regarding schizophrenia. The public expression of stigma has decreased, with fewer stigmatizing articles and notably more neutral in valence articles. The findings of this study suggest a decline of the media propensity for emotionally charged descriptions and a shift towards objective journalism regarding mental illness. This is most likely to be attributed to the anti-stigma campaigns, targeting media workers, that have been implemented during the last decade in Greece. Nevertheless, the public expression of stigma remains present by taking more subtle forms. Such examples are demonstrated by the semantic context of articles in which psychiatric terms are used as a metaphor, or by the recurrent reference of (unspecified) mental illness on the occasion of violent crime.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26197099/"}

The 2004 public health survey in Skåne in Southern Sweden is a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study that was answered by 27,757 respondents aged 18-80 yielding a 59% response rate. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the associations between political trust and self-reported psychological health adjusting for possible confounders (age, country of origin, education, economic stress and generalized trust in other people i.e. horizontal trust). We found that 13.0% of the men and 18.9% of the women reported poor psychological health. A total of 17.3% and 11.6% of the male and female respondents, respectively, reported that they had no trust at all in the national parliament, and another 38.2% and 36.2%, respectively, reported that their political trust was not particularly high. Respondents in younger age groups, born abroad, with high education, high levels of economic stress, low horizontal trust and low political trust had significantly higher levels of self-reported poor psychological health. There was a significant association between low political trust and low horizontal trust. After adjustments for age, country of origin, education and economic stress, the inclusion of horizontal trust reduced the odds ratios of self-reported poor psychological health in the \"no political trust at all\" category compared to the \"very high political trust\" category from 1.6 to 1.4 among men and from 1.7 to 1.4 among women. It is concluded that low political trust in the Riksdag seems to be significantly and positively associated with poor mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19049849/"}

We carried out 51 semi-structured audio-recorded interviews after participants responded to a survey regarding food security status and maternal depressive symptoms. Each interview was transcribed. Through a content analysis, we coded \"meaning units\" in each manuscript and organized them by themes in ATLAS.ti. Among participants reporting both food insecurity and depressive symptoms, we identified three primary areas of concern: trade-offs, mental health, and child well-being. Parents described how trade-offs associated with food insecurity have a profound relationship with their mental health and home environment that strongly affects young children. Descriptions of hardships include anxiety and depression related to overdue bills and shut-off notices, strains with housing costs, and safety. Parents described how their own frustration, anxiety, and depression related to economic hardship have a negative impact on their children's physical health, and their social and emotional development. Parents in food insecure households recognize that trade-offs between food and other basic necessities are associated with their personal stress and poor mental health that, in turn, affects their children's health and development.

Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33493652/"}

Little is known regarding how the prison environment may affect the mental health of adult prisoners. Consequently, there is a need to investigate how this setting may exacerbate mental distress among this community. This literature review explores how the prison climate influences the mental health of adult prisoners. A thematic synthesis approach was used to elicit data relating to the aspects of the prison climate, which influence the mental health of prisoners. Four primary themes emerged from the synthesis: social, emotional, organizational and physical aspects. Prisoners perceive the prison climate to have a negative influence upon their mental health. However, perceived positively, prison was regarded as a place of respite, which afforded structure and an opportunity to access health services. There is limited research available specifically exploring the potential impact of the prison climate upon those from black and ethnic minorities groups. Nurses must recognize the aspects of the prison environment that may impact upon the mental health of prisoners and demonstrate innovation and imagination in their application of interventions. Additionally nurses need to take an active role in influencing and structuring the political agenda, which governs the clinical setting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122924/"}

The 2007 Hawaii Health Survey with linked zip-code information was used to investigate the effects of education at both individual and neighborhood levels using mixed-effects models. Geographic Information System was applied to map the geographical distributions of education, social well-being, and health. It was found that individual-level education benefits mental health and its effects are largely mediated by respondents' employment status and their social well-being (social integration, social contribution, social actualization, and social coherence). Both individual and neighborhood-level education promotes physical health and their effects are partially mediated by economic well-being and two indicators of social well-being (social integration and social coherence). Results of this study suggest the independent effects of two levels of education on physical health and the importance of education and social well-being to both mental and physical health in the State of Hawaii.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21075036/"}

High dynamics of the expenditure increase will result in the development of a model of community psychiatry and a gradual move away from the hospital psychiatric treatment towards mental health care in the open system, including the community one. This research is based on data on the implementation of services for mental health care in the framework of agreements with the National Health Fund, which has been collected in the NFZ IT system. Some information is from 2010, which was adopted as the base date for the implementation of the principles of the National Mental Health Program in 2011. The data from the implementation of individual benefits in 2013 were used for the comparison. In addition, other selected organizational, economic and financial elements of the psychiatric care system were analyzed. In 2013, compared to 2010, increased the number of mental health care organizations: outpatient mental health clinics (an increase of 37 clinics), outpatient mental health day hospital wards (an increase of 25 wards) and community psychiatric treatment teams (an increase of 74 teams). The largest increase in the value of contracts (approx. 150%) was related to community treatment teams. Between 2010 and 2013 there was an increase in the value of cleared contracts in psychiatric care, in general and in each of the three forms of psychiatric care (i.e., in day wards, outpatient mental health clinics and in community teams). The highest increase in investments included community treatment teams, to a lesser extent day wards and outpatient clinics.

This study addresses the critical challenge of automated mental health classification by comparing three distinct computational approaches: (1) Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) with advanced feature engineering, (2) Prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), and (3) Fine-tuned LLMs. The dataset consisted of over 51,000 publicly available text statements from social media platforms, tagged with seven mental health conditions: Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bipolar Disorder, and Personality Disorder. The dataset was stratified into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation. The primary outcome was classification accuracy across these seven mental health conditions. Additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score were analyzed. We compared the results of the three computational approaches and overfitting was monitored through validation loss across epochs for the fine-tuned LLM. The NLP model with advanced feature engineering achieved an overall accuracy of 95%, surpassing both the prompt-engineered LLM (65%) and the fine-tuned LLM (91%). This model performed exceptionally well in terms of accuracy and precision. While fine-tuning for three epochs yielded optimal results, further training led to overfitting and decreased performance. This study demonstrates the significant benefits of applying advanced text preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to traditional NLP models, alongside fine-tuning LLMs, such as GPT-4o-mini, for mental health classification tasks. The results clearly indicate that off-the-shelf LLM chatbots using prompt engineering are inadequate for mental health classification, performing 30% points below specialized NLP approaches. Despite the popularity of general-purpose LLMs, specialized approaches remain superior for critical healthcare applications like mental health classification.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40619512/"}

Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovation in the prevention of MDEs in the workplace. Electronic mental (e-mental) health programs are a cost-effective approach toward the self-management of stress and emotional issues. E-mental health dropout rate, MDE prevalence, and symptoms greatly vary by sex and age. Thus, the development and implementation of e-mental health programs for the prevention of MDEs need to be examined through a sex and age lens to enhance program use and effectiveness. This study aimed to examine design feature preferences based on sex and age for an e-mental health program targeted toward depression prevention. Household residents across Canada were contacted using the random digit dialing method. 500 women and 511 men who were 18 years and older and who were at high risk of having MDEs were interviewed. Internet use was assessed using questions from the 2012 Canadian Internet Use Survey conducted by Statistics Canada, and preferred design features of e-mental health program questions were developed by the BroMatters team members. The proportions of likely use of specific features of e-mental health programs in women were estimated and compared with those in men using chi-square tests. The comparisons were made overall and by age groups. Men (181/511, 35.4%) and women (211/500, 42.2%) differed significantly in their likelihood of using an e-mental health program. Compared with men (307/489, 62.8%), women (408/479, 85.2%) were more likely to use the internet for medical or health-related information. Women were more likely to use the following design features: practices and exercises to help reduce symptoms of stress and depression (350/500, 70.7%), a self-help interactive program that provides information about stress and work problems (302/500, 61.8%), the ability to ask questions and receive answers from mental health professionals via email or text message (294/500, 59.9%), and to receive printed materials by mail (215/500, 43.4%). Men preferred to receive information in a video game format (156/511, 30.7%). Younger men (46/73, 63%) and younger women (49/60, 81%) were more likely to access a program through a mobile phone or an app, and younger men preferred having access to information in a video game format. Factors such as sex and age influenced design feature preferences for an e-mental health program. Working women who are at high risk for MDEs preferred interactive programs incorporating practice and exercise for reducing stress, quality information about work stress, and some guidance from professionals. This suggests that sex and age should be taken into account when designing e-mental health programs to meet the needs of individuals seeking help via Web-based mental health programs and to enhance their use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30882361/"}

Connected mental health (CMH), which refers to the use of information and communication technologies in mental health care, can assist in overcoming these barriers. The aim of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview and a structured understanding of CMH literature available in the Scopus database. A total of 289 selected publications were analyzed based on 8 classification criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, mental health issues, targeted cohort groups, and countries where the empirically evaluated studies were conducted. The results showed that there was an increasing interest in CMH publications; journals were the main publication channels of the selected papers; exploratory research was the dominant research type; advantages and challenges of the use of technology for mental health care were the most investigated subjects; most of the selected studies had not been evaluated empirically; depression and anxiety were the most addressed mental disorders; young people were the most targeted cohort groups in the selected publications; and Australia, followed by the United States, was the country where most empirically evaluated studies were conducted. CMH is a promising research field to present novel approaches to assist in the management, treatment, and diagnosis of mental health issues that can help overcome existing mental health care delivery barriers.

However, its effects on the health and well-being of hotel workers in the United States remains underexplored. We aimed to explore the effects of shift work on mental health, sleep, and chronic fatigue among hotel workers. We collaborated with a community advisory board to develop a survey and recruit participants. Individuals aged 18 years or older, working in hotels in a Midwest state, completed surveys online or on paper. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, linear and logistic regression, and stepwise moderation to examine the impact of work schedules on chronic sleep problems, fatigue, and mental health outcomes. Data from 518 participants were analyzed. The majority identified as white and female, with an average age of 32.05 years. Most were employed in housekeeping or front desk positions. Regression analyses showed that those working nonstandard hours were significantly more likely to report chronic fatigue and screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder. Paid overtime was significantly associated with decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant interactions by job type were also observed, with front desk workers reporting increased depression with more overtime compared to other job types. These findings address a crucial gap in understanding shift work's impact on US hotel workers' health and well-being. Future longitudinal studies should explore shift work's effects on sleep, fatigue, and mental health.

It argues that two factors drew student mental health to the attention of medical professionals across this period: first, it argues that the post-war interest in mental illness drew attention to students, who were seen to be the luminaries of the future, investing their wellbeing with particular social importance. Second, it argues that the development of university health services made students increasingly visible, endorsing the view that higher education posed distinctive yet shared mental challenges to young people. The article charts the expansion of services and maps the implications of the visibility of student mental distress for post-war British universities. It suggests that claims that British higher education is currently in the midst of an unprecedented mental health \"crisis\" should be seen within this broader historical context, for while the contours of the debates around student mental health have shifted substantially, evidence that there was anxiety around student mental wellbeing in the immediate post-war years undermines accusations that contemporary students constitute a unique \"snowflake generation.\"", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31913482/"}

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data illustrated a dominant in-phase pattern across all emotions, modulated by antiphase patterns for \"positive\" and \"negative\" emotions. The first three principal components accounted for over 90% of the variation in the data. PCA was also used to remove the dominant diurnal and weekly variations allowing identification of significant events within the data, with z-scores showing expression of emotions over 80 standard deviations from the mean.

Furthermore, the impact of savings behaviour on mental health is stronger for men than women. Our results are robust to alternative measures of subjective wellbeing and estimation techniques.

In the sample of 89 families including 181 children and adolescents (intervention group [45 families]: 86 children; mean [SD] age, 8.6 [2.7] years; 42 girls [49%]; control group [44 families]: 95 children; mean [SD] age, 9.5 [2.5] years; 57 girls [60%]), there was a statistically significant between-group mean difference in the total difficulties score, favoring the screen media reduction intervention (-1.67; 95% CI, -2.68 to -0.67; Cohen d, 0.53). The greatest improvements were observed for internalizing symptoms (emotional symptoms and peer problems; between-group mean difference, -1.03; 95% CI, -1.76 to -0.29) and prosocial behavior (between-group mean difference, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.39-1.30). This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial found that a short-term reduction in leisure-time screen media use within families positively affected psychological symptoms of children and adolescents, particularly by mitigating internalizing behavioral issues and enhancing prosocial behavior. More research is needed to confirm whether these effects are sustainable in the long term. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04098913.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38995646/"}

The present study reports the results of the first meta-analysis on the effects of systemic treatment of mental disorders and behavior problems in children and adolescents. Based on systematic search in electronic databases (PsycINFO, Psyndex, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, CINAHL), k = 56 randomized, controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. We computed a random-effects meta-analysis. Systemic therapy showed small-to-medium effects in comparison with an untreated control group (posttest: k = 7, g = .59 standard deviation units, follow-up: k = 2, g = .27) and alternative treatment (posttest: k = 43, g = .32, follow-up: k = 38, g = .28). At follow-up, longer interventions produced larger effect sizes. No other moderator effects were identified. Although available randomized, controlled trials show convincing results, their effects refer to a limited number of systemic approaches and mental disorders, and also pertain to adolescents rather than younger children. Thus, more research is needed before more general conclusions about the effects of systemic therapy can be drawn.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467300/"}

Here, expanding from extant literature's focus on Western-Eastern dichotomy or individualism-collectivism, this meta-analysis synthesized evidence on the associations between the two most-studied ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and two mental health outcomes (psychopathology and positive functioning) and investigated the moderating roles of several cultural dimensions: Hofstede's national cultures dimensions, education, industrialization, richness and democracy (EIRDness), and sample demographics. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases (CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and MEDLINE) to identify eligible studies reporting relationships between ER and mental health outcomes (PROSPERO: CRD42021258190, 249 articles, n = 150,474, 861 effect sizes, 37 countries/regions). For Hofstede's national cultures and EIRDness, multimodel inference revealed that greater reappraisal propensity was more adaptive in more short-term-oriented, uncertainty-tolerant and competition-driven cultures, whereas greater suppression propensity was more maladaptive in more indulgent and competition-driven cultures. For demographics, greater reappraisal propensity was more adaptive for samples with more female (B = -0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29 to -0.09) and more racial minority participants (B = -0.32, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.13), whereas greater suppression propensity was more maladaptive in younger samples (B = -0.004, 95% CI -0.005 to -0.002). These findings elucidate how cultures are associated with the function of ER and suggests ways in which future studies can integrate cultural characteristics when examining ER and psychological adjustment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40234629/"}

This study sought to examine resilience, trauma-related risk behaviors, and receipt of mental health services among a sample of YBM who experienced trauma. Focus groups and a brief survey were conducted with YBM (<i>N</i> = 55) who had been exposed to at least one traumatic event (e.g., witnessing violence, experienced serious injury or illness) and were recruited from urban community settings (e.g., colleges/universities, barbershops, churches). Participants were an average age of 23 years (SD = 3.9; range 18-30) and experienced an average of 2 to 3 traumatic events (SD = 2.2). Trauma exposure was a significant predictor of risk factors (<i>β</i> = .513, <i>p</i> < .01). However, resilience did not significantly moderate this relationship. Resilience also did not predict receipt of mental health services. Culturally relevant qualitative themes found to be related to resilience included maintaining resilience autonomously, preferred coping methods (e.g., friends, music), and habituating to adversity.

This paper provides a thorough review of both peer-reviewed and grey literature and makes key recommendations and directions for future research and development. We systematically reviewed extant evidence using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Peer-reviewed studies published in English between 2010, and June 2024 were included based on a priori criteria. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Critical Appraisal Skill Program (CASP) quality assessment tools were used to critically appraise the reliability, validity and overall quality of included articles. A qualitative narrative synthesis was perfomed to summarize the findings effectively. A total of 206 full-text articles evaluated for eligibility and inclusion in the systematic review, predominantly observational studies with a minority employing randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs, were included, with 70%, 22%, and 8% of the articles rated as good, fair, and poor quality, respectively. Women in Africa experience a wide range of common perinatal mental disorders, including major depressive disorders and psychosis, either discretely or comorbid. Socioeconomic disadvantages and other intertwined poverty-related factors at the individual, family, social, and environmental levels are implicated in maternal mental health disorders. Currently, there is insufficient evidence regarding the short- and long-term health, development, and social impacts of maternal mental health. Addtionally, there is limited knowledge about the availability and accessibility of mental healthcare, evidence-based context-specific interventions, and healthcare-seeking behaviors of women in Africa, as well as their access to and utilization of mental health services. The evidence base on maternal mental health in Africa suffers from considerable variability, inconsistency, and equivocal findings resulting from heterogeneity across the studies. This restricts generalizability and the ability to draw valid conclusions. Published studies also likely underestimate the scale and health impacts of perinatal mental disorders. Evidence from these studies are rarely used to inform policies and programs. The maternal mental health ecosystem in Africa needs to be better understood. More rigorous study designs should be implemented to focus on evidence generation and the evaluation of interventions, alongside robust integration of mental health services within health systems. Policy initiatives aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in maternal, newborn, and child health, particularly concerning maternal mental health, must be supported by these studies. • Women across Africa suffer from various mental health problems, including major depressive disorders, anxiety, and psychosis, occurring separately or in combination. • The evidence base on maternal mental health in Africa displays significant variability, inconsistency, and ambiguous findings, largely attributed to study heterogeneity. • Factors at the individual, familial, societal, and environmental levels contribute to poverty-related issues that can lead to or worsen maternal mental health disorders. • Current evidence has not been synthesized to improve our understanding of the short- and long-term health impacts, developmental consequences, and social implications of maternal mental health conditions, as well as the healthcare-seeking behaviors and access to mental health services. • Insufficient policy prioritization and funding for maternal mental health in Africa hinder the development, evaluation, and sustainability of interventions. • There is an urgent need to integrate mental health services into primary healthcare, particularly in resource-limited settings across Africa. This integration should be guided by evidence from rigorous research that uses longitudinal designs. It is also essential to emphasize the importance of investing in digital and community-based approaches to improve the accessibility to mental health services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220206/"}

To show that policies are informed by evidence, policy-related documents that cite external sources should ideally provide direct access to, and accurately represent, the referenced source and the evidence it provides. Our aim was to find a way to systematically assess the prevalence of referencing accuracy and accessibility issues in referenced statements selected from a sample of mental health-related policy documents. 236 referenced statements were selected from 10 mental health-related policy documents published between 2013 and 2018. Policy documents were chosen as the focus of this investigation because of their relative accessibility and impact on clinical practice. Statements were rated against their referenced sources in terms of the (i) content accuracy in relation to the information provided by the referenced source and (ii) degree of accessibility of the source and the required evidence from the references provided. Of the 236 statements, 141 (59.7%) accurately represented the referenced source, 45 (19.1%) contained major errors and 50 (21.2%) contained minor errors in accuracy. For accessibility, 126 (53.4%) directly referenced primary sources of evidence that supported the claims made, 36 (15.3%) contained indirect references, 18 (7.6%) provided 'dead-end' references, and 11 (4.7%) references were completely inaccessible. With only slightly over half of all statements assessed providing fully accessible references and accurately representing the referenced source, these components of referencing quality deserve further attention if evidence-informed policy goals are to be achieved. The rating framework used in the current study proved to be a simple and straightforward method to assess these components and can provide a baseline against which interventions can be designed to improve referencing quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641826/"}

MHR papers were retrieved using three strategies: from key mental health journals; using US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords; and from additional journals in which mental health topics accounted for over 75% of papers. The number of papers per year increased over time in absolute terms and as a proportion of total medical output. The US's proportion of world publication output dropped from 60% in 1980 to 42% in 2011, while the EU increased its share from 27% to 40%. Countries with greater research intensity in mental health generally had higher citation impact, such as the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands. MHR also became more collaborative: 3% of all MHR papers published in 1980 were the result of international collaboration compared to 22% in 2011. We conclude by noting that the rise in MHR appears to be due to funding and that bibliometrics can help highlight the potential drivers of variation in performance of MHR systems.

Yet gaining insight into the individual concerns of this group could be helpful in providing better services to the adolescent population. In this study, an idiographic procedure called Assert was used to increase our knowledge of which concerns are reported by adolescents as the most salient, in a primary mental health care situation. 231 unique concerns were reported by 70 adolescents in a primary mental health context in Norway. These concerns were analysed qualitatively by a group of experts, to define categories. The distribution of these categories, and differences in gender and age, were analysed quantitatively. The alleviation experienced on the subjective concerns over the course of counselling was measured. Two linear multilevel models were analysed, to examine whether alleviation on self-defined concerns, as measured with Assert, differed-based on the main category of the concern or the number of times Assert was used. Three main categories of concerns emerged, related to (1) Self, (2) Relationships and (3) Life domains; as well as nine sub-categories: (1a) Autonomy, (1b) Mental health, (1c) Somatic health, (2a) Improving of relationships, (2b) Feeling safe from people around them, (2c) Taking responsibility for others, (3a) School, (3b) Work and (3c) Spare time. Girls reported fewer Life domain concerns than boys. Younger adolescents (12-16) more frequently reported no Self concerns, and older adolescents (17-23) more frequently reported no Relationship concerns. The adolescents felt less bothered by their subjective concerns after counselling, and there were some differences in alleviation depending on the category of concern. The adolescents defined their own concerns at the start of counselling and were less troubled by these concerns after counselling. The content of the concerns might suggest that these adolescents experienced a need to improve across several arenas: personal, relational and academic.

This cross-sectional study explores resilience, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and family norms with disclosure of mental health problems (FNAD) in a sample of 182 Filipino American women (FAW). Participants completed survey measures of resilience, PTSD, and FNAD and open-ended questions about beliefs and reasons for (not) disclosing mental health problems outside the family. Previous research found that the rates of psychological trauma and depression among FAW are higher than those in other Asian ethnic groups, which makes it necessary to investigate the protective characteristic of resilience among FAW. According to our results, foreign-born FAW had a significantly lower PTSD and greater resilience as compared to their US-born counterparts. A significant negative relationship between PTSD and resilience was observed only among foreign-born FAW. We also found a conditional moderating effect of FNAD on the negative relationship between resilience and PTSD. The results of our qualitative analysis of the participants' responses to the open-ended questions of the survey showed that FAW's family norms of nondisclosure are related to the cultural value of \"saving face,\" a salient cultural construct among Asian family members. Results suggest that protective properties of resilience against PTSD are influenced by cultural factors, such as FNAD.

However, most data show associations of unemployment and isolated mental disorders, and this study field has been neglected in the last years. Therefore, this narrative review aims to provide an updated overview of the association between unemployment and mental health in general as well as the most prevalent mental disorders. A literature search was conducted using PubMed with the initial search terms \"unemployment\" and \"mental health\". The identified disorders were then used as search terms for a more in-depth search. Two raters screened abstracts and identified the literature containing relevant information. As a main result, it could be demonstrated that regardless of age and sex, there is still a broad association between unemployment and mental well-being in general (e.g., quality of life measure for example by the General Health Questionnaire), suicide attempts, suicide rates, as well as specific psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorders, compulsive/obsessive disorders, eating disorders, specific personality disorders, intelligence disorders/impairment, and ADHD). The most significant association was found for affective disorders (depression) and substance use disorders. The association in general was particularly evident for long-term unemployment and mental disorders. Returning to work reduced the prevalence rates of mental disorders significantly. The literature review confirms the results of much older and disease centered studies that unemployment and mental disorders are associated with each other. The main conclusion is that early medical detection and intervention among the mentally ill are as crucial as labor market policy interventions to prevent, avoid, and reduce unemployment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39767537/"}

The use of internet technologies has the potential to increase access to evidence-based mental health services for a larger proportion of the population with the use of fewer resources. However, despite extensive evidence that internet interventions can be effective in the treatment of mental health disorders, user adherence to such internet intervention is suboptimal. This review aimed to (1) inspect and identify the adaptive elements of IDPT for mental health disorders, (2) examine how system adaptation influences the efficacy of IDPT on mental health treatments, (3) identify the information architecture, adaptive dimensions, and strategies for implementing these interventions for mental illness, and (4) use the findings to create a conceptual framework that provides better user adherence and adaptiveness in IDPT for mental health issues. The review followed the guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The research databases Medline (PubMed), ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched for studies dating from January 2000 to January 2020. Based on predetermined selection criteria, data from eligible studies were analyzed. A total of 3341 studies were initially identified based on the inclusion criteria. Following a review of the title, abstract, and full text, 31 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected, most of which described attempts to tailor interventions for mental health disorders. The most common adaptive elements were feedback messages to patients from therapists and intervention content. However, how these elements contribute to the efficacy of IDPT in mental health were not reported. The most common information architecture used by studies was tunnel-based, although a number of studies did not report the choice of information architecture used. Rule-based strategies were the most common adaptive strategies used by these studies. All of the studies were broadly grouped into two adaptive dimensions based on user preferences or using performance measures, such as psychometric tests.

The potential role of cultural values in cross-national variability of mental disorders' prevalence.", "text": "Mental disorders may show inherent cross-national variability in their prevalence. A considerable number of meta-analyses attribute this heterogeneity to the methodological diversity in published epidemiological studies. Cultural values are characteristically not assessed in meta-regression models as potential covariates. Our aim was to conduct a meta-regression analysis to explore to what extent certain cultural values and immigration rates (as indicator of cultural diversity) might be associated with the cross-national heterogeneity of prevalence rates. To minimize methodological differences that may exert a confounding effect, prevalence rates were obtained from the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Cultural indices (overall emancipative values; overall secular values) were collected from the World Value Survey, while immigration rates were registered by utilizing the data of the United Nations' World Population Policies 2005 report. Meta-regression analysis indicated that overall emancipative values (i.e. promoting self-expression, non-violent protest) showed significant connection with lifetime and last year prevalence of any mood disorders (<i>Z</i> = 4.71, <i>p</i> = .001; <i>Z</i> = 2.35, <i>p</i> = .02) and any internalizing disorders (a merged category that combined mood and anxiety disorders; <i>Z</i> = 2.82, <i>p</i> = .004; <i>Z</i> = 2.34, <i>p</i> = .02). Overall secular values (i.e. rejecting authority and obedience) were negatively associated with last year prevalence of depression (<i>Z</i> = -2.75, <i>p</i> = .06). Multistep regression analysis indicated that immigration rate moderated the connection between cultural values and mental disorders. Countries with higher immigration rates showed higher emancipative and secular values. Our findings might function as potential foundation for formulating hypotheses regarding the cultural context's influence on the population's mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30417725/"}

In this Health Policy paper, we consider the complexities involved in generating such data and propose an approach to classify mental health research grants. We then describe a method using search terms and algorithms for automatic identification and categorisation of mental health research grants listed in a major international database (Dimensions, Digital Science). The automated approach was validated using manually categorised grants data from funders based in the UK, which showed that the accuracy of this approach is satisfactory and comparable to manual classification. Finally, we consider areas of research that are difficult to classify, and how the automated approach can be refined using machine-learning. We argue that agreed definitions and automated approaches could facilitate collaborative reporting of mental health research funders nationally and internationally and improve the strategic dialogue in this area of research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30824371/"}

Many of these scales are used widely in published studies examining associations with health, and yet many researchers and reviewers are not aware of contamination issues. We have previously cautioned researchers to be careful in their choice of religious/spirituality (R/S) measures (Koenig and Carey in J Relig Health, 63(5):3729-3743. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-024-02112-6 , 2024), and to avoid using measures contaminated with the health outcome being assessed, which will result in tautological findings (particularly between spirituality and mental health). However, not all is lost. There are approaches for analyzing collected data using contaminated measures that can still result in meaningful and interpretable results, which may contribute to our knowledge of the impact of R/S on health. In this brief article, we describe several approaches for analyzing such data including deleting contaminated items from the scale, analyzing subscales separately, and modeling psychosocial scales, subscales, or collections of variables as mediators in the causal pathway that leads from R/S to health. The use of path analysis or structural equation modeling to identify direct effects and indirect effects through mediating constructs may also be helpful in this regard.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39808227/"}

We examined the association between pre-migration and post-migration potentially traumatic events and stressors and mental health, and assessed the moderating effect of post-migration stressors in humanitarian migrants in Australia. In this study, we used the first wave of data between 2013 and 2014 from the Building a New Life in Australia survey. The survey included 2399 migrants who had arrived in Australia holding a permanent humanitarian visa 3-6 months preceding the survey, with 77% and 23% of participants being granted visas through offshore and onshore humanitarian programmes, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured with the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 8 items (PTSD-8) and severe mental illness was measured with the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6). Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors related to asylum process and resettlement were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. Of the 2399 participants, 762 (31%; 95% CI 29·4-33·2) had PTSD and 394 (16%; 95% CI 14·2-17·2) had severe mental illness. The mean number of pre-migration potentially traumatic events was 2·1 (SD 1·4). 64%, 59%, 49%, and 18% of participants reported poor social integration, economic problems, worrying about family or friends overseas, and loneliness as post-migration stressors. Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors were positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness. Factors significantly modifying the association between pre-migration potentially traumatic events and mental health after controlling for confounding factors were resettlement related stressors, including loneliness (odds ratio 1·17, 95% CI 1·05-1·28 for PTSD and 1·28, 1·16-1·41 for severe mental illness) and the number of social integration stressors (1·10, 1·05-1·16 for PTSD). Our data suggest that post-migration resettlement-related stressors were the most important correlates of mental health in humanitarian migrants, accounting for both direct and indirect associations.

The aim of the present research was to identify person-related characteristics that, in addition to work-related aspects, affect the mental well-being and performance of recently graduated veterinary professionals, and to reach a greater understanding of the role of personal resources in mental health and well-being. Based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, a questionnaire measuring work engagement as well as burnout and its potential predictors was developed and distributed to 1,760 veterinarians who graduated in the Netherlands between 1999 and 2009 (response rate 41%, of which 73% were females). An intervention aiming at increasing personal resources was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative methods. The intervention was designed so that participants could set their own learning objectives toward which they could work during a yearlong multimodular program. The results show that gender and the number of years after graduation have a small effect on exhaustion resulting in 16% of the veterinarians (18% for females) meeting the criteria for burnout in the first 5 years after graduation. Thirteen percent of respondents could be classified as being highly engaged. While burnout resulted mostly from job characteristics (demands and resources), work engagement resulted mostly from job resources and personal resources. Personal resources appear to have an important mediating and initiating role in work engagement and performance. Self-reported ratings of reflective behavior, proactive behavior, and self-efficacy were significantly increased after a yearlong resources development program.

Though the law's language is ambiguous, it was widely perceived to target sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals. We interviewed 20 SGM people living in Tennessee to understand their experiences with mental health care in the state and their perceptions of the law. Our participants perceive the law as fundamentally discriminatory, though they overwhelmingly conceptualize the conscience clause as legalizing discrimination toward members of all stigmatized groups-not just SGM individuals. They described individual and societal consequences for the law, including an understanding of the conscience clause as harmful above and beyond any individual discrimination event it may engender. We situate these findings amid the research on structural stigma and suggest that counseling psychologists become actively engaged in combatting conscience clauses, which appear to have profound consequences on mental health care engagement, particularly for populations vulnerable to discrimination.

By dealing with such heterogeneity through a systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine the association between income inequality, mental health problems, use of mental health services, and resilience (defined as the ability to cope with adversity). We searched the Global Health, PsychARTICLES, PsycINFO, Social Policy and Practice, Embase and MEDLINE databases up to July 6, 2016, for quantitative studies of the association of income inequality with prevalence or incidence of mental disorders or mental health problems, use of mental health services, and resilience. Eligible studies used standardised instruments at the individual level, and income inequality at the aggregated, contextual, and ecological level. We extracted study characteristics, sampling, exposure, outcomes, statistical modelling, and parameters from articles. Because several studies did not provide enough statistical information to be included in a meta-analysis, we did a narrative synthesis to summarise results with studies categorised as showing either a positive association, mixed results, or no association. The primary outcome in the random-effects meta-analysis was mental health-related morbidity, defined as the prevalence or incidence of any mental health problem. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016036377. Our search identified 15 615 non-duplicate references, of which 113 were deemed potentially relevant and were assessed for eligibility, leading to the inclusion of 27 studies in the qualitative synthesis. Nine articles found a positive association between income inequality and the prevalence or incidence of mental health problems; ten articles found mixed results, with positive association in some subgroups and non-significant or negative association in other subgroups; and eight articles found no association between income inequality and mental health problems. Of the nine articles included in our meta-analysis, one reported a positive association between income inequality and mental health problems, six reported mixed results, and two reported no association. Pooled Cohen's d effect sizes for the association between income inequality and any mental disorder or mental health problems were 0·06 (95% CI 0·01-0·11) for any mental disorder, and 0·12 (0·05-0·20) for depressive disorders. Our meta-regression analysis showed that none of the factors considered (sample size, contextual level at which income inequality was assessed, quality assessment, type of instruments, and individual income as control variable) explained heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup> 89·3%; p<0·0001). Only one study investigated the association between income inequality and resilience; it found greater income inequality was associated with higher prevalence of depression only among individuals with low income. The only study of the role of income inequality as a determinant of the use of mental health services reported no association. Income inequality negatively affects mental health but the effect sizes are small and there is marked heterogeneity among studies. If this association is causal and growing income inequality does lead to an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems, then its reduction could result in a significant improvement in population wellbeing.

To keep trying to identify the conflicts of values in ethical issues is an absolute necessity, which implies that we support a \"living together\" relying on a \"thinking together\" for both the sake of each of us and for the sake of all of us. Our duty is then to resist collectively to prevent any possible deleterious excesses on both human and therapeutic points of view. Moreover, to focus on the principle of proportionality in complex medical decisions in the field of mental health requires at the same time a balance between the protection, the safety and the respect of the fundamental freedoms and a balance between the public interest and the individual needs. Such arbitration demands a strong focus on the ethical reflection so as to avoid decisions simply oriented towards the health dimension and recorded without any consideration for the health democracy. The referrals of the ethical support cells in Brittany and everywhere in France bring to light the challenges we met on the field. In particular those aroused during the COVID crisis concerning the institutional decisions, to take care of the mental health of patients at the end of their life or when facing treatment of resistant diseases. These situations raise some critical issues about the respect for the dignity and the humanity of the people we take care of. It thus seems necessary to respect an ethical code of human understanding, with poise and right balance, relying on a collegiate discussion. Besides, receiving end of life care will today requires the development of a palliative psychiatry in France, which becomes a priority. This could enable us to lead to fairer and equitable care, respectful of the individual freedoms, and a care better adapted to the specific needs of the patients in great psychological suffering. Especially in places where vulnerability is at stake, such as the retirement homes, to maintain a better articulation between the principles of beneficence and of nonmaleficence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39613697/"}

We firstly consider what is meant by elicited autobiography and how the narrative approach has been used in research more broadly. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken in Manchester, UK and Auckland, New Zealand we then demonstrate how this approach has helped us to map out and unpack the career journeys of mental health activists working within and across the voluntary and statutory sectors. Through our autobiographical narratives we illustrate how this approach has enabled us to elicit important insights into the triggers and trajectories underpinning mental health activism and how events and moments in time have provided critical junctures in these trajectories. We consider places as sites of significance in activist career paths; and as central to the researcher-participant gestalt within which the autobiography is elicited and recounted. The autobiographical process, we suggest, offers reflective insights into mental health activism that might not otherwise be gained using more conventional methodologies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23251925/"}

{"id": "25664767", "title": "Introduction to the special issue: toward implementing physiological measures in clinical child and adolescent assessments.", "text": "The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). The RDoC is an initiative to improve classification of mental health concerns by promoting research on the brain mechanisms underlying these concerns, with the ultimate goal of developing interventions that target these brain mechanisms. A key focus of RDoC involves opening new lines of research examining patients' responses on biological measures. The RDoC presents unique challenges to mental health professionals who work with children and adolescents. Indeed, mental health professionals rarely integrate biological measures into clinical assessments. Thus, RDoC's ability to improve patient care rests, in part, on the development of strategies for implementing biological measures within mental health assessments. Further, mental health professionals already carry out comprehensive assessments that frequently yield inconsistent findings. These inconsistencies have historically posed challenges to interpreting research findings as well as assessment outcomes in practice settings. In this introductory article, we review key issues that informed the development of a special issue of articles demonstrating methods for implementing low-cost measures of physiological functioning in clinical child and adolescent assessments. We also outline a conceptual framework, informed by theoretical work on using and interpreting multiple informants' clinical reports (De Los Reyes, Thomas, Goodman, & Kundey, 2013 ), to guide hypothesis testing when using physiological measures within clinical child and adolescent assessments. This special issue and the conceptual model described in this article may open up new lines of research testing paradigms for implementing clinically feasible physiological measures in clinical child and adolescent assessments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25664767/"}

However, mental health at work is a crucial issue involving substantial costs and consequences. The aim of the study was to assess changes in behaviors and indicators of mental health in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, and to explore the differential changes according to age, origin, occupation, activity sector, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract. The data came from the prospective national representative Santé et itinéraire professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The behaviors and indicators of mental health studied were excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, sleep problems (sleep disorders and/or insufficient sleep duration), psychotropic drug use (antidepressants, anxiolytics and/or hypnotics), and poor self-reported health. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze changes in behaviors and indicators of mental health, and the analyses were adjusted for age. Covariates (age, origin, occupation, activity sector, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and type of contract) were added separately to assess differential changes. Increases in excessive alcohol consumption among women, sleep problems among men, and smoking, insufficient sleep duration and poor self-reported health for both genders were observed in the French working population between 2006 and 2010. Some differential changes were observed, negative changes being more likely to affect young workers and workers with a permanent contract. Prevention policies should consider that behavior and indicators of mental health may deteriorate in times of economic crisis, especially among some sub-groups of the working population, such as young workers and workers with a permanent contract. These changes might foreshadow a forthcoming increase in mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28601504/"}

In a 2009 study conducted in Austria, among 106 people on the verge of bankruptcy, perceived financial strain appeared as the strongest predictor of distress. This effect was moderated by two out of five latent benefits of work and self-efficacy, but employment status failed to have a significant effect.

The frequency and severity of community violence exposure is a unique challenge for these youth and requires tailored approaches to promote resilience after community violence exposure. However, limited research exists that operationalizes resilience after community violence based on the unique context and lived experience of African American youth. Developing a more contextually relevant understanding of resilience is critical to reducing health inequities experienced by African American youth and promoting their well-being. Five focus groups were conducted with 39 African American adolescents (ages 13-18) exposed to community violence. Participants also completed a brief survey that included questions on demographics, adverse childhood experiences, social capital, and resilience. Focus-group transcripts were independently coded by two members of the research team and analyzed using an inductive approach. Youth highlighted key indicators of resilience including the ability to persevere, self-regulate, and change to adapt/improve. Youth also described family, peer, and cultural contexts that impact how resilience is produced and manifested, highlighting trust, perceived burdensomeness, self-determination, connectedness, and mental health stigma as key factors within these contexts. Results of this qualitative study support the development of health promotion programs for African American youth exposed to community violence that address unique risks and build on existing protective factors within family, peer, and cultural contexts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32787725/"}

The objective of this review was to systematically review the evidence for effects of PE on mental health and identify important areas for further research. Methods A protocol was developed following PRISMA-P guidelines. Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched up to 4 September 2017. All unique records were assessed for eligibility and quality by at least two reviewers. Data from included studies were summarized in forest plots and meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Evidence quality was rated using the GRADE method. Results We obtained 3328 unique records, of which 16 studies of sufficient quality met the inclusion criteria. Moderate quality evidence (GRADE score 3 of 4) was found for an adverse effect of job insecurity on mental health; summary odds ratio (OR) 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.70]. There was very low quality (GRADE 1 of 4) evidence for effects of temporary employment or unpredictable work hours on mental health. Five studies on multidimensional exposures all showed adverse effects, weighted average OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.60-2.53). Conclusions Research on PE and mental health is growing, but high-quality prospective studies are still scarce. Job insecurity likely has an adverse effect on mental health. A clear multi-dimensional definition of PE is lacking, and harmonization efforts are needed.

Progress was measured by a range of indicators including Māori-referenced life expectancy, Māori agendas for health, strengthened cultural identity, the dissemination of health knowledge, and Māori participation in the health sector. In contrast to being ready to respond to change (future takers), active planning for the future (future makers) was seen as a better way of achieving Indigenous aspirations. One option for health advancement currently being developed in New Zealand involved an integrated approach premised on intersectoral delivery and a focus on families.

The present study addresses this gap by investigating, in depth, relationships between perceptions about state forgiveness and a variety of mental wellbeing outcomes as well as exploring perceptions about the factors that may modify such effects. Developing an understanding of a forgiveness wellbeing relationship is of relevance to healthcare workers, researchers and policy makers with an interest in improving public health. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data were analysed using grounded theory methods. From England and Ireland, eleven adults who were affiliated with religious/spiritual and secular/atheist groups were recruited using purposive and convenience sampling methods. Key themes that appeared to be related to the effects of unforgiveness were: increases in negative affect; reduction in cognitive abilities and barriers to psychological and social growth. For the majority of participants, state forgiveness had strong ties to participants perceived sense of mental wellbeing, including reductions in negative affect, feeling positive emotions, positive relations with others, spiritual growth, a sense of meaning and purpose in life as well as a greater sense of empowerment. The data also revealed a number of factors that may positively or negatively influence a forgiveness-wellbeing link such as: viewing an offender as spiritually similar or different, responsibility/karma, blaming, wanting restitution/apology as well as practices such as meditation and prayer. The findings suggest that forgiving a range of real-life interpersonal offences may be an important determinant of psychological wellbeing, particularly among religious/spiritual populations.

A Novel Conceptual Framework to Bridge Public Health, Planning, and Neurourbanism.", "text": "Childhood and adolescence are crucial periods for mental and social development. Currently, mental illness among young people is a global epidemic, and rates of disorders such as depression and anxiety are rising. Urban living, compared with rural living, is linked with a higher risk of serious mental illness, which is important because the world is urbanizing faster than ever before. Urban environments and their landscapes, designs, and features influence mental health and well-being. However, no conceptual frameworks to date have detailed the effect of urban environments on young people's mental health, and few studies have considered the growing role of digital and social media in this relationship, leading to calls for the development of holistic approaches to describe this relationship. This article synthesizes existing knowledge on urban places (both built and natural environments) and mental health in the public health and urban planning literature and examines the emerging field of neurourbanism (a multidisciplinary study of the effect of urban environments on mental health and brain activity) to enhance current practice and research. We developed 2 novel conceptual frameworks (1 research-oriented, 1 practice-oriented), adapted from Bronfenbrenner's socioecological model, that focus on the relationship between urban environments and young people's mental health.

It is challenging to provide an in-depth understanding of recovery in a nursing curriculum because there are so many competing content areas and, as a result, time is constrained. However, because it is so vital to understand, educators would benefit from developing and sharing teaching strategies that explore recovery deeply, memorably, and engagingly, in order to encourage theory to be put into practice. Recent research into narrative pedagogy suggests that better use of stories, especially those that have strong emotional pull, such as well-made films and memoirs, may offer solutions to creative educators. Stories can have transformative potential, because once heard and heeded, the person can never go back to exactly how they were before. Recovery learned in this way becomes a threshold concept for the mental health curriculum. This paper outlines an engaging and time-efficient teaching strategy to develop these skills, drawing on the concept of narrative pedagogy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25977106/"}

A scoping review of measures recommended in Europe.", "text": "There are a growing number of authors stating that outcome measurement in treatment for substance use disorders should go beyond substance use and include other bio-psycho-social variables of interest. However, little is known about which topics tend to be covered by outcome measures and whether they reflect the typical concerns of this patient group. This study followed a scoping review methodology in which 42 outcome measures recommended by an EU agency for substance use disorders were reviewed. We identified the domains of problems covered by these 42 measures and then compared them with 54 domains derived from patients, in a previous study. We also explored how similar the existing measures were in terms of domains covered, and which patient derived domains tended to be represented in those measures. We identified 31domains of problems across the 42 measures, with 'substance use' and 'psychological health' among the commonest. Most measures were similar in content to each other and multidimensional. Almost all domains of problems identified in the outcome measures corresponded to concerns reported by patients. On the other hand, we found that several topics of relevance for patients were not covered by any of the measure included in our study. This suggests that existing outcome measurement does not always target aspects that affect patients' lives, as reported directly by patients. Our study shows that outcome measurement needs to adopt a more flexible and comprehensive approach, by taking on board the problems experienced by patients in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28830035/"}

Nine databases were searched to identify peer reviewed literature published between January 2000 and August 2015; 15 articles were included in the review. The articles were categorized across four broad areas: educational interventions, learning skills, learning about other people's lived experience, and learning about personal lived experience. We identify that while digital storytelling has potential as a participatory process to promote mutual understanding of and empathy towards lived experiences in mental health, there is a dearth of research in this area.

As marriage immigrant women face greater barriers to public health services than non-immigrant women, it is necessary to understand the related factors, process, and context to address these barriers and strengthen available assets. A qualitative case study design was used with the phenomenological approach. Eleven mental health promotion program managers and 12 marriage immigrant women from who experienced resilience were recruited from four public-funded multicultural community centers in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, between December 2015 and March 2016. Using data from in-depth semi-structured face-to-face interviews, the author applied theme analysis informed by the resilience theory in order to identify factors that affect resilience and its development process. Findings indicated that the process of resilience follows enduring difficulties, collapse of stability, access to professional help, professional and social support, and experience of growth. A combination of the staged process of growth, absence of partner support, children as a driving force for change, the need for economic activity, factors affecting difference in growth: satisfaction levels of women's need for recognition, respect, and reward, and level of spousal support were identified as factors affecting marriage immigrant women's resilience. Spouses, children, and economic activity play key roles in resilience in positive and negative ways. The existing information barrier should be addressed at a structural level to improve the mental health of marriage immigrant women, and the optimum time for intervention is suggested within 2 years post-migration. Efforts to build supportive relationships with Korean spouses and meet the women's needs for recognition, respect, and reward may also help promote these women's resilience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345269/"}

However, the lack of culturally appropriate QoL tools for First Nations people is a major barrier to such efforts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Good Spirit, Good Life (GSGL) QoL tool for older Aboriginal Australians. One hundred and twenty older Aboriginal people living in Perth and Melbourne, Australia, were administered the GSGL tool, along with several other instruments assessing cognition (KICA-Cog), depression (KICA-Dep), anxiety (GAI-SF), health and well-being (EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O) and resilience (ARRQ-25). Associations between these instruments and the GSGL tool were explored to determine concurrent and known-groups validity. Internal consistency was assessed with split-half reliability and Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to investigate construct validity. GSGL scores were positively correlated with ICECAP-O and ARRQ-25 scores, and negatively correlated with EQ-5D-5L score. GSGL scores differed significantly between participants with a probable anxiety disorder or depression, but not those with cognitive impairment. The Spearman-Brown prophecy estimate was 0.83 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.75. Principal component analysis identified two factors, which were labelled foundation and external. The GSGL tool is a valid tool to assess quality of life in older Aboriginal Australians. The tool demonstrates acceptable convergent, concurrent and known-groups validity.

The aim of the study was to prepare a multidimensional analysis of a profile of sexual offenders against minors. A detailed analysis of documentation from forensic sexological, psychiatric and psychological examinations and information from the records of the proceedings concerning 257 perpetrators was performed by the authors. Information analyzed included demographic data, psychosocial background, psychosexual development, recent sexual activity, physical and mental health issues and information concerning accused sexual crime. The majority of the offenders had undisturbed family relations. However, subjects with sexual preference disorders perceived their parents' relationship as worse, reported more difficulties in educational process and in relation to teachers and peers. 5.4% of subjects experienced sexual abuse and 23.3% physical violence in their childhood. The majority reported no sexual dysfunction and had regular but rare sexual activity. 20.6% were diagnosed as having mental disorder and 36.8% were alcohol abusers. Almost 30% were under influence of alcohol or another substance during the crime. The majority had no sexual preference disorder. Definite pedophilia was found in 27% and traits of psychosexual immaturity in 23.1% of cases. There was no relationship between sexual preference disorders and psychiatric comorbidity, alcohol or substance abuse. The acts of sexual abuse comprised genital touching, vaginal or oral intercourse as well as exposing offender's or victim's body. These acts were typically against one child, planned, being aware of victim's age and using physical violence.

This situation begs the question, what role is there for the anthropology of mental health? In this essay, I contend that there are three essential roles for the anthropology of mental health in an era of biological psychiatry. These roles are to (i) provide a meaningful critique of practices, beliefs, and movements within current psychiatry; (ii) illuminate the socio-cultural, clinical, and familial context of suffering and healing regarding emotional distress/mental illness; and (iii) act as a catalyst for positive change regarding healing, services and provisions for people with emotional distress/mental illness. My argument is unified by my contention that a credible anthropology of mental health intending to make a societal contribution should offer no opposition without proposition. In other words, any critique must be counter-balanced by the detailing of solutions and proposals for change. This will ensure that the anthropology of mental health continues to contribute critical knowledge to the understanding of mental suffering, distress, and healing. Such social and cultural approaches are becoming especially important given the widespread disenchantment with an increasingly dominant biological psychiatry.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24990458/"}

This perspective paper presents methodological reflections from Land Body Ecologies research collective, which collaborates with Ogiek (Kenya), Batwa (Uganda), Iruliga (India), Pgak'yau (Thailand) and Sámi (Sápmi) Indigenous Peoples to explore climate change-related mental health impacts through the lens of solastalgia. Through participatory dialogues conducted during in-person gatherings, team members reflected on three years of community-based participatory research and identified two critical methodological challenges underexplored in the existing literature: (1) language and concept translation difficulties, where terms such as 'mental health' and 'climate change' lack direct cultural equivalents and may carry stigmatising connotations and (2) barriers to cultural practices, where climate change and conservation-related legislation restricts Indigenous Peoples' access to ancestral lands and traditional practices essential for well-being. These challenges reflect deeper epistemological tensions between conventional research approaches and Indigenous holistic worldviews that understand land, body and ecosystems as interconnected. It concludes that meaningful mental health research with Indigenous Peoples demands active recognition of Indigenous cultural rights and self-determination, collaborative approaches that honour Indigenous knowledge systems and systemic changes that normalise Indigenous timelines, relationality and knowledge sovereignty within research institutions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40713061/"}

The data for these analyses were drawn from three national surveys of psychiatric morbidity among adults in England living in private households carried out in 2000, 2007, and 2014. Employment status was the primary exposure of interest. Common mental disorder (CMD) and constituent symptoms were ascertained identically in the three surveys from the revised Clinical Interview Schedule. Covariates included identical demographic, social and physical health measures. A significant association between non-employment and CMD was present in 2007 (odds ratio 2.66 [95% CI: 1.02-7.83]) but there was no significant association between non-employment and CMD in 2000 or 2014. The largest attenuation in the association between non-employment and CMD was seen when adjusted for physical health related factors. In combined samples, non-employment was most strongly associated with self-reported cognitive difficulties (OR 1.25, 1.01-1.61), depressive ideas (1.30, 1.01-1.67), worry (1.30, 1.01-1.68), and anxiety (1.27, 1.00-1.64) as constituent CMD symptoms. Evidence is still unclear whether employment after statutory retirement ages is associated with better mental health, and associations may be symptom-specific. In the light of policies to encourage older workers to remain active in the labour market, more research is needed into the interrelationships between paid work and mental health, as well as other outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39327228/"}

The exposure to preflight, flight, and resettlement stressors puts refugee children and their families at risk of developing emotional and behavioral disorders. A unique Western-based approach of mental health problems seems to be insufficient to address the complexity of interactions between individual vulnerabilities and more ecological surrounding systems. We looked into (1) the reasons for referral; and (2) the process diagnostic outcomes after ethnopsychiatric and psychological assessment. We conducted a thematic content analysis on 93 files of refugee children. The findings suggest that mental health care professionals need to hold into account the multiplicity and intertwining of ongoing challenges to the well-being of refugee children. The integration of a Western-based psychiatric assessment with a more ecologically based view can lead to a more culturally sensitive approach in refugee children and their families. This way, both under- and overdiagnosis of psychiatric disorders could be avoided to further optimalise mental health care in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28389967/"}

Given the increasing multi-racial population in Ontario, there is a need to develop mechanisms to address these intersecting issues. Other countries that have created evaluative tools for mental health legislation include the United Kingdom and Australia. Australia's Rights Analysis Tool, the United Kingdom's Race Equality Impact Assessment, the Scottish Recovery Tool, and the World Health Organization's Mental Health and Human Rights checklist are examples of evaluative tools developed for mental health legislation. Such a tool does not exist in Canada, let alone in Ontario specifically. Thus, this study developed a Cultural Analysis Tool (CAT) consisting of specific and meaningful thematic questions that can be used by practitioners when addressing issues of culture and equity for ethno-racial people with mental health disabilities interacting with Ontario's civil mental health laws. It is hoped that the CAT, and the research underlying its development, will enable practitioners to critically question whether cultural and intersecting concerns are being appropriately addressed within an ethno-racial client's case and, furthermore, how equitable outcomes can be achieved. This article describes and analyzes the methodology, research and qualitative data used to develop the CAT. It then presents and examines the CAT itself. The qualitative data was drawn from thirty-five semi-structured interviews with seven members of each of the following groups: (1) ethno-racial people with mental health disabilities including in-patients and ex-patients, (2) lawyers who practice in the area of mental health law, (3) health care professionals including psychiatrists, nurses and social workers, (4) service providers such as front-line case workers at mental health agencies and (5) adjudicators, government advisors and academics. After an analysis of these data, the CAT's questions were refined through an expert review (involving the qualitative technique of member-checking) using three focus groups comprised of ethno-racial people with mental health disabilities, mental health lawyers and service providers and health care professionals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948984/"}

In the variable-centered analyses, three mental health indicators (psychosomatic complaints, self-rated poor health, and low life satisfaction) were examined in relation to adverse physical, school, interpersonal, and personal conditions. In the person-centered analyses, the three health indicators were used to create mental health profiles using cluster analysis, which were examined in relation to the adverse psychosocial measures. Data were drawn from the HBSC survey of 15-year-olds in 2022. Samples from five Nordic countries were used (<i>N</i> = 7,860). Correlational and cluster analysis were applied. The variable-oriented analyses show that all three health indicators were interrelated (ranging between 0.45 and 0.53), form one common factor (with factor loadings ranging from 0.66 to 0.78), and that psychosocial problems do not stand out as having different associations from the other two indicators. Cluster analysis of the three health indicators revealed seven health profiles. These profiles were differentially associated with the outcome measures examined. The health profiles associated with lack of physical activity all included self-rated poor health. The health profiles associated with adverse school, interpersonal, and personal conditions all included high psychosomatic complaints. As a proxy for mental health, psychosomatic complaints have been the primary measure in many previous studies when associated with aversive psychosocial conditions. However, the mental health profile characterized by high levels of psychosomatic complaints exclusively had average levels of these adverse psychosocial measures. Variable- and person-centered approaches to the study of adolescent mental health provide complementary insights into the role of the three health indicators in relation to adverse psychosocial conditions. The person-centered approach provides much needed additional information about when a specific health indicator is associated with adverse psychosocial conditions and when it is not. As such, person-centered analyses are needed for future studies in other domains that wish to tell a more complete story as part of their findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40453500/"}

In June 2007, the General Principles for Suicide Prevention Policy (GPSP), a guideline on how the national government should act to promote suicide prevention, was announced, urging local governments to tackle the problem of suicide. The GPSP was set to be revised after around five years from its publication, and, thus, a revised GPSP was published in August of 2012. Based on the five years of challenges, the revised GPSP states that suicide prevention strategies should move on to more practical and community-oriented ones. The National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), through its Center for Suicide Prevention, played a coordinating role in putting forward a proposal for the revision, working with 29 academic societies including the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN). In February 2013, by further developing the relationships with academic societies, etc., which were forged in the above-mentioned process, NCNP set up the Preparatory Committee for the Evidence-based Suicide Prevention Consortium in order to contribute to suicide prevention strategies from an academic perspective. Meanwhile, in the World Health Organization's 66th World Health Assembly held in May 2013, the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 was approved. Its core principle is \"no health without mental health\", and it has the following four objectives: (1) to strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health; (2) to provide comprehensive, integrated, and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings; (3) to implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health; and (4) to strengthen information systems, evidence, and research for mental health. In these, objective (3) includes a numerical target for the future global suicide rate.

When possible, pooled mean differences and effect sizes were calculated to estimate the effect of retirement on health. Twenty-two longitudinal studies were included, of which eleven were deemed to be of high quality. Strong evidence was found for retirement having a beneficial effect on mental health, and contradictory evidence was found for retirement having an effect on perceived general health and physical health. Few studies examined the differences between blue- and white-collar workers and between voluntary, involuntary and regulatory retirement with regards to the effect of retirement on health outcomes.

The participants were a convenience sample of parents of 77 school children with PD and 94 TD children who completed four assessments with a one-year interval between each assessment. Parents of these children were interviewed with the Functioning Scale of the Disability Evaluation System-Child version (FUNDES-Child). Three dimensions of mental health problems-loneliness, acting upset, and acting nervous-were rated by parents with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Linear trend was tested by repeated-measure ANOVA. The results revealed different longitudinal patterns of independence and frequency of attendance over time for children with PD and TD.

An ethnographic analysis of the positives and negatives of peer-support around self-harm on social media.", "text": "There is emerging evidence of the potentially detrimental impact of social media on young people's mental health. Against this background, online self-harm content has been a recent focus of concern across academia, policy and the media. It has been argued to encourage or even cause acts such as self-cutting through mechanisms of contagion. However, little is known about why a young person might engage with such content or about its impact on behaviour or well-being. Online ethnographic observation of interactions around self-harm on Twitter, Reddit and Instagram: collection and analysis of 10,169 original posts and 36,934 comments, both written and pictorial, at two time-points in 2018 and 2019. Ten in-depth semi-structured interviews exploring engagements with self-harm content on social media. Our data show that peer support is the central component of online interactions around self-harm. Young people accessing such content are likely to already be self-harming; they may turn to social media to understand, and seek help for, their actions and feelings in a context of offline stigma and service support gaps. This paper engages with the mechanisms, complexities and impact of this peer-support, reflecting on the benefits and dangers to caring for oneself and others through social media. Self-harm content is a fraught issue at the centre of current debates around risks and opportunities for child and adolescent mental health in the digital age. Whilst the importance of supporting young people's online safety is clear, moves to eradicate self-harm content must be undertaken with caution so as not to cause unintentional harm. Our research highlights a need to think beyond a model of contagion, instead attending to other mechanisms of harm and benefit. In so doing, it challenges prevailing attitudes towards online communication about self-harm and accepted approaches to managing this.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32459004/"}

A decade of research on in this region, along with a number of shorter research trips to healing shrines and specialists elsewhere in the subcontinent, and a thorough study of the literature, suggest that such techniques are often therapeutically effective. However, several considerations suggest that ritual healing may not be usefully combined with mainstream \"Western\" psychiatry: (a) psychiatry is deeply influenced by the ideology of individualism, which is incompatible with South Asian understandings of the person; (b) social asymmetries between religious healers and health professionals are too great to allow a truly respectful relationship between them; and (c) neither the science of psychiatry nor the regulatory apparatus of the state can or will acknowledge the validity of \"ritual therapy\"--and even if they did so, regulation would most likely destroy what is most valuable about ritual healing.

I describe how anticipation of state regulation prompted fears and discontents as well as critical reflections and actions that aimed to transform the field into a profession. The efforts to mark out a professional core against the backdrop of unruly jianghu further faced the challenge of an alternative vision that saw popularization as an equally noble cause. The Mental Health Law came into effect in 2013; ultimately, however, it did not introduce substantive regulation.

Most state workers' compensation systems divide mental injuries into categories based on their presumed etiology: physical-mental, mental-physical, and mental-mental. Major differences exist among states as to which workers are eligible. Proving workplace causation can be difficult where no traumatic physical injuries exist. Latency periods, time limits, preexisting health conditions, restrictions as to types of condition covered, and complex chains of causation may make this burden, which falls on the claimant, even more challenging. Only nine (9) states enacted presumption of causation laws for mental health conditions to ease claimants' burden of proof. This contrasts starkly with presumption laws for chronic and infectious diseases.

Physical abuse is suggested to decrease with age, but rates of emotional abuse appear to be stable over the lifespan. Among older adults, domestic violence is strongly associated with physical and mental health problems, and the scarce research comparing the impact of domestic violence across the age cohorts suggests that the physical health of older victims may be more severely affected than younger victims. In contrast, there is evidence that older victims may experience less psychological distress in response to domestic violence than younger victims.

Based on previous work, it was predicted that multiple high group identifications would protect against psychological ill health. Furthermore, it was predicted that better mental health would also predict greater number of group identifications, thus creating a 'virtuous circle'. A longitudinal questionnaire design was used. A total of 409 Scottish secondary school pupils aged 13-17 completed a questionnaire twice over a year. Pupils' responses regarding their mental health and the extent of their identification with three groups (the family, school, and friends) were measured. A path analysis of the data showed that greater number of high group identifications predicted better mental health outcomes amongst participants. However, better mental health also predicted greater number of high group identifications, suggesting that there is a cyclical relationship between both variables. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications. They highlight the importance of conceptualizing the link between group identification and mental health as cyclical, rather than unidirectional. This reconceptualization has implications for mental health promotion strategies, as it highlights the importance of attempting to turn a potentially 'vicious cycle' of social disidentification and mental ill health into a 'virtuous cycle' of social identification and mental health. Results showed that in a population of 409 high school pupils, the more high group identifications pupils had, the better their mental health outcomes. Better mental health also predicted a greater number of high group identifications over time. The findings suggest that we would benefit from conceptualizing the relationship between group identification and mental outcomes as being cyclical rather than unidirectional. Viewing the relationship between group identification and mental health in this way enables us to consider interventions which help turn a 'vicious cycle' into a 'virtuous cycle'.

Twenty-three studies could be included, overall showing a positive impact of the interventions considered, but no well-designed randomised controlled trials to test this optimistic view rigorously.

Of 14,247 citations initially identified, 73 articles drawn from 44 studies met inclusion criteria. The articles were classified by implementation phase (exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment) and specific implementation factors examined. These factors were divided into outer (i.e., system level) and inner (i.e., organizational level) contexts. Few studies used true experimental designs; most were observational. Of the many inner context factors that were examined in these studies (e.g., provider characteristics, organizational resources, leadership), fidelity monitoring and supervision had the strongest empirical evidence. Albeit the focus of fewer studies, implementation interventions focused on improving organizational climate and culture were associated with better intervention sustainment as well as child and adolescent outcomes. Outer contextual factors such as training and use of specific technologies to support intervention use were also important in facilitating the implementation process. The further development and testing of dissemination and implementation strategies is needed to more efficiently move EBPs into usual care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24074468/"}

Records of miracles that were believed to have been performed by saints reveal details of illnesses and injuries that afflicted medieval people. In the twelfth century, such records became increasingly medicalized and naturalized as the monks who recorded them gained access to Greek and Arabic medical material, newly translated into Latin. Nonetheless, by exploring nuances and patterns across the cults of five English saints, this book shows that hagiographical representations of madness were shaped as much by the individual circumstances of their recording as they were by new medical and theological standards.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31364431/"}
{"id": "39046759", "title": "Religious Coping, Resilience, and Military Spouse Mental Health.", "text": "Military spouses play a key role in the military family and contribute to military readiness. Despite their influence, they are an understudied population. Previous research has identified military spouses as a vulnerable group considering their unique life stressors and high mental distress; thus, it is critical to identify potential protective factors for military spouses. However, there is a lack of research exploring the role of religious coping and resilience in mental health outcomes of military spouses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of religious coping on depression, anxiety, and stress, and the extent to which the effect is mediated by resilience. A total of 1,079 military spouses completed self-administered surveys online. The questionnaires assessed demographic factors, depression, anxiety, stress, religious coping, and resilience. Zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics were analyzed. Additionally, multiple linear regression was utilized to investigate the extent to which resilience mediated the relationship between religious coping and mental health outcomes. The results indicate high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among military spouses. Religious coping had significant effects on mental distress, such that increases in religious coping corresponded to decreases in depression (β = -3.30), anxiety (β = -1.89) and stress (β = -1.58). Mediation analyses indicated resilience significantly mediated the relationship between religious coping and depression (95% CI [-1.38, -.431]), anxiety (95% CI [-1.23, -.376]), and stress (95% CI [-1.328, -0.420]). For military spouses, religious coping was associated with increased resilience, which was subsequently associated with reduced mental distress. This study draws attention to the role of religious coping and resilience in mental health outcomes for military spouses. Considering the role of military spouses in supporting service members, future research should explore how to strengthen military spouses' religious coping and resilience to mitigate mental distress, thereby facilitating service member success and military readiness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39046759/"}

Considering the volume of time that almost all youth spend at school during the school year, it is important to assess the role of the school environment in relation to students' attitudes toward help-seeking. Data from 47,290 grade 9 to 12 students and 116 Canadian secondary schools that participated in the 2018-19 wave of the COMPASS (Cannabis, Obesity, Mental health, Physical activity, Alcohol, Smoking, Sedentary behaviour) study were analyzed using GEE models to assess the student and school characteristics associated with attitudes regarding seeking help for mental health concerns from an adult at school. Overall, 58% of students reported being reluctant to seek help for mental health concerns at school. Students who reported lower self-rated mental health (aOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.65, 1.87), emotion regulation (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.09), family support (aOR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.16, 2.47), peer support (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.31), and school connectedness (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.92, 0.93) scores were more likely to be reluctant towards help-seeking at school than students with more favourable scores on these variables. Students with higher flourishing scores were less likely than students who were languishing to report reluctance to help-seeking at school (aOR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.96, 0.97). Students attending schools in areas with lower population densities and median household incomes between $50,000-75,000 were less likely to be reluctant to help-seeking relative to students attending schools in areas with higher density (aOR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.93) and median household incomes (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.31), respectively. The availability of school mental health services and specialists were not associated with student help-seeking reluctance. High levels of resistance towards help-seeking among youth remain a significant barrier, particularly among youth at highest risk (i.e., with lower support and poorer mental health). The student and school characteristics identified in the current study can help inform strategies to promote greater acceptance of help seeking among students in schools.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33003499/"}

The aim was to determine the level of PMH and self-care agency as well as the relations among sociodemographic variables, PMH, and the level of self-care among patients with chronic physical health problems. We also examined correlations between PMH and self-care agency. A descriptive, cross-sectional correlational study was conducted with a sample of 209 patients at a primary care center. The instruments used were the Positive Mental Health Questionnaire and the Appraisal of Self-Care Agency scale. The STROBE statement was used. Significant differences were found in the PMH factors in relation to sociodemographic variables and health conditions. Suffering one or more chronic diseases was associated negatively, and significantly, with the capacity for self-care. The four most prevalent chronic health problems in the sample were hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In people with chronic physical health problems, there is a positive relationship between PMH and self-care capacity. An increase in the possibility of caring for oneself saw an increase in PMH; conversely, an increase in PMH brought with it an increased capacity for self-care as well. Therefore, if actions are taken to increase PMH, the capacity for self-care will also increase.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762130/"}

This qualitative study applied Indigenous methodologies undertaken with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander governance and leadership. A respected local Aboriginal person engaged with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members and service providers through semi-structured interviews and yarning circles that explored community needs and challenges, service gaps, access barriers, success stories, proposed strategies to address service and system challenges, and principles and values for service design. A content analysis identified the breadth of challenges in addition to describing key targets to empower and connect communities and optimize health and social services to strengthen individual and collective social and emotional wellbeing. Eighty-three participants contributed to interviews and yarning circles including 17 Aboriginal community members, 38 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander service providers, and 28 non-Indigenous service providers. They expressed the need for codesigned, strengths-based, accessible and flexible services delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers with lived experience employed in organisations with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership and governance. Community hubs and cultural events in addition to one-stop-shop service centres and pre-crisis mental health, drug and alcohol and homelessness services were among many strategies identified. Holistic approaches to the promotion of social and emotional wellbeing are critical. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are calling for places in the community to connect and practice culture. They seek culturally safe systems that enable equitable access to and navigation of health and social services.

We used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study between 2009 and 2019 linking 108,247 observations (29,528 working age participants) to administrative UC Local Authority district data. We compared a UC-eligible population - reporting receipt of either UC or any of six legacy benefits (treatment group) - to individuals receiving alternative benefits (comparison group). We used standard and novel difference-in-differences approaches, exploiting geographical variation of UC rollout, and accounting for heterogeneity in treatment timing, to estimate mental health impacts (SF-12 Mental Component Summary) on average and at different time points post-introduction. UC was associated with mental health declining by 0·70 units (95 % CI -1·24 to -0·15), a 1·5 % relative reduction.

This article interrogates how this national response to problems of mental ill-health - and the problematization itself - was developed, accounted for, and sustained. By imbricating economic expertise with accounts of mental ill-health and mechanisms of treatment, IAPT has revivified psychological framings of pathology and therapy. However, it has done so in ways that are more familiar within biomedical contexts (e.g. through recourse to randomized controlled trial studies). Today, the initiative is a principal player in relation to which other services are increasingly developed. Indeed, in many respects IAPT has transformed from content to context within UK public mental health (in a process of what I term 'contextification').

Efforts to locally validate mental health assessments are of particular value, yet gold-standard clinical validation is costly, time-intensive, and reliant on available professionals. This study aimed to validate assessment items for mental distress in Kenya, using an innovative gold standard and a combination of culturally adapted and locally developed items. The mixed-method study drew on surveys and semi-structured interviews, conducted by lay interviewers, with 48 caregivers. Interviews were used to designate mental health \"cases\" or \"non-cases\" based on emotional health problems, identified through a collaborative clinical rating process with local input. Individual mental health survey items were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between cases and non-cases. Discriminant survey items included 23 items adapted from existing mental health assessment tools, as well as 6 new items developed for the specific cultural context. When items were combined into a scale, results showed good psychometric properties. The use of clinically rated semi-structured interviews provides a promising alternative gold standard that can help address the challenges of conducting diagnostic clinical validation in low-resource settings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31209898/"}

But for the less fortunate, acting further upstream, long before these mental health problems occur, is just as important as advancing new treatments. \"Treating\" the social determinants of mental health involves focusing more on policies than on medication, therapy, and neurobiological innovation. It entails creating public policies that improve these issues and changing social norms to place greater value on giving everyone an equal chance at living a fulfilling and healthy life.

Of 5,310 articles screened by title and abstract, 357 were retrieved for full-text review, and 62 met inclusion criteria. Articles describing interventions that were activity or occupation based were included. Conference proceedings, non-peer reviewed publications, dissertations, theses, and presentations were excluded. Of the 62 studies included in the review, 20 (32%) were Level I studies, 22 (36%) were Level II studies, and 20 (32%) were Level III studies. Articles were categorized by type: outdoor camps, video and computer games, productive occupations and life skills, meditation, animal-assisted interventions, creative arts, play, sports, and yoga. Moderate to strong evidence supports the use of yoga and sports. Moderate-strength evidence supports the use of play and creative arts. Evidence for the use of animal-assisted interventions, meditation, video and computer games, and productive occupations was of low strength. Substantial evidence exists to support the use of activity- and occupation-based interventions to address the mental health, behavioral, and social participation concerns of children and youth. Occupational therapy practitioners should match the desired outcome of therapy with the appropriate intervention to provide the best and most effective services to their clients.

The programme reported in this paper is one such programme that is working with young men in the building and construction industry who are regarded at even greater risk of poor mental health outcomes. The research that was undertaken uncovered some of the impact of a universal programme on improving the protective factors of young men in this industry. Young men can present themselves in a very positive light as robust and resilient human beings, contrary to much of the research that has been undertaken with a focus on young men in building and construction and living in rural and remote communities.

Despite their substantial consequences, there is a dearth of research and representation in the current literature. We conducted a systematic review of observational studies published between January 1, 2000, and January 20, 2024, to examine the impact of extreme weather events on the mental health of the South and Southeast Asian population. Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality appraisal checklist. The search retrieved 70 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Most were from India (n = 22), and most used a cross-sectional study design (n = 55). Poor mental health outcomes were associated with six types of extreme weather events: floods, storm surges, typhoons, cyclones, extreme heat, and riverbank erosion. Most studies (n = 41) reported short-term outcome measurements. Findings included outcomes with predictable symptomatology, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, emotional distress and suicide. Limited studies on long-term effects showed higher mental disorders after floods and typhoons, while cyclone-exposed individuals had more short-term distress. Notably, the review identified over 50 risk factors influencing mental health outcomes, categorized into six classes: demographic, economic, health, disaster exposure, psychological, and community factors. However, the quantitative evidence linking extreme weather events to mental health was limited due to a lack of longitudinal data, lack of control groups, and the absence of objective exposure measurements. The review found some compelling evidence linking extreme weather events to adverse mental health in the South and Southeast Asia region. Future research should focus on longitudinal study design to identify the specific stressors and climatic factors influencing the relationship between climate extremes and mental health in this region.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38354890/"}

Open-ended audio-recorded interviews were conducted in Arabic with 23 mothers residing in Jordan. Using a narrative approach in the data collection and analysis, five major themes were identified: (1) children were exposed to diverse war traumatic experiences in Syria; (2) the escape journey and refugee camps threatened children's lives; (3) displacement and family stressors exposed children to poverty, hostility from local peers, educational and recreational challenges, child labor, and domestic violence (these three major themes were considered as trauma related variables); (4) children were not only directly affected physically and mentally by their own traumatic experiences and displacement stressors, but these experiences were mediated and magnified by familial interrelated processes, evidenced in intergenerational transmission of trauma, harsh parenting style, parental control, and parentification; and (5) adverse consequences of both trauma related variables and family processes directly and indirectly traumatized children and adversely impacted their physical and mental health. We examined the themes that emerged from the data in view of three theoretical frameworks and the impact of trauma in the family system on child development. To conclude, humanitarian organizations that provide services and interventions to refugees need to take into account familial processes and not only individual factors affecting refugee children's physical and mental health.

Principal components analysis was used to describe the factor structure of mental well-being and to generate mental well-being indicators. A two-factor solution found eight out of nine items with strong loadings on well-being. Eight items corresponding to hedonic and eudaemonic well-being accounted for 36.9% and 14.3% of total variance respectively. Separate hedonic and eudaemonic well-being scales were created. Hedonic well-being (full of life; having lots of energy) declined with age, while eudaemonic well-being (getting on well with family and friends; sense of belonging) rose steadily with age. Hedonic well-being was lower and eudaemonic well-being higher in women. Associations of well-being with age, gender, income and self-rated health were little altered by adjustment for symptoms of mental illness. In a large nationally representative population sample, two types of well-being were distinguished and reliably assessed: hedonic and eudaemonic.

Both work and family are identified as two major contributors to these problems. Utilizing Conservation of Resources theory, this paper examines work-family conflict and overwork as significant explanatory variables and develops a moderated mediation model to investigate the mechanisms affecting mental health issues among Chinese career women. Data were gathered through a questionnaire survey, with 500 questionnaires distributed and 393 responses received. Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS was employed to examine moderated mediation models, with Bootstrap resampling set at 1000. (1) Work-family conflict (abbreviated as WFC) is significantly associated with emotional exhaustion (abbreviated as EE) and mental health problems in career women, with emotional exhaustion serving as a mediator between work-family conflict and mental health. (2) Overwork is positively linked to emotional exhaustion and influences the relationship between work-family conflict and emotional exhaustion. (3) Overwork also moderates the mediation effect of work-family conflict on mental health via emotional exhaustion, amplifying the mediation effect when career women are overburdened. This study provides fresh insights into the mechanisms underlying mental health issues among career women, offering valuable information for addressing these challenges.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40241940/"}

Students participated in a 10-week, multistage project that examined life histories, treatment resources, and evidence-based practice, as applied to a single individual with a mental illness. Students reported increased understanding of mental health and illness, developed personal relevance associated with the knowledge gained, and learned to problem solve with regard to nursing care of individuals diagnosed with mental illness. For many students, there also appeared to be a reduction in stigmatized attitudes towards mental illness.

Participants whose family/relative initiated the first contact were significantly associated with a shorter duration of untreated illness compared to those who initiated first contact on their own. Findings suggest the determinants of the pathways to first contact and duration of untreated illness included diagnosis, ethnicity, marital status and family initiating the first contact.

The health inequalities were examined by way of binary logistic regression modeling of hypertension and multinomial logistic regression modeling of self-rated health and self-rated mental health. Educational attainment and household income were investigated as potentially mediating factors using nested models and the Karlson-Holm-Breen decomposition technique. <b>Results:</b> Black respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to report hypertension, a disparity that was partly attributable to differences in income. White respondents reported the best and Black respondents reported the worst overall self-rated health, a disparity that was entirely attributable to income differences. Respondents who identified as both Black and White were significantly more likely than White respondents to report fair or poor mental health, a disparity that was partly attributable to income differences. After controlling for income, Black respondents were significantly less likely than White respondents to report fair or poor mental health. Educational attainment did not contribute to explaining any of these associations. <b>Conclusion:</b> Canadians who identify as both Black and White fall between Black Canadians and White Canadians in regards to self-rated overall health, report the worst self-rated mental health of the three populations, and, with White Canadians, are the least likely to report hypertension. These heterogeneous findings are indicative of a range of diverse processes operative in the production of Black-White health inequalities in Canada.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28393550/"}

As clinicians and researchers with an interest in mental health, we have a collective responsibility to help understand and mitigate these impacts. To achieve this, however, it is vital to have an appreciation of the relevant policy and regulatory frameworks. In this feature article, a collaboration amongst mental health and policy experts, we provide an overview of the integration of mental health within current climate policies and regulations in the UK, including gaps and opportunities. We argue that current policy and regulatory frameworks are lacking in coverage, ambition, detail and implementation, as increases in weather extremes and their negative impacts on mental health outpace action. For example, across current national and local climate policies, there is almost no reference to the impacts of extreme weather events on mental health. Whilst alarming, this provides scope for future research to fill evidence gaps and inform policy and regulatory change. We call for mental health and policy experts to work together to improve our understanding of underlying mechanisms and develop practical interventions, helping to bring mental health within climate policy and regulatory frameworks.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39582375/"}

The search criterion was the descriptor \"positive mental health.\" Results Of 51 studies consulted, 84% used a quantitative approach; 84% were published in English; and the same percentage were conducted between 2000 and 2014. The concept of positive mental health has been applied in essentially five different ways: as the absence of disease; as the subject of the Jahoda model; as a combination of factors on the Lluch scale; as a synonym of well-being; and as part of more complex scales of measurement. Conclusions Positive mental health should not be viewed as the opposite of a mental disorder, the absence of disease, or the sum of a given set of personal conditions.

We demonstrate that the Mental Health Compartment Model produces irrelevant outcomes that are not helpful for clinical settings. The model inflated the productivity gains generated from mental health investment. In some cases, the model underestimated the economic costs of mental health. Such limitation renders the investment cases poor in providing valuable intervention points from the perspectives of both the users and the providers.

{"id": "26480224", "title": "Mental health and sexual activity according to ancient Greek physicians.", "text": "The ancient Greek physicians have not failed in their studies to indicate the beneficial role of sexual activity in human health. They acknowledged that sex helps to maintain mental balance. Very interesting is their observation that sex may help mental patients to recover. Nevertheless they stressed emphatically that sex is beneficial only when there is a measure in it, so they believed that sexual abstinence or excessive sexual activity affect negatively the mental and physical health of man. Ancient Greek physicians reached this conclusion by empirical observation. They tried to justify the mental imbalance, as the potential physical problems, which probably will be listed today in the psychosomatic manifestations, of people with long-term sexual abstinence or hyperactivity, based on the theory of humors which was the main methodological tool of ancient Greek medicine. Their fundamental idea was that the four humors of the body (blood, phlegm, yellow and black bile) should be in balance. Therefore they believed that the loss and the exchange of bodily fluids during sex help body's humors to maintain their equilibrium which in turn will form the basis for the physical and mental health. Although in ancient medical texts the irrationality presented by people in the aforementioned conditions was not attributed in any of the major mental illnesses recognized in antiquity, as mania, melancholy and phrenitis, our belief is that their behavior is more suited to the characteristics of melancholy, while according to modern medicine it should be classified in the depressive disorders. We have come to this conclusion, because common characteristics of people who either did not have sexual life or was overactive, was sadness, lack of interest and hope, as well as paranoid thinking that can reach up to suicide. Regarding the psychosomatic problems, which could occur in these people, they were determined by the ancient Greek physicians in the following; continuous headaches and heaviness, dilatancy, pain, dysuria and fever. But all these symptoms would disappear when the man gained a measure sexual activity, as was categorically stated by Galen. It is striking that these ideas were maintained over time, starting already from the authors of the Hippocratic Corpus, from which the distinguished work De virginum morbis, refers indeed to women who reached the point of suicide due to the absence sexual life, hanging themselves or falling into wells and eventually passing to the works of Rufus of Ephesus, Soranus of Ephesus and Galen.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26480224/"}

The aim of the study is to determine whether adverse outcomes (physical and verbal aggression, self-harm, victimisation, self-neglect, unauthorised leave and substance abuse) reduced after patients were assessed with the Short-term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START). In a naturalistic study, anonymised demographic and clinical information was collected from 50 male patients. Data included START assessment and frequency of target behaviour for 3 months before and after first assessment. Chi-square and linear mixed models analyses were used to determine whether there was any change in the behaviours of interest. There were no significant changes in physical or verbal aggression over time, although a tendency towards fewer incidents was apparent. Other adverse behaviours were very infrequent at baseline, precluding adequate analysis. In this small sample, START did not achieve its primary purpose of significant reduction in adverse behaviours. Although our sample size was informed by a power calculation, we may have over-estimated the size of anticipated change. Further, the 3-month comparison periods before and after the assessment follow-up period were rather short. Accordingly, we recommend more research on the value of this tool in practice rather than discontinuing its use.

Data were obtained from the 1997 Taiwan Social Change Survey (<i>n</i> = 2,598). The 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptom scores; ⩾16 represented high depressive symptoms. Network-based social capital was measured using a position generator. Two dimensions of cohesion-based social capital were assessed: cognitive (perceived neighborhood trust and reciprocity) and structural (local community participation and organizational participation). Multivariable log-binomial regression models, weighted to account for the complex sampling design and adjusted for confounders, estimated prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine the association between each social capital measure and depressive symptoms.

Sleep-competing behaviours are likely factors in the inadequate sleep time and related functional outcomes observed in this population. We examined a range of sleep-competing behaviours and their associations with sleep variables in Australian school-attending youth. We also assessed whether these behaviours indirectly affected mental health and daytime functioning through poorer sleep quality. A total of 353 school-attending youth (mean age = 14.6 years, 53% female) were recruited from high schools in Australia, and completed a range of self-report measures. Approximately 50% of the youth obtained sub-optimal levels of sleep and reported having a problematically long sleep onset latency. Sleep competing behaviours, related and unrelated to electronic media use, were reported as occurring frequently, and were associated with a range of sleep variables.

The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials, qualitative studies, and single-armed trials on the basis of the literature evaluation criteria developed by the JBI Center for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Australia. Mixed-sex studies were assessed by using the mixed-methods assessment tool (MMAT 2018). The review identified 11 studies that met the criteria, most of which reported on the effects of MHFA training in terms of mental health literacy (referred to as MHL), MHFA intentions and confidence, stigma, and changes in social distance. A few studies analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of MHFA training courses, motivation to complete MHFA, barriers and facilitators to MHFA training, and participants' perceptions of implementing MHFA training. The MHFA curriculum is practical for healthcare workers and medical nursing students. In the future, a standardized training program based on the population characteristics of healthcare workers and medical nursing students must be developed to standardize the measurement of outcome indicators to reflect the effectiveness of implementing the MHFA training curriculum.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the total impact of selected behavioural and environmental factors on the variability of mental well-being indexes of young people aged 15 to 17 years. The survey, conducted as part of the last round of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2017/18 study, covered 3693 secondary school students in Poland at the average age of 16.53 years (SD = 1.09). Dependent variables: depression (CES-DC), stress (Cohen scale), satisfaction with life (Cantril's Ladder), and self-efficacy in social relations (Smith and Betz scale). Independent variables included: physical activity; sedentary behaviours; length of sleep; and perception of the environment in which the respondent was raised. The analyses were adjusted by gender, age, and occurrence of chronic disease. It was demonstrated that gender, duration of sleep, and perception of the surrounding environment proved to be significant predictors of all four mental health indicators. The protective influence of physical activity appeared to be a particular advantage in a less-supportive environment. The intervention programmes aimed at improving the mental well-being of young people should include promoting physical activity and sufficient sleep; furthermore, environmental moderators should be taken into consideration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30875742/"}

Comparison shows that all these practices involve communal healing rituals grounded in spiritual, religious, and cultural knowledge systems related to embodied ways of knowing and that are embedded in social-ecological systems, including kinship, ancestral ties, and filial connections to the cosmology. To support further development of decolonial practice, it is crucial to attend to the complex interactions of cultural identity and sociocultural (relational, communal, political, and spiritual) factors underlying healing traditions in Indigenous communities.

Few studies, however, have investigated the contemporary factors which may explain these lasting associations. We examined features of contemporary housing markets-including property values, homeownership rates, and loan denial rates for home purchase-as possible mediators of historical redlining patterns and contemporary prevalence of poor mental health and assessed neighborhood racial composition as a moderator of these associations. Using data from the CDC PLACES Project (2020 release), American Community Survey (2013-2017), Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database (2013-2017), and Historic Redlining Scores Project, we studied 12,047 census tracts in the United States. We found significant indirect effects of historical redlining on contemporary prevalence of poor mental health via neighborhood property values, homeownership rates, and loan denial rates for home purchase. Further, the indirect effect of redlining via relative median property value was conditional on neighborhood racial composition. Our findings suggest properties in historically \"A\" graded neighborhoods are valued more than those in neighborhoods graded less favorably, and this apparent benefit to property values-and subsequently to residents' mental health-is greater in neighborhoods where Black residents are underrepresented.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40378697/"}

These debates have become increasingly polarized, giving rise to a need for more dialogue and experience-near research to inform theorizing. Ethnography has much to offer in this respect. This paper frames and introduces five articles in this issue of Transcultural Psychiatry that illustrate the role of ethnographic methods in understanding the effects and implications of the field of global mental health on mental health policy and practice. The papers include ethnographies from South Africa, India, and Tonga that show the potential for ethnographic evidence to inform GMH projects. These studies provide nuanced conceptualizations of GMH's varied manifestations across different settings, the diverse ways that GMH's achievements can be evaluated, and the connections that can be drawn between locally observed experiences and wider historical, political, and social phenomena.

Following the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to consult the target group, this is the first study qualitatively investigating the perspectives on mental health and coping strategies of Syrian refugees in Germany. A qualitative design with semi-structured focus group discussions was applied. Three focus groups with a total of N = 20 participants were conducted. Focus group discussions were analyzed using content-structuring content analysis. Hopelessness, fear, and worries were reported most frequently as emotional consequences of war, fleeing, and resettlement, along with cognitive, physical, social, and behavioral consequences. Among the reported consequences, symptoms of PTSD were identified. Contrary to depression and schizophrenia, PTSD was not explicitly mentioned. Possibilities of coping and support referred to meeting basic needs (e.g., mental health care), fostering participation and personal coping, with the social network stated as most important source of support. Barriers of accessing mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services included poor information, stigma, and language difficulties. In contrast to earlier research, Syrian refugees reported numerous emotional symptoms as well as mental disorders as consequences of war, fleeing, and resettlement, indicating awareness of mental health sequelae. However, PTSD was not reported as possible consequence.

We used multivariable regression to investigate whether variation in the trend in reassessments in each of 149 local authorities in England was associated with differences in local trends in suicides, self-reported mental health problems and antidepressant prescribing rates, while adjusting for baseline conditions and trends in other factors known to influence mental ill-health. Each additional 10,000 people reassessed in each area was associated with an additional 6 suicides (95% CI 2 to 9), 2700 cases of reported mental health problems (95% CI 548 to 4840), and the prescribing of an additional 7020 antidepressant items (95% CI 3930 to 10100). The reassessment process was associated with the greatest increases in these adverse mental health outcomes in the most deprived areas of the country, widening health inequalities. The programme of reassessing people on disability benefits using the Work Capability Assessment was independently associated with an increase in suicides, self-reported mental health problems and antidepressant prescribing.

Linear mixed effects models were used to assess whether age, gender, and trauma exposure prior to arrival were associated with levels and changes in symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms over time. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether daily hassles, perceived social support, and new trauma experiences predict PTS, internalization, externalization, and somatization. The mean levels of depression had decreased significantly at 5 years, but mean levels of anxiety, PTS, and externalizing symptoms did not. Females and severely trauma exposed had higher levels of symptoms. Higher age was associated with less change in symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress over time. Five years after arrival, many still experienced clinical levels of mental health problems, and level of daily hassles was an important predictor.

We used hierarchical linear modeling as well as analyses of variance to analyze parents' Child Behavior Checklist ratings of 72,493 6- to 16-year-olds from 45 societies. The 45 societies were nested within 10 culture clusters based on the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) taxonomy. Societal differences accounted for 3.8-10.7% of variance in various kinds of problems, while differences between culture clusters (e.g., Anglo vs. Confucian) accounted for 0.1-10.0%. By contrast, differences associated with parents' ratings of individual children accounted for 85.5-93.3% of variance. Averaged across 17 problem scales, society plus culture cluster accounted for about 10% of the variance in parents' ratings of children's problems, whereas individual differences and other possible variables accounted for about 90%.

The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021214731). We systematically searched twelve databases in September 2022 and identified 149 eligible reviews from 38,257 records screened. Quality of evidence was assessed with the JBI levels of evidence and risk of bias with the ROBIS tool. A large but low-quality evidence base points to class-based inequalities in mental health and wellbeing, with the strongest available evidence linking lower social positions to an increased risk of depression. In terms of different facets of stratification, the best available evidence suggests that deprivation (e.g., poverty), socioeconomic status, income, and subjective social status are consequential for individuals' mental health and wellbeing. However, high-quality evidence for the roles of education, occupation, other economic resources (e.g., wealth), and social capital is currently limited. Most reviews employed individual-level measures (e.g., income), as opposed to interpersonal- (e.g., social capital) or community-level (e.g., neighbourhood deprivation) measures. Considering mechanisms, we found some evidence for mediation via subjective social status, sense of control, and experiences of stress and trauma. There was also some evidence that higher socioeconomic status can provide a buffer for neighbourhood deprivation, lower social capital, and lower subjective social status.

There is no conformity of the age ranges addressed by these documents nor are vulnerable groups explicitly recognized. Stress, anxiety and depression were commonly identified as mental health concerns and diverse platforms such as community, family, school, digital and health facility were recommended to deliver preventive and treatment interventions.

Preventive interventions were recommended for delivery through peers and other non-specialist providers while treatment interventions were recommended for delivery in healthcare facilities by specialist health professionals. There was very little engagement of young people in the development of these policies or in their implementation, except for peer educators mentioned in one policy.

The study objective was to assess mental health disparities in a representative sample of adolescents growing up in South Africa. Cross-sectional associations of race/ethnicity and material disadvantage with CMD and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were assessed in a stratified random sample representative of school-attendees, aged 14-15 years, in a large metropolitan area of Cape Town. Validated instruments assessed mental disorders; these included: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (PTSD); Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (depression); Zung self-rated anxiety scale (anxiety). Self-ascribed ethnicity was determined using procedures similar to the South African census and previous national surveys. Response rate was 88% (1034 of 1169 individuals). Adolescents experienced a high prevalence of depression (41%), anxiety (16%) and PTSD (21%). A gradient between material disadvantage and CMD/ PTSD was evident across all ethnic/racial groups.

After adjusting for confounders, relative to white children, relative risk (RR) of CMD in black children was 2.27 (95% CI:1.24, 4.15) and for PTSD was RR: 2.21 (95% CI:1.73, 2.83). Relative risk of CMD was elevated in children self-identifying as 'coloured' (RR: 1.73, 95% CI:1.11, 2.70). Putative mediators (violence, racially motivated bullying, social support, self-esteem) partially accounted for differences in CMD and fully for PTSD. Adolescent mental health inequalities in Cape Town are associated with material disadvantage and self-identification with historically disadvantaged groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27139456/"}

Observational Evidence From 22 Countries.", "text": "<b>Objectives:</b> As advancing evidence on modifiable resources to support mental health in persons experiencing physical disabilities is of particular importance, we investigate whether structural and functional social relationships relate to mental health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). <b>Methods:</b> Data from 12,330 participants of the International SCI community survey (InSCI) from 22 countries were analyzed. Structural (partnership status, living situation) and functional aspects of social relationships (belongingness, relationship satisfaction, problems with social interactions) were regressed on the SF-36 mental health index (MHI-5), stratified by countries and for the total sample using multilevel models. <b>Results:</b> Functional aspects of social relationships were consistently related to clinically relevant higher MHI-5 scores and lower risk of mental health disorders (MHI-5 >56). Structural social relationships were inconsistently associated with mental health in our sample. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides evidence that functional aspects of social relationships are important resources for mental health.

While substantial progress in realizing this potential has been made across several domains, including surgery, anatomy, and rehabilitation, the implementation of XR in mental health training, where nuanced humanistic interactions are central, has lagged. Given the growing societal and health care service need for trained mental health and care workers, coupled with the heterogeneity of exposure during training and the shortage of placement opportunities, we explored the feasibility and utility of a novel XR tool for mental health consultation training. Specifically, we set out to evaluate a training simulation created through collaboration among software developers, clinicians, and learning technologists, in which users interact with a virtual patient, \"Stacey,\" through a virtual reality or augmented reality head-mounted display. The tool was designed to provide trainee health care professionals with an immersive experience of a consultation with a patient presenting with perinatal mental health symptoms. Users verbally interacted with the patient, and a human instructor selected responses from a repository of prerecorded voice-acted clips. In a pilot experiment, we confirmed the face validity and usability of this platform for perinatal and primary care training with subject-matter experts. In our follow-up experiment, we delivered personalized 1-hour training sessions to 123 participants, comprising mental health nursing trainees, general practitioner doctors in training, and students in psychology and medicine. This phase involved a comprehensive evaluation focusing on usability, validity, and both cognitive and affective learning outcomes. We found significant enhancements in learning metrics across all participant groups. Notably, there was a marked increase in understanding (P<.001) and motivation (P<.001), coupled with decreased anxiety related to mental health consultations (P<.001). There were also significant improvements to considerations toward careers in perinatal mental health (P<.001). Our findings show, for the first time, that XR can be used to provide an effective, standardized, and reproducible tool for trainees to develop their mental health consultation skills. We suggest that XR could provide a solution to overcoming the current resource challenges associated with equipping current and future health care professionals, which are likely to be exacerbated by workforce expansion plans.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40173446/"}

Previous studies acknowledge that the poor design of communities and social environments leads to increased psychological distress, but methodological issues make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Recent public health, leisure and recreation studies have tried to determine the relationship between recreation opportunities and mental health. However, previous studies have heavily focused on individual contexts rather than national or regional levels; this is a major limitation. It is difficult to reflect the characteristics of community environments effectively with such limited studies, because social environments and infrastructure should be analyzed using a spatial perspective that goes beyond an individual's behavioral patterns. Other limitations include lack of socioeconomic context and appropriate data to represent the characteristics of a local community and its environment. To date, very few studies have tested the spatial relationships between mental health and recreation opportunities on a national level, while controlling for a variety of competing explanations (e.g., the social determinants of mental health). To address these gaps, this study used multi-level spatial data combined with various sources to: (1) identify variables that contribute to spatial disparities of mental health; (2) examine how selected variables influence spatial mental health disparities using a generalized linear model (GLM); (3) specify the spatial variation of the relationships between recreation opportunities and mental health in the continental U.S. using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The findings suggest that multiple factors associated with poor mental health days, particularly walkable access to local parks, showed the strongest explanatory power in both the GLM and GWR models. In addition, negative relationships were found with educational attainment, racial/ethnic dynamics, and lower levels of urbanization, while positive relationships were found with poverty rate and unemployment in the GLM. Finally, the GWR model detected differences in the strength and direction of associations for 3109 counties. These results may address the gaps in previous studies that focused on individual-level scales and did not include a spatial context.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33327395/"}

We sought to design a conversational agent that could express empathic support in ways that might approach, or even match, human capabilities. Another aim was to assess how users might appraise such a system. Our system used a corpus-based approach to simulate expressed empathy. Responses from an existing pool of online peer support data were repurposed by the agent and presented to the user. Information retrieval techniques and word embeddings were used to select historical responses that best matched a user's concerns. We collected ratings from 37,169 users to evaluate the system. Additionally, we conducted a controlled experiment (N=1284) to test whether the alleged source of a response (human or machine) might change user perceptions. The majority of responses created by the agent (2986/3770, 79.20%) were deemed acceptable by users. However, users significantly preferred the efforts of their peers (P<.001). This effect was maintained in a controlled study (P=.02), even when the only difference in responses was whether they were framed as coming from a human or a machine.

This study explores the experiences of GPs dealing with parents bereaved by suicide. Qualitative study using interviews with 13 GPs in the UK. Parents, whose adult offspring had died by suicide between 2002 and 2012, were recruited and gave the name of their GP to be invited for interview. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. The topic guide explored experiences of dealing with suicide and bereavement. Data were analysed thematically using constant comparison techniques. GPs described mental health as 'part and parcel' of primary care, but disclosed low confidence in dealing with suicide and an unpreparedness to face parents bereaved by suicide. Some GPs described guilt surrounding the suicide, and a reluctance to initiate contact with the bereaved parents. GPs talked of their duty to care for the bereaved patients, but admitted difficulties in knowing what to do, particularly in the perceived absence of other services. GPs reflected on the impact of the suicide on themselves and described a lack of support or supervision. GPs need to feel confident and competent to support parents bereaved by suicide. Although this may be facilitated through training initiatives, and accessible services to refer parents to, GPs also require formal support and supervision, particularly around significant events such as suicide.

There is a large literature demonstrating an association between internal LoC and positive mental health outcomes. However, this research is conducted mostly in high-income, Global North settings, with limited consideration of cross-cultural variability. This short report explores how LoC relates to mental health when considered in a less-studied context: in a setting of stark structural violence and in relation to supernatural agents. I conducted a community-based survey in rural Haiti (n = 322) that assessed sent spirit-related locus of control (LoC-S) and mental health. Among individuals experiencing higher levels of daily stressors, depressive and anxiety symptoms were high regardless of LoC-S. However, for individuals facing low-to-moderate daily stressors, external LoC-S (believing one does not have control in relation to sent spirits) was associated with lower depressive and anxiety symptoms, though this interaction did not hold for anxiety after controlling for covariates. Though initially a nonintuitive finding, I contextualize this outcome in relation to ethnographic work in Haiti, showing that the ability to explain misfortune via the supernatural world can serve as a form of blame displacement. In a context where extreme structural violence means that individuals realistically have little control over their lives, an external LoC better reflects lived experience, helping explain the association with better mental health outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39143843/"}

An Integrated Literature Review.", "text": "Individuals with a severe mental illness have a gap in life expectancy of up to 20 years in comparison to the general population. Nurses who work in mental health services have been identified as best placed to improve the physical health outcomes of individuals with mental illness. The literature identifies a lack of nursing knowledge related to physical health care and the presence of metabolic syndrome which is impeding nurses in providing essential physical health care to patients. An integrated literature review was carried out due to the dearth of research evidence pertaining to the impact of targeted education specifically with psychiatric/mental health nurses in the provision of physical healthcare. A search for literature included the following databases: CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science revealed nine studies: seven quantitative, one qualitative and one mixed method. Qualitative synthesis has shed light on the value of targeted education on improving knowledge and skills in providing physical health care that can then be translated into clinical practice. Targeted education in physical healthcare grows psychiatric/mental health nurse's confidence and develops the skills necessary to enable them to screen and monitor and offer range of physical health interventions to individuals with severe mental illness. Accessible summary • The poor physical health outcomes and premature death of individuals with severe mental illness is of growing concern; a contributing factor is a lack of knowledge and confidence amongst psychiatric/mental health nurses to providing physical health screening and intervening in preventable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. • An integrated literature review was used to ascertain if targeted education on physical health care can improve the knowledge base of psychiatric/mental health nurses within physical health care. • Nine studies were critically appraised, and the data reduced using a narrative synthesis that tells a story of the findings from these research studies. • The review found that targeted education with psychiatric/mental health nurses does result in a statistical increase in knowledge This review finds that nurses have not been regularly supported with physical health education to alter existing practices. This lack of knowledge within physical healthcare is hindering psychiatric/mental health nurses to fully engaging in physical health care activities in practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29465277/"}

Using the 2015, 2017, and 2019 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 6,776), this study explores how one's earnings and work hours combine to influence mental health using growth mixture modeling and a negative binomial regression model, with generalized propensity score weighting for causal inference. The findings reveal that working 40 h a week with earnings two to three times the US federal poverty threshold benefits mental health. However, earning more by working 60 h a week does not provide additional mental health benefits. Additionally, individuals with a history of low earnings face a high risk of psychological distress, even as their earnings improve over time. This risk is similar to that experienced by those consistently earning low incomes.

Compliance and retention rates were lower for studies with a higher proportion of male participants (P<.001) and individuals with a psychotic disorder (P<.001). Compliance was positively associated with the use of a fixed sampling scheme (P=.02), higher incentives (P=.03), higher time intervals between successive evaluations (P=.02), and fewer evaluations per day (P=.008), while no significant associations were observed with regard to the mean age of the sample, the study duration, or other design characteristics.

The aim of this study was to review the current evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of online one-on-one mental health interventions that use text-based synchronous chat. A systematic search was conducted of the databases relevant to this area of research (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], PsycINFO, Central, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, IEEE, and ACM). There were no specific selection criteria relating to the participant group. Studies were included if they reported interventions with individual text-based synchronous conversations (ie, chat or text messaging) and a psychological outcome measure. A total of 24 articles were included in this review. Interventions included a wide range of mental health targets (eg, anxiety, distress, depression, eating disorders, and addiction) and intervention design. Overall, compared with the waitlist (WL) condition, studies showed significant and sustained improvements in mental health outcomes following synchronous text-based intervention, and post treatment improvement equivalent but not superior to treatment as usual (TAU) (eg, face-to-face and telephone counseling). Feasibility studies indicate substantial innovation in this area of mental health intervention with studies utilizing trained volunteers and chatbot technologies to deliver interventions. While studies of efficacy show positive post-intervention gains, further research is needed to determine whether time requirements for this mode of intervention are feasible in clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28784594/"}

Despite the high prevalence and cost of mental health disorders, an estimated 75 % of those with need in lower resource settings do not receive intervention. Most studies to date have examined the effectiveness of single-disorder mental health treatments - an approach that may be a significant challenge to scale-up and sustainability in lower resource settings. This paper presents a brief overview of the scientific progress in global mental health, and suggests consideration of an internal stepped care delivery approach. An internal stepped care model is one idea of a delivery system, utilizing a common elements approach, where the same provider could navigate between different elements based on severity and type of problems of the client. It is distinct from traditional stepped care models in that clients remain with the same provider, rather than relying on referral systems. An internal stepped care delivery system based on a simplified common elements approach could be more efficient, scalable, sustainable, and reduce the loss of clients to referrals in lower resource settings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27406182/"}

Such information not only improves our understanding of etiology but also allows for effective intervention strategies to be tailored. The temporal relationship between alcohol intake and mental health remains poorly understood, particularly in nonclinical samples. The purpose of this study was to disentangle the dominant temporal sequence between mental health and frequency of heavy drinking days. We report a 10-year (1997 to 2007) prospective cohort study of 500 respondents (74% male) from the Birmingham Untreated Heavy Drinkers project. Participants were aged 25 to 55 years at baseline, drinking a minimum of 50/35 U.K. units of alcohol for men/women on a weekly basis, and were not seeking treatment for their alcohol use upon recruitment into the study. Heavy drinking days were defined as consuming 10/7+ U.K. units of alcohol in a single day for men/women. Mental health was assessed using the mental health component score of the SF-36 questionnaire. Dynamic longitudinal structural equation models were used to test competing theoretical models (frequency of heavy drinking days leading to changes in mental health scores and vice versa) and a reciprocal relationship (both mental health scores and the frequency of heavy drinking days influencing changes in each other). A model whereby mental health scores were predictors of change in the frequency of heavy drinking days was of best fit. In this model, mental health scores were negatively related to change in heavy drinking days (β -0.80, SE 0.28) indicating that those with higher mental health scores (i.e., better functioning) made larger reductions in the number of heavy drinking days over time. Mental health appears to be the stronger underlying process in the relationship between mental health and frequency of heavy drinking days.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25787314/"}

The continuing deinstitutionalisation process and the implementation of community mental health services was considerably affected by the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, which required dramatic changes in the structure and quality of the mental health care system of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Overall, German mental health care is organised as a subsidiary system, where planning and regulating mental health care is the responsibility of the 16 federal states. So German mental health care provision is spread among many sectors and characterised by considerable regional differences. A key characteristic is the particularly wide gap between inpatient and outpatient services, which are funded separately and staffed by different teams. In 2003 the total number of psychiatric beds was a mere two thirds of the overall bed capacity in 1991, the first year as a re-unified Germany, when psychiatric beds in East and West Germany totalled 80,275. From 1970 onwards the number of psychiatric beds was cut by roughly half. So the momentum of the reform has been strong enough to assimilate the completely different mental health care system of the former German Democratic Republic and, in the course of a decade, to re-structure mental health services for an additional 17-18 million new inhabitants. In an ongoing struggle to adapt to changing administrative set-ups, legal frameworks, and financial constraints, psychiatry in Germany in currently facing specific problems and is seriously challenged to defend to considerable achievements of the past. A major obstacle to achieving this aim lies in the fragmented system of mental health care provision and mental health care funding.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17149540/"}

In the post-war period of reconstruction (1945-65), as well as between 1965 and 1985, the link between mental health and ideals of citizenship was coloured by the public memory of World War II and the German occupation, albeit in completely different, even opposite ways. The memory of the war, and especially the public consideration of its victims, changed drastically in the mid-1960s, and the mental health sector played a crucial role in bringing this change about. The widespread attention to the mental effects of the war that surfaced in the late 1960s after a period of 20 years of public silence should be seen against the backdrop of the combination of democratization and the emancipation of emotions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24594819/"}

Forty-one participants (aged 13-17 years) attended FOXY body mapping workshops in six NWT communities in 2013 then completed interviews regarding the content of their body maps. Thematic analysis was used to identify five themes related to coping strategies: grounding via nature, strength through Indigenous cultures, connection with God and Christian beliefs, expression using the arts, and relationships with social supports. These results can be used to develop culturally relevant, strengths-based, trauma informed interventions that improve coping and resiliency among Northern youth.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29697022/"}

Patients with strong (high lip and high nose ratios) and weak (low lip and low nose ratios) Afrocentric features (i.e., congruent features) had poorer health than patients with incongruent features. Unlike findings for skin color, congruence of features rather than strength predicted health. Congruence predicted perceived unfair treatment in the same manner.

Utilizing data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS6) collected between 2016 and 2021, we examined children aged 5-17 years in four low or middle-low-income countries experiencing war or conflict and compared them to 20 control countries. We employed logistic models to analyze the data, focusing on mental well-being as the outcome. Primary independent variable was exposure to war, with an emphasis on the interaction between this exposure and potential predictors, including age, sex, having a physical disability, enrolled in education, having siblings, living with at least one parent, residence place, and family wealth status. The analysis revealed significant modifications in the association between factors like age, disability, education, economic status, and place of residence and mental well-being due to war (p values < 0.05). Specifically, the impact of war was more pronounced in older children (OR = 1.48, 95%CI = 1.18-1.85) compared to younger ones. Education was found to mitigate anxiety in conflict-affected areas (OR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.60-0.95), whereas children with disabilities were more vulnerable to mental health challenges (OR = 2.05, 95%CI = 1.65-2.55) in these settings. The mental well-being measure was based on caregiver reports, which may not fully capture the children's experiences. Our findings provide crucial insights into the differential impact of war on children's mental well-being. They underscore the need for tailored, context-specific mental health interventions for children in conflict-affected areas and encourage further research into the nuanced effects of war on child and adolescent mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40301826/"}

Utilizing data from the 2020 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), We examine the effects of different dimensions of intergenerational support on the positive and negative emotions of older adults based on the main effect model and the buffer model. Then we employ instrumental variable methods to address key endogeneity concerns. The indirect effect mechanism through which children's economic support influences the mental health of the older adults was examined using a mediation model. In addition, robustness tests and heterogeneity analyses were conducted. The intergenerational support from children has a significant impact on the mental health of older adults. All three types of support contribute to the positive emotions of older adults. In terms of the impact on negative emotions, the regression coefficients for financial support and emotional support are significantly negative, while the direction of the effect of caregiving support is positive. Additionally, financial support promotes the mental health of the older adults by influencing their social participation. Heterogeneity analysis further indicates that the impact of intergenerational support varies across different subpopulations, with rural older adults particularly benefiting from emotional support. Our findings reveal that financial support from adult children enhances older adults' mental health by improving positive emotions and reducing negative emotions, and emotional support from children has a similar effect. However, while caregiving by adult children significantly boosts positive emotions among older adults, long-term caregiving also engenders feelings of guilt, which in turn exacerbates negative emotions and diminishes overall mental health. Our study emphasizes the need to consider Filial Piety Culture, social care support and social participation in order to improve older adults' mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40313498/"}

Data may be compromised in a range of ways. They may be flawed, due to missing or erroneously recorded entries; uncertain, due to differences in how data items are rated or conceptualised; proximate, in that data items are a proxy for key issues of concern; and sparse, in that a low volume of cases within key subgroups may limit the possibility of statistical inference. The term 'FUPS' is proposed to describe these flawed, uncertain, proximate and sparse datasets. Many of the systems that seek to use FUPS data may be characterised as dynamic and complex, involving a wide range of agents whose actions impact on each other in reverberating ways, leading to feedback and adaptation. The literature on the use of routinely collected data in healthcare is often implicitly premised on the availability of high-quality data to be used in complicated but not necessarily complex systems.

The paper explores the use of this FUPS dataset to support meaningful dialogue between key stakeholders, including service providers, funders and users, in relation to outcomes of services. There is a particular focus on the potential for service improvement and learning. The issues raised and principles for practice suggested have relevance for other health communities that similarly face the dilemma of how to address the gap between the ideal of comprehensive clear data used in complicated, but not complex, contexts, and the reality of FUPS data in the context of complexity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29895295/"}

To adapt these interventions for use in other countries, a systematic and tailored approach is required to maintain the logical framework. This study describes the systematic process of selecting and adapting an intervention to improve MHL of Dutch secondary school educational professionals, using Intervention Mapping (IM) Adapt. IM Adapt regards six steps: (1) assess needs and organizational capacity; (2) find evidence-based interventions; (3) plan adaptations; (4) make adaptations; (5) plan for implementation; and (6) plan for evaluation. The outcomes of a needs assessment were used to develop a logic model of the problem and of change, leading to the intervention goal of increasing mental health awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy among end-users. A logic model of the problem and of change visually outlines the relationship between a specific issue, its root causes, and the intended intervention to drive change. The existing evidence-based digital intervention, named LEARN, was identified as the most suitable for addressing these needs. This was done through reviewing the literature and existing intervention databases. Four main content adaptations were made to align with the distinct needs of the Dutch context and the evolving trends within the field of mental health, resulting in LEARN-NL, a digital mental health literacy intervention for Dutch educational professionals. Finally, implementers were identified, and a mixed methods feasibility study was set up. Our findings show that some content adaptations to LEARN were needed to address the needs and (learning) preferences of educational professionals in the Dutch education context, but that the majority of the existing intervention could be upheld. Existing evidence-based MHL interventions for educational professionals are useful as a basis for the adaptation and transfer to other countries. IM Adapt is a valuable framework for the systematic planning of adaptations to a new context while retaining its essential elements.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40898146/"}

Evidence that disaggregates the influence of physical and mental health conditions on educational attainment, using population wide linked administrative data, varies between UK jurisdictions, with a lack of such research evident in Northern Ireland (NI). This study aims to address this gap by investigating the impact of students' physical and mental health on post-primary attainment in NI. This is a pertinent area as the recent Children and Young People's Emotional Health and Wellbeing in Education Framework outlined the need for cross-departmental collaboration between education and health. Using administrative data that linked the household Census (2011), School Leavers Survey (2010-2014) and School Census (2010-2014), this study examines the associations between young people's GCSE attainment, physical health and mental health (n = 61,373). Multilevel models were executed to account for the nested data structure and wider demographic profile of young people. Interaction terms were also tested between factors such as sex, socio-economic background, and physical and mental ill-health markers to determine their effects on attainment. The study confirmed the negative associations between lower post-primary attainment and 'very bad' self-reported health status (d = -1.01, 95% CI: -1.26, -0.75), the presence of a physical health condition (d = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.41, -0.36), mental health condition (d = -0.91, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.82) and an illness/disability that limited daily activity a little (d = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.53, -0.44) or a lot (d = -0.98, 95% CI: -1.04, -0.92). Interaction terms were tested, and significant associations were evident between sex and physical health condition, sex and mental health condition, free school meal eligibility and physical health condition, and the presence of both a physical health condition and mental health condition. This study is the first instance where population wide, linked administrative data is used to examine the associations between educational attainment and students' physical and mental health in NI. The importance of mental health and the greater educational disadvantage some social groups may experience are key implications for policy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40847342/"}

Still, professional help-seeking behavior is not fully understood. To conceive cultural determinants of help-seeking is crucial to reduce personal and social costs of (untreated) mental disorders. The current study investigates mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes in a Cuban (n = 195) and a German (n = 165) sample. In a questionnaire survey we asked for attitudes towards mental illness and professional help-seeking in the general Cuban and German populations. The cultural context was associated with mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes. Interestingly, Cuban participants reported stronger mental health stigma and more willingness to seek help. In multiple hierarchical regression analyses, community attitudes towards the mentally ill significantly predicted help-seeking attitudes, especially in the Cuban sample. Only in the German sample, more negative individual beliefs about mental illness predicted more self-stigma on help-seeking. Beyond that, cultural context moderated the association between mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes with a stronger association between the measures in the German sample. However, gender did not predict help-seeking attitudes and self-stigma on help-seeking and no interactions between community attitudes, cultural context, and gender were found in the prediction of help-seeking attitudes. Similarities and differences between the samples are discussed in the light of the cultural contexts and peculiarities of the current samples.

The aim of this research was to explore the underlying association between these aspects for the better understanding of the effect of psychosocial variables on mental health in cancer. This information could lead to the design of adapted psychological interventions in cancer. Participants with different diagnosis of cancer were recruited (N = 170). They came from the Spanish Association Against Cancer of Biscay. Resilience was measured with the 10 items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, coping with the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and mental health was measured as a global indicator through the SF-12 and the GHQ-12. A structural equation model (SEM) was conducted to test the effects between the constructs. Results showed that resilience and coping were significantly associated. Results reflected an absence of significant correlation between adaptive and disadaptive coping strategies. Resilience was the factor that most correlated with health outcomes (β = -.45, p < .001). However, disadaptive coping strategies did not correlate with resilience or mental health indicators. Findings in this study underscore the positive contribution of high levels of resilience and an adaptive coping on participants´ level of health.

{"id": "32264914", "title": "Bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice by formalizing idiographic theories: a computational model of functional analysis.", "text": "The past decades of research have seen an increase in statistical tools to explore the complex dynamics of mental health from patient data, yet the application of these tools in clinical practice remains uncommon. This is surprising, given that clinical reasoning, e.g., case conceptualizations, largely coincides with the dynamical system approach. We argue that the gap between statistical tools and clinical practice can partly be explained by the fact that current estimation techniques disregard theoretical and practical considerations relevant to psychotherapy. To address this issue, we propose that case conceptualizations should be formalized. We illustrate this approach by introducing a computational model of functional analysis, a framework commonly used by practitioners to formulate case conceptualizations and design patient-tailored treatment. We outline the general approach of formalizing idiographic theories, drawing on the example of a functional analysis for a patient suffering from panic disorder. We specified the system using a series of differential equations and simulated different scenarios; first, we simulated data without intervening in the system to examine the effects of avoidant coping on the development of panic symptomatic. Second, we formalized two interventions commonly used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; exposure and cognitive reappraisal) and subsequently simulated their effects on the system. The first simulation showed that the specified system could recover several aspects of the phenomenon (panic disorder), however, also showed some incongruency with the nature of panic attacks (e.g., rapid decreases were not observed). The second simulation study illustrated differential effects of CBT interventions for this patient. All tested interventions could decrease panic levels in the system. Formalizing idiographic theories is promising in bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice and can help foster more rigorous scientific practices in psychotherapy, through enhancing theory development. More precise case conceptualizations could potentially improve intervention planning and treatment outcomes. We discuss applications in psychotherapy and future directions, amongst others barriers for systematic theory evaluation and extending the framework to incorporate interactions between individual systems, relevant for modeling social learning processes. With this report, we hope to stimulate future efforts in formalizing clinical frameworks.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32264914/"}

The strategic tree algorithm was used to identify the main manifestations of the state of sub-mental health. The back propogation artificial neural network was used to analyze the main manifestations of sub-healthy mental states of three different degrees. A sub-mental health evaluation model was then established to achieve predictive evaluation results. Using classifications from the Scale of Chinese Sub-healthy State, the main manifestations of sub-mental health selected using the strategic tree were F1101 (Do you lack peace of mind?), F1102 (Are you easily nervous when something comes up?), and F1002 (Do you often sigh?). The relative intensity of manifestations of sub-mental health was highest for F1101, followed by F1102, and then F1002. Through study of the neural network, better differentiation could be made between moderate and severe and between mild and severe states of sub-mental health. The differentiation between mild and moderate sub-mental health states was less apparent. Additionally, the sub-mental health state evaluation model, which could be used to predict states of sub-mental health of different individuals, was established using F1101, F1102, F1002, and the mental self-assessment total score. The main manifestations of the state of sub-mental health can be discovered using data mining methods to research and analyze the latent laws and knowledge hidden in research evidence on the state of sub-mental health. The state of sub-mental health of different individuals can be rapidly predicted using the model established here. This can provide a basis for assessment and intervention for sub-mental health.

Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic literature review aimed to synthesise existing research on NGS access barriers experienced by SAs and associations between NGS use and PWB. A comprehensive search was conducted through SAGE, Science Direct, and SCOPUS in August 2022; we included qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies with findings on NGS access and/or associations between NGS use and PWB for SAs in the UK. We employed deductive thematic analysis to explore inhibitors and enablers of access which were then conceptualised through a multidimensional framework. Associations between NGS and PWB were coded inductively and mapped separately. This review is registered on PROSPERO: CRD42022353711. Twenty-six studies were included in the review which varied substantially in their aims, methods, context, and participants. Included studies on NGS grouped SAs within broader demographic categories such as minority ethnic communities or Muslims. Our findings indicate that SAs are disadvantaged in their access to NGS due to numerous intersecting factors including unequal distribution, inadequate transport, racialisation of NGS, and safety concerns. Whilst these findings generally aligned with broader literature on NGS access, certain access barriers and enablers are particularly significant to SA communities. We also identified several dimensions of PWB that are enhanced for SAs through interacting with NGS including overall mental health outcomes, physical wellbeing, and social relatedness.

Former POWs were seen as asocial and potentially subversive and were therefore encouraged to undergo a period of treatment in a Civil Resettlement Unit (CRU) before re-entering civilian life. These units sought to inculcate emotional health, 'good citizenship' and healthy masculinity in a supposedly at-risk population. Ex-POWs were seen as lacking in each of these categories due to the psychopathological environment present in Axis POW camps. POWs needed assistance on their return, lest the social stresses of resettlement result in permanent mental harm. Civil Resettlement was originally conceptualized as the solution to the emergent problem of mentally unwell POWs, but those who devised the programme held that it could be expanded to society as a whole.

An instrumental variable estimation strategy is employed to specifically evaluate the evidence of a causal pathway from psychological distress to risky health behaviours. The results confirm strong within-individual associations between psychological distress and health behaviours. Further evidence supports a causal relationship from psychological distress to health behaviours, though only for men and lifestyle habits. The case for a direct causal pathway is less straightforward when considering dietary habits, and potentially also for women. This lack of clarity suggests at least some of the observed within-individual associations reflect causal effects of psychological distress on risky health behaviours.

Spurred on by the fears of a rising population of older people, overcrowding in mental hospitals, social changes and an awareness of the lack of knowledge of older people's mental illnesses, they and others began to explore further the mental health needs of older people. There was a marked change from a predominant interest in neuropathology in older mental hospital patients to emphasis on the need to provide clinical care and treatment for people in the community. The establishment of the new specialty of geriatric medicine and the inception of the National Health Service gave further impetus to service development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16193625/"}

Adverse climate change events place undue stress on food and health systems, with consequences for human food security and mental health status. Ubiquitous digital devices, such as smartphones, have the potential to manage existing and emerging climate-related crises, given their ability to enable rapid response, instant communication, and knowledge sharing. This scoping review aimed to identify digital apps being used to capture or address climate change impacts on food security and mental health to inform the development of a digital citizen science initiative. A scoping review was conducted using 3 peer-reviewed databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) and manual gray literature searches of relevant organizational (ie, governmental and nonprofit) websites to identify articles and reports published between January 2012 and July 2023. Three separate searches were conducted in each database to identify digital apps focused on climate change and (1) food security, (2) mental health, and (3) food security and mental health. Two reviewers conducted initial screening, with a third reviewer resolving any discrepancies. Articles focused on climate change impacts on wildlife or agriculture (ie, not human food security) were excluded. Full-text screening was conducted for shortlisted articles, and a final data abstraction table was generated, summarizing key app features, contextual factors, and participant involvement. From the 656 records screened, 14 digital apps met the inclusion criteria. The food security apps (n=7, 50%) aimed to capture traditional knowledge to preserve food systems, conduct food security assessments, and aid users in decreasing food insecurity risk. The mental health apps (n=7, 50%) assessed climate change-related stress and provided users with coping strategies following adverse weather events. No digital apps examined the intersection of climate change, food security, and mental health. Key app features included user-to-user communication (n=5, 36%), knowledge databases (n=5, 36%), data collection and analysis (n=3, 21%), gamification (n=1, 7%), and educational resources (n=2, 14%) to address climate change impacts on food security or mental health. In total, 3 approaches to participant involvement were used across studies, including contributory (n=1, 7%), collaborative (n=1, 7%), and cocreative (n=1, 7%) approaches, to ensure the relevance and use of digital apps. Most digital apps identified provided a service to citizens to either prevent adverse climate change-related health impacts or manage these effects following an acute event or a natural disaster. The capacity of ubiquitous digital tools to enable near real-time communication, the involvement of various stakeholder groups, and their ability to share relevant educational resources in a timely manner are important for developing tailored climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies across jurisdictions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39042453/"}

Given higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths experienced by communities of color along with greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors (e.g., unemployment, food insecurity), we expect that the decline in mental health during the pandemic was more pronounced among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, with these groups also having less access to mental health services. We examine two nationally representative US surveys: the 2019 National Household Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,368) and the 2020-2021 Household Pulse Survey (HPS; N = 1,677,238). We find mental health of Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents worsened relative to White respondents during the pandemic, with significant increases in depression and anxiety among racialized minorities compared to Whites. There is also evidence of especially high mental health burden for Black adults around the murder of George Floyd by police and for Asian adults around the murder of six Asian women in Atlanta. White respondents are most likely to receive professional mental health care before and during the pandemic, and Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents demonstrate higher levels of unmet mental health care needs during the pandemic than White respondents. Our results indicate that within the current environment, White adults are at a large and systemic advantage buffering them from unexpected crises-like the COVID-19 pandemic. Without targeted interventions, the long-term social consequences of the pandemic and other co-occurring events (e.g., death of Black and Hispanic people by police) will likely include widening mental health disparities between racial/ethnic groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35318615/"}

Using a difference-in-differences analysis, the authors analyzed the effect of comprehensive parity on spending for mental health and substance abuse services. Increases in spending on mental health and substance abuse services after implementation of Oregon's parity law were almost entirely the result of a general trend observed among individuals with and without parity. Expenditures per enrollee for mental health and substance abuse services attributable to parity were positive, but they did not differ significantly from zero in any of the four plans.

A 2012 e-mental health initiative by the Australian Federal Government (eMHPrac) has sought to address the issue through several strategies, one of which has been to train different health professional workforces in e-mental health (e-MH). The aim of the study was to report on the barriers and enablers of e-MH uptake in a cohort of predominantly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health professionals (21 Indigenous, 5 non-Indigenous) who occupied mainly support or case management roles within their organizations. A 3- or 2-day e-MH training program was followed by up to 5 consultation sessions (mean 2.4 sessions) provided by the 2 trainers. The trainer-consultants provided written reports on each of the 30 consultation sessions for 7 consultation groups. They were also interviewed as part of the study. The written reports and interview data were thematically analyzed by 2 members of the research team. Uptake of e-MH among the consultation group was moderate (22%-30% of participants). There were significant organizational barriers to uptake resulting from procedural and administrative problems, demanding workloads, prohibitive policies, and a lack of fit between the organizational culture and the introduction of new technologies. Personal barriers included participant beliefs about the applicability of e-MH to certain populations, and workers' lack of confidence and skills. However, enthusiastic managers and tech-savvy champions could provide a counter-balance as organizational enablers of e-MH; and the consultation sessions themselves appear to have enhanced skills and confidence, shifted attitudes to new technologies, and seeded a perception that e-MH could be a valuable health education resource. A conclusion from the program was that it was important to match e-MH training and resources to work roles. In the latter stages of the consultation sessions, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health professionals responded very positively to YouTube video clips and apps with a health education dimension. Therapy-oriented apps and programs may fit less well within the scope of practice of some workforces, including this one. We suggest that researchers broaden their focus and definitions of e-MH and give rather more weight to e-MH's health education possibilities. Developing criteria for evaluating apps and YouTube videos may empower a rather greater section of health workforce to use e-MH with their clients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28077347/"}

The objective of this systematic literature review was to examine young peoples' online help-seeking behaviors for mental health concerns. It aimed to summarize young peoples' experiences and identify benefits and limitations of online help-seeking for this age group. It also examined the theoretical perspectives that have been applied to understand online help-seeking. A systematic review of peer-reviewed research papers from the following major electronic databases was conducted: PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. The search was conducted in August 2017. The narrative synthesis approach to reviews was used to analyze the existing evidence to answer the review questions. Overall, 28 studies were included. The most common method of data collection was through the use of surveys. Study quality was moderate to strong. Text-based query via an internet search engine was the most commonly identified help-seeking approach. Social media, government or charity websites, live chat, instant messaging, and online communities were also used. Key benefits included anonymity and privacy, immediacy, ease of access, inclusivity, the ability to connect with others and share experiences, and a greater sense of control over the help-seeking journey. Online help-seeking has the potential to meet the needs of those with a preference for self-reliance or act as a gateway to further help-seeking. Barriers to help-seeking included a lack of mental health literacy, concerns about privacy and confidentiality, and uncertainty about the trustworthiness of online resources. Until now, there has been limited development and use of theoretical models to guide research on online help-seeking. Approaches to improving help-seeking by young people should consider the role of the internet and online resources as an adjunct to offline help-seeking. This review identifies opportunities and challenges in this space. It highlights the limited use of theoretical frameworks to help conceptualize online help-seeking.

It is critical that their attitudes are professional and optimistic. ABSTRACT: Introduction Consumer participation is central to mental health policy. Negative attitudes of health professionals are barriers to realizing policy goals. Evidence suggests consumers (Experts by Experience) can influence positive attitudes in nursing students. Research in this area to date is limited and primarily from Australia and New Zealand. Aim To enhance understanding of nursing students' perspectives and experiences of being taught mental health by an Expert by Experience. Method A qualitative exploratory approach was used. Focus groups were conducted with nursing students from seven universities in Australia and Europe. Data were analysed thematically. Results Student participants described how exposure to Experts by Experience challenged their views and attitudes and provided a mechanism for reflection, critique and change. The main theme \"changing mindset\" includes two subthemes: exposing stereotypes and reflection. Discussion This unique international study demonstrates the capacity for Experts by Experience to contribute to positive attitudinal change towards mental illness in nursing students. This changed mindset must occur for policy goals to be realized. Implications for practice Nurses in all areas of practice will work with people labelled with mental illness and experiencing mental distress. Overcoming stereotypes and adopting more positive attitudes is essential to deliver quality mental health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31220380/"}

Accordingly, it is imperative to find and implement cost and time-effective interventions to mitigate the consequences of this transition. Intervention research has shown mental contrasting is an effective means of promoting various health-enhancing behaviors including physical activity. However, the efficacy of this intervention approach may be bolstered by targeting affective judgments (e.g., enjoyable-unenjoyable), which exert greater influence on physical activity behaviors compared to health-related instrumental judgments (e.g., useful-useless). The purpose of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of a mental contrasting intervention that targeted affective judgments associated with physical activity, in relation to a mental contrasting intervention that targeted instrumental judgments, and a \"standard\" mental contrasting intervention (with no modifications). Using a 3-arm parallel randomized controlled trial design (ClinicalTrials.gov Number NCT02615821), 110 insufficiently active, female, university students were randomly assigned to an affective, instrumental, or standard mental contrasting intervention following simple randomization procedures. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 4 weeks postintervention. Participants in the affective mental contrasting condition displayed higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than those in the instrumental or standard comparison conditions, F(2, 90) = 3.14, p < .05, ηp2 = 0.065. Overall, affective mental contrasting has the potential to represent a low-cost and time-efficient intervention that may help insufficiently active, female students increase activity or attenuate declining levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that occurs during university.

However, the concept of stickiness, as put forward by scholars Chip and Dan Heath, is more than a fancy new term for salience. Rather, stickiness is defined in a way that recognizes the last several decades of research in the cognitive and social sciences on how people think about complex social issues. In this article, we argue that stickiness is an empirical pursuit, one that requires an accretion of methods from across the cognitive and social sciences but which, if pursued systematically, can contribute significantly to public understanding. Drawing from the FrameWorks Institute's development of Strategic Frame Analysis, we demonstrate how our methods can be used to pursue stickiness and with what effects. Applying this approach to the issue of child mental health, we demonstrate why approaches that posit resonance or salience are likely to prove ineffective in helping the public to prioritize prevention and treatment for child mental illness or promotion of child mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24826821/"}

Finally, the paper emphasizes Viktor Frankl's cure and Wong's integrative meaning therapy. It concludes that integrative meaning therapy represents the future of psychotherapy, because it is situated in the area of interactions of at least three traditions: Clinical psychology, existential psychology, and positive psychology.

This article presents the findings of a pre- and postevaluation which was employed to explore the effectiveness of the 5-day intensive mental health Master Class programme on student's mental health learning and their understanding of the role of a mental health nurse. The findings highlighted that prior to participating in the Master Class, there was a significant sense of uncertainty associated with perceived levels of competence required within the profession of mental health nursing. This was coupled with students expressing they wanted to disengage with the profession even before they had commenced any theory or clinical experience.

Due to efficiency and reach, internet-based interventions for informal caregivers have the potential to mitigate the negative mental health outcomes associated with caregiving. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the impact of internet-based interventions on caregiver mental health outcomes and the impact of different types of internet-based intervention programs. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and AgeLine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials published from January 1995 to April 2017 that compared internet-based intervention programs with no or minimal internet-based interventions for caregivers of adults with at least 1 chronic condition. The inclusion criteria were studies that included (1) adult informal caregivers (aged 18 years or older) of adults living in the community with a chronic condition; (2) an internet-based intervention program to deliver education, support, or monitoring to informal caregivers; and (3) outcomes of mental health. Title and abstract and full-text screening were completed in duplicate. Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer, and risk of bias assessments were completed accordingly. Where possible, data for mental health outcomes were meta-analyzed. The search yielded 7923 unique citations of which 290 studies were screened at full-text. Of those, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria; 11 were randomized controlled trials, 1 study was a controlled clinical trial, and 1 study comprised both study designs. Beneficial effects of any internet-based intervention program resulted in a mean decrease of 0.48 points (95% CI -0.75 to -0.22) for stress and distress and a mean decrease of 0.40 points (95% CI -0.58 to -0.22) for anxiety among caregivers. For studies that examined internet-based information and education plus professional psychosocial support, the meta-analysis results showed small to medium beneficial effect sizes of the intervention for the mental health outcomes of depression (-0.34; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.05) and anxiety (-0.36; 95% CI -0.66 to -0.07). Some suggestion of a beneficial effect on overall health for the use of information and education plus combined peer and professional support was also shown (1.25; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25). Overall, many studies were of poor quality and were rated at high risk of bias. The review found evidence for the benefit of internet-based intervention programs on mental health for caregivers of adults living with a chronic condition, particularly for the outcomes of caregiver depression, stress and distress, and anxiety. The types of interventions that predominated as efficacious included information and education with or without professional psychological support, and, to a lesser extent, with combined peer and psychological support. Further high-quality research is needed to inform the effectiveness of interactive, dynamic, and multicomponent internet-based interventions.

Only original research papers, published between 2004 and 2014, peer-reviewed, non-qualitative research, and reporting on associations between economic factors and proxies of mental health were considered. One-hundred-one papers met the inclusion criteria. The evidence was consistent that economic recessions and mediators such as unemployment, income decline, and unmanageable debts are significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing, increased rates of common mental disorders, substance-related disorders, and suicidal behaviours. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the selected investigations, we conclude that periods of economic recession are possibly associated with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, including common mental disorders, substance disorders, and ultimately suicidal behaviour. Most of the research is based on cross-sectional studies, which seriously limits causality inferences.

Although researchers assessed the effect of isolated design elements on the results of Web-based interventions and the associations between symptom reduction and use of components across computer and mobile phone platforms, there remains uncertainty with regard to which components of technology-mediated interventions for mental health exert the greatest therapeutic gain. Until now, no studies have presented results on the therapeutic benefit associated with specific service components of technology-mediated MHIS for depression. This systematic review aims at identifying components of technology-mediated MHIS for patients with depression. Consequently, all randomized controlled trials comparing technology-mediated treatments for depression to either waiting-list control, treatment as usual, or any other form of treatment for depression were reviewed. Updating prior reviews, this study aims to (1) assess the effectiveness of technology-supported interventions for the treatment of depression and (2) add to the debate on what components in technology-mediated MHIS for the treatment of depression should be standard of care. Systematic searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Effect sizes for each comparison between a technology-enabled intervention and a control condition were computed using the standard mean difference (SMD). Chi-square tests were used to test for heterogeneity. Using subgroup analysis, potential sources of heterogeneity were analyzed. Publication bias was examined using visual inspection of funnel plots and Begg's test. Qualitative data analysis was also used. In an explorative approach, a list of relevant components was extracted from the body of literature by consensus between two researchers. Of 6387 studies initially identified, 45 met all inclusion criteria. Programs analyzed showed a significant trend toward reduced depressive symptoms (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.45, P<.001). Heterogeneity was large (I2≥76). A total of 15 components were identified. Technology-mediated MHIS for the treatment of depression has a consistent positive overall effect compared to controls. A total of 15 components have been identified. Further studies are needed to quantify the impact of individual components on treatment effects and to identify further components that are relevant for the design of future technology-mediated interventions for the treatment of depression and other mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566267/"}

Participation restrictions are impaired capacities which not allow context or role requirements to be fulfilled. There are many instruments to measure capacities, such as the Mini-ICF-APP which was especially developed for mental disorders. As most mental disorders are chronic illnesses which lead to participation restrictions they must be conceptualized as mental disabilities.

Evidence demonstrates the link between perinatal mental health and maternal and child outcomes. Indigenous Australian maternal and child health and wellbeing outcomes remain unacceptably poor across all measured parameters and reported psychological distress and child removal rates are increasing. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the effectiveness, validity, reliability, and cultural safety of the EPDS in the Indigenous Australian context and identify the availability and suitability of any adaptations. The EPDS has not been validated for use with Indigenous Australian women. The findings and limitations identified in this review are consistent with concerns in other countries about the cross-cultural use of the EPDS and its sensitivity in predicting risk for postnatal depression amongst Indigenous women. Where adaptations of the EPDS have been used there has been no psychometric and cultural validation beyond the remote communities in which they were developed.

In addition, we discussed the requirements for high school students' mental health support system. The subjects were 3,312 students and 208 teachers in four Shizuoka prefectural public high schools in 2009. University Personality Inventory (UPI) is usually conducted to assess university students' mental state and is a questionnaire that high school students can answer easily. Therefore, we adopted UPI for this survey. UPI was composed of 56 unhealthy and 4 healthy condition items. High school students completed the UPI and determined the sum of unhealthy condition items; a higher score indicated a poorer mental health status. The average UPI score of all students (n = 3,312) was 12.7 points, and that of females (n = 1,217)was 15.2 points, which was significantly higher than the 11.3 points of males (n = 2,095). Those with scores > or = 30 points (7.5%), which was more than half of the maximum score, were designated as the High Score (HS) group and considered to have poor mental health. Those with scores of > or = 40 (1.4%) seemed to have very poor mental health, and there was concern that they may be suffering from psychosis. Our observations indicated that HS students were likely to avoid seeking help regarding mental health issues, which was especially true for male HS students. The majority of students chose their friends and parents as advisers, but HS students were significantly more likely to choose advisers who were engaged in jobs related to medical work. Students in both the HS and non-HS groups who did not wish to consult anyone else about their mental conditions wanted to be approached by those around them. High school teachers hesitated to intervene with mentally disturbed students and attempted to resolve problems within the school. Thus, it appears necessary for families, school teachers, and psychiatrists to build closer relations with each other to promote mental health among high school students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24167964/"}

The objective of this study is to assess the status of mental and neurological research in Latin American countries and identify the main difficulties encountered in conducting research, publishing results, and shaping health policies, interventions, and programs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 key informants from 13 Latin American countries. Participants reported that production of mental and neurological research in Latin American countries is low. Lack of financial and human resources, including lack of support from government agencies, were identified as the main factors contributing to the dearth of local research. The few research projects that do take place in Latin American countries are often funded at researchers' personal expense. Few policies, interventions, or programs are generated from research results. To address these deficiencies, participants called for training in research methodology, mechanisms for identifying funding opportunities, and greater recognition of their research products. Researchers and stakeholders recognize the need to mobilize local and international efforts aimed at strengthening research capacity and results implementation. This will lead to an overall optimization of mental and neurological research in the region.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19142407/"}

Codifying qualitative data from publicly available U.S. Defense Health Agency and U.S. Service Branch doctrine, policy guidance, and concepts of operations, our findings indicate that the psychological health care system is strongly process-oriented and mentions a variety of key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities in the enterprise.

The current service configuration, with distinct Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) and Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS), is considered a weak link where the care pathway needs to be most robust. Our aim was to delineate transitional policies and care across Europe and to highlight current gaps in care provision at the service interface. An online mapping survey was conducted across all 28 European Countries using a bespoke instrument: The Standardized Assessment Tool for Mental Health Transition (SATMEHT). The survey was directed at expert(s) in each of the 28 EU countries. The response rate was 100%. Country experts commonly (12/28) reported that between 25 and 49% of CAMHS service users will need transitioning to AMHS. Estimates of the percentage of AMHS users aged under 30 years who had has previous contact with CAMHS were most commonly in the region 20-30% (33% on average).Written policies for managing the interface were available in only four countries and half (14/28) indicated that no transition support services were available. This is the first survey of CAMHS transitional policies and care carried out at a European level. Policymaking on transitional care clearly needs special attention and further elaboration.

However, the influence of built environment (BE) factors on the mental well-being of older individuals varies across different geographical regions. This comprehensive systematic review synthesizes research on the association between BE elements and the mental health (MH) of the older adult population. A pool of 2938 studies were reviewed, with 21 studies meeting the inclusion criteria: 17 cross-sectional studies and 4 longitudinal studies. Most of these investigations were conducted in Asian countries and published within the last five years. The findings reveal that the GDS-15 scale is the most commonly used tool for assessing MH outcomes. We have established a quantifiable evaluation framework for BE elements, addressing the limitations of previous studies that relied on subjective perception measurements. Furthermore, a higher proportion of green spaces, improved facility accessibility, and shorter travel times and distances to destinations are positively linked with better MH of older adults. While these associations are becoming increasingly evident, research on the effects of density, diversity, and design elements in relation to older adults' MH remains limited and may varied significantly across different regions. Future research should focus on designing quasi-natural experimental studies to enhance our understanding of the convoluted and elaborate relationship between the BE and MH.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40672928/"}

Current technology platforms delivering interventions are largely mobile apps and online websites, although efforts have been made to create more personalized and embodied technology experiences. To extend and improve on these platforms, the field of robotics has been increasingly included in conversations of how to deliver technology-assisted, interactive, and responsive mental health and psychological well-being interventions. Socially assistive robots (SARs) are robotic technology platforms with audio, visual, and movement capabilities that are being developed to interact with individuals socially while also assisting them with management of their physical and psychological well-being. However, little is known about the empirical evidence or utility of using SARs in mental health interventions. The review synthesizes and describes the nascent empirical literature of SARs in mental health research and identifies strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in future research and practice. Searches in Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore yielded 12 studies included in the final review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstract and full-text reviews were conducted by two authors independently. This systematic review of the literature found 5 distinct SARs used in research to investigate the potential for this technology to address mental health and psychological well-being outcomes. Research on mental health applications of SARs focuses largely on elderly dementia patients and relies on usability pilot data with methodological limitations. The current SARs research in mental health use is limited in generalizability, scope, and measurement of psychological outcomes. Opportunities for expansion of research in this area include diversifying populations studied, SARs used, clinical applications, measures used, and settings for those applications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342908/"}

To train health care professionals in technology, serious gaming concepts such as educational escape rooms are increasingly used, which could also possibly be used in mental health care. However, such serious-game concepts are scarcely available for eMH training for mental health care professionals. This study aims to co-design an escape room for training mental health care professionals' eMH skills and test the escape room's usability by exploring their experiences with this concept as a training method. This project used a research through design approach with 3 design stages. In the first stage, the purpose, expectations, and storylines for the escape room were formulated in 2 co-design sessions with mental health care professionals, game designers, innovation staff, and researchers. In the second stage, the results were translated into the first escape room, which was tested in 3 sessions, including one web version of the escape room. In the third stage, the escape room was tested with mental health care professionals outside the co-design team. First, 2 test sessions took place, followed by 3 field study sessions. In the field study sessions, a questionnaire was used in combination with focus groups to assess the usability of the escape room for eMH training in practice. An escape room prototype was iteratively developed and tested by the co-design team, which delivered multiple suggestions for adaptations that were assimilated in each next version of the prototype. The field study showed that the escape room creates a positive mindset toward eMH. The suitability of the escape room to explore the possibilities of eMH was rated 4.7 out of 5 by the professionals who participated in the field study. In addition, it was found to be fun and educational at the same time, scoring 4.7 (SD 0.68) on a 5-point scale. Attention should be paid to the game's complexity, credibility, and flexibility. This is important for the usefulness of the escape room in clinical practice, which was rated an average of 3.8 (SD 0.77) on a 5-point scale. Finally, implementation challenges should be addressed, including organizational policy and stimulation of eMH training. We can conclude that the perceived usability of an escape room for training mental health care professionals in eMH skills is promising. However, it requires additional effort to transfer the learnings into mental health care professionals' clinical practice. A straightforward implementation plan and testing the effectiveness of an escape room on skill enhancement in mental health care professionals are essential next steps to reach sustainable goals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39773391/"}

Thirty correctional officers (COs) were recruited to participate in a remote MHFA intervention study. The COs were divided into three MHFA training sessions, with no more than 10 COs per group. Data collection assessments included pretest and posttest surveys and a focus group meeting. Of the 30 eligible CO participants, 27 completed the study, including follow-up assessments. Nine COs participated in a focus group meeting-one third (<i>n</i> = 9) of the CO participants identified as female, and the remaining identified as male. Most CO participants self-identified as White (<i>n</i> = 17), and two thirds (<i>n</i> = 18) of the CO participants were 35-54 years old. There was a strong military influence, with about close to half (48%) of COs identifying as a veteran. A paired sample t test was used to analyze whether there were any differences in mental health knowledge scores from pre- and postintervention. There were no significant differences between the pre- and postintervention results for the five MHFA knowledge items. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze differences in pre- and postintervention data for mental health referral items. From pre- to posttraining, COs reported that it would be easier to make a mental health referral for someone experiencing a mental health challenge (<i>Z</i> = -2.087, <i>p</i> = .037). At 12 weeks, COs referred 2.6 (<i>SD</i>: 4.30, range 1-20) people incarcerated for mental health services. The reasons for referral included: \"suicidal thoughts,\" \"experiencing anxiety over being incarcerated during COVID,\" and \"considering self-harm.\" A phenomenological approach was used to analyze the focus group meeting. The themes identified were: (a) COs experience with MHFA training was viewed positively (facilitators); (b) there is a need to improve mental wellness in correctional settings (barriers); and (c) mental health referral process for incarcerated individuals needs enhancement when implementing MHFA (barriers). MHFA training for COs is necessary to equip COs with the skills to safely support and refer incarcerated people experiencing a mental health crisis.

The scientific literature so far is inconclusive, although in the short term, involuntary hospitalization has benefits. This review has also shown that involuntary hospitalization can have adverse long-term consequences for the patient-therapist allegiance. We conclude that in some cases, involuntary treatment can save lives of young patients with anorexia nervosa; however, in other cases, it can break the psychotherapeutic relationship and make the patient abandon treatment. It is the clinician who has to decide for whom and when to approve involuntary treatment or not.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660351/"}

However, culture remains disconnected from theory, research, training, assessment, and interventions in developmental psychopathology, limiting our understanding of the genesis and epigenesis of mental health. Cultural development and psychopathology research can help overcome this limitation by focusing on the elucidation of cultural risk, protective, and promotive factors, at the individual and social levels, that initiate, derail, or maintain trajectories of normal and abnormal behavior. The goal of this Special Issue is to showcase research on the association between culture, development, and psychopathology that investigates equifinality and multifinality in cultural development, the interplay between culture and biology, cultural assessment and interventions, and cultural differences and similarities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30451138/"}

Within the region, the contributing factors to this conundrum include inadequate infrastructure, severe underfunding and a strong adherence to masculine culture. However, there is a lack of studies exploring the effects of masculine culture on the mental health of males, particularly Black African males. The current study aimed to explore the effects of masculine culture on the mental health of Northern Sotho male youth. The study was grounded in a qualitative research approach, an interpretive research paradigm and an exploratory research design. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the sample. Data was collected through individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews and analyzed using qualitative content analysis through the lens of gender role conflict theory.  RESULTS: The findings revealed that the participants' understanding of masculine culture was centred on the intersectionality of social processes and cultural ideologies. Furthermore, the study revealed that Northern Sotho male youth value masculine ethos; however, this can have negative consequences as failure to meet these expectations may lead to gender role conflict (GRC) and consequently mental health difficulties. Additionally, the study also discovered that in trying to cope with the mental health difficulties, maladaptive mechanisms were adopted. Future studies should include Black male youth from other ethnic groups for a more comprehensive understanding and tracking of the long-term intersectional trajectory of masculine culture and mental health difficulties among men. The current study provided valuable insight regarding the effects of masculine culture on the mental health of Northern Sotho male youth and underscored the need for culturally sensitive, context-specific awareness campaigns, and targeted interventions to raise awareness and help educate males on the long-term negative implications that masculine culture may have on their mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40468440/"}

Few studies have used longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional data to investigate the mental health benefits of bird diversity. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between bird diversity and mental health at the national level using a unique repeated cross-sectional dataset. I used repeated cross-sectional health data from the German National Cohort health study, collected between March, 2014, and September, 2019, and annual bird citizen science data to investigate the effects of bird-diversity exposure on mental health. Mental health was measured using the summary score of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module 9 (SumPHQ) and the Short Form Health Survey-12 Mental Health Component Scale. As a proxy for bird diversity, I created a unique indicator called reporting-rate richness and combined it with the health data. Reporting-rate richness measures the number of bird species within postcode areas across Germany in probabilities while accounting for variation in survey efforts. Alternative indicators of bird diversity, such as bird-species richness or abundance, were also calculated. Associations between bird diversity and mental health were estimated using linear regression with region and time fixed effects, adjusted for a range of sociodemographic and environmental confounders and spatial autocorrelation. Interaction terms between income levels and reporting-rate richness were also analysed to examine the moderating effect of socioeconomic status. I did the analyses for an unbalanced (n=176 362) and balanced (n=125 423) dataset, with the balanced dataset comprising only regions (postcode areas) in which health data were available for each year. The linear fixed-effects regression analysis indicated a significant negative association between reporting-rate richness and SumPHQ, as observed in both the unbalanced dataset (β -0·02, p=0·017) and the balanced dataset (β -0·03, p=0·0037). Similarly, regression results with both datasets showed a positive relationship between reporting-rate richness and Mental Health Component Scale (MCS; unbalanced β 0·02, p=0·0086; balanced β 0·03, p=0·0018). The moderator analyses revealed a significant influence of socioeconomic status on the relationship between reporting-rate richness and mental health. The robustness of these findings was confirmed through sensitivity analyses. The results suggest that a greater likelihood of having many different bird species in a person's area of residence might positively contribute to mental health, especially for people with lower socioeconomic status. These findings could have implications for biodiversity conservation and health policy decisions, as governments are facing challenges such as global biodiversity loss and growing public mental health problems.

Our review found spiritual support, resilience, collective culture, and culturally congruent support as facilitators of positive mental health of black people in Canada, while stigmatization, misconceptions, low uptake of mental services, and difficulties accessing mental health services were the most significant barriers. Strategies for improving the mental health of black people in Canada center on social, emotional, and community support.

We used the Job Satisfaction Survey to assess job satisfaction. Our conceptual framework integrated numerous independent variables adapted from the input-mediator-output-input (IMOI) model and the Integrated Team Effectiveness Model (ITEM). The structural equation model predicted 47% of the variance of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was associated with eight variables: strong team support, participation in the decision-making process, closer collaboration, fewer conflicts among team members, modest knowledge production (team processes), firm affective commitment, multifocal identification (emergent states) and belonging to the nursing profession (provider characteristics). Team climate had an impact on six job satisfaction variables (team support, knowledge production, conflicts, affective commitment, collaboration, and multifocal identification). Results show that team processes and emergent states were mediators between job satisfaction and team climate.

We also investigated if the impact varies by the regional origin and examined potential factors for joint decision-making. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Korean National Survey of Multicultural Families 2015 and logistic regression. We analyzed data from 11,188 married immigrant women ages 20 to 59 who were originally from East Asia or Southeast/South Asia and co-living with their spouses. We defined households as joint-decision, wife-decision, or husband-decision based on who decides how living expenses are spent. Mental well-being encompassed a depressive mood for two consecutive weeks, and life and marital satisfaction. After controlling for covariates, we showed that immigrant women in husband-decision households were more likely to have depressive mood (odds ratio [OR] 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.38), poorer life satisfaction (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.24-1.78), and poorer marital satisfaction (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47-2.22) than women in joint-decision households. Immigrant women in wife-decision households had a similar but slightly lower odds of poor mental well-being. This association was less prominent for Southeast/South Asian origin than East Asian origin, while the age-adjusted prevalence rates of poor mental well-being among them were higher than their East Asian counterparts. Factors that restricted the odds of husband-decision did not necessarily guarantee wife-decision. This study suggests one-sided decision-making can be a risk factor for immigrant women's poor mental well-being, while joint decision-making is protective. Differences across regional origins suggest domestic decision-making might be a less important predictor for mental well-being in immigrants more occupied with adapting to the host society. Factors for joint decision-making should be addressed to improve the mental well-being of immigrant women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35192668/"}

However, many young people experience a significant disruption of their care during this transition, whilst others may fail to transition at all. Currently, there is no systematic appraisal of the international evidence regarding the outcomes of young people after transition. A systematic review was conducted which aimed to synthesise and review the existing research regarding outcomes after transition. We searched six databases from their inception until December 2017 for research relating to either the mental health or service use outcomes of young people after reaching their CAMHS age boundary. Results were synthesised narratively. The initial searches identified 18,287 papers, of which 213 were screened on full text. 13 papers were included in the review, representing 10 cohorts of young people who crossed the transition age boundary. No studies contained extractable data on mental health outcomes following transition, and therefore, this review focused only on service use outcomes. Results showed a quarter of young people transitioned to AMHS, with the other young people experiencing varied outcomes after leaving CAMHS and multiple transitions during this time. This review provides evidence for the varying service use outcomes of young people after reaching the upper age limit of CAMHS.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a cognitive skills programme (Reasoning and Rehabilitation 2: Short Version for Adults [R&R2]) among offenders with mental illness. Our first hypothesis was that participation in this programme would result in significantly greater improvement in antisocial attitudes than among similar prisoners who did not participate; both groups received \"treatment as usual\" (TAU). Our second hypothesis was that those receiving R&R2 would show less post-treatment violent or general recidivism than those receiving TAU alone. Incarcerated offenders with serious mental illness (N = 101) were randomly assigned to R&R2 or TAU alone. Criminal attitudes and mental state were examined before and after treatment. Violent and non-violent recidivism was measured, on average, 18 months after release. In both intervention and TAU alone trial arms, there were significant pre- to post-treatment changes in criminal attitudes and symptoms or signs of mental disorder. There was no difference between groups in these respects. These pre/post changes were not associated with reductions in recidivism over time, whether or not controlling for baseline risk. Although there was no demonstrable advantage of R&R2 over TAU alone, non-significant trends towards lower violent recidivism in the R&R2 group and general recidivism in the TAU group suggest that it may be worth repeating the trial in a larger sample with more differentiated control groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732624/"}

The context of the review is acute adult mental healthcare settings with no restriction on geographical location. The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. The databases searched include CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Embase. A gray literature search included ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Mednar and Google Scholar. Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity before inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). The standardized data extraction tool from the JBI-QARI was used to extract data from the papers. Qualitative research findings were pooled using the JBI-QARI. This involved the aggregation of findings to generate a set of statements that represented that aggregation, through assembling the findings rated according to their quality and categorizing these findings by similarity in meaning. These categories were then subjected to a meta-synthesis to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Four studies were included in the systematic review. Two studies each from both groups' perspective. These experiences were combined in one synthesis to look at the issues from mutual perspectives. A total of 40 findings were extracted from these four studies. The findings were grouped into 10 categories and five synthesized findings were developed.

ICHBs included smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, and healthy diet adherence. Mental health included low mood, irritability, nervousness, and sleep difficulties, while well-being included life satisfaction and self-reported health. Multi-regression analyses were performed. The study included 12,934 adolescents (mean age: 13.6 ± 1.6 years). Non-smokers, non-overweight individuals, and physically active participants were more likely to report good mental health, higher life satisfaction, and better self-reported health. Adherence to a healthy diet was linked to improved self-reported health and greater life satisfaction. Compared to those with four ICHBs (reference), adolescents with only one ICHB had higher odds of feeling low (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13-0.62), irritability (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19-0.66), nervousness (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.13-0.55), and sleep difficulties (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14-0.61).

This article presents the development and psychometric evaluation of the Mental Help Seeking Attitudes Scale (MHSAS), designed to measure respondents' overall evaluation (unfavorable vs. favorable) of their seeking help from a mental health professional. In Study 1 (N = 857 United States adults), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory (IRT) analysis were used to identify an optimal set of 9 items that demonstrated initial evidence of internal consistency, unidimensionality, and strong measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) across gender, past help-seeking experience, and psychological distress. Initial convergent evidence of validity was demonstrated via theoretically anticipated relationships between the MHSAS and key variables in the help-seeking nomological network (e.g., subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intention, public stigma, self-stigma, anticipated risks and benefits, gender, previous help seeking). Initial incremental evidence of validity was demonstrated when the MHSAS demonstrated the ability to account for unique variance in help-seeking intention, beyond that accounted for by the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form scale (ATSPPH-SF) and the Psychological Openness subscale of the Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS-PO). Study 2 (N = 207 United States adults at Times 1 and 2) provided initial evidence of test-retest reliability over a 3-week period. The MHSAS offers mental health professionals a new tool for measuring attitudes that may avoid limitations of current help seeking-attitudes measures (e.g., construct-irrelevant variance).

Various pathways through which climate change can impact mental health have been theorised, but the impacts themselves remain understudied. In this article we applied psychological methods to examine if climate change is affecting individuals' mental health in the Small Island Developing State of Tuvalu, a Pacific Island nation regarded as exceptionally vulnerable to climate change. We determined the presence of psychological distress and associated impairment attributed to two categories of climate change-related stressors in particular: 1) local environmental impacts caused or exacerbated by climate change, and 2) hearing about global climate change and contemplating its future implications. The findings draw on data collected in a mixed-method study involving 100 Tuvaluan participants. Data were collected via face-to-face structured interviews that lasted 45 min on average and were subjected to descriptive, correlational, and between-group analyses. The findings revealed participants' experiences of distress in relation to both types of stressor, and demonstrated that a high proportion of participants are experiencing psychological distress at levels that reportedly cause them impairment in one or more areas of daily life. The findings lend weight to the claim that climate change represents a risk to mental health and obliges decision-makers to consider these risks when conceptualizing climate-related harms or tallying the costs of inaction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32485590/"}

Data from 3175 Dutch adults were linked to accessibility and availability measures of green spaces at three time points (2004/2011/2014). Mental health was measured with the Mental Health Inventory-5. Fixed effects analyses were performed to assess the effect of changes in green spaces on mental health. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data showed significant associations between Euclidean distances to the nearest green space and mental health, with an increase of 100 m correlating with a lower mental health score of approximately 0.5 (95% CI -0.87 to -0.12) on a 0-100 scale. Fixed effects models showed no evidence for associations between changes in green spaces and changes in mental health both for the entire sample as well as for those that did not relocate during follow-up. Despite observed cross-sectional correlations between the accessibility of green space in the residential environment and mental health, no evidence was found for an association between changes in green spaces and changes in mental health.

Using scientific evidence, she described the benefits of mindfulness and then invited us to try it and decide for ourselves. Charity was a superb teacher, who knew how to impart knowledge skillfully, and a brilliant lawyer, who could present and defend her case exceptionally well. In fact, \"Charity Scott owned the subject matter so deeply that she was able to engage lawyers who otherwise would never have given the concept of mindfulness any credence in a million years.

This article is drawn from work done by the ZERO TO THREE Task Force developing the DC:0-5 Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood, specifically dealing with eating disorders in the first 5 years of life. The proposed changes come from both reviewing major studies and reviews published in the last 10 years and reports from clinicians collected through surveys commissioned by the Task Force. The main changes that are proposed include changes in terminology, such as Eating Disorders instead of Feeding Behavior Disorders, as well as focusing on the child's observed eating symptoms rather than on classifying the eating problems by inferred etiologies. Another major change relates to the differentiation between eating disorders that are observed beyond any specific caregiver-child relationship context and those that are confined to one specific relationship. A new category, Overeating Disorder, has been added, as it has been increasingly recognized as a significant and not rare clinical condition. Two illustrative cases are described.

This has led to increased demand for healthcare services, but mental health outcomes may also be particularly sensitive to the availability of social services. This paper examines the variation in the absolute and relative amounts that high-income countries spend on healthcare and social services to determine whether increased expenditure on social services relative to healthcare expenditure might be associated with better mental health outcomes. This paper estimates the association between patterns of government spending and population mental health, as measured by the death rate resulting from mental and behavioural disorders, across member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We use country-level repeated measures multivariable modelling for the period from 1995 to 2016 with region and time effects, adjusted for total spending and demographic and economic characteristics. Healthcare spending includes all curative services, long-term care, ancillary services, medical goods, preventative care and administration whilst social spending consists of all transfer payments made to individuals and families as part of the welfare state. We find that a higher ratio of social to healthcare expenditure is associated with significantly better mental health outcomes for OECD populations, as measured by the death rate resulting from mental and behavioural disorders. We also find that there is no statistically significant association between healthcare spending and population mental health when we do not control for social spending. This study suggests that OECD countries can have a significant impact on population mental health by investing a greater proportion of total expenditure in social services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32216782/"}

The aim of this study is to explore the influences on and patterns in help-seeking for mental health concerns among transition-aged youth who attend postsecondary schools in Canada. A qualitative research design was used, involving 12 semistructured focus groups with transition-aged youth (17-29 years) who attended postsecondary schools in Canada. A thematic analysis was conducted to code the transcripts and develop themes. Four main themes and subthemes regarding the process and experience of help-seeking were generated: (1) the influence of formal service providers (accessibility and experiences), (2) the influence of social factors (system navigation and stigma), (3) the influence of health literacy (symptom recognition, acting on symptoms, digital tools and the internet, and mental health awareness campaigns), and (4) the influence of low-intensity sources of support, namely, self-help. Transition-aged youth seek help for mental health problems in different ways. Despite efforts to improve access to mental health services, transition-aged youth continue to face barriers to accessing these services, especially formal sources of support. The factors identified in this study that either hinder or facilitate help-seeking have pragmatic implications for developing help-seeking interventions and delivering mental health services for this population. In addition to other facilitators, family physicians are an important resource in the help-seeking process. Furthermore, digital help-seeking tools have unique characteristics that may make them an important source of support for transition-aged youth.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33016882/"}

This is a 3-day nationally devised training programme delivered via an innovative co-production model (i.e. co-delivery and partnership working with service users who have lived experience). This paper provides quantitative and qualitative information on the effectiveness of training delivery and also serves to provide some insight into the impact of service-user involvement via such a co-production model. Information on 162 participants using the Knowledge and Understanding Framework bespoke questionnaire (Personality Disorder Knowledge, Attitudes and Skills Questionnaire) suggests that the training can be effectively delivered by and within a local NHS Mental Health Trust. Results immediately post-training suggest an improvement in levels of understanding and capability efficacy and a reduction in negative emotional reactions. Indications from a 3-month follow-up suggest that while understanding and emotional reaction remain improved, capability efficacy regresses back to pre-training levels, suggesting the need for ongoing supervision and/or support to consolidate skills.

However, the specific stressors inherent in end-of-life (EOL) care and their relation with the mental health of these professionals, remain inadequately explored. This study seeks to examine the respective roles of various stressors encountered by PC professionals and their associations with mental health. Additionally, it aims to elucidate the relationships between specific psychosocial factors (psychological resources or work environment perceptions) and mental health within the context of stress associated with PC. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed to PC professionals in France (e.g., doctors, nurses, care assistants, psychologists). The questionnaire contained measures of stress experienced in the last 6 months (personal, professional, or EOL); measures of mental health; and measures of psychosocial factors (perceptions of work environment and psychological resources). Three hundred and seventy-nine participants completed the entire questionnaire in November 2022. Among the various stress factors assessed, the accumulation of EOL care emerged as a robustly linked stressor to poorer mental health. In this specific context of EOL care stress, self-compassion and psychological flexibility are significantly related to well-being and mental health, even when other psychosocial factors related to the work environment are statistically controlled. This study is the first to highlight the main stressor affecting the well-being of PC professionals - the accumulation of EOL care - along with the key resources - psychological flexibility and self-compassion - that are associated with their well-being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40148246/"}

The prevalence of common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in the general population of Nigeria is comparatively low. Prevalence data of mental disorders in slum settings in Nigeria is sparse. There is a need to better understand the relationship between protective factors and the occurrence of common mental disorders in the Nigerian slum context. This study aimed to describe the relationship between protective factors and the occurrence of common mental disorders among female urban slum dwellers in Ibadan, Nigeria. A cross sectional household survey of 550 women was conducted in slum settlements in Ibadan, Nigeria. Interviewer administered questionnaires were completed to elicit information on protective factors (social connectedness, self-esteem, social support, resilience) and common mental disorders (depression, anxiety and stress). The DASS-21 was used to measure common mental disorders and protective factors were measured using the Social Connectedness Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Resilience scale and the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale. A multivariable logistic regression model was employed to examine associations while adjusting for relevant confounders. Common mental disorders were reported by 14.0% of the respondents. Resilience and social support were found to be protective against reporting symptoms of common mental disorders. Women who reported higher levels of social support and resilience were less likely to report common mental disorders (OR:0.96, 95% CI 0.93, 0.98) and (OR:0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99) respectively. Women who were 65 years and older were also less likely to report the occurrence of common mental disorders (OR:0.38, 95% CI 0.15, 0.98) compared to those aged 18-34 years. Social support and resilience appear to be protective against common mental disorders among these respondents. Further research should be conducted to explore the pathways through which protective factors reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of common mental disorders. This would be important in the development of mental health interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35134096/"}

Attention to these areas would improve the quality of life and quality of liberty of people with mental illness and their families. Progress in these areas needs to be underpinned by enhanced involvement of service-users in planning and provision of care, increased funding of mental health services and particular attention to groups who are currently underserved, including children and adolescents. Enhanced attention to these areas would also help advance Ireland's national mental health policy, \"A Vision for Change\", which has yet to be implemented in full.

Recent studies suggest that healthy eating habits may play a role in the development and management of mental health. However, existing literature is largely based on clinical populations, and comparisons are challenged by sociocultural differences and methodological issues. The aim of the present study was to use nationally representative data based on standardized procedures, to explore associations between adolescents eating habits and mental health, considering the importance of age, gender, socioeconomic factors, and country. The study was based on data from Nordic adolescents (age 11, 13 and 15 years) who participated in the 2017/2018 Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study (n = 22384). General linear modelling and multigroup regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between food habits (intake of fruit, vegetables, sweets, soft drinks), meal habits (intake of breakfast and having family meals together), and mental health (life satisfaction and subjective health complaints). The analyses were weighted and adjusted for age, gender, socio-economic status, and country. Overall, healthier eating habits were associated with better mental health. The strongest associations were found between meal habits (breakfast consumption and having family meals together) and mental health. Gender and country differences were seen, with weaker associations found among Danish boys. Eating habits should be considered when promoting mental health in the adolescent population. While gender differences and cross-country variations exist, even minor enhancements in eating behaviors could yield meaningful benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39334065/"}

Chronotype and the mental health of adolescents.", "text": "Evidence suggests that the timing of sleep (chronotype) impacts mental health in young people, but previous studies have not accounted for sleep duration or school start time in this association, or examined a broad range of mental outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between chronotype and mental health in a representative sample of adolescents from the 2014 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey (29,635 students, 362 schools). We examined positive and negative aspects of mental health, using scores for emotional problems (range 0-33), emotional well-being (0-22), behavioural problems (0-28) and prosocial behaviours (0-25). We estimated chronotype using the time of mid-sleep on weekends and examined the associations using multilevel regressions, adjusted for sleep duration, school start time, individual, family and geographic characteristics. The average time of mid-sleep (chronotype) was 04:11 hr. An hour delay in mid-sleep time was associated with more emotional problems (0.34 [95% confidence interval 0.23, 0.45] point higher score), more behavioural problems (2.0% [95% confidence interval 1.4%, 2.6%] higher score), less emotional well-being (0.19 [95% confidence interval 0.09, 0.20] point lower score), and fewer prosocial behaviours (0.18 [95% confidence interval 0.08, 0.29] point lower score). A later chronotype was associated with poorer mental health, independent of sleep duration and school start time, and across internalizing and externalizing mental health domains. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this association. The timing of sleep, and not just its duration, may be an additional consideration for youth mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998523/"}

There may be both benefits and risks. Yet, almost all published research on this topic is from high-income countries. This paper presents new findings across four countries of varying wealth. We analyse data gathered through the Global Kids Online project from nationally representative samples of Internet-using children aged 9 to 17 years in Bulgaria (n = 1,000), Chile (n = 1,000), Ghana (n = 2,060) and the Philippines (n = 1,873). Data was gathered on Internet usage on week and weekend days. Measures of absolute (comparable across countries) and relative (compared to other children within countries) time use were constructed. Mental health was measured by Cantril's ladder (life satisfaction). The analysis also considers the relative explanatory power on variations in mental health of children's relationships with family and friends. Analysis controlled for age, gender and family socioeconomic status. In Bulgaria and Chile, higher-frequency Internet use is weakly associated with lower life satisfaction. In Ghana and the Philippines, no such pattern was observed. There was no evidence that the relationship between frequency of Internet use and life satisfaction differed by gender. In all four countries, the quality of children's close relationships showed a much stronger relationship with their life satisfaction than did time spent on the Internet. Time spent on the Internet does not appear to be strongly linked to children's life satisfaction, and results from one country should not be assumed to transfer to another. Improving the quality of children's close relationships offers a more fruitful area for intervention than restricting their time online. Future research could consider a wider range of countries and links between the nature, rather than quantity, of Internet usage and mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32634259/"}

The goal of this study is to identify the transition and implementation challenges of mental health policies in both high-income countries (HICs) as well as middle- and low-income countries (MLICs). PubMed, Cochrane Library and Campbell Library were searched from inception to 31 December 2017, for studies on implemented mental health policies at the national level. Abstracts and the main texts of papers were double screened, and extracted data were analysed through thematic synthesis. A total of 93 papers were included in this study, covering 24 HICs, 28 MLICs and 5 regions. Studies on mental health policies, especially those of MLICs, kept increasing, but MLICs were still underrepresented in terms of publication quantity and study frequency. Based on the included studies, nine policy domains were summarized: service organizing, service provision, service quality, human resources, legislation and human rights, advocacy, administration, surveillance and research, and financing and budgeting. HICs incrementally enriched their policy content in all domains over centuries of development; following HICs' experience, mental health policies in MLICs have boomed since the 1990s and quickly extended to all domains. Implementation problems in HICs were mainly related to service organizing and service provision; for MLICs, more severe implementation problems converged on financing and budgeting, administration and human resources. Mental health policy developments in both HICs and MLICs present a process of diversification and enrichment. In terms of implementation, MLICs are faced with more and greater challenges than HICs, especially in funding, human resources and administration.

Particular attention is focused upon the main foundational issues of the discipline, drawing from some of the writings of Lightner Witmer, to whom we owe the founding of the first \"clinical psychology\" for subjects in childhood characterized by \"retardation or physical defects interfering with school progress\"; and of a lesser-known scholar, John E.W. Wallin. Both authors, indeed, worry themselves anxious to define clinical psychology, differentiating it from other medical and psychological branches; to establish which is the field of competence of the clinical psychologist; and to outline their training and specify the aims and contents of their intervention. Attention is then addressed to the relationship psychologists-psychiatrists at the time of its emergence, making specific reference to a document of the New York Psychiatrical Society--which represents one of the first attempts to exclude clinical psychologists from the field of mental health--and reporting also on the response to this position signed by Shepherd Franz. After an allusion to the Italian situation from the 1950s to today, the article concludes by emphasizing that at least some of the basic questions that clinical psychology had to deal with at its birth are still present, though filtered through the intense debate that has taken place over the years, and consequently supporting the importance of a historical component in the training of contemporary clinical psychologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26915235/"}

Using seven waves of repeated cross-sectional data collected between 1988 and 2008 in Sweden, the current study examined if economic factors at the societal level (municipality unemployment rate) and at the individual level (worry about family finances), and their interaction could explain a secular trend in mental health problems. Participants were 17 533 students of age 15-16 years (49.3% girls), from 14 municipalities in a county of Sweden. Data on adolescents' mental health (psychosomatic problems) and worry about family finances were obtained using a self-report questionnaire. A series of multilevel regression analyses were conducted in order to explain the trends in adolescents' mental health. The results indicated that the individual-level predictor (worry about family finances) significantly explained the increasing rates of adolescents' psychosomatic problems. This was particularly the case during the mid-1990s, which was characterised by a severe recession in Sweden with high unemployment rates. For example, after accounting for adolescents' worry, a significant increase in psychosomatic symptoms between 1988 and 1998 among girls (<i>b</i>=0.112, P<0.05) disappeared (<i>b</i>=0.018, P>0.05) and a non-significant decrease between 1988 and 1995 among boys (<i>b</i>=-0.017, P>0.05) became significant (<i>b</i>=-0.142, P<0.05).

The findings demonstrate the effects of adolescents' worry about family finances on a secular trend in mental health problems during an economically bleak period of time.

The developed model is a new method of mental health promotion for mental health nurses working in comprehensive schools. The professional practice model has been developed in workshops together with school staff, interest groups, parents and students. Information gathered from the workshops was analysed using action research methods. Mental health promotion interventions are delivered at three levels: universal, which is an intervention that affects the whole school or community; selective, which is an intervention focusing on a certain group of students; and indicated, which is an individually focused intervention. All interventions are delivered within the school setting, which is a universal setting for all school-aged children. The interventions share the goal of promoting mental health. The purposes of the interventions are enhancing protective factors, reducing risk factors relating to mental health problems and early identification of mental health problems as well as rapid delivery of support or referral to specialized services. The common effect of the interventions on all levels is the increase in the experience of positive mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24612241/"}

GRIN.", "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a computer-based game to improve social skills and mental health in children with social skills deficits would be efficacious. The program, Adventures aboard the S.S. GRIN, translates a proven in-person intervention into a nine-episode interactive online adventure game that provides opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill practice. Participants (children aged 7-11 years with social skills challenges) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment group (n = 33) or waitlist control group (n = 36). Children in the immediate treatment condition completed the game at home over the course of 9 weeks. Before playing the game and again within 1 week of game completion, children completed surveys about social literacy, social anxiety, bullying, social self-efficacy, and social satisfaction. Children who played Adventures improved significantly more from pretest to posttest than children who did not play the game in social literacy, social anxiety, bullying victimization, and social satisfaction. Online interactive games can be effective in improving mental health for children who struggle with social skills. For children who can access them, serious games have the potential to increase the reach of effective programs by overcoming the logistical and implementation barriers (such as cost, travel, and accessibility) that limit traditionally delivered mental health interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28051877/"}

We examined all US interventional mental health trials submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov between October 1, 2007 and April 30, 2018 to identify trends in trial characteristics, comparisons with non-mental health trials, and trial attributes associated with discontinuation and results reporting. International data were excluded to minimize potential confounding. Over this period, mental health and non-mental health trials grew at similar rates, though Industry and US government-funded trials declined and academic medical center/hospital/other (AMC/Hosp/Oth) funded trials grew faster in mental health research. The proportion of trials with safeguards against bias, including blinding and oversight by data monitoring committees (DMCs), decreased. This occurred during growth in the proportion of trials studying behavioral and non-pharmacological interventions, which often cannot be blinded and do not require DMC oversight. There was concurrent decline in pharmaceutical trials. There was significant growth in trials studying Non-DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5) conditions (e.g. suicidality and wellness), as well as substance use, anxiety, and neurocognitive disorders. One in 12 trials was discontinued. Trial discontinuation was associated with industry and AMC/Hosp/Oth funders, pharmaceutical interventions, and lack of DMC oversight. Only 29.9% of completed trials reported results to the registry. Decreased results reporting was associated with behavioral interventions, phase 1 trials, and industry and AMC/Hosp/Oth funders. The main implications of these data are that funding is shifting away from traditional government and industry sources, there is increasing interest in non-pharmacological treatments and Non-DSM conditions, and there are changing norms in trial design characteristics regarding safeguards against bias. These trends can guide researchers and funding bodies when considering the trajectory of future mental health research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32502181/"}

Emotional-behavioural difficulties items came from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and were parent-, and adolescent-reported. Results of logistic regression analyses indicate that the emotional-behavioural difficulties of adolescents with either a disability or BIF, were worse than for those with neither disability nor BIF. While adolescents with a disability reported more anxiety symptoms, no clear associations were observed for self-harming/suicidal thoughts/behaviours or depressive symptoms for those with either BIF or a disability.

To address this gap, this study measures national support for 5 social determinants of health policy priorities and their relation to mental health and political affiliation. This study assessed support for 5 policy priorities related to the social determinants of health using a nationally representative survey of US adults (n=2,430) conducted in March-April 2023. Logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of identifying each priority as important, test differences in support by self-rated mental health, and evaluate whether partisanship modified these relationships. Analyses were conducted in 2023. The majority of US adults, across partisan identities, supported 5 policy priorities related to improving the economy (84%), healthcare affordability (77%), improving K-12 education (76%), housing affordability (68%), and childcare affordability (61%). Worse mental health predicted significantly greater support for addressing housing affordability (73.9% vs 66.2%), and partisanship modified the relationship between mental health and support for improving the economy, improving K-12 education, and housing affordability. In 2023, there was substantial bipartisan support for federal policy action to address the social determinants of health, and worse mental health was related to greater policy support, particularly among Democrats.

However, it remains unclear whether these benefits are driven by arts engagement itself or by important confounders such as socio-economic status (SES), childhood arts engagement, previous mental health, personality, or self-selection bias. The aim of this study is to use fixed effects models that account for unidentified time-constant confounding measures to examine the longitudinal association between arts (frequency of both arts participation and cultural attendance), mental distress, mental health functioning and life satisfaction. Data from 23,660 individuals (with a mean age of 47 years) included in the UK Understanding Society wave 2 (2010-2012) and wave 5 (2013-2015) were analyzed. Aside from controlling for all time-constant variables using fixed-effects models, we additionally adjusted for time-varying demographic factors (e.g. age and marital status), health behaviors and social support variables. After controlling for all time-constant variables and identified time-varying confounders, frequent arts participation and cultural attendance were associated with lower levels of mental distress and higher levels of life satisfaction, with arts participation additionally associated with better mental health functioning. Health-related and social time-varying factors were shown partly but not wholly to explain the observed associations. Arts engagement amongst the population as a whole may help enhance positive mental health and life satisfaction, and protect against mental distress.

Details of all 511 patients enrolled into a large forensic mental health service in Ontario, Canada, in 2011 or 2012 were collected from records. A latent profile analysis supported a 2-class solution in both men and women. External validation of the classes demonstrated that those with a younger age onset of serious mental illness and offending were characterised by higher levels of static risk factors and criminogenic need than those whose involvement in both mental health and criminal justice systems was delayed to later life. Our findings present a new perspective on life course trajectories of offenders with SMI. While analyses identified just two distinct age-of-onset groups, in both the illness preceded the offending. The fact that our sample was entirely drawn from those hospitalised may have introduced a selection bias for those whose illness precedes offending, but findings underscore the complexity and level of need among those with a younger age of onset.

{"id": "28474412", "title": "Mental health literacy in korean older adults: A cross-sectional survey.", "text": "WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Mental health literacy is a fairly new concept, first introduced in 1997. It refers to what people know and believe about mental health disorders. People's knowledge and beliefs help them to recognize, manage and prevent mental disorders. Generally, older adults have lower health literacy compared to young and middle-aged adults. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This is the first study on the mental health literacy of Korean older adults. This study looks beyond peoples' ability to recognize mental health disorders and their opinions about them. It identifies factors that are associated with mental health literacy (level of education and social support, the number of people in one's social circles and how individuals rate their health). WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Older adults might get more out of mental health literacy programmes in group or social settings. Programmes that use older adult peer educators/supporters, such as the \"older people's champions\" of the Healthy Passport programme in England, might make the programmes more effective. Mental health campaigns, such as Australia's beyondblue, might increase mental health literacy of older adults. Introduction Korea is experiencing rapid population ageing, spurring an increased need for mental health services for the elderly. Approximately one-third of Korean older adults experience depressive symptoms, and Korea has the highest elder suicide rate among 34 developed nations. Mental health literacy is an important component of promoting mental health, yet studies on the concept have been conducted in few countries. Aim This study examines the level of mental health literacy among Korean older adults and identifies factors associated with their mental health literacy. Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 596 community-dwelling Korean adults aged 65 and older. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use framed the study. Results Overall, participants displayed low levels of mental health literacy. They had difficulty recognizing their mental health issues and had limited knowledge about self-help strategies. Mental health literacy was positively associated with education, social support, social network and health status. Discussion and Implications This study highlights a need for efforts to increase mental health literacy among Korean older adults. Strategies that have the potential to empower this population to proactively attend to their mental health include community-based education and national mental health campaigns.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28474412/"}

A systematic search of academic and grey literature was conducted for relevant literature with 'hidden' groups published between January 1995 and January 2016. The main search used Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS electronic databases. Hidden groups were defined as refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons or hard/difficult to reach populations. A supplementary grey literature search was conducted. Identified articles were rated according to a created graded system of 'level of evidence for a community representative sample' based on key study factors that indicated possible sources of selection bias. Articles were included if they were assessed as having medium or higher evidence for a representative sample. All full-text papers that met the eligibility criteria were examined in detail and relevant data extracted. The searches identified a total of 20 publications for inclusion: 16 peer-reviewed publications and four highly relevant reports. Seventeen studies had sampled refugee and asylum seekers and three other hidden groups. The main search identified 12 (60.0%) and the grey search identified another eight (40.0%) articles. All 20 described sampling techniques for accessing hidden groups for participation in health-related research. Key design considerations were: an a priori aim to recruit a representative sample; a reliable sampling frame; recording of response rates; implementation of long recruitment periods; using multiple non-probability sampling methods; and, if possible, including a probability sampling component. Online social networking sites were used by one study. Engagement with the refugee and asylum seeker group was universally endorsed in the literature as necessary and a variety of additional efforts to do this were reported. The strategies for increasing the likelihood of a representative sample of this hidden group were identified and will assist researchers when doing future research with refugee groups. These findings encourage more rigorous reporting of future studies so that the representativeness of samples of these groups in research can be more readily assessed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28253851/"}

This narrative review focuses on the therapeutic alliance within the context of refugee clients, who face unique challenges stemming from forced displacement, trauma, and systemic barriers. Utilizing a systematic search and thematic synthesis, 20 studies published between 2014 and 2024 were analyzed to address four key questions: the state of knowledge, the role of interpreters, strategies for improvement, and gaps in research. Findings highlight significant challenges in building alliances with refugee clients due to cultural and linguistic differences, power dynamics, and trauma-related distrust. The presence of interpreters transforms the traditional dyadic alliance into a triadic relationship, introducing both benefits and complexities. Interpreters act as co-constructors of the alliance, requiring strong collaboration and role negotiation with providers. Recommendations for strengthening the alliance include flexible therapeutic boundaries, advocacy integration, continuity of care, and tailored training for providers and interpreters. Despite the growing body of research, gaps remain in understanding non-verbal communication, virtual care dynamics, and the perspectives of clients discontinuing therapy. This review emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift recognizing clients, providers, and interpreters as equal partners in therapeutic processes, alongside further exploration of emerging contexts such as telehealth and refugee-led MHPSS initiatives.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40317432/"}

The traditional psychiatric and mental health nursing historian objectively uses primary sources in order to be able to make 'truth' claims about the past. The post-modern psychiatric nursing historian, on the other hand, constructs truth claims, rather than discovers them, and in the process of doing so creates historical discourses that are different from the past. To the postmodern psychiatric nursing historian, all histories are fictions, created with the use of imagination, and have characteristics that are similar to the literary constructions that are more traditionally identified as fiction. A variety of literature is used in order to explore such claims, and the conclusion is drawn that, with caution and careful attention to the rigorous use of historical method, fiction can be used as a valid source for historical research in psychiatric and mental health nursing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19930366/"}

This study aimed to gather perspectives from immigrants and racialized community members on strategies central to support their mental health and well-being, with the aim of addressing research to practice gaps. The study was co-designed in collaboration with a Community Action Table in Markham, Ontario, a setting with 93% of residents self-identifying as visible minorities. Using a community-focused mixed methods Concept Mapping approach, 68 residents, service providers, and policymakers were engaged through three phases of brainstorming, sorting and rating, and interpretation. Their brainstorming led to 68 statements which they sorted into groups and rated for importance and feasibility to act in next six months. Further analysis led to a 9-cluster concept map comprising of Family Wellness, Awareness & Education, Cultural Sensitivity, Social Service Access, Community Building, Socioeconomic, Food Security, Healthcare Access, and Housing Stability. These clusters are important in advancing knowledge on ways to support and prioritize mental health and well-being of immigrants and racialized communities. Overall, participants viewed mental health and well-being as being closely tied to their living and working conditions while also focusing on family wellness and intergenerational dynamics. Novel insights from this project are important for the planning of mental health and well-being supports for immigrant groups in Canada and can help improve foci across sectors through service implementation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39576366/"}

Wildlife activities (WAs) have been increasingly promoted as a potential measure to improve adolescent well-being. However, there is limited research on the extent of adolescent participation in these activities and its association with mental distress among Norwegian adolescents. This study has a twofold aim: to explore the degree of adolescent participation in WAs and to examine the association between this participation and mental distress. The study design was cross-sectional, using Young-HUNT data from Norway collected between 2017 and 2019. A total of 6,361 participants were included in the final sample. Participants were categorized based on their level of participation in WAs, and ordinal regression analysis was conducted to assess factors associated with their level of wildlife activity. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analysis assessed the association between wildlife activity and mental distress. The majority of participants reported low levels (34.6%) or medium levels (53.2%) of engagement in WAs. Adjusted analyses showed that higher levels of participation in WAs were associated with a range of factors, particularly female sex, having both parents born in Norway, and maintaining a medium or high level of physical activity. A weak yet statistically significant relationship was identified between higher levels of wildlife activity and increased mental distress among the participants. Various sociodemographic, lifestyle, and social factors influence the involvement in WAs. The observed weak but significant association between higher participation in WAs, and increased mental distress raises questions about the assumption that nature and WAs are universally beneficial for adolescent mental health. These results highlight the need for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms of this relationship. These findings also caution policymakers against making generalized claims about the mental health benefits of WAs without a deeper consideration of individual and contextual factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40144979/"}

Identification rates, beliefs about various interventions, best methods, and the prognosis with or without treatment were measured. Less than 60% of the non-mental health professionals could identify the mental disorders correctly. Psychiatrists and psychologists were considered to be the people who would be most helpful in all vignettes. Over 70% of participants identified the correct medication for each vignette. Participants gave higher ratings to lifestyle interventions than to psychological and medical interventions, especially in the depression and generalized anxiety disorder vignettes. For the question about how the person could best be helped, about half of the participants rated listening or talking with the person more highly than accompanying the person to professional help or encouraging the person to visit a psychiatrist or psychologist. Participants believed that, with professional help, the people in the vignettes would fully recover but that problems would probably reoccur and that, without professional help, the people described would get worse.

Studies suggests that health in informal settlements is a serious and growing concern, yet there is a paucity of research focused on health outcomes and the correlates of health in these settlements. Studies cite individual, environmental and social correlates to health in informal settlements, but they often lack empirical evidence. In particular, research suggests that high rates of violence against women (VAW) in informal settlements may be associated with detrimental effects on women's health, but few studies have investigated this link. The purpose of this study was to fill this gap by empirically exploring associations between women's experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and their physical and mental health. Data for this study were collected in August 2018 in Mathare Valley Informal Settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 550 randomly-selected women participated in surveys; however, analyses for this study were run on a subpopulation of the women (n = 361). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to investigate the link between psychological, sexual, and emotional IPV and women's mental and physical health. Results suggest that while some socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental variables were significantly associated with women's mental and physical health outcomes, all types of IPV emerged key correlates in this context. In particular, women's experiences of IPV were associated with lower odds of normal-high physical health component scores (based on SF-36); higher odds of gynecological and reproductive health issues, psychological distress (based on K-10), depression, suicidality, and substance use. Findings from this study suggest that policies and interventions focused on prevention and response to VAW in informal settlements may make critical contributions to improving health for women in these rapidly growing settlements.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240207/"}

Research on the link between use of social media and mental health has resulted in a vast number of studies covering diverse aspects of the link between them. The existing body of knowledge on use of social media, and mental health and well-being among adolescents is complex and difficult to follow. In this paper, we present a protocol for a scoping review to systematically identify and summarise the central research foci and knowledge gaps in the research field of social media use, and mental health and well-being among adolescents. The current scoping review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The first step is to search relevant databases for eligible studies. Relevant databases are CINAHL, Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Sociological Services Abstracts, ERIC, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CRD (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), NHS EED, HTA and Epistemonikos. Next, two reviewers from the research team will independently screen the identified studies for eligibility. Data extraction and data synthesis will be performed and result in summarised themes based on the findings. A scoping review can be described as a method of gaining an overview and understanding of a research area, with its strengths and weaknesses, and as it involves peer-reviewed and published articles, a scoping review does not require ethical approval.

Future studies employing several assessment points could use longitudinal mediation analysis to model intraindividual changes in order to understand when and through which mechanisms social media use has an impact on mental health. Furthermore, future studies should include additional mental disorders, various sources of information, a broader age range, and additional social-networking websites to develop more precise models for the early detection of mental disorders.

To examine: 1) how streetscape and remote sensing-based greenery affect people's mental wellbeing; 2) whether and, if so, to what extent the associations are mediated by physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; and 3) whether differences in the mediation across the streetscape greenery and NDVI exposure metrics occurred. We used a population sample of 1029 adult residents of the metropolis of Guangzhou, China, from 2016. Mental wellbeing was quantified by the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Two objective greenery measures were extracted at the neighborhood level: 1) streetscape greenery from street view data via a convolutional neural network, and 2) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Single and multiple mediation analyses with multilevel regressions were conducted. Streetscape and NDVI greenery were weakly and positively, but not significantly, correlated. Our regression results revealed that streetscape greenery and NDVI were, individually and jointly, positively associated with mental wellbeing. Significant partial mediators for the streetscape greenery were physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; together, they explained 62% of the association. For NDVI, only physical activity and social cohesion were significant partial mediators, accounting for 22% of the association. Mental health and wellbeing and both streetscape and satellite-derived greenery seem to be both directly correlated and indirectly mediated. Our findings signify that both greenery measures capture different aspects of natural environments and may contribute to people's wellbeing by means of different mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31260914/"}

To ensure practitioners in remote and rural areas have the necessary skills, the Remote and Rural Healthcare Educational Alliance (RRHEAL) were asked to develop a pre-hospital mental health care course. Several mental health care experts were asked to express an opinion on the essential content of such a course. Stakeholder review informed the development of a survey to identify the priority areas for training. The first round of the survey process involved an expert group of 16; the second round used a survey of over 300 remote and rural practitioners involved with the British Association for Immediate Care, Scotland (BASICS). The stakeholder review identified key content, summarised under the following topics: risk assessment; patient assessment; crisis management; handling difficult situations; engagement skills; mental health law; management of retrieval; pharmacology; theory and classification of mental illness; and understanding your network. This article shares how the needs within a national pre-hospital mental health care programme were identified, and demonstrates how consensus over the content of a national course was achieved through the use of a modified Delphi approach. The Clinical Skills Managed Educational Network (CSMEN), Self-Harm Mitigation Training (STORM®) and BASICS, alongside RRHEAL, contributed to this development. Using blended learning techniques the resulting course encourages a contextual approach to user needs, specifically teaching generic mental health care skills to staff who are often working single-handed, and are required to respond appropriately, locally and safely as they work towards achieving National Mental Health crisis standards.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24219523/"}

Alongside the unprecedented explosion of digital technology facilities and systems, mental health care is under greater pressure than ever before. With its emphasis on big data, computing power, mobile technology, and network information, digital technology is set to transform health care delivery. This article reviews the field of digital health technology assessment and intervention primarily in secondary service mental health care, including the barriers and facilitators to adopting and implementing digitally mediated interventions in service delivery. We consider the impact of digitally mediated communication on human interaction and its potential impact on various mental states such as those linked to mood, anxiety but also well-being. These developments point to a need for both theory- and data-driven approaches to digital health care. We argue that, as developments in digital technology are outpacing the evaluation of rigorous digital health interventions, more advanced methodologies are needed to keep up with the pace of digital technology development. The need for co-production of digital tools with and for people with chronic and mental health difficulties, and implications of digital technology for psychotherapy practice, will be central to this development. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Mental health problems are one of the main causes of global and societal burden and are a growing public health. People with mental health problems around the world have limited, if any, chance of accessing psychological help at all. Technological innovations and solutions are being considered in an attempt to address the size and scale of the mental health crisis worldwide. Digital platforms allow people to self-monitor and self-manage in a way that face-to-face/paper-based methods of assessment have up until now not allowed. We provide examples of digital tools that are being developed and used in the secondary setting and identify a number of challenges in the digital health field that require careful consideration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30924316/"}

Community perceptions of mental illness are an essential issue for the quality of life of people with mental health problems and the promotion of mental health in general. The aim of this study was to explore adolescents' perceptions of mental illness and to examine the extent to which those perceptions changed after an educational mental health intervention. The data were collected twice, before and after the educational mental health intervention. Fifty-nine pupils from two Greek secondary schools were individually interviewed, and data were analyzed by inductive content analysis. The findings show that adolescents can provide a rich description of mental illness in a multidimensional way. After the intervention, they provide different descriptions, identify various forms of mental illness and express opinions on what mentally ill people need and how they should be treated. It is concluded that mental health educational interventions in schools can be effective in changing adolescents' perceptions towards mental illness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24673839/"}

Sociodemographic descriptors, psychiatric antecedents, clinical characteristics and follow-up care were compared before and during the recession for newly assessed patients in community mental health clinics located across a Northern Alberta oil mining region. Data were collected retrospectively as part of a clinical audit process and then analysed with descriptive statistics, cross-tabular univariate analyses with chi-square tests using SPSS version 20. A total of 1,465 patients were included. Sociodemographic factors disproportionately elevated during the recession included male sex, Caucasian ethnicity, own home ownership, higher levels of education and unemployment. More patients seeking mental health care were already taking psychotropic medications (e.g. antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and stimulants). At the same time, disproportionately fewer patients engaged in substance abuse or had a prior formal history of mental health problems. The referral reasons during recession were less likely to be associated with substance abuse or mood concerns and more likely for 'other' reasons. The patients seeking psychiatric help during a recession were disproportionately likely to be diagnosed with personality disorders and 'other' less common diagnostic categories and less likely to suffer from mood or trauma-related diagnoses. Referrals for counselling and social services were also disproportionately more common during the recession. This study provides a comprehensive description of longitudinal patterns of mental health service utilization before and during a recession. The findings provide important evidence for policy and planning decisions to encourage resource allocation to help promote accessibility of the most needed community mental health resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29966476/"}

Today, with ever-increasing access to the Internet and use of technology, the potential to provide all young people with access (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) to the support they require to improve their mental health and well-being is promising. The aim of this study was to use participatory design (PD) as research methodologies with end users (young people aged between 16 and 25 years and youth health professionals) and our research team to develop the Mental Health eClinic (a Web-based mental health clinic) to improve timely access to, and better quality, mental health care for young people across Australia. A research and development (R&D) cycle for the codesign and build of the Mental Health eClinic included several iterative PD phases: PD workshops; translation of knowledge and ideas generated during workshops to produce mockups of webpages either as hand-drawn sketches or as wireframes (simple layout of a webpage before visual design and content is added); rapid prototyping; and one-on-one consultations with end users to assess the usability of the alpha build of the Mental Health eClinic. Four PD workshops were held with 28 end users (young people n=18, youth health professionals n=10) and our research team (n=8). Each PD workshop was followed by a knowledge translation session. At the conclusion of this cycle, the alpha prototype was built, and one round of one-on-one end user consultation sessions was conducted (n=6; all new participants, young people n=4, youth health professionals n=2). The R&D cycle revealed the importance of five key components for the Mental Health eClinic: a home page with a visible triage system for those requiring urgent help; a comprehensive online physical and mental health assessment; a detailed dashboard of results; a booking and videoconferencing system to enable video visits; and the generation of a personalized well-being plan that includes links to evidence-based, and health professional-recommended, apps and etools. The Mental Health eClinic provides health promotion, triage protocols, screening, assessment, a video visit system, the development of personalized well-being plans, and self-directed mental health support for young people. It presents a technologically advanced and clinically efficient system that can be adapted to suit a variety of settings in which there is an opportunity to connect with young people. This will enable all young people, and especially those currently not able or willing to connect with face-to-face services, to receive best practice clinical services by breaking down traditional barriers to care and making health care more personalized, accessible, affordable, and available.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29807878/"}

For this reason, this study aims to determine the mental health (MH) assessment of elderly people with chronic pain (CP) based on Quranic components. The study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. A total of 138 elderly people who are aged over 65 years and had history of CP were enrolled. Data were collected using Islamic Questionnaire of Identifying God's Traits in the same, and analysis was performed using SPSS ver. 16. The mean (SD) of age in elderly is 81.00 (12.07), and as the age increased, the God's Traits score of the elderly increased (p = 0.003, R = 0.34). The mean overall God's Traits score was 234.68 (3.61). In the elderly who lived with their spouse and had higher social support, the score of God's Traits was higher (p > 0.05), but there was no relationship between other demographic characteristics and status of God's Traits (p > 0.05). This study is the first study to evaluate the MH status of chronic patients based on Quranic components, and their MH status has been high.

One of the objectives of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) is to reduce the financial burden for those with intensive mental health service needs. Few researchers to date have examined MHPAEA's effects on children with mental health conditions and those with particularly high mental health expenditures. A difference-in-differences approach was used to compare commercially insured children ages 3 to 18 years (in 2008) who were continuously enrolled in plans newly subject to parity under MHPAEA to children continuously enrolled in plans never subject to parity. Data included inpatient, outpatient, and pharmaceutical claims for 2008-2012 from 3 national commercial insurers. We examined annual mental health service use and spending outcomes. Among children with mental health conditions who were enrolled in plans subject to parity, parity was associated with $140 (95% confidence interval: -$196 to -$84) lower average annual out-of-pocket (OOP) mental health spending than expected given changes in the comparison group. Among children who were ≥85th percentile in total mental health spending, parity was associated with $234 (-$391 to -$76) lower average annual OOP mental health spending. MHPAEA was associated with increased financial protection on average for children with mental health conditions and among those at the higher end of the spending distribution. However, estimated reductions in OOP spending were likely too modest to have substantially reduced financial burden on families of children with particularly high mental health expenditures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30037977/"}

Though previous studies have suggested the need for an interregional comparison of psychological and social resources, few studies have undertaken such an investigation. The aim of this study is to investigate the associations among coping resources, sense of coherence (SOC), and health status in a comparison of urban and rural residents. General residents (aged 30-69 years) in two areas were targeted for the current study. Through a random sampling selection, 1,000 residents from each area were picked, and an anonymous questionnaire was mailed to each resident. Ultimately, 269 and 363 valid responses from the urban and rural areas, respectively, were analyzed. SOC, both social and psychological resources, and mental health were assessed. To examine relationships between SOC and resources associated with mental health, mental health was defined as a dependent variable. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted with variables entered from sociodemographic characteristics, social and psychological resources, and SOC. Regarding regional characteristics, social capital and participation in community activities were significantly greater in the rural area than in the urban area. Urban residents reported significantly higher self-esteem and optimism than rural residents. SOC showed the most significant association with mental health in both areas. Mental health was significantly associated with physical activity limitations and life stressors in both areas. However, the associations were weakened when social and psychological resources and SOC were added, which demonstrated their buffering effect on the negative influence of life stressors on health. When SOC was added, the association of self-esteem with mental health disappeared in both areas, but optimism in the urban area and humor in the rural area were directly and independently associated with mental health. Our findings indicate that resources available to urban and rural residents are characteristic of the area where they live, and that social and psychological resources as well as SOC are associated with better mental health. Possible directions for health support strategies, reflecting regional characteristics, are suggested.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23259917/"}

For both genders, FE models showed that objective and subjective multidimensional PE both had a strong negative association with mental health (stronger for subjective PE). IV analysis indicated OLS models overestimate the relationship between subjective PE and mental health for men but underestimate it for women, providing causal evidence that subjective PE is important for women's mental health.

The penalties for committing the offences range from small fines to 12 months' imprisonment. There is a concern that the threat of criminal punishment may discourage practitioners from routinely using the Act's immediate detention procedure. Failure to adhere to extensive notification requirements can result in financial penalties. Private psychiatric facilities may also face particular penalties.

Participants included 161 clinicians, primarily psychiatrists, from 24 countries. Clinicians completed a semi-structured qualitative questionnaire on existing SBPs guidelines and development of new guidelines where not available. Clinicians' responses were mapped against academic experts' perceptions on SBPs guidelines highlighted in a previous study (Gatej et al. in Eur Psychiatry 57:1-9, 2019). Under half of the clinicians reported being unaware of guidelines. Of these, 37.6% represented countries where guidelines were available according to experts. The remaining half of clinicians who were aware of guidelines on average reported being moderately familiar with their content, perceiving them as moderately useful and using them some of the time. Additionally, 60.8% clinicians agreed that SBPs guidelines need to be developed, as these would create a shared scientific knowledge base and common practice. Guideline improvements included taking a multifactorial approach, creating specific case recommendations, and dissemination efforts. The modest familiarity with and use of guidelines amongst practitioners may highlight guidelines poor fitness-for-purpose, or, alternatively, an underlying confusion around the meaning and purpose of guidelines.

We investigated the prevalence of as well as risk factors for mental disease among female sex workers globally. Utilizing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across several databases, ultimately analyzing data from 80 studies comprising 24,675 individuals in total. Most of the studies stemmed from the United States (<i>n</i> = 24), followed by China (<i>n</i> = 12), India (<i>n</i> = 7) and Kenya (<i>n</i> = 5).

Single studies were identified from Scotland, Switzerland, Israel, Portugal, Mongolia, Malawi, Cameroon, Ukraine, Togo, Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, Tanzania, Puerto Rico, Ethiopia, and Moldova. The review highlights significant heterogeneity in the prevalence of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use and dependence, investigating the influence of socio-economic, legal, and individual factors on these outcomes. The meta-analysis reveals that while factors like legal status of sex work and economic conditions did not show any impact, specific demographic characteristics, notably female sex workers living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), migrant female sex workers, or female sex workers engaged in substance use, exhibit notably higher mental health challenges. These findings suggest the critical need for targeted mental health interventions and policy reforms that consider the complex interplay of various factors affecting sex workers.

For this purpose, we will focus on analysis of the activities of the Mental Hygiene Week held in Barcelona in 1954 and on the creation in 1955 of the National Board of Psychiatric Care, which took on mental hygiene as one of its functions. This paper shows the close relationship of mental hygiene during the early years of Francoism with the political principles of the Dictatorship. The 1940s witnessed the deployment of a harsh discourse in which mental hygiene was a tool for the (moral and spiritual) education of the Spanish people in the political principles of the \"New State\", pathologizing political dissent and ideologically purifying the country. In the 1950s, Francoist mental hygiene underwent a process of aggiornamento marked by international political events following the defeat of fascism in World War II, advancing a project for (authoritarian) modernization in an international context already directed towards mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29206008/"}

A total of 224 teaching staff at the Australian National University completed an anonymous online survey (16.4% response rate from n ∼ 1370). Data on mental health training needs, and experiences of assisting students with mental health problems were described using tabulation. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Most teaching staff (70.1-82.2%) reported at least moderate confidence in their ability to provide emotional support for students. However, many staff (60.0%) felt under-equipped overall to deal with student mental health problems; almost half (49.6%) reported they did not have access to formal training. Specific actions described in assisting students included referrals, offering support, or consulting others for advice. Given the high rates of students who approach staff about mental health problems, there is a critical need to provide and promote both formal mental health response training and explicit guidelines for staff on when, how, and where to refer students for help.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29722579/"}

Such research often uses social media content to study how specific places in the offline world influence well-being without acknowledging that digital platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Yelp) are designed in unique ways that structure certain types of interactions in online and offline worlds, which can influence place-making and well-being. To expand our understanding of the mechanisms that influence social media expressions about well-being, we describe an ecological framework of person-place interactions that asks, \"at what broad levels of interaction with digital platforms and physical environments do effects on well-being manifest?\" The person is at the centre of the ecological framework to recognize how people define and organize both digital and physical communities and interactions. The relevance of interactions in physical environments depends on the built and natural characteristics encountered across modes of activity (e.g., domestic, work, study). Here, social interactions are stratified into the meso-social (e.g., local social norms) and micro-social (e.g., personal conversations) levels. The relevance of interactions in digital platforms is contingent on specific hardware and software elements. Social interactions at the meso-social level include platform norms and passive use of social media, such as observing the expressions of others, whereas interactions at the micro-level include more active uses, like direct messaging. Digital platforms are accessed in a physical location, and physical locations are partly experienced through online interactions; therefore, interactions between these environments are also acknowledged. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of applying the framework to studies of place and well-being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30287115/"}

From the review, we finally selected 53 studies. Of the studies we reviewed, 60.38% or 32 out of 53, were evaluated as having a high risk of bias. The main biases our review revealed were problems with evaluation, time bias, lack of control of unobserved confounding, and non-exogeneity when defining the onset of the Great Recession. The results from the studies that controlled the biases were quite consistent. Summing up, the studies reviewed found that the Great Recession increased the risk of declaring poor self-rated health and the deterioration of mental health.

PMADs also substantially contribute the cost of maternal morbidity. This paper offers a discussion of the quality-of-care cascade model of PMADs, which outlines care pathways that people typically face as well as gaps and unmet needs that frequently happen along the way. The model uses the US health system as an example. A discussion of international implications follows. The quality-of-care cascade model outlines downward dips in quality of care along the perinatal mental health treatment continuum, including access (many Americans do not have access to affordable health insurance), enrollment (even when individuals are offered health insurance, some do not enroll), coverage (even if individuals have health insurance, some needed services or providers may not be covered), choice (even if services and providers are covered, patients may not be able to choose among plans, institutions, or clinicians), consistency (even if patients have a choice of plan or provider, a consistent source of care may not be accessible), referral (even if care is available and accessible, referral services may not be), quality (even if patients have access to both care and referral services, there may be gaps in the quality of care provided), adherence (even if patients receive high-quality care, they may not be adherent to treatment), barriers (societal forces that may influence people's choices and behaviors), and shocks (unanticipated events that could disrupt care pathways). In describing the quality-of-care cascade model, this paper uses the US healthcare system as the primary example. However, the model can extend to examine quality-of-care dips along the perinatal mental health treatment continuum within the international context. Although the US healthcare system may differ from other healthcare systems in many respects, shared commonalities lead to quality-of-care dips in countries with healthcare systems structured differently than in the US. The global cost of PMADs remains substantial, and addressing the costs of these conditions could have a significant impact on overall cost and quality of care internationally. The quality-of-care cascade model presented in this paper could help identify, understand, and address the complex contributing factors that lead to dips in quality-of-care for perinatal mental health conditions across the world.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38904275/"}

The classic models for Mental Health Programs, defined through their basic infrastructures are analyzed: a) The Institution-Pscychiatric Hospital, aimed mainly at tertiary prevention, custody, and biologic therapy, and having high costs with reduced benefits; b) The Mental Health Unit, aimed mainly at secondary prevention, providing several services, and having high costs with good benefits; and c) The Comprehensive Program, aiming mainly at primary prevention, providing several specialized services together with the use of the resources of the community itself, and having low costs with high benefits. An overview of Mental Health indicators shows the following rates of prevalence: a) neurosis, 15%; b) alcoholism, 5%; c) epilepsy, 2%; d) psychosis, 1%; e) dementia, 1%; f) mental retardation, 1%. The total prevalence rate for the six basic psychopathological entities is 25%, in the population of more than 15 years of age. The minimal requirement of psychiatrists for that degree of prevalence is about 80/one million inhabitants, that is, an increase fourfold to fivefold of the present number. To attain this goal, at least 50 years are required, during which mental health services are likely to maintain their present deficits, unless a new conception of mental health services is used. The author proposes the generalized use of Comprehensive Programs, as the only possibility of providing within periods reasonably short an adequate service. The importance of incorporating the mental health resources of the community is stressed.

However, because most studies focus on the longer term effects of gamification (eg, effectiveness or adherence at the end of the intervention period), there is limited insight into how gamification may enhance engagement. Research implies that gamification has a direct impact at the time of use of the intervention, which changes the experience of the users, and thereby motivates users. However, it is unclear what this direct impact of gamification might be and how it can be measured. The objective of this study was to explore the direct impact of gamification on behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement in the context of a Web-based mental health intervention and to explore whether and how the different components of engagement are related. A pilot (n=19) and a real-life (n=75) randomized between-groups experiment was carried out, where participants used a gamified or nongamified version of the same Web-based well-being intervention for a single session. Participants (68%, 64/94 female, mean age 23 years) were asked to use the intervention in one session for research purposes. Gamification elements included a map as visualization of the different lessons, a virtual guide, and badges. Later, behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement were measured. The pilot experiment showed no differences between the gamified and nongamified intervention. However, in the real-life experiment, participants in the gamified intervention scored higher on cognitive engagement, that is, involvement (P=.02) and some elements of affective engagement, that is, flow as a combination of cognitive and affective engagement (P=.049), and the emotions \"interest\" (P=.03) and \"inspiration\" (P=.009). Furthermore, the effect of gamification on cognitive engagement was mediated by the influence of gamification on specific positive emotions. The gamified intervention seemed to be able to increase cognitive engagement and the combination of cognitive and affective engagement but not behavioral and affective engagement alone. However, positive emotions seem to play an important role in mediating the effect of gamification on engagement. In conclusion, we cannot say that gamification \"works\" but that the design of an intervention, in this case, gamification, can have an impact on how participants experience the intervention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30049669/"}

Although there is evidence that these common mental health problems are preventable and treatable in the workplace, uptake of psychological treatments among the working population is low. One way to address this may be the delivery of occupational digital mental health interventions. While there is convincing evidence for delivering digital psychological interventions within a health and community context, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis of these interventions in an occupational setting. The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of occupational digital mental health interventions in enhancing employee psychological well-being and increasing work effectiveness and to identify intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Cochrane guidelines. Papers published from January 2000 to May 2016 were searched in the PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases, as well as the databases of the researchers and relevant websites. Unpublished data was sought using the Conference Proceedings Citation Index and the Clinical Trials and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) research registers. A meta-analysis was conducted by applying a random-effects model to assess the pooled effect size for psychological well-being and the work effectiveness outcomes. A positive deviance approach was used to identify those intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. In total, 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the search criteria. Occupational digital mental health interventions had a statistically significant effect post intervention on both psychological well-being (g=0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.50) and work effectiveness (g=0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41) compared with the control condition. No statistically significant differences were found on either outcome between studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches (as defined by the authors) compared with other psychological approaches, offering guidance compared with self-guidance, or recruiting from a targeted workplace population compared with a universal workplace population. In-depth analysis of the interventions identified by the positive deviance approach suggests that interventions that offer guidance are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users (ie, emails and text messages [short message service, SMS]), and use elements of persuasive technology (ie, self-monitoring and tailoring), which may achieve greater engagement and adherence. This review provides evidence that occupational digital mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological well-being and increase work effectiveness.

In order to develop relevant interventions and policies to strengthen adolescent mental health, a continuous monitoring of the population well-being becomes important. The aim of the study was to examine the level, distribution, and changes in mental well-being over time in a Swedish adolescent population. Current study is based on four waves (2014-2017-2020-2023) of a cross-sectional student survey (N = 16288, Mage = 16.23). The outcome was measured with the Mental Health Continuum Short Form. Ten explanatory factors were chosen to examine differences in mental well-being in the study population: Grade, Sex, Sexual orientation, Socioeconomic status, Country of birth, Visual, Hearing or Mobility impairment, Specific learning disorder and Neurodevelopmental disorder. Differences in mental well-being between groups as well as temporal trends were examined and evaluated through statistical testing and hierarchical multiple linear regressions modeling. Girls, non-heterosexual adolescents, and adolescents with low socioeconomic status or impairments have lower levels of mental well-being than boys, heterosexual adolescents, and adolescents with higher socioeconomic status or without impairments, respectively. A deterioration in mental well-being is seen over time for several groups; however, results of the multivariable analysis indicates that the deterioration is mainly an effect of sex and the significant decline in mental well-being seen among girls. The most significant factor for explaining the variation in mental well-being in this study is socioeconomic status. This study elucidates temporal changes and differences in levels of mental well-being between social groups in the adolescent population. The overall differences are small, but their potential implications for public health warrant careful consideration since they concern a significant part of the population.

The results show that first, individuals working longer hours (55 h or more per week) exhibited a higher likelihood of developing mental illness than those working regular hours or fewer hours. Second, the negative effect of long working hours on mental health is more pronounced among non-regular workers than among regular workers. Third, the effect of long working hours on mental health varies among different demographic groups, with a greater impact observed among women, managers, non-regular workers, employees in small- or large-sized firms, and those in smaller cities compared to their counterparts.

Four electronic databases were searched for relevant health economic studies, using a pre-developed search algorithm. Full health economic evaluations evaluating the cost effectiveness of universal mental health interventions were included, as well as evaluations of anti-bullying and suicide prevention interventions that used a universal approach. Studies on the prevention of substance abuse and those published before 2013 fell outside the scope of this review. Study results were summarised in evidence tables, and each study was subject to a systematic quality appraisal. Nine studies were included in the review; in six, the economic evaluation was conducted alongside a clinical trial. All studies except one were carried out in the European Union, and all but one evaluated school-based interventions. All evaluated interventions led to positive incremental costs compared to their comparators and most were associated with small increases in quality-adjusted life-years. Almost half of the studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy-based interventions aimed at the prevention of depression or anxiety, with mixed results. Cost-effectiveness estimates for a parenting programme, a school-based social and emotional well-being programme and anti-bullying interventions were promising, though the latter were only evaluated for the Swedish context. Drivers of cost effectiveness were implementation costs; intervention effectiveness, delivery mode and duration; baseline prevalence; and the perspective of the evaluation. The overall study quality was reasonable, though most studies only assessed short-term costs and effects. Few studies were found, which limits the possibility of drawing strong conclusions about cost effectiveness. There is some evidence based on decision-analytic modelling that anti-bullying interventions represent value for money.

This study aimed to explore the motivations and experiences of volunteer befrienders engaging in these schemes in addition to the experiences of befriending recipients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 volunteers and 23 befriending recipients, across 12 mental health befriending schemes in the UK, and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Volunteers highlighted their motivations for wanting to befriend. Individuals discussed their experiences, including the benefits and any challenges. Analysis of interviews revealed the motivations for individuals to volunteer in mental health care, the experiences of both volunteers and recipients of befriending, as well as how complex the role of befriender is. The three overarching themes were (1) Personal growth & altruism as motivations for volunteering, (2) Impact of \"doing things\" versus \"being there\" and (3) Negotiating between professional role and friendship.

Both acute and regular PA can boost a range of cognitive functions and enhance mood and mental health. Notably, the effect of acute PA on the brain and cognitive functions is generally found to be dose-dependent, in terms of both the amount and intensity of the exercise episode. In contrast, in the case of regular PA, the literature has primarily focused on the amount of exercise, and limited studies have assessed the influence of the exercise intensity. Since PA in higher intensity causes more extensive, more powerful, and longer-lasting neurobiological changes, it may prove more beneficial to cognitive functions and mental health. In the present study, we set out to test this hypothesis by employing a battery of questionnaires and laboratory tests with a sample of young adults. We found that more frequent vigorous- and moderate-intensity PA rather than walking (considered low to moderate intensity) was associated with better cognitive and mental health measures. Meanwhile, compared with no moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) at all, as few as 1~2 days per week (lasting at least 10 min each time) of MVPA was associated with a variety of benefits, particularly related to coping with challenging situations. In light of the neurobiological literature, the present study speaks to the value of moderate- to vigorous- rather than low-intensity PA in enhancing cognitive functions and mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31963639/"}

OEF/OIF Veterans returning from deployment have been found to have poorer function than soldiers who have not deployed; however the reasons for this are unknown. A prospective cohort of 790 soldiers was assessed both pre- and immediately after deployment to determine predictors of physical and mental function after war. On average, OEF/OIF Veterans showed significant declines in both physical (t=6.65, p<.0001) and mental function (t=7.11, p<.0001). After controlling for pre-deployment function, poorer physical function after deployment was associated with older age, more physical symptoms, blunted systolic blood pressure reactivity and being injured. After controlling for pre-deployment function, poorer mental function after deployment was associated with younger age, lower social desirability, lower social support, greater physical symptoms and greater PTSD symptoms. Combat deployment was associated with an immediate decline in both mental and physical function. The relationship of combat deployment to function is complex and influenced by demographic, psychosocial, physiological and experiential factors.

Widely used definitions of good mental health (e.g., WHO's) include several aspects of positive human functioning as predisposing to mental health. According to diagnostic criteria, people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are impaired in their functioning levels (e.g., intellectual functioning, adaptive skills). Existing definitions of good mental health may therefore not be applicable to an ID population. We aimed to explore the perspectives of experts on good mental health in people with ID to shed light on the constitutive factors of good mental health in this population. Semi-structured expert interviews with open-ended questions (N = 12) were conducted with psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, and psychiatric nurses, working either academically or in practice with this population. Inductive, reflexive thematic analysis was applied to analyze and synthesize the data. Four themes regarding components of good mental health in people with ID were derived: (1) Absence of Mental Illness, (2) Physical Health, (3) Psychosocial Functioning, and (4) Social Environment. Psychosocial functioning was divided into five subthemes, namely: (1) Emotional Competence, (2) Self-Concept, (3) Experience of Meaning, (4) Self-Determination, and (5) Personal Growth. According the participants of this study, the constitutive factors of good mental health are similar for people with and without ID.

Mounting evidence has confirmed the plausibility of high incidences of mental disorders in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, the association between the neighborhood built environment and individual mental health is understudied and far from conclusive, especially in developing countries such as China. The underlying mechanism requires in-depth analysis combining potential intermediates such as perceived environmental disorder and supportive social relationships. Using a health survey conducted in Beijing in 2017, this study investigates for the first time a socio-environmental pathway through which perceived disorder and social interaction account for the relationship between the built environment and mental health under the very notion of the neighborhood effect. The results from multilevel structural equation models indicate that individual mental health is influenced by the neighborhood-scale built environment through three pathways, independent of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantages: (1) proximity to parks is the sole indicator directly linked to mental health; (2) population density, road connectivity and proximity to parks are indirectly associated with mental health through interactions with neighbors; and (3) population density, road connectivity and facility diversity are partially associated with perceived neighborhood disorder, which is indirectly correlated with mental health through interactions with neighbors. This study is a preliminary attempt to disentangle the complex relationships among the neighborhood environment, social interaction and mental health in the context of developing megacities.

We intend, through an exploration of the exigences, social actions, and consequences of the posts, to facilitate a better understanding of the depressed population in China. We argue that the social exigences for the posts in online depression communities can be regarded as a failure of the rhetorical environment in real life and that expressing emotions, exchanging information, establishing interpersonal relationships, and communicating across spatiotemporal boundaries are the typified social actions performed by the posts in the Baidu depression community. Moreover, as a genre, the posts have successfully created an ambience of collective intimacy.

A systematic search was conducted to identify and evaluate the most downloaded apps from iOS and Android platforms. Apps were categorized according to their main purpose and downloaded to evaluate their content. Each app's affiliation, cost, target users, information security, and evidence-based nature were evaluated. Of the 172 unique apps that were identified, there were 37 apps (21.5%) for psychological counseling, 50 apps (29.1%) for assessment, 12 apps (7.0%) to relieve stress, 24 apps (14.0%) for psychoeducation, and 49 (28.4%) multipurpose apps (ie, a combination of counseling and assessment). Most apps were developed for adults in the general population (166/172, 96.5%), rather than for psychiatric patients. App-based counseling was mostly provided by psychologists, and of the assessed apps, only 40% (70/172) used evidence-based scales to assess mental health problems such as anxiety or depressed mood.

Subsequent sections examine psychosocial factors, environmental factors and physical health factors that may have a detrimental effect on mental health. The final sections look at the prevalence of mental illness in older offenders before and after sentencing. Mental illness in older prisoners is a result of complex interactions between numerous individual and environmental factors. It currently remains poorly researched and service provision for older prisoners with mental illness is poorly developed. Further research is needed, with a particular focus on the different groups of older prisoners and the most beneficial service models, because the number of older prisoners, including those with mental illness, is likely to increase in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20478093/"}

Family size (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.93; 95% CI [0.90, 0.96]), job status (unemployed vs. employed, AOR = 1.34; 95% CI [1.16, 1.55]), marital status (widowed and divorced vs. single, AOR = 1.09; 95% CI [1.02, 1.17]), education level (illiterate vs. academic, AOR = 1.18; 95% CI [1.09, 1.29]), and smoking status (smokers vs. nonsmokers, AOR = 1.46; 95% CI [1.31, 1.62]) were directly associated with poor mental health status in the logistic regression model. These results suggest that social capital could be an important approach for men to attain suitable mental health and reduce mental disorders. The high prevalence of poor mental health in men merits more attention in mental health policy and program planning.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26883076/"}

Exogenous variations in students' home-to-school distance are exploited to address potential endogeneity in their boarding status. Instrumental variable estimates suggest that while boarding has little impact on students' physical health (measured by height-for-age and BMI-for-age z-scores and hemoglobin concentration levels), it has a significantly detrimental effect on their mental health status, amounting to 0.455 standard deviations (SDs) of the distribution of scores on a Mental Health Test (a modified version of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale). The effect of boarding is more pronounced for students with relatively advantageous backgrounds. For example, boarding boys scored 0.544 SDs higher on the Mental Health Test (suggesting more anxiety problems) than nonboarding boys, and boarders from relatively wealthier families scored 0.754 SDs higher than wealthier nonboarders.

The main aim of this study was to investigate to what extent mental health problems are associated with academic functioning. As part of the World Mental Health Surveys International College Student project, 12-month mental health problems among freshmen (N = 4921) was assessed in an e-survey of students at KU Leuven University in Leuven, Belgium. The associations of mental health problems with academic functioning (expressed in terms of academic year percentage [or AYP] and grade point average [GPA]) were examined across academic departments. Approximately one in three freshman reports mental health problems in the past year, with internalizing and externalizing problems both associated with reduced academic functioning (2.9-4.7% AYP reduction, corresponding to 0.2-0.3 GPA reduction). The association of externalizing problems with individual-level academic functioning was significantly higher in academic departments with comparatively low average academic functioning. Limited sample size precluded further investigation of interactions between department-level and student-level variables. No information was available on freshman secondary school academic performance. Mental health problems are common in college freshman, and clearly associated with lower academic functioning. Additional research is needed to examine the potentially causal nature of this association, and, if so, whether interventions aimed at treating mental health problems might improve academic performance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28802728/"}

A French and English languages literature search was conducted in eight databases, without restrictions on dates of publication. Thirty studies were selected. Results were summarized according to three aspects: 1) types of violence experienced by young immigrants; 2) conditions under which this violence occurs; 3) effects of such violence on the health and well-being of young immigrants. Immigrant children and adolescents can experience various forms of physical, verbal, and relational violence. This violence seems to be mostly instigated by their peers and it has mainly been studied in terms of discrimination. Victimization may vary depending on factors such as ethnic composition of schools or time of residence in the host society. Violence may have many effects on mental health of immigrant youth: it is associated with both increased psychopathological symptoms and poorer mental health. Finally, the experience of violence is related to a more negative attitude of young immigrants toward their host society and a more positive attitude toward their own cultural community. In addition to its having numerous adverse effects on their mental and social health and well-being, violence may prove to be a key factor in the experience of marginalization of immigrant youth.

Studies carried out in Kenya suggest a need for a robust service for the treatment, prevention, and promotion of child and adolescent mental health. Despite a few existing services to provide treatment and management of mental health disorders, we need more knowledge about their effectiveness in the management of these disorders. This paper describes a study protocol that aims to evaluate the process and outcomes of psychotherapies offered to children and adolescents seeking mental health services at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya. This study will use a prospective cohort approach that will follow adolescent patients (12-17 years of age) receiving mental health services in the youth clinics at the Kenyatta National Hospital for a period of 12 months. During this time a mixed methods research will be carried out, focusing on treatment outcomes, therapeutic relationship, understanding of psychotherapy, and other mental health interventions offered to the young patients. In this proposed study, we define outcome as the alleviation of symptoms, which will be assessed quantitatively using longitudinal patient data collected session-wise. Process refers to the mechanisms identified to promote change in the adolescent. For example, individual participant or clinician characteristics, therapeutic alliance will be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In each session, assessments will be used to reduce problems due to attrition and to enable calculation of longitudinal change trajectories using growth curve modeling. For this study, these will be referred to as session-wise assessments. Qualitative work will include interviews with adolescent patients, their caregivers as well as feedback from the mental health care providers on existing services and their barriers to providing care. This study aims to understand the mechanisms through which change takes place beyond the context of psychotherapy.

Understanding the relationship between unemployment and specific mental health outcomes is crucial for formulating effective policy interventions. This study examines the relationship between unemployment and mental disorders across 201 countries from 1970 to 2020. Using a fixed-effects model, we analyze the impact of unemployment on various mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use, and eating disorders, with a focus on demographic variations. The analysis reveals a significant positive association between unemployment and mental disorders, particularly anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Moreover, distinct patterns emerge, linking unemployment to higher rates of drug use and eating disorders in specific demographics. These findings underscore the critical interplay between socio-economic factors and mental health, highlighting the need for proactive strategies to address the dual burden of unemployment and mental health disorders. Targeted interventions, such as employment support programs and accessible mental health services, are essential to improve global mental health outcomes. These initiatives can also alleviate the economic burden of unemployment by boosting workforce participation and productivity.

This study examined the impact of trial setting on user behavior by directly comparing reported user engagement in trial-based research and objective measures of real-world usage of the same unguided mental health programs. The authors conducted a systematic search for papers reporting user engagement with off-the-shelf unguided e-mental health programs. Real-world usage was obtained from a panel that presents aggregated nonpersonal information on user engagement with digital programs across the world. A total of 13 papers yielding 14 comparable usage metrics met all inclusion criteria. In three papers reporting the use of programs by lay users without any proactive trial procedures, the ratios calculated by dividing the usage reported in the paper by the usage documented within the objective dataset were 0.84, 1.05, and 1.27-suggesting a sufficient criterion validity for our examination. In studies that proactively recruited users and included pre- to post-assessment procedures (11 comparisons), the median program usage rate reported was 4.06 times higher (IQR = 4.49) than the real-world usage of the same program. Severity of clinical symptoms, in-person versus remote assessment procedures, study design, and program cost had no impact on these differences.

Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eight papers were included in the review. The interventions used in the studies were diverse and the research was heterogeneous; therefore, narrative synthesis of the results was conducted. The findings from the studies are considered in terms of the contribution the activities make to building resilience of children and young people. It was found that participating in arts activities can have a positive effect on self-confidence, self-esteem, relationship building and a sense of belonging, qualities which have been associated with resilience and mental wellbeing.

Forensic patients represent a subgroup at one end of a spectrum of such criminalization, typically with histories of serious violence and psychotic illness. Strategies for decriminalizing mental illness in this context should consider a range of approaches, including intervening to prevent CJS contact in those with severe mental illness, particularly in the early or emerging stages of psychosis. However, it may be that even gold standard mental healthcare applied universally is insufficient to address CJS contact risks. While there is now an extensive literature documenting the relatively low rates of repeat CJS contact for forensic patients released from secure care, appropriate comparison groups are lacking and the key ingredients of any benefits of treatment are unknown. The CJS may well have something to learn from forensic mental health systems and services given the abject failure to stem rates of prison-release reoffending internationally.

In 2006, a prominent review of the clinical significance of loneliness was published. However, there has not been a comprehensive update on known and emerging risk factors and correlates of loneliness since then. Furthermore, there is no conceptual model that has been developed to better account for the complexity of loneliness and to inform the development of evidence-based solutions as we challenge the issues of the twenty-first century. We reviewed the current literature to identify either known or emerging risk factors and correlates of loneliness since 2006.

We synthesized the literature according to a new proposed conceptual model of loneliness which showed the interplay between known and emerging correlates and risk factors from demography, health, to socio-environmental factors. In the conceptual model of loneliness, we illustrated how solutions can be delivered and tailored to an individual based on their life circumstances and preferences.

We report on the results of an international multi- and inter-disciplinary three-round Delphi survey completed by 135 mental health experts from 37 countries. We asked these experts to identify and rank the main ethical, social, and cultural challenges of screening for child and adolescent mental health problems in developing nations, and to propose solutions for each challenge. Thirty-nine significant challenges emerged around eight themes, along with 32 potential solutions organized into seven themes. There was a high degree of consensus among the experts, but a few interesting disagreements arose between members of the panel from high-income countries and those from low- and middle-income nations. The panelists overwhelmingly supported mental health screening for children and adolescents. They recommended ensuring local acceptance and support for screening prior to program initiation, along with careful and comprehensive protection of human rights; integrating screening procedures into primary care; designing and implementing culturally appropriate screening tools, programs, and follow-up; securing long-term funding; expanding capacity building; and task-shifting screening to local non-specialists. These recommendations can serve as a guide for policy and decision-making, resource allocation, and international cooperation. They also offer a novel approach to reduce the burden of these disorders by encouraging their timely and context-sensitive prevention and management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32834012/"}

A national Norwegian cohort of 11-year-old EP/ELBW children, excluding those with intellectual disabilities, non-ambulatory cerebral palsy, blindness and/or deafness, was assessed. Parents and teachers completed the SDQ. Mean scores and scores ≥90th percentile for the control group, combined (parent and/or teacher reporting the child ≥90th percentile), and pervasive ratings (both parent and teacher reporting the child ≥90th percentile) were presented. The controls consisted of an unselected population of all 11-year-old children born in 1995 who attended public or private schools in Bergen. Of the eligible children, 216 (64%) EP/ELBW and 1882 (61%) control children participated. The EP/ELBW children had significantly higher scores and/or increased risk of parent, teacher, combined, and pervasive rated hyperactivity/inattention, emotional-, and peer problems (OR 2.1-6.3). Only parents reported the EP/ELBW children to be at an increased risk of conduct problems (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.6).

Despite this, little is known about how often these interventions are used for children and adolescents. This global scoping review set out to: (1) map the current evidence around mental health detentions of children and adolescents (< 18 years); (2) identify the clinical, sociodemographic, and behavioural factors associated with detention; and (3) document the views of professionals and young people on the implementation of mental health legislation. After searching databases of peer-reviewed literature and citation chaining, 42 articles from 15 jurisdictions were included. About one fifth of psychiatric admissions in national register data were detentions, however trends were only available for a few high-income Western countries. The circumstances justifying detention and the criteria authorising detention varied between studies, with a mix of clinical factors and observed behaviours reported as the reason(s) warranting/precipitating a detention. Particular groups were more likely to experience detention, such as children and adolescents from minority ethnic communities and those with a documented history of abuse. There was a notable absence of qualitative research exploring the views of professionals or children and adolescents on detention. Further research is needed to explore the impact of detention on those aged < 18 years, including national register-based studies and qualitative studies.

Our aim was to test for associations between childhood adversity or substance misuse and psychiatric disorders among young offenders. Sentenced adolescent offenders were recruited from young offenders' institutions or community centres provided by the Chilean National Service for Minors. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, conducted by trained psychologists. A trained sociologist used an ad hoc interview to collect information about childhood experiences, including parenting, trauma, education and substance misuse. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyse data. The most prevalent psychiatric disorders among the 935 participants were marijuana dependence disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Substance use disorders were less frequent among young offenders who were serving their sentence in young offenders' institutions than among those serving in community centres and more frequent among those who started to use marijuana at an earlier age. Among other variables, childhood maltreatment was related to major depressive disorder, and maternal death to anxiety disorders. Higher educational status was related to a lower frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders. Our findings suggest that greater efforts must be made to identify vulnerable young people much earlier. Few of these young offenders with mental health problems had been well adjusted in health, education or socially before this period of detention. © 2017 The Authors.

The present study assessed the association between the amount of time spent playing video games and children mental health as well as cognitive and social skills. Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Europe project conducted in six European Union countries (youth ages 6-11, n = 3195). Child mental health was assessed by parents and teachers using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and by children themselves with the Dominic Interactive. Child video game usage was reported by the parents. Teachers evaluated academic functioning. Multivariable logistic regressions were used. 20 % of the children played video games more than 5 h per week. Factors associated with time spent playing video games included being a boy, being older, and belonging to a medium size family. Having a less educated, single, inactive, or psychologically distressed mother decreased time spent playing video games. Children living in Western European countries were significantly less likely to have high video game usage (9.66 vs 20.49 %) though this was not homogenous. Once adjusted for child age and gender, number of children, mothers age, marital status, education, employment status, psychological distress, and region, high usage was associated with 1.75 times the odds of high intellectual functioning (95 % CI 1.31-2.33), and 1.88 times the odds of high overall school competence (95 % CI 1.44-2.47). Once controlled for high usage predictors, there were no significant associations with any child self-reported or mother- or teacher-reported mental health problems. High usage was associated with decreases in peer relationship problems [OR 0.41 (0.2-0.86) and in prosocial deficits (0.23 (0.07, 0.81)]. Playing video games may have positive effects on young children. Understanding the mechanisms through which video game use may stimulate children should be further investigated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26846228/"}

A systematic search for studies exploring the role of companion animals in the management of mental health conditions was undertaken by searching 9 databases and undertaking a scoping review of grey literature from the earliest record until March 2017. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be published in English and report on primary data related to the relationship between domestic animal ownership and the management of diagnosable mental health conditions. Synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken in parallel using a narrative synthesis informed by an illness work theoretical framework. A total of 17 studies were included in the review. Quantitative evidence relating to the benefits of pet ownership was mixed with included studies demonstrating positive, negative and neutral impacts of pet ownership. Qualitative studies illuminated the intensiveness of connectivity people with companion animals reported, and the multi-faceted ways in which pets contributed to the work associated with managing a mental health condition, particularly in times of crisis. The negative aspects of pet ownership were also highlighted, including the practical and emotional burden of pet ownership and the psychological impact that losing a pet has. This review suggests that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions.

Critically, residing in a setting that fails to evoke desired emotions and perceptions may have important implications for psychological wellbeing. Although previous research has investigated the relationship between student satisfaction and architecture/building amenities, little research has investigated how the ambiance of students' residences relates to mental health. Across a pair of studies, we evaluate the relationship between actual-ideal ambiance congruency (A-IAC) and mental health outcomes and mood. In Study 1, participants completed a pair of Q-sort tasks that required them to describe both their ideal room ambiance and their current room's actual ambiance. The discrepancy between these sorts was predictive of depressive symptoms, even when controlling for key covariates (e.g., personality, health, academics). In Study 2, these results were replicated among roommate pairs using dyadic analyses, while also being predictive of anxiety symptoms. Collectively, these studies reveal a novel environmental predictor of student wellbeing that can be of value for university staff. Ultimately, these findings suggest that having the ability to create one's ideal space may prove to be beneficial and possibly protective for the mental health of undergraduate university students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37786342/"}

In this article, I discuss ethical issues regarding the use of NTA techniques in psychiatric contexts. First, I consider the notion of neurotechnological \"thought apprehension,\" as well as some limitations of present-day NTA applications. Next, I identify ethical priorities for its possible future use in psychiatry.

Eighty-seven migrants coming from different Latin American and African countries were interviewed using an adaptation of the Measure of Quality of Life in Detention (MQLD; Bosworth & Gerlach, 2020) to measure the perceived detention environment and The Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25; Derogatis et al., 1974) to assess mental health. The results show a high prevalence of detainees with significant levels of anxiety and depression (69%) and attempts at self-harm within the detention centers (19.5%). A more positive perception of the detention environment-especially concerning institutional decency and the relationship with officers-is related to a lower degree of negative mental health symptoms. Finally, people detained for more than 2 weeks assess the detention environment more negatively than those detained for less time.

The purpose of this project was to identify salient consumer issues related to privacy in the mental health app market and to inform advocacy efforts towards promoting consumer interests. We conducted a critical content analysis of promotional (advertising) materials for prominent mental health apps in selected dominant English-speaking markets in late 2016-early 2017, updated in 2018. We identified 61 prominent mental health apps, 56 of which were still available in 2018. Apps frequently requested permission to access elements of the user's mobile device, including requesting so-called 'dangerous' permissions. Many apps encouraged users to share their own data with an online community. Nearly half of the apps (25/61, 41%) did not have a privacy policy to inform users about how and when personal information would be collected and retained or shared with third parties, despite this being a standard recommendation of privacy regulations. We consider that the app industry pays insufficient attention to protecting the privacy of mental health app users.

We implemented a mental health services delivery model that leveraged technology and task sharing to facilitate identification and treatment of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as stress, depression, anxiety and suicide risk in rural areas of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The intervention was delivered by lay village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists - ASHAs) and primary care doctors. An anti-stigma campaign was implemented prior to this activity. This paper reports the process evaluation of the intervention using mixed methods. A mixed methods pre-post evaluation assessed the intervention using quantitative service usage analytics from the server, and qualitative interviews with different stakeholders. Barriers and facilitators in implementing the intervention were identified. Health service use increased significantly at post-intervention, ASHAs could followup 78.6% of those who had screened positive, and 78.6% of the 1243 Interactive Voice Response System calls made, were successful. Most respondents were aware of the intervention. They indicated that knowledge received through the intervention empowered them to approach ASHAs and share their mental health symptoms. ASHAs and doctors opined that EDSS was useful and easy to use. Medical camps organized in villages to increase access to the doctor were received positively by all.

Recall is a growing problem: In June 2020, there were 1,359 recalled IPP prisoners. Research documents the negative mental health implications of initial imprisonment under an IPP sentence; however, little is known about experiences on licence, or post-recall. To explain how recalled IPP prisoners perceive being on licence, and in prison post-recall, to affect their mental wellbeing. We draw on 31 interviews with recalled IPP prisoners, conducted for a wider project exploring the high rates of IPP recall. Three themes emerged: a perpetual state of anxiety about recall and spending additional years behind bars; self-imposed social isolation, both in the community and in prison; and a profound sense of hopelessness. People often feel trapped in an unjust and inevitable cycle of imprisonment, with little faith in a positive future. The government must make structural changes to stop the revolving door of IPP recall. In the short term, confidential mental health support should be available to people serving IPPs in prison and the community.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33186474/"}

Selected articles were grouped in articles related to mental health (rMH) or article not related to mental health (nrMH). 946 articles were identified. Schizophrenia-related terms were used in 356 (36.03%) article rMH, which mainly reinforce negative stereotypes regarding mental illness both in rMH and nrMH groups. Over time, only in the rMH group a significant reduction of articles reinforcing negative stereotypes was found. Several factors have been identified as predictors of article reinforcing negative stereotypes: unnecessarily dramatic or sensational headline or content; inaccurate or not in the correct context use of medical terminology; emphasis to the illness rather than to the person; mental disorders are the same; disclosure of particular individual has a mental illness. Although there has been a significant reduction in stigmatizing articles, in the rMH group one article out of three reinforces negative stereotypes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551327/"}

Following his arrest, there was a public discussion of a) whether the state had a responsibility to cure individuals like Shriner before releasing them, and b) whether sex offenders could be cured at all. The WCPA was a landmark law because it shifted forensic psychology in the use of sexual criminals from an intervention model to a containment model, from a model that sought to separate out those sexual criminals who could be treated to a model that separated out sexual criminals because they could not be treated. I demonstrate here that this shift was made in response to the representation of Earl Shriner as a member of a group classified by legislators as having a coherent, recognizable and untreatable mental disorder that caused them to commit acts of sexual violence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225326/"}

The scarcity of suitable mental health measures for young people underscores the urgent need for tailored interventions to address their unique mental health challenges. This study explores the reliability and validity of the self-rated mental health measurement scale (SRMHS) for assessing Chinese youth mental health in an urban context in China, addressing a critical research gap in culturally and contextually appropriate mental health measurement instruments. The study responds to the global demand for valid and reliable health data to support mental well-being initiatives. Utilizing a sample of 3,279 participants aged 14-35 years, the study employed rigorous statistical analyses, including Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and tests for convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity, to evaluate the scale's psychometric properties. Results confirm a three-dimensional structure of the mental health scale, encompassing positive emotion, psychosocial symptoms and negative emotion, and cognitive function, demonstrating good internal consistency, reliability, and validity. Subgroup consistency categorized across gender, age, and social identity was examined, and the significant correlations between mental health scores with relevant psychological outcomes showed good concurrent validity, indicating the effectiveness of SRMHS in capturing a broad spectrum of psychological states relevant to youth development. Findings highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach to mental health assessment, reflecting global advocacy for recognizing mental well-being as not merely the absence of illness, but also the presence of positive psychological states. This study significantly contributes to the field by providing a scientifically robust and culturally sensitive tool for assessing youth mental health in China, and promotes a more inclusive and holistic approach to mental health research and practice globally.

Generic health instruments like the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) is important for the cost-utility analysis of health care interventions and calculation of quality-adjusted life years. However, the applicability of the EQ-5D health measure in Chinese patients with SpA is currently unknown. Hence, the aim of the study is to test the psychometric properties and to validate the use of the EQ-5D health measure for utility analyses in Chinese patients with SpA. Prospective and consecutive recruitment of 220 Chinese patients with SpA was conducted. Demographic data including smoking and drinking habits, education level, income, and occupation was collected. Disease-associated data including disease duration, the presence of back pain, peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease was also recorded. Questionnaires regarding disease activity and functional disability (BASDAI, BASFI, BASGI, BASMI, ASDAS, ODI), mental health (HADS depression and anxiety), and the EQ-5D scores were recorded. SF-36 scores were used to verify the findings. Baseline correlations were performed along with test-retest reliability, validity, and internal consistency tests. Specifically, the relationship between EQ-5D and disease activity and functional scores was studied. EQ-5D scores achieved acceptable internal consistency and reliability. A ceiling effect was observed for all domains of the EQ-5D except for pain/discomfort. No floor effect was observed. Significant negative correlations were observed between ODI, HADS, BASFI, BASMI, BASDAI, and ASDAS-CRP and with EQ-5D. A higher disease activity was well-differentiated by EQ-5D, as with the disability and mental health scores.

This study was a qualitative examination of the organizational context as it pertained to the implementation of a workplace mental health program called Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR) in police organizations in Canada. We conducted a qualitative key informant study in 9 different policing organizations in Canada. The central theme of \"successful cultural uptake\" emerged as key to R2MR's implementation and the ability to facilitate broader culture change. Successful cultural uptake was enabled by several contextual factors, including organizational readiness, strong leadership support, ensuring good group dynamics, credibility of the trainers, implementing widely and thoroughly, and implementing R2MR as one piece of a larger puzzle. Successful cultural uptake was also described as enabling R2MR's impact for broader cultural change within the organization. This enablement occurred through enhanced dialogue about mental health and the introduction of a common language, a supportive workplace culture, increased help seeking, and organizational momentum for additional mental health programming and policy initiatives. Successful uptake of R2MR has the potential to lead to promote change within policing organizations. The model derived from our research may function as a tool or roadmap to help guide other organizations in the process of or planning to implement R2MR or a similar intervention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31056932/"}

This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former's interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are <i>prima facie</i> discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim \"holding\" legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant \"permission\" for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669798/"}

The present study used an online survey to explore mental health factors, personality characteristics, subjective experiences, and the impact of channeling on 83 participants who self-identified as trance channelers. Most participants endorsed being spiritual but not religious as adults, and on average the channeling experiences began at middle age. The majority of participants did not report pathological levels of dissociative or psychotic symptoms, anxiety or depression. Compared to relevant norms, participants reported similar scores on most personality factors, psychological absorption and empathy. Participants' average scores on emotional and environmental sensitivity corresponded to being designated as sensory-processing sensitives. Participants reported high levels of noetic beliefs and experiences, particularly beliefs in life after death, non-local consciousness, and telepathy. Most participants reported that their channeling process is willful and consensual and that they are consciously aware of the channeling state while it occurs. The majority of participants also reported a positive impact of channeling on their lives. Lower psychotic symptoms, older age when the trance channeling experiences began, and higher sensitivity scores predicted a greater positive impact of trance on participants' lives. Given that trance channeling has played a role in religious and spiritual traditions around the world throughout history, the present study provides an important exploration of the trance channeling phenomenon.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268983/"}

Many young children spend a large amount of time in preschool, which have unique opportunities to promote mental health at an early stage. The aim of this study was to illuminate teachers’ views of what they do in ordinary work to promote mental health among preschool children. This qualitative study had a descriptive and exploratory design and qualitative content analysis was utilized. Six focus group interviews with preschool teachers, concerning families from different cultural, geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds, were conducted in a county in the southwest of Sweden. Both manifest and latent content appeared. Three categories, ‘structured world’, ‘pleasant climate’ and ‘affirming the child’ and 10 subcategories emerged. The latent content of these categories is described under the theme ‘creating an atmosphere where each child can flourish in harmony with their environment’. The results show teachers different working approaches with mental health in preschool and together with previous research these results can provide a basis of knowledge for preschool teachers and inspire them to develop and maintain their health-promoting work. In future studies it should be particularly interesting to investigate how the promotive way to work can be transferred to strengthen mental health throughout the school years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28180266/"}

Two instances of mental health care for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are described in this reflective piece of writing. The care provided in both instances was culturally inappropriate and/or inadequate. I was an agent or observer in both cases, which happened during my employment as a mental health nurse in Australia. The first story, 'the traumatisation of Client A' describes an instance where I, from a place of ignorance, acted without cultural sensitivity and knowledge. I restrained and observed a client in a way that accorded with workplace policy but, at the same time, failed to take into account the circumstances and cultural safety of my client. The second story, 'the misunderstandings about Client B', occurred much later in my career. This time, I engaged with the client, acted with cultural safety, listened to his story and was able to clear up misunderstandings surrounding his presentation to hospital. The two events described in this article led me to discover the nurse I was then and the nurse I have become now.

Materials and Methods: The study, using valid psycho-diagnostic methods, was conducted in 3 stages: studying the frequency of mental states, Mental Health Continuum, and occupational self-efficacy. Using descriptive and analytical statistics, we analyzed the results obtained from 114 respondents. Results: It was found that in the majority of the study group, regardless of the position held (manager, doctor, nurse), the levels of anxiety, frustration, aggressiveness, and rigidity were low (64.0%-50.9% of respondents); flourishing and high development of occupational self-efficacy were recorded in 59.6% and 61.0%, staff of HCFs respectively. A small proportion of specialists (10.5%-4.4%) revealed a high level of manifestation of mental states; languishing and a low level of professional self-efficacy were practically absent. In other study participants, all indicators were at the borderline level. Conclusions: Almost 2 years of functioning in the context of the war has led to the development of a certain adaptation and resilience in all categories of healthcare employees, which allows them to fulfill their professional duties. At the same time, there is a significant number of healthcare professionals who have moderate and high levels of mental stress, and problems with mental health stability, which requires systemic decisions to be made at the sectoral level to ensure the mental health of staff of healthcare facilities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38865622/"}

We accessed repeated cross-sectional data from the annual Health Interview Survey, for the period 2004-2011 among adults (n target districts=1445, n rest of the Netherlands=44 795). We used multilevel logistic regression models to compare the development of mental health in the target districts with the rest of the Netherlands and with comparably deprived districts. Results were presented as 'slope estimates' with corresponding 95% CIs. Finally, we analysed the trends by gender and by the intensity of the programme. The trend change in mental health between the intervention and preintervention period was approximately the same in the target districts as in broadly comparably deprived control districts (Δ slope 0.06 (-0.08 to 0.20)). However, among women, a tendency was found towards more positive trend changes in the target districts compared with control districts (Δ slope 0.17 (-0.01 to 0.34)). Those districts that implemented an intensive programme experienced an improvement in mental health, while residents of the comparably deprived control districts experienced a deterioration, resulting in a statistically significantly more positive trend change between the preintervention and intervention period in those target districts (Δ slope 0.19 (0.01 to 0.38)). Implementing an urban regeneration programme with a wide range of intensive interventions may be effective in promoting good mental health. Further research is required to examine which mix of interventions is needed for the programme to be effective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27053684/"}

Qualitative data from a two-year period were thematically analysed from one participating site in a multi-site trial of employment services integrated with public funded community mental health treatment and care. Both positive and negative themes arose. Positive themes included: Aspirations for a better life, receiving feedback on good job performance, employment displacing preoccupation with illness, and employment improving self-esteem and reducing financial stress. Negative themes included stigma experiences, stress, and health difficulties. Both positive and negative experiences did not depend on type of employment service assistance nor key client characteristics such as age, sex, and diagnostic category. Despite its many benefits, employment can also increase the risk of negative personal experiences.

In this study, we explored these time-varying associations. We used data from the first four waves (October, 2013, to February, 2017) of a national refugee-based longitudinal study, the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) project. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and high risk of severe mental illness (HR-SMI) were used to assess mental health. The independent variables included the number of potentially traumatic events experienced during the pre-migration process, and a range of post-migration stressors. We used logistic regression models to analyse the relative importance of variables and time-varying associations between the pre-migration potentially traumatic events, post-migration resettlement stressors, and refugees' mental health. Analyses were stratified by gender, and sociodemographic covariates included age, marital status, education level, country of birth, and weekly income. 2399 participants were surveyed in Wave 1 of the BNLA project in 2013-14, of whom 2009 (83·7%) responded in Wave 2 in 2014-15, 1894 (78·9%) in Wave 3 in 2015-16, and 1929 (80·4%) in Wave 4 in 2016-17. The three most important factors associated with mental health in each wave differed for male and female refugees, but the socioeconomic stressors of loneliness and adjustment to life in Australia were consistently prominent. Positive associations between socioeconomic stressors and mental ill-health were found for both genders, with a peak at Wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] among men, 1·60 [95% CI 1·26-2·03], p=0.0001 for PTSD; AOR 1·86 [1·35-2·55], p=0·0001 for HR-SMI; and among women, AOR 1·81 [1·27-2·57], p=0·0009 for PTSD; AOR 2·24 [1·49-3·38], p=0·0001 for HR-SMI). Associations between loneliness and mental health fluctuated, but were significant for both genders in Wave 4 (among men, AOR 1·90 [1·21-2·99], p=0·0051 for PTSD; AOR 3·70 [2·18-6·27], p<0·0001 for HR-SMI; and among women, AOR 3·65 [2·08-6·39], p<0·0001 for PTSD; AOR 3·68 [2·02-6·69], p<0·0001 for HR-SMI). The association between difficulties in adjustment to life in Australia and male refugees' mental ill-health increased continuously during the resettlement period. Gender-specific and time-sensitive services should be considered to improve refugees' mental health. For both genders, improved economic conditions that complement social security benefits deserve attention and are relevant throughout the resettlement process. At the later stage of resettlement, services to reduce loneliness could be carried out, and reducing stressors related to adjustment to life in the host country is especially needed for male refugees.

Cross-lagged longitudinal analyses using structural equation models enable the estimation of the relative size of these pathways which would be useful in determining the relative importance of the health selection hypothesis over the social causation hypothesis. Data from four phases of the Whitehall II study (initially consisting of 10,308 men and women aged 35-55 in the British civil service) were collected over a 10 year period. There was no evidence for an effect of mental (GHQ-30 and SF36) or physical health (SF-36) on changes in employment grade. When financial deprivation was used as a measure of social position, there was a significant effect of mental health on changes in social position among men although this health selection effect was over two and a half times smaller than the effect of social position on changes in health.

While prior studies have debated the psychological effects of social media, little is known about how short-form video consumption affects rural populations. This study investigates the causal relationship between short video consumption and mental health among rural residents in China. We use longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies and apply a Difference-in-Differences strategy to estimate the impact of frequent short video usage on mental health. To address self-selection and staggered treatment timing, we employ Propensity Score Matching and heterogeneity-robust difference-in-differences estimators. Robustness checks include placebo tests and an event study analysis. We find that short video consumption appears to improve mental health among rural residents. The effect is immediate and significant only in the first year of exposure, but fades in subsequent periods. Mechanism analysis suggests that the improvements are driven by enhanced entertainment and information access rather than increased social interaction. The effects are more pronounced in economically underdeveloped and less pandemic-affected regions, but not evident among urban residents. Short videos provide short-term mental health benefits for rural Chinese residents by enriching their leisure and information access, especially in less developed areas. However, their positive effect is transient and cannot offset pandemic-related stress.

Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale >17). A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment).

First, mental health deteriorated between 1993 and 2019 for all population groups examined. Second, these declines are associated with higher predicted death rates and help explain worsening mortality trends for prime-age non-Hispanic Whites and, to a lesser extent, non-Hispanic Blacks between 1999 and 2019. Third, while these correlations lend some support to the broader idea of \"deaths of despair,\" the specific causes comprising them appear to be both more expansive and different from those previously emphasized. Fourth, heterogeneity in how worsening mental distress affects mortality-rather than in mental health trends themselves-is more important in explaining Black-White disparities in its overall impact. Finally, in the primary specifications, deteriorating mental health accounts for an estimated 9 % to 29 % of the rise in mortality rates among prime-age Whites in recent years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40466290/"}

A systematic review.", "text": "Our objective was to compare the effects on mental and physical wellbeing, health related quality of life and long-term adherence to physical activity, of participation in physical activity in natural environments compared with physical activity indoors. We conducted a systematic review using the following data sources: Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, GreenFILE, SportDISCUS, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index--Science and BIOSIS from inception to June 2010. Internet searches of relevant Web sites, hand searches of relevant journals, and the reference lists of included papers and other review papers identified in the search were also searched for relevant information. Controlled trials (randomized and nonrandomized) were included. To be eligible trials had to compare the effects of outdoor exercise initiatives with those conducted indoors and report on at least one physical or mental wellbeing outcome in adults or children. Screening of articles for inclusion, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of identified studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Eleven trials (833 adults) were included. Most participants (6 trials; 523 adults) were young students. Study entry criteria and methods were sparsely reported. All interventions consisted of a single episode of walking or running indoors with the same activity at a similar level conducted outdoors on a separate occasion. A total of 13 different outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on mental wellbeing, and 4 outcome measures were used to assess attitude to exercise. Most trials (n = 9) showed some improvement in mental wellbeing on one or other of the outcome measures. Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments was associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy. However, the results suggested that feelings of calmness may be decreased following outdoor exercise. Participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction with outdoor activity and declared a greater intent to repeat the activity at a later date. None of the identified studies measured the effects of physical activity on physical wellbeing or the effect of natural environments on exercise adherence. The hypothesis that there are added beneficial effects to be gained from performing physical activity outdoors in natural environments is very appealing and has generated considerable interest. This review has shown some promising effects on self-reported mental wellbeing immediately following exercise in nature which are not seen following the same exercise indoors. However, the interpretation and extrapolation of these findings is hampered by the poor methodological quality of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures employed. The review demonstrates the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations and reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area. Large, well designed, longer term trials in populations who might benefit most from the potential advantages of outdoor exercise are needed to fully elucidate the effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The influence of these effects on the sustainability of physical activity initiatives also awaits investigation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21291246/"}

Prior evidence has consistently found perceived job insecurity to be associated with poorer mental health. Nonetheless, several key under-researched areas remain in the existing evidence base. This study addresses some of these gaps by examining trajectories of job (in)security and assessing the effect of various persistent job security trajectories on subsequent mental health of both men and women. Utilising 15 waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we employed group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) to identify trajectories of job (in)security through men and women's prime working years (from baseline age of 28-38yrs to 41-51yrs) across 14 years (waves 5-18), before subsequently examining the associations between these estimated trajectories and mental health at wave 19 (aged 42-52yrs). We identified four distinct trajectories of job (in)security for both men and women: persistently secure, becoming more secure, becoming less secure, and persistently insecure. Examining the association between these trajectories and mental health, we found that chronic exposure to any amount of persistent job insecurity (improving, worsening or persistently insecure) is detrimental to the mental health of both men and women. Furthermore, a somewhat incremental or dose dependant effect was found, with persistent job insecurity associated with the largest declines in mental health scores. Given mental health disorders are a substantial cause of disability globally, our study provides evidence that developing policy and practice interventions to reduce job insecurity (as an increasingly recognised and highly modifiable social determinant of mental health) has considerable potential to enact positive population health improvements.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38663146/"}

Yet, knowledge on the costs of stress and related health problems in adolescence is missing. The present study addresses this gap by investigating direct health care costs in relation to stress, mental health problems and physical health in high school students. The sample comprised 284 pupils from four schools in Heidelberg (mean age 16.75 ± 0.64 years, 59.64% female). Self-reported health care utilization and medication intake within 1 month were translated into costs. We established correlative associations of the dichotomized overall costs (no vs. any) with stress, mental health problems and physical health within generalized structural equation models. In particular, mental health problems and physical health were examined as mediators of the association between stress and costs. An increase of stress by 1 SD corresponded increased chances for costs by OR 1.39 (Odds Ratio; 95% CI  0.13-0.53, p = 0.001). When mediators were analysed separately, both mental and physical health (problems) fully mediated the association. Yet, when examined together, only mental health problems acted as a mediator. Our results indicate the health economic relevance of stress-related mental health problems in high school students. The finding is meant to set the stage for further cost-of-illness studies of stress and related health problems, as well as economic evaluations.

We present confirmatory factor analysis models to explore the structure of psychopathology and wellbeing in early adolescents, using secondary data from a large U.K. sample (N = 1982). A simple correlated factors structure fitted the data well and revealed that wellbeing was just as related to internalising as this was to externalising symptoms. The classical bifactor solution also fitted the data well but was rejected as the general factor explained only 55% of the total common variance. S-1 models were therefore used to explore general covariance in a more robust way, and revealed that a general internalising distress factor could play an important role in all item responses.

Non-specialists (such as PCPs)' training is an internationally supported way to target untreated mental health symptoms. We aimed to evaluate the programme's impact on PCPs' mental health knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and self-reported practice, immediately following and 18 months after training. We conducted an exploratory trial with a combination of designs: a pretest-posttest control group design and a one-group pretest-posttest design were used to assess the training's short-term impact; and a repeated measures design was used to assess the training's long-term impact. The former relied on a delayed-intervention strategy: participants assigned to the control group (Group 2) received the training after the intervention group (Group 1). The intervention consisted of a weekly mhGAP-based training session (totalling 6 weeks), comprising lectures, discussions, role plays and a support session offered by trainers. Data were collected at baseline, following Group 1's training, following Group 2's training and 18 months after training. Descriptive, bivariate and ANOVA analyses were conducted. Overall, 112 PCPs were randomized to either Group 1 (n = 52) or Group 2 (n = 60).

Furthermore, we assessed whether neighborhood poverty explains and/or modifies the association. Logistic regression models were estimated separately for blacks and whites as well as for each segregation index. Higher D- and P-indices were associated with higher odds of psychological distress for blacks. Neighborhood poverty explained some, but not all, of the association. In models that allowed for the impact of metropolitan segregation to vary by neighborhood poverty, higher segregation was found to be detrimental for blacks who resided in high poverty neighborhoods but not for those living in low poverty neighborhoods. We found no evidence that segregation impacts the mental health of whites-either detrimentally or beneficially-regardless of neighborhood poverty level. The impact of segregation differs by neighborhood poverty and race. The psychological harm of structural racism, resulting in segregation and concentrated poverty, is not additive but multiplicative, reflecting a \"triple jeopardy\" for blacks, whereby their mental health is detrimentally impacted by the compounded effects of both neighborhood distress and racial segregation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30671599/"}

Perceived control over personal financial circumstances was a significant predictor of higher psychological well-being. In middle-aged and older Americans, unsecured debt has negative effects on mental health because of the associated depressive symptoms and decreased psychological well-being.

Therefore, a decrease in benzodiazepine use is expected, particularly in prolonged use. The aim of this study was to assess time trends in benzodiazepine use. Data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) were used to investigate trends in benzodiazepine use between 1992 and 2002 in two population-based samples aged 55-64 years. Differences between the two samples with respect to benzodiazepine use and to sociodemographic, physical health and mental health characteristics were described and tested with chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses. Benzodiazepine use remained stable over 10 years, with 7.8% in LASA-1 (n = 874) and 7.9% in LASA-2 (n = 919) (p = 0.90) with a persisting preponderance in women and in people with low education, low income, chronic physical diseases, functional limitations, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety complaints, sleep problems and when using antidepressants. Long-term use remained high with 70% in 1992 and 80% in 2002 of total benzodiazepine use. In the Dutch population aged 55-64, overall benzodiazepine use remained stable from 1992 to 2002, with a high proportion of long-term users, despite the effort to reduce benzodiazepine use and the renewal of the guidelines. More effort should be made to decrease prolonged benzodiazepine use in this middle-aged group, because of the increasing risks with ageing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258999/"}

While mental health practitioners need to understand the psycho-biological issues that impact the person and family with an eating disorder, there is much about this complex condition that eludes and escapes a bio-medical perspective. Use of an aesthetic lens on the issue can illuminate various challenges, tensions and insights that people with disordered eating experience along the journey of their ill-health and on to their recovery, but which often remain unstated in the clinical context. Scholars within the creative arts discipline are experts in making judgements about the quality of artworks they encounter and have highly developed aesthetic knowing. Yet, the central skills and knowledges embodied in creative arts activity are not widely utilized outside that sphere. This article reports on how aesthetics can be applied to sensitize mental health practitioners to appreciate the lived experience of a mental health challenge such as an eating disorder. Such mental health practitioners play an important role in the health service, yet the widespread diffusion of the bio-medical model into mental health, once characterized for its equal emphasis on the psycho-social-cultural, has led to criticisms of an over-focus on illness identification, at the expense of accommodating the meanings of subjective and unique experiences of mental health, struggle and recovery. Using Kate Grenville's typology of the elements of effective creative writing, we show how these elements contribute to the aesthetic power and impact of particular eating disorder memoirs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28165847/"}

We hypothesized that these two constructs would be distinct factorially, and that the derived factors would have different correlates. Correlations between scales of HQL and WB were moderate. When the nineteen scales were factored, four factors were extracted with HQL and WB scales generally loading on separate factors. The factors had distinct patterns of relations with general quality of life, personality, and the presence of a health problem, controlling for sociodemographics. These results suggest that HQL is distinct from the older construct of well-being. Although the two constructs are conceptually related, there is only a moderate amount of statistical overlap between them. Gerontologists should readily adopt health-related quality of life, which maintains continuity with such classics as well-being. This new construct, although needing slight alterations to broaden its assessment of well-being and life satisfaction, holds promise as more than an accessory in the study of health and well-being among older persons.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11087109/"}

IRaMuTeq software with similarity analysis, descending hierarchical classification and thematic analysis, was used to process the data. It was observed that theoretical support indicates a greater occurrence of psychopathology, problematizing the risk of reproducing the medicalizing psychiatric paradigm. It is also possible to identify the need to address mental health in primary care in training. The main achievements of residency training consist of dialogue with human rights and innovation in educational processes, trends towards the decolonial debate on madness, and challenges in disputes over models of care. It is argued that the path to an anti-asylum praxis is based on an understanding of the genesis of madness and the processes of social exclusion, since providing care in freedom requires an existential territory for broadening the ways of improving life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40298734/"}

It updates older and broader reviews that included weaker studies or those that did not analyze permanent housing as an input and housing and mental health as primary outcomes. The literature search (1980-2013) yielded 14 studies (randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies). The studies found that a majority of participants placed in experimental housing programs with case management support remained in housing for at least one year or experienced more days housed than homeless relative to a comparison group. Although this finding is in line with previous literature reviews on permanent supportive housing, this analysis found limitations in each of the 14 reviewed studies, such as attrition, selection and response bias, imprecise definitions and implementation of housing programs, and a lack of appropriate controls. Only three of the reviewed studies reported using a housing fidelity assessment tool to test whether the housing intervention was faithful to theoretical standards, and conceptions and implementation of housing varied widely across studies, threatening internal and external validity. Pitfalls in the best available studies on permanent supportive housing programs in the United States limit the ability of research to inform the policy goal of ending chronic homelessness and demonstrate a need for further experimental research upon which to make funding and policy decisions, especially in light of prioritized federal funds.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25873027/"}

A qualitative, Black Emancipatory Action Research Framework was adopted. Framework application involved adequately compensating community organisations for their consultancy role; having 'research conversations' rather than interviewing participants; and focusing outputs on community benefit. Eight individual and group research conversations took place with nine Black directors, employees and volunteers working with Black-led community organisations, aged between 19 and 62, living in the UK. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse conversations. Three themes were developed in relation to what Black-led community organisations do for Black mental health. These are: identify and respond to mental health needs; selectively build relationships with mainstream services; and drive social and systemic improvements. Findings revealed that Black-led community organisations uniquely identify and address mental wellbeing by offering respite from racism, hosting activities, and meeting urgent needs. They navigate and facilitate access to health and social systems, protect communities from harmful services, and advocate for social and systemic change. Drawing on the study design, findings, and the broader literature, we propose three key changes to current funding, community, and research practices. These are a reconsideration of how Black-led organisations' work is valued and measured, a forging of greater collaboration between these organisations, and bolder consideration of how research practice can benefit Black communities. Black-led organisations play multiple roles in supporting individual and collective mental health, crucial for mediating the effects of racism and mitigating ethnic inequalities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to both illuminate the critical role of community organisations in promoting Black mental health in the UK and to prioritise participant, and community, benefit throughout the research process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39788116/"}

Research highlights the importance of mental health literacy (MHL) training for educators; few studies have evaluated a program designed to improve it. The purpose was to assess the impact of a two-session, virtual workshop offered 10 weeks apart for postsecondary educators on MHL and self-efficacy to recommend mental health resources to students. Content was co-created and delivered in collaboration with the university's Student Health and Wellness department. Validated questionnaires were used to assess MHL, self-efficacy, and psychological well-being before and after each session. Open-ended questions were posed following the second session to explore experiences. Educators at the host institution who did not enrol were invited to complete the same quantitative measures to serve as comparative data. Seven participants attended both workshops and were included in the analysis. Scores for MHL and self-efficacy increased following each session and were highest following the second, revealing medium and large effect sizes, respectively. Post-workshop MHL and self-efficacy scores were higher for workshop attendees compared to their institutional counterparts (n = 28). Positive experiences (e.g. group camaraderie, improved empathy and understanding, workshop utility) were noted qualitatively. Findings suggest that this type of virtual workshop may be valuable for equipping educators with knowledge and self-efficacy to enhance student mental health. Postsecondary wellness centre partnerships should be considered to facilitate reach of mental health education and resources.

The existing literature on interventions that offer support, advice and/or treatment to sick doctors has not yet been synthesised in a way that considers the complexity and heterogeneity of the interventions, and the many dimensions of the problem. We (1) reviewed interventions to tackle doctors' and medical students' mental ill-health and its impacts on the clinical workforce and patient care-drawing on diverse literature sources and engaging iteratively with diverse stakeholder perspectives-and (2) produced recommendations that support the tailoring, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of contextually sensitive strategies to tackle mental ill-health and its impacts. Realist literature review consistent with the RAMESES quality and reporting standards. Sources for inclusion were identified through bibliographic database searches supplemented by purposive searches-resulting also from engagement with stakeholders. Data were extracted from included articles and subjected to realist analysis to identify (i) mechanisms causing mental ill-health in doctors and medical students and relevant contexts or circumstances when these mechanisms were likely to be 'triggered' and (ii) 'guiding principles' and features underpinning the interventions and recommendations discussed mostly in policy document, reviews and commentaries. One hundred seventy-nine records were included. Most were from the USA (45%) and were published since 2009 (74%). The analysis showed that doctors were more likely to experience mental ill-health when they felt isolated or unable to do their job and when they feared repercussions of help-seeking. Healthy staff were necessary for excellent patient care. Interventions emphasising relationships and belonging were more likely to promote wellbeing. Interventions creating a people-focussed working culture, balancing positive/negative performance and acknowledging positive/negative aspects of a medical career helped doctors to thrive. The way that interventions were implemented seemed critically important. Doctors and medical students needed to have confidence in an intervention for the intervention to be effective. Successful interventions to tackle doctors' and students' mental ill-health are likely to be multidimensional and multilevel and involve multiple stakeholders. Evaluating and improving existing interventions is likely to be more effective than developing new ones. Our evidence synthesis provides a basis on which to do this. PROSPERO CRD42017069870.

Prevalence of any form of childhood sexual abuse was statistically equivalent to national rates, except that females reported less involuntary penetration (OR = 0.53). All Jewish religious groups reported equivalent levels of sexual abuse, except that history of involuntary penetration was greater among formerly (but not presently) Orthodox Jews (OR = 3.00).

Although recognising that no gold standard measures exist and that all existing measures are flawed in one way or another, anxiety and depression research is spearheading a common metrics movement to harmonise measurement, with several initiatives over the past 5 years recommending the consistent use of specific scales to allow read-across of measurements between studies. For this approach to flourish, however, common metrics must be acceptable and adaptable to a range of contexts and populations, and global access should be as easy and affordable as possible, including in low-income countries. Within a measurement landscape dominated by fixed proprietary measures and with competing views of what should be measured, achieving this goal poses a range of challenges. In this Personal View, we consider tensions between affordability, sustainability, consistency, and adaptability that, if not addressed, risk undermining the common metrics agenda. We outline a three-pronged way forward that involves funders taking more direct responsibility for measure development and dissemination; a move towards managing measure dissemination and adaptation via open-access measure hubs; and transitioning from fixed questionnaires to item banks.

The Wounded Warrior Recovery Project examines patient-reported outcomes in a cohort of US military personnel wounded in combat. Participants were identified from the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database, a US Navy-maintained deployment health database, and invited to complete a web-based survey.

Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the unique contribution of each set of antecedents on HRQOL scores. HRQOL was uniquely associated with a number of demographics, and service- and injury-related characteristics.

In most healthcare problems, however, there is a plethora of competing interventions. Network meta-analysis allows to rank competing interventions and evaluate their relative effectiveness even if they have not been compared in an individual trial. The aim of this paper is to explain and discuss the main features of this statistical technique. We present the key assumptions underlying network meta-analysis and the graphical methods to visualise results and information in the network. We used one illustrative example that compared the relative effectiveness of 15 antimanic drugs and placebo in acute mania. A network plot allows to visualise how information flows in the network and reveals important information about network geometry. Discrepancies between direct and indirect evidence can be detected using inconsistency plots. Relative effectiveness or safety of competing interventions can be presented in a league table. A contribution plot reveals the contribution of each direct comparison to each network estimate. A comparison-adjusted funnel plot is an extension of simple funnel plot to network meta-analysis.

There is limited research carried out with military veterans and, to date, there is no review of existing evidence. To synthesize and examine the evidence exploring aspects of social isolation and loneliness of military veterans, using a systematic narrative review strategy. A database search was carried out utilizing relevant search criterion. Seven databases were searched for publications with no date restrictions. Articles were included if they involved veterans and either social isolation or loneliness. The initial search returned 484 papers, after exclusions, removal of duplications, and a reference/citation search, 17 papers remained and were included in this review. The retrieved papers examined four areas of loneliness and social isolation: prevalence of loneliness in the veteran population, experiences related to military service as impacting loneliness or social isolation, the relationship between mental health and loneliness or social isolation, and interventions to combat loneliness and social isolation. Differences between the experiences of younger and older veterans were also highlighted. It is evident that military veterans present unique experiences of loneliness and social isolation, especially older veterans.

Despite this, there is limited knowledge regarding their mental health training opportunities. <b>Methods:</b> To identify predictors of satisfaction with mental health training opportunities and assess the relationship between training opportunities and clinician comfort in managing mental health comorbidities, we conducted a secondary analysis of a nationwide survey involving 708 PC clinicians. <b>Results:</b> Satisfaction with mental health training was moderate (M = 2.75/5, SD = .915). Access to lectures/webinars was the most common training opportunity (54%). Significant predictors of satisfaction with training included access to lectures/webinars (β = .328, <i>P</i> <.001) and case discussions (β = .231, <i>P</i> = .007). Academic practice settings and satisfactory mental health referrals were associated with a greater number of different training opportunities.

Several studies examining the level of public knowledge about the nature and dynamics of mental illness in sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade had concluded that such knowledge was poor and had called for further public enlightenment. What was thought to be mental health 'ignorance' has also been blamed for poor mainstream service utilization. These views however assume that non-alignment of the views of community dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa with the biomedical understanding of mental illness connotes 'ignorance', and that correcting such 'ignorance' will translate to improvements in service utilization. Within the framework of contemporary thinking in mental health literacy, this paper argues that such assumptions are not culturally nuanced and may have overrated the usefulness of de-contextualized public engagement in enhancing mental health service utilization in the region.

Outcomes were pharmacy, inpatient and outpatient costs in 2012 dollars. Least-square covariate adjusted estimates from the joint model of total VA costs of the number of MHV using December 31, 2012 value dollars indicate that relative to those with fewer MHV, those with 3+ MHV had the lowest mean inpatient cost ($21,406), but the highest mean outpatient and pharmacy cost ($9,727 and $2,015, respectively).

Functional data analysis (FDA) may overcome such limitations by fully exploiting the richness of actigraphy data and revealing important relationships with mental health outcomes. To our knowledge, no studies have extensively used FDA to study the relationship between sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, sampling, and psychiatric clinical characteristics and daily motor activity patterns assessed with actigraphy in a sample of individuals with and without depression/anxiety. We aimed to study the association between daily motor activity patterns assessed via actigraphy and (1) sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, and sampling factors, and (2) psychiatric clinical characteristics (ie, presence and severity of depression/anxiety disorders). We obtained 14-day continuous actigraphy data from 359 participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety with current (n=93), remitted (n=176), or no (n=90) depression/anxiety diagnosis, based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Associations between patterns of daily motor activity, quantified via functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, sampling, and psychiatric clinical characteristics were assessed using generalized estimating equation regressions. For exploratory purposes, function-on-scalar regression (FoSR) was applied to quantify the time-varying association of sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, sampling, and psychiatric clinical characteristics on daily motor activity. Four components of daily activity patterns captured 77.4% of the variability in the data: overall daily activity level (fPCA1, 34.3% variability), early versus late morning activity (fPCA2, 16.5% variability), biphasic versus monophasic activity (fPCA3, 14.8% variability), and early versus late biphasic activity (fPCA4, 11.8% variability). A low overall daily activity level was associated with a number of sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, and psychopathology variables: older age (P<.001), higher education level (P=.005), higher BMI (P=.009), greater number of chronic diseases (P=.02), greater number of cigarettes smoked per day (P=.02), current depressive and/or anxiety disorders (P=.05), and greater severity of depressive symptoms (P<.001). A high overall daily activity level was associated with work/school days (P=.02) and summer (reference: winter; P=.03). Earlier morning activity was associated with older age (P=.02), having a partner (P=.009), work/school days (P<.001), and autumn and spring (reference: winter; P=.02 and P<.001, respectively). Monophasic activity was associated with older age (P=.005). Biphasic activity was associated with work/school days (P<.001) and summer (reference: winter; P<.001). Earlier biphasic activity was associated with older age (P=.005), work/school days (P<.001), and spring and summer (reference: winter; P<.001 and P=.005, respectively). In FoSR analyses, age, work/school days, and season were the main determinants having a time-varying association with daily motor activity (all P<.05). Features of daily motor activity extracted with fPCA reflect commonly studied factors such as the intensity of daily activity and preference for morningness/eveningness. The presence and severity of depression/anxiety disorders were found to be associated mainly with a lower overall activity pattern but not with the time of the activity. Age, work/school days, and season were the variables most strongly associated with patterns and time of activity, and thus future epidemiological studies on motor activity in depression/anxiety should take these variables into account.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33595445/"}

These findings are juxtaposed with a policing policy scan concerning the Ontario and Canadian contexts.

We review the available evidence on the use and impact of restraints in patient transfer to emergency departments from police settings, highlight police practices in four Ontario jurisdictions, and summarize recommendations from police and mental health advocates regarding mental health transfers. Synthesizing the available evidence, policies, and procedures, we illustrate that the Ontario-wide variability in both who transfers PMI on a Form 1 to hospital and whether restraints are utilized reflect systemic failures to utilize least restrictive means of transfer.

We hypothesized that PWE who report normal activity limitations due to epilepsy and poor social/emotional support would report poor mental health regardless of whether they report having seizures in the past 3 months or currently taking medication for their epilepsy. In 2005 and 2006, twenty-two states asked about epilepsy in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A set of survey weight-adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine self-reported poor mental health. Our findings reveal that both normal activity limitations due to epilepsy and poor social/emotional support are significant predictors of reporting poor mental health. After controlling for social support, demographics, comorbidities, and health behaviors we determined that those reporting normal activity limitations due to epilepsy are more likely to report poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-6.58). Similarly, after controlling for the same factors, PWE with poor social/emotional support are more likely to report poor mental health (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.84-5.61).

After its abolition in 2012, many IPP-prisoners have become stuck in the prison system, facing considerable problems of sentence progression. The extant literature makes clear that the uncertainty and hopelessness caused by the indeterminacy of the IPP sentence are compounded by the negative impacts experienced by families and others providing support to people serving these sentences. The mental strains caused for family members by the IPP sentence were examined. Of particular interest is the role and weight of the parole process experience, and its potential mental and physiological health impact on families. This article draws on findings from two qualitative research projects conducted with families of prisoners serving the IPP sentence in England and Wales. Their experiences will be examined by reference to literature on the mental health impact of indeterminate sentences on prisoners and their families and the wider literature on the symbiotic harms of imprisonment for families. The aim was to add to this by focusing on families' experiences of cumulative stress caused by the sentence. We demonstrate that the IPP parole process exerts specific weight and mental strains on family members occupying the negative end of the stress spectrum. Drawing on a body of neuroscientific, neuroendocrinological and criminological literature, we argue that these mental health impacts on families may represent a public health risk in need of practical and policy mitigation. There is a pressing need for recognition of what are often hidden symbiotic harms experienced by families of people sentenced to IPP. Families require more information as well as considerably greater practical and emotional support on an institutional and communal level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230954/"}

There was also a significant change in knowledge scores over time (p < .001), with knowledge scores increasing from pre to post. No significant changes in knowledge or stigma were found for participants in the control condition. A meaningful relationship was found whereby increases in knowledge significantly predicted increases in positive attitudes toward mental health (p < .001). This is the first large randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the effectiveness in mental health literacy of an integrated, manualized mental health educational resource for high school students on knowledge and stigma. Findings also support the applicability by teachers and suggest the potential for broad-based implementation of the educational curriculum in high schools.

It shapes well-rounded personalities, fosters innovation, and cultivates responsible citizens, contributing to social stability and national development. Our research aims to establish an evaluation system for college student mental health education policies based on the Policy Modeling Consistency Index (PMC-Index) model and text mining techniques, quantitatively assessing 15 representative policies. This paper first retrieves policy documents through specialized policy databases and government websites, excluding policies that have already expired or become invalid. The sample selections of this research range from 2001 to 2024, including national guidelines and specific actions. Referring to the above steps of policy effectiveness evaluation, our research comprehensively analyses the implementation effectiveness of the foregoing policies regarding mental health curricula, service systems, crisis intervention, and family cooperation. In the following, based on 10 major variables, 38 sub-variables are constructed with a binary coding system to quantify the content of policy for objectivity. Then, the ROSTCM 6.0 software is used for text segmentation and word frequency statistics, meanwhile, keywords and semantic networks of core policies will be considered for analysis. Subsequently, the PMC-Index is computed based on the multi-input-output matrix and a diagram of the PMC-Surface is drawn with the help of MATLAB to express policy consistency and deficiencies in different dimensions intuitively. Among the 15 policies, 11 exhibit Great Consistency (GC), and 4 fall under Acceptable Consistency (AC). Higher scores are found in Policy Function (X<sub>6</sub>), Policy Evaluation (X<sub>8</sub>), and Policy Goals (X<sub>9</sub>), indicating practical implementation and clear guidance. However, lower scores in Policy Nature (X<sub>1</sub>), Policy Timeliness (X<sub>2</sub>), Policy Issuing Agency (X<sub>3</sub>), and Policy Object (X<sub>4</sub>) reveal deficiencies in policy innovation, long-term planning, and target group coverage. Particularly, short-term policies lack sustainability, limiting their long-term effectiveness in supporting students' mental health. Through PMC-Surface analysis, it is found that lower scores in timeliness and adaptability to target groups are primary factors contributing to surface depressions in the diagram, suggesting that these policies struggle to meet the diverse needs of different types of higher education institutions. The research also highlights significant areas for improvement in resource allocation, support system construction, and personalized mental health services. Some policies fail to address regional disparities, with weaker implementation in underdeveloped areas and insufficient safeguard mechanisms. In the future, long-term planning for policy optimization is expected, in which priority would be given to localized resource allocation and close collaboration among schools, families, and society to ensure the comprehensiveness and sustainability of mental health education services. The research has identified certain strengths and weaknesses in the policies concerning mental health education for college students in China, thus providing theoretical references and specific recommendations that can be effectively implemented in higher education institutions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40190748/"}

On the initiative of World Psychiatric Association-CAP section, national CAP association boards from each SEE country allocated one member to the Consortium on Academic Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in SEE (CACAP SEE) in 2018. Using an internally distributed questionnaire, CACAP SEE members provided information on the CAP training structure and mental health care. Ten out of eleven SEE countries recognized CAP as a separate specialty. Duration of training did not differ much between the SEE countries. Other components were more variable (availability of rotations, overseas electives, and inclusion of psychotherapy). Ten countries were familiar with the CAP requirements of the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS-CAP) and five provided the training in accordance with it. Nine countries had less than 36 board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrists practicing in the country. The number of general psychiatrists treating children and adolescents with mental disorders was higher than the number of CAP specialists in five of the countries. Although CAP was recognized as a separate specialty in the vast majority of SEE countries, there was a substantial variation among them in available CAP training. In most of the countries, there is a considerable lack of CAP specialists for several reasons, including loss of trained specialists to other countries.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31227911/"}

KPIs scores were standardised in a 1-10 Likert Scale (1: worst performance; 10: best performance), thus allowing between-country comparisons of the relative performance. Exploratory unadjusted bivariate correlations between KPIs-transformed scores were run. Based on the KPIs-transformed scores, Slovakia (8.3), Cyprus (7.8), and Greece (7.1) had the best MH status, while Sweden (3.1), UK (2.6), and The Netherlands (2.1) had the poorest MH status.

Barriers such as stigma, low mental health literacy, and traditional masculine norms hinder help-seeking in this male-dominated sector. Few mental health interventions are tailored to this context. This study developed a co-designed, theory-informed training to improve mental health literacy, reduce stigma, and increase help-seeking among construction workers in Ireland. Using the Medical Research Council's framework, the training was developed with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Behavior Change Techniques, and extensive stakeholder co-design. Two systematic reviews, a broad literature review, and focus groups with industry managers informed the content and structure. The training will be pilot-tested using validated measures: the Literacy of Suicide Scale (LOSS), the Stigma of Suicide Scale (SOSS), and the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), the results of which will be the subject of a separate study. CAIRDE is a promising, evidence-based training that addresses key mental health barriers in Irish construction. Embedding the TPB within a co-design methodology has resulted in the development of a training program that is underpinned by theoretical fidelity and cultural relevance and provides a framework for other male-dominated industries to draw upon. Future work should address remaining challenges related to stigma and help-seeking, and explore broader implementation through integration into mandatory safety training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40869891/"}

This line of inquiry then leads to reflection on the value of a social topology-enabled through the application of intersectionality principles, Black Sociological analytical frameworks, including the worldview approach, and societal psychological perspectives on knowledge and action. I argue the possibilities in actioning these approaches emerge through the application of a social-political economy of mental health, that holds the complexity presented by the totality of social life as it potentially relates to mental health.

In a survey conducted by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in February 2012, the top three sources of anxiety among evacuees were radiation contamination (mentioned by 56% of respondents), income (48%), and school attendance of children (21%). In June 2012, results from the Mental Health Survey, which was conducted as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey, indicated that 14.8% of adult evacuees had K6 scores equal to or greater than the standard cut-off of 13, a much higher proportion than the 3% found in previous studies. In the same survey, 21.5% of child evacuees had SDQ scores equal to or greater than the standard cut-off of 16, whereas previous studies suggest a typical ratio of around 9.5%. It is natural for people to experience anxiety when facing radiation exposure, even at low levels. Here the important thing is to be \"accurately\" afraid: people should pay attention to scientific facts, and avoid danger appropriately, but not be unduly frightened. However, some people remain anxious even when objective radiation levels are low enough to not result in harm. A number of parents with young children decided to relocate outside of Fukushima Prefecture. In consideration of the desires of these parents to have areas where their children could play without being concerned about radiation, some municipalities constructed spacious indoor play facilities where parents have increased opportunities to communicate with each other, which actually leads to effective risk communication. Compared to the trajectory of mental health recovery after the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, recovery after the present disaster is delayed, particularly in Fukushima. In Fukushima, many disturbing events, such as the issue of water contaminated by radiation, have distressed evacuees, resulting in their delayed recovery in terms of mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24783445/"}

This study used #BeeWell survey data collected from adolescents in Greater Manchester (England) in 2021-2023 (life satisfaction: N = 27,009; emotional difficulties: N = 26,461). Through Latent Growth Mixture Modelling, we identified four non-linear trajectories of life satisfaction (Consistently High (71.0%), Improving (8.7%), Deteriorating (6.3%), and Consistently Low (13.9%); entropy = 0.66) and three non-linear trajectories of emotional difficulties (Low/Lessening (53.7%), Sub-Clinical (38.3%), and Elevated/Worsening (8.0%); entropy = 0.61). Using a multi-level mediation framework we assessed (1) whether neighbourhood deprivation predicted trajectory class membership and (2) the extent to which effects of deprivation operate through aspects of Community Wellbeing, as measured by the Co-op Community Wellbeing Index (CWI). Greater deprivation increased the odds of following Deteriorating (OR = 1.081, [1.023, 1.12]) and Consistently Low (OR = 1.084, [1.051, 1.119]) life satisfaction trajectories and reduced the odds of following a Sub-Clinical emotional difficulties trajectory (OR = 0.975, [0.954, 0.996]). Mediation analyses revealed that the effects of deprivation on Consistently Low life satisfaction partially operate through Equality (<i>ab</i> = 0.016, [0.002, 0.029]) and Housing, Space, and Environment (<i>ab</i> = -0.026, [-0.046, -0.006]). Further indirect effects were observed for Housing, Space, and Environment, which reduced likelihood of Sub-Clinical emotional difficulties for those living in deprived neighbourhoods (<i>ab</i> = -0.026, [-0.045, -0.008]). The findings highlight the distinct effects of neighbourhood deprivation on affective and evaluative domains of adolescent mental health and the protective effect of housing and related environmental factors in disadvantaged contexts, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning neighbourhood effects on dual-state adolescent mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40566377/"}

To properly assist the users of these systems, a virtual agent needs to promote motivation. This can be done by offering motivational messages. The objective of this study was two-fold. The first was to build a motivational message system for a virtual agent assisting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) therapy based on domain knowledge from experts. The second was to test the hypotheses that (1) computer-generated motivating messages influence users' motivation to continue with therapy, trust in a good therapy outcome, and the feeling of being heard by the agent and (2) personalized messages outperform generic messages on these factors. A system capable of generating motivational messages was built by analyzing expert (N=13) knowledge on what types of motivational statements to use in what situation. To test the 2 hypotheses, a Web-based study was performed (N=207). Participants were asked to imagine they were in a certain situation, specified by the progression of their symptoms and initial trust in a good therapy outcome. After this, they received a message from a virtual agent containing either personalized motivation as generated by the system, general motivation, or no motivational content. They were asked how this message changed their motivation to continue and trust in a good outcome as well as how much they felt they were being heard by the agent. Overall, findings confirmed the first hypothesis, as well as the second hypothesis for the measure feeling of being heard by the agent. Personalization of the messages was also shown to be important in those situations where the symptoms were getting worse. In these situations, personalized messages outperformed general messages both in terms of motivation to continue and trust in a good therapy outcome. Expert input can successfully be used to develop a personalized motivational message system. Messages generated by such a system seem to improve people's motivation and trust in PTSD therapy as well as the user's feeling of being heard by a virtual agent. Given the importance of motivation, trust, and therapeutic alliance for successful therapy, we anticipate that the proposed system can improve adherence in e-mental therapy for PTSD and that it can provide a blueprint for the development of an adaptive system for persuasive messages based on expert input.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30916660/"}

He describes the six models and provides history and research needs for each. The first model, being \"above normal,\" is epitomized by DSM-IV's axis V, the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. High scores represent \"superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities.\" The goal of the second model, positive psychology, is intervention to maximize positive qualities, such as self-efficacy. Maturity and Erikson's four developmental tasks (identity, intimacy, generativity, integrity) are the basis of the third model. The author adds two other tasks: career consolidation and \"keeper of the meaning.\" The fourth model is emotional or social intelligence, the ability to read other people's emotions. Surprisingly, subjective well-being, the fifth model, is as much a characteristic of temperament as of a benign environment. The last model, resilience, is epitomized by DSM-IV's Defense Function Scale, which categorizes coping mechanisms in terms of adaptational value.

The sample consisted of 1652 patients diagnosed with cancer in the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016. The sample was split into three groups: non-mental health, moderate mental health, and serious mental health. Patients in the serious and moderate mental health groups were more likely to have physical comorbidities. Those in the serious mental health group were also marginally more likely to have advanced cancer at diagnosis. There were no differences between groups in terms of treatment delays, but patients in the serious mental health group were more likely to be hospitalised and die in the 12 months following diagnosis. Whilst differences in mortality may be explained by greater clinical complexity (being older, having other physical comorbidities) and later stage at presentation, mental health history was independently associated with hospitalisations. Cancer patients with a history of more serious mental health issues fare more poorly than those with moderate mental health issues or no such history.

However, the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon have not been sufficiently explored. This study systematically examines the impact of parenting style disparities on the mental health of medical college students from the perspective of positive psychology and analyzes the mediating effects of positive psychological qualities. This study administered questionnaires to 3,387 medical students in Wuhu, China, all of whom came from two-parent families. Specifically, the Short-Egna Minnen av. Barndoms Uppfostran for Children (s-EMBU-C) questionnaire was used to assess parenting style disparities, whereas the SCL-90 scale was utilized to evaluate mental health problems. Additionally, the Chinese College Student Positive Psychological Quality Scale was employed to assess positive psychological qualities. The hypothesis is proposed that positive psychological qualities mediate the relationship between parenting style disparities and mental health problems, and the bootstrap method was employed to examine the mediating effect. Additionally, a multivariate linear regression model was utilized to identify the factors associated with mental health problems. The study revealed a significant positive correlation between parenting style disparities and mental health problems (<i>r</i> = 0.152, <i>p</i> < 0.01); conversely, parenting style disparities were significantly negatively correlated with positive psychological qualities (<i>r</i> = -0.070, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Additionally, positive psychological qualities were significantly negatively correlated with mental health problems (<i>r</i> = -0.201, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Furthermore, positive psychological qualities played a partial mediating role between parenting style disparities and mental health problems, accounting for 12.398% of the total effect. Parenting style disparities significantly negatively predict positive psychological qualities in medical college students, whereas positive psychological qualities significantly negatively predict mental health problems. Positive psychological qualities play a partial mediating role between parenting style disparities and mental health problems among medical college students. The main findings emphasize the importance of consistent parenting styles and the cultivation of positive psychological qualities for the mental health of medical college students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40356835/"}

We aimed to investigate this question using the World Mental Health surveys. Lifetime occurrences of six types of PEs were assessed along with 21 mental disorders and 14 general medical conditions. Disability was assessed with a modified version of the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between PEs and high disability scores (top quartile) with various adjustments. Respondents with PEs were more likely to have top quartile scores on global disability than respondents without PEs (19.1% vs. 7.5%; χ<sup>2</sup>  = 190.1, P < 0.001) as well as greater likelihood of cognitive, social, and role impairment. Relationships persisted in each adjusted model. A significant dose-response relationship was also found for the PE type measures with most of these outcomes. Psychotic experiences are associated with disability measures with a dose-response relationship. These results are consistent with the view that PEs are associated with disability regardless of the presence of comorbid mental or general medical disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28542726/"}

In Step 1, we conducted semi-structured interviews with LSSAs and then created an initial list of competencies based on the interviews and a previous investigation. In Step 2, we recruited LSSAs with 10 or more cases related to occupational mental health. They completed a questionnaire assessing the importance of their work (how important they felt it was to conduct work related to mental health) and level of achievement (how much they felt they had achieved). The respondents were also asked to provide additional competencies (not listed on the questionnaire) if they regarded them as necessary for their work, and these were later added to the list of proposed competencies. In Step 3, we presented the results of Step 2 to the same respondents and asked them to rate their agreement with the proposed competencies. Items with agreement of 80% or higher were set as competencies. We also asked LSSAs about the level of importance of their work and their perceived level of achievement with regard to the additional items created in Step 2. Items for which the level of achievement fell below the median were extracted even if the level of importance of the work fell at or above the median. We recruited 8 LSSAs in Step 1 and created a list of 68 preliminary competencies in 20 fields. We recruited 57 LSSAs in Step 2, and 45 LSSAs completed the survey (response rate: 78.9%).

Using data from a population sample, this study sought to establish psychometric properties and norms of the PMH Instrument (PMH-I), a measure of positive mental health developed in Singapore. We conducted a nationally representative survey among 1925 adults aged 18-79 years of Chinese, Malay, Indian or other ethnicity. Participants reported socio-demographic characteristics and completed the PMH-I along with measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological distress. Construct validity of the PMH-I was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis and concurrent validity was tested through correlation with other psychological measures. Normative PMH values and differences in population subgroups were estimated. The six-factor-higher-order structure of the PMH-I comprising six subscales of general coping, emotional support, spirituality, interpersonal skills, personal growth and autonomy and global affect was confirmed. Concurrent validity was shown through significant positive correlation of the total PMH score and its subscales with HRQoL and an inverse correlation with psychological distress. Weighted age, gender and ethnicity-specific norms were derived for the Singapore population. Total PMH was significantly higher in participants aged over 40 years as compared with 18-29 year olds and in non-Chinese ethnic groups as compared with Chinese. These differences were observed for all PMH-I subscales, with the exception of emotional support and interpersonal skills score differences by age. In contrast, gender, marital status, and education level were significantly associated with some of the subscales, but not with total PMH. These results support the psychometric properties of the PMH-I in a multi-ethnic Asian population sample.

Wave 4 included data on parent-reported mental health issues for children at age 7 years. Wave 6 included data on self-reported mental health problems as well as health behaviors for the same children at age 14 years. Data were analyzed July 5, 2020. Mental health problems at age 7 years were parent-reported using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Mental health problems at age 14 years were self-reported using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Health behaviors at age 14 years were the main outcome of interest. Sleep duration; fruit, vegetable, and soft drink consumption; and social media use were self-reported using recall on a typical day. Regression models were calculated for each lifestyle variable, with mental health change from ages 7 to 14 years as the exposure variable. Data were weighted to account for the potential clustering of region of sampling and adjusted for nonresponse. A total of 9369 participants were included in waves 4 and 6 of the Millennium Cohort Study, including 4665 (48.1%) girls and 6014 participants (81.9%) who were born in England. Adolescents who self-reported mental health problems at age 14 years only were less likely to have at least 9 hours of sleep (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.34-0.45) and to consume fruit (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.46-0.65) and vegetables (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.83) reported greater use of social media (b = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.75) compared with individuals who did not have mental health problems at both time points.

The study aimed to test changes in child mental health inequalities across three large UK population cohorts of 11-year-old children assessed in 1999, 2004 and 2012 as part of the British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Surveys and Millennium Cohort Study. Child mental health was assessed using parent and teacher versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. There were substantial differences in parent and teacher reported symptom scores between children from low and higher income families in each cohort. Differences in parent-reported symptoms increased over time (ES 0.35 [95% CI 0.20, 0.49] in 1999, ES 0.39 [95% CI 0.17, 0.61] in 2004, ES 0.54 [95% CI 0.49, 0.58] in 2012); cohort interaction: p = 0.01).

Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence regarding the links between loneliness and mental health and the potential buffering role of social support. Thus, this study aims to investigate the prevalence of loneliness among children and adolescents in Germany and its associations with mental health. Furthermore, we analyze whether social support is negatively correlated with loneliness and mental health problems and whether it acts as a moderator of the association between loneliness and mental health issues. This study analyzed data from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey in Germany in 2022, which included 6,475 students aged 11, 13, and 15 years (girls: 50,6%, M<sub>age</sub> = 13,4, SD = 1,7). Loneliness was measured via the University of California-Los Angeles Scale (UCLA) and a single-item measure. The mental health indicators included subjective health, life satisfaction, and multiple psychosomatic complaints. Social support from family, teachers, and classmates was assessed. Chi-square tests, t tests, logistic regressions, and moderation analyses were conducted. A total of 17.2% of the students reported high levels of loneliness. Compared with boys, girls and gender-diverse students reported higher rates of loneliness. High levels of loneliness were strongly linked to poorer subjective health (OR = 5.56, p <.001), lower life satisfaction (OR = 7.32, p <.001), and increased psychosomatic complaints (OR = 7.38, p <.001). High social support from family, teachers, and students was associated with reduced loneliness and better mental health outcomes. Teacher support in grades 7 and 9 buffered the effect of loneliness on multiple psychosomatic complaints. The findings highlight that loneliness is a prevalent phenomenon among children and adolescents and is strongly associated with mental health issues. Greater social support is linked to reduced loneliness and better mental health, so targeted interventions to promote social support in schools and families are needed to address loneliness. Future research should explore longitudinal relationships and further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40571925/"}

This study uses data from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey, a nationally representative sample of middle and high school students aged approximately 11-18 years (n = 23,366). Mental health conditions were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, and social media use was categorized by frequency levels. We employed multinomial logistic regression and a finite mixture Poisson model to explore the relationship between social media use, sexual identity, and mental health status. The study found a consistent association between social media use and mental health conditions, particularly among frequent users. The finite mixture model revealed two latent groups based on mental health status: a 'better' group with minimal or no poor mental health indicators and a 'worse' group with more indicators. For both groups, social media use was associated with mental health conditions, with a stronger association among frequent users. Notably, sexual minorities, especially bisexual students, were more likely to report poor mental health indicators. This study suggests that frequent social media use may adversely affect young people's mental health and that different youth subgroups may respond differently to social media use and mental health conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941758/"}

Particularly challenging under the CRPD is the scope, if any, for involuntary treatment. Conventional mental health legislation, such as the Mental Health Act (England and Wales) appears to violate, for example, Article 4 ('no discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability'), Article 12 (persons shall 'enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life') and Article 14 ('the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty'). We argue that a form of mental health law, such as the Fusion Law proposal, is consistent with the principles of the CRPD. Such law is aimed at eliminating discrimination against persons with a mental illness. It covers all persons regardless of whether they have a 'mental' or a 'physical' illness, and only allows involuntary treatment when a person's decision-making capability (DMC) for a specific treatment decision is impaired - whatever the health setting or cause of the impairment - and where supported decision making has failed. In addition to impaired DMC, involuntary treatment would require an assessment that such treatment gives the person's values and perspective paramount importance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24280316/"}

To assess the validity of the hypothesis, I propose a periodization of the economic, political, and social changes that occurred in Latin America in the past decades. A brief review of recent studies on social determinants of mental health (with a focus on Brazil), considering research findings by historical context, shows that urbanization-modernization-migration variables were more present in the literature in the decades of 1980 and 1990, whereas social inequity factors (gender, ethnicity/race, and racism) came to be dominant as a research question after the year 2000.

Therefore, we conducted an experiment examining how four different ways of referring to a person with (a) alcohol addiction, (b) drug addiction, (c) depression and (d) schizophrenia are related to stigmatising attitudes by care professionals in the Netherlands. We partially replicated two studies performed in the United States and used surveys with vignettes containing either 'disorder-first', 'person-first', 'victim' and 'recovery' language, which were randomly assigned to participants (n = 361).

Furthermore, few published studies have reported on characteristics of treatment fidelity. The present study examined fidelity to the Infant Mental Health Home Visiting (IMH-HV) model among 51 therapists with a range of experience practicing in community settings across the state of Michigan. IMH therapists completed fidelity checklists after every session with participating families to track use of 15 treatment strategies central to the IMH-HV model across the 12-month study period. Results indicated that the most commonly endorsed components utilized in home visits were developmental guidance and infant-parent psychotherapy, followed by the provision of emotional support. Use of IMH-HV components did not vary over time for the entire sample; however, patterns of strategies used showed somewhat more variability among more experienced therapists and when serving higher risk families. Findings demonstrate that IMH-HV therapists report a range of adherence to the model in community settings, with greatest fidelity to several model core components. Ongoing training in the flexible use of all core strategies may further enhance fidelity and contribute to positive outcomes for caregivers and their children receiving IMH-HV services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32242965/"}

However, measurement of well-being often takes place in the absence of reflection on the underlying theoretical conceptualisation of well-being. This disguises the fact that different rating scales of well-being often measure very different phenomena because rating scales are based on different philosophical assumptions, which represent radically different foundational views about the nature of well-being. The aim of this paper is to examine the philosophical foundation of the Well-Being Index WHO-5 in order to clarify the underlying normative commitments and the psychometric compromises involved in the translation of philosophical theory into practice. WHO-5 has been introduced as a rating scale that measures the affective and hedonistic dimensions of well-being. It is widely used within public health and mental health research. This paper introduces the philosophical theory of Hedonism and explores how two central assumptions that relate to hedonistic theory are reflected in the construction of WHO-5. The first concerns 'the hedonic balance', that is the relation between positive and negative emotions. The second assumption concerns 'the value of emotions', that is, how to determine the duration and intensity of emotions. At the end, Hedonism is contrasted with Life Satisfaction Theory, an alternative foundational theory of well-being, in order to clarify that the outlook of WHO-5 is more a rating system of positive affect than a cognitive judgement of overall life satisfaction. We conclude that it is important to examine the philosophical foundation of rating scales of well-being, such as WHO-5, in order to be fully able to assess the magnitude as well as the limits of their results.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471446/"}

The core intervention included lectures on mental illness, encounters with people coping with mental illness, simulations, and a film on coping with mental illness. Behavioral intention to work with mentally ill patients and three dimensions of nursing students' attitudes (perceived functional characteristics, perceived danger, and value diminution of mentally ill patients) were measured before and after the intervention. The post-intervention impact of the intervention on participants' attitudes and behavioral intention was measured. One hundred and one undergraduate third year nursing students studying at four nursing schools in Israel participated in the study. The planned intervention improved the students' attitudes towards mentally ill patients but did not improve their intention of working with them. Post-intervention, older and less religious students had more intention to work with mentally ill patients. Moreover, older and Jewish students held better attitudes towards the functional characteristics of mentally ill patients. Being older was also correlated with the perception of mentally ill patients as less dangerous and male students ascribed to them more value diminution.

Secondary school teachers have worse mental health outcomes than the general working population, which the Wellbeing in Secondary Education (WISE) cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to improve. The WISE intervention comprised a Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training package delivered to at least 16% of staff, a short mental health awareness session to all teachers and development of a staff peer support service. Twenty-five schools were randomised to intervention or control arms. This paper reports findings regarding the extent of uptake and fidelity of the intervention. Mixed methods data collection comprised researcher observations of training delivery, training participant evaluation forms, trainer and peer supporter interviews, peer supporter feedback meetings, logs of support provided, and teacher questionnaires. Quantitative data were summarised descriptively, while thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. In the 12 schools assigned to the intervention arm, 113 (8.6%) staff completed the 2-day standard MHFA training course, and a further 146 (11.1%) staff completed the 1-day MHFA for schools and colleges training. In seven (58.3%) schools, the required 8% of staff completed the MHFA training packages. A 1-h mental health awareness-raising session was attended by 666 (54.5%) staff. Delivery of the MHFA training package was achieved with high levels of fidelity and quality across schools. All schools set up the peer support service following training, with a majority adhering to most of the operational guidelines developed from the pilot study at the outset. Teachers reported limited use of the peer support service during follow-up. At the 1-year follow-up, only three (25.0%) schools indicated they had re-advertised the service and there was evidence of a reduction in support from senior leadership. The MHFA training package was delivered with reasonably high fidelity, and a staff peer support service was established with general, but not complete, adherence to guidelines. In some schools, insufficient staff received MHFA training and levels of delivery of the peer support service compromised intervention dose and reach. ISRCTN 95909211 .

The formulation does not merely organize the assessment findings but is also an interpretation or explanation, made in consultation with the client, of what meaning can be attributed to the issues explored in the assessment process.

Psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and social workers at the university's medical center teach the courses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which CAMS encourages graduates of the program to pursue a career in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH). In 2015-2016, graduates of the CAMS program were invited to participate in a mixed methods study. In addition to statistical analyses, qualitative thematic analyses were performed to interpret free-text responses. Forty-five percent (314/702) of invited graduates completed the online survey. Interviews were conducted with 11% (34/314) of participants by study staff over the phone. Quantitative results suggested that 81% (149/185) of participants enrolled in educational programs after graduation due to an interest in CAMH. A significantly higher proportion of the total sample (t = 3.661, p < .001) reported that they changed their career goals while undergraduate students compared to those who did so after graduation. Results of qualitative interviews with 34 participants uncovered five key themes unique to CAMS that may explain the program's influence on graduates' career choices and career development: practitioners-as-instructors, instructor mentorship, novel course content, experiential learning opportunities, and career training and skills. Quantitative and qualitative results indicated that teaching college undergraduate students about CAMH encourages them to set career goals within the field. These findings suggest the utility of implementing similar programs at other undergraduate colleges.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28236053/"}

We used data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) national longitudinal study, 1995-1996 (Time 1) and 2005-2006 (Time 2). Childhood misfortune was measured at Time 1 using indicators of financial strain, family structure, and abuse. Self-rated physical and mental health indicators were obtained at both occasions. The measure of quality of social relations was based on items relative to social support and social strain from spouse, friends, and family at Time 1. Mediational models showed that a higher level of childhood misfortune was associated with low-quality family relations which in turn tend to account for change in mental health. These findings suggest that childhood misfortune is associated with the quality of social relations, which in turn explain individual changes in mental health in adulthood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28195011/"}

We provide an analysis of policy implications of four papers in this issue of the journal from the 2020-22 NSMHWB (<i>N</i> = 15,893) and the 2007 NSMHWB (<i>N</i> = 8841). The 2020-2022 NSMHWB reported a lifetime prevalence rate of common mental disorders of 40.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 39.2-41.3) and 12-month prevalence rate of 20.2% (95% CI 19.5-21.0). Overall, adult Australians were significantly more likely to experience a 12-month mental disorder in 2020-22 compared with 2007, with the change most striking in among those aged 16-24 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). Individuals aged 16-24 years in 2020-22 were significantly more likely to experience a 12-month anxiety disorder (OR 2.9, 95% CI = 2.3-3.7, depressive disorder (OR 2.8 95% CI = 2.1-3.9) or comorbidity (relative risk [RR] = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-1.7) compared with those aged 16-24 years in 2007. In 2020-22, the proportion of Australians who had experienced suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts in the past 12 months was 3.3%, 1.1% and 0.3%. Under half (46.5% 95% CI 44.1-48.8) of adults with a 12-month mental disorder sought treatment. Mental disorders remain an endemic feature of Australia's overall health landscape and appear to be increasing, especially in younger cohorts. While service use rates have improved over time, there is still some way to go. Epidemiological surveys such as the 2020-22 NSMHWB are important for understanding changing prevalence and the population not accessing services.

However, it is unclear whether mental wellbeing is best conceptualized as a general wellbeing factor or a multidimensional construct. This paper investigated whether mental wellbeing, measured by the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF), is best represented by: (1) a single-factor general model; (2) a three-factor multidimensional model or (3) a combination of both (bifactor model). 2220 young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years completed an online survey including the MHC-SF and a range of other wellbeing and mental ill-health measures. Exploratory factor analysis supported a bifactor solution, comprised of a general wellbeing factor, and specific group factors of psychological, social and emotional wellbeing. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the bifactor model had a better fit than competing single and three-factor models. The MHC-SF total score was more strongly associated with other wellbeing and mental ill-health measures than the social, emotional or psychological subscale scores. Findings indicate that the mental wellbeing of young people is best conceptualized as an overarching latent construct (general wellbeing) to which emotional, social and psychological domains contribute. The MHC-SF total score is a valid and reliable measure of this general wellbeing factor.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27152903/"}

A longitudinal study of 18,000 adults.", "text": "Nearly 100 years ago, the philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell warned of the social dangers of widespread envy. One view of modern society is that it is systematically developing a set of institutions -- such as social media and new forms of advertising -- that make people feel inadequate and envious of others. If so, how might that be influencing the psychological health of our citizens? This paper reports the first large-scale longitudinal research into envy and its possible repercussions. The paper studies 18,000 randomly selected individuals over the years 2005, 2009, and 2013. Using measures of SF-36 mental health and psychological well-being, four main conclusions emerge. First, the young are especially susceptible. Levels of envy fall as people grow older. This longitudinal finding is consistent with a cross-sectional pattern noted recently by Nicole E. Henniger and Christine R. Harris, and with the theory of socioemotional regulation suggested by scholars such as Laura L. Carstensen. Second, using fixed-effects equations and prospective analysis, the analysis reveals that envy today is a powerful predictor of worse SF-36 mental health and well-being in the future. A change from the lowest to the highest level of envy, for example, is associated with a worsening of SF-36 mental health by approximately half a standard deviation (p < .001). Third, no evidence is found for the idea that envy acts as a useful motivator. Greater envy is associated with slower -- not higher -- growth of psychological well-being in the future. Nor is envy a predictor of later economic success. Fourth, the longitudinal decline of envy leaves unaltered a U-shaped age pattern of well-being from age 20 to age 70. These results are consistent with the idea that society should be concerned about institutions that stimulate large-scale envy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29316510/"}

{"id": "31318066", "title": "The relationship between death anxiety and severity of mental illnesses.", "text": "Death anxiety has been implicated theoretically and empirically in mental health and has been proposed to be a transdiagnostic construct. However, it has largely been investigated in relation to specific disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Few studies have assessed the relationship between death anxiety and psychopathology using heterogeneous treatment-seeking clinical samples. In the present study, the relationships between death anxiety and broad markers of psychopathology were explored in 200 treatment-seeking participants with various diagnosed mental disorders. Across the sample, death anxiety was a strong predictor of psychopathology, including the number of lifetime diagnoses, medications, hospitalizations, distress/impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress. This relationship was not accounted for by neuroticism. Large to very large correlations were also consistently found between a measure of death anxiety and the symptom severity of 12 disorders. Neither meaning in life nor attachment style moderated the associations between death fears and psychopathology. The findings reveal a strong relationship between death anxiety and psychopathology across numerous disorders, further supporting the transdiagnostic role of fears of death. As such, clinical implications revolve around the potential need for innovative treatments which address death fears directly, in order to produce long-term improvements in mental health. However, experimental research is needed to ascertain causal relationships. Across a large treatment-seeking sample, death anxiety was a significant predictor of broad psychopathology, including distress and number of lifetime diagnoses. Across 12 different disorders, death anxiety significantly predicted symptom severity. Results may suggest the need for novel treatments which specifically target fears of death. Due to the correlational design, future experimental research is needed to establish causal relationships with increased confidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318066/"}

Second is stewardship, including supporting countries to use funds effectively, evaluate results, and hold stakeholders accountable.

However, studies testing the exposure hypothesis among the employed population rarely take into account the work-family interface and neglect the macro-social context in the construction of gender. This study examines a gendered exposure model, stratified by Canadian province, in which differences between working women and men in work and family conditions, work-family conflict, and work-family enrichment are linked to self-reported mental health inequalities. Path analyses were conducted for Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, and Ontario using data from 6,786 employed respondents to the 2022 Canadian Community Health Survey. The exposure hypothesis was tested through indirect associations between sex categories and mental health via work and family conditions and the work-family interface. Findings show that in Quebec, women report higher work stress, which is indirectly linked to poorer mental health through increased work-to-family conflict. In Alberta, women report more work stress, which is associated with poorer mental health. Women also work fewer hours than men, a factor linked to poorer mental health in Quebec and Ontario. Overall, the results indicate that work-family stressors and resources contribute more to provincial differences in mental health than in gendered mental health inequalities, highlighting the need to differentiate between general determinants of mental health and the factors driving mental health disparities. This study emphasizes the importance of integrating the work-family interface when documenting the structuring influence of gender on mental health inequalities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40153920/"}

The target population comprised international students enrolled in a Japanese university. Online questionnaires were used to assess self-stigma, perceived stigma, recognized knowledge of schizophrenia and depression, gender, country and region, general mental health status, parents' income, non-clinical and clinical help-seeking attitudes, and Japanese and English language ability. Logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for self-stigma and perceived stigma after adjusting for the above factors. A total of 119 students were invited to participate, 61 (51.3%) of whom were enrolled. Students with good knowledge of depression/schizophrenia did not indicate more severe self-stigma compared with those without such knowledge. Students with good knowledge of schizophrenia indicated more severe perceived stigma compared with those without such knowledge (OR 3.78 [95% confidence intervals; CI, 1.21-11.78]). Students with good knowledge of depression indicated less severe perceived stigma compared with those without such knowledge (OR 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.94]).

We analyzed data from youth respondents in the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth. We obtained estimates of average life satisfaction and high self-rated mental health, happiness, autonomy, competence, and relatedness for youth with an exclusively heterosexual attraction and youth with a minority sexual attraction (those exclusively attracted to the same gender, and those attracted to both females and males), and for cisgender and gender minority youth. Regression analyses were conducted to test for disparities on each PMH outcome. Compared with exclusively heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth reported lower life satisfaction and were less likely to report high self-rated mental health, happiness, autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Significant disparities were more consistently found for youth attracted to both females and males than youth exclusively attracted to the same gender. Gender minority (versus cisgender) youth also reported lower average life satisfaction and were less likely to report high self-rated mental health, happiness, autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Owing to the high and growing demand for mental health care, a large number of such information and communication technology systems have been developed in recent years. Consequently, a diverse system landscape formed. This literature review aims to give an overview of this landscape of e-mental health systems for the prevention and treatment of major depressive disorder, focusing on three main research questions: (1) What types of systems exist? (2) How technologically advanced are these systems? (3) How has the system landscape evolved between 2000 and 2017? Publications eligible for inclusion described e-mental health software for the prevention or treatment of major depressive disorder. Additionally, the software had to have been evaluated with end users and developed since 2000. After screening, 270 records remained for inclusion. We constructed a taxonomy concerning software systems, their functions, how technologized these were in their realization, and how systems were evaluated, and then, we extracted this information from the included records. We define here as functions any component of the system that delivers either treatment or adherence support to the user. For this coding process, an elaborate classification hierarchy for functions was developed yielding a total of 133 systems with 2163 functions. The systems and their functions were analyzed quantitatively, with a focus on technological realization. There are various types of systems. However, most are delivered on the World Wide Web (76%), and most implement cognitive behavioral therapy techniques (85%). In terms of content, systems contain twice as many treatment functions as adherence support functions, on average. Furthermore, autonomous systems, those not including human guidance, are equally as technologized and have one-third less functions than guided ones. Therefore, lack of guidance is neither compensated with additional functions nor compensated by technologizing functions to a greater degree. Although several high-tech solutions could be found, the average system falls between a purely informational system and one that allows for data entry but without automatically processing these data. Moreover, no clear increase in the technological capabilities of systems showed in the field, between 2000 and 2017, despite a marked growth in system quantity. Finally, more sophisticated systems were evaluated less often in comparative trials than less sophisticated ones (OR 0.59). The findings indicate that when developers create systems, there is a greater focus on implementing therapeutic treatment than adherence support. Although the field is very active, as evidenced by the growing number of systems developed per year, the technological possibilities explored are limited. In addition to allowing developers to compare their system with others, we anticipate that this review will help researchers identify opportunities in the field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31958063/"}

Identifying different socioeconomic factors that impact mental well-being across contexts is pressing given the global rise in mental health disorders. Numerous studies in the population and social sciences have emphasized the protective role of material wealth on human health and well-being; however, scholars frequently assess wealth as a one-dimensional variable, which may fail to capture diverse forms of wealth. Acknowledging different forms of wealth may be particularly important in settings where agricultural economies coexist with cash economies. Using data from the 2013 Namibia Demographic Health Survey (n = 13 377), we use a newly developed measure of success in agricultural activities, an agricultural wealth index, or AWI, generated by Hackman et al., (2021). To examine the role of different forms of wealth on mental health symptoms. We find mental well-being, assessed through three survey questions, is lower among urban dwellers and females and shows varied associations with wealth type and sex/gender. In general, success in agricultural activities is associated with better mental well-being, while the association with market success is null or and conditional upon sex/gender and place. This study adds to recent work on the value of using multidimensional measures of wealth and raises important questions about why wealth type and sex/gender differentially impact mental well-being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38459957/"}

However, there has been limited implementation of such alternative models, and their efficacy is still inconclusive. Notably, little is known of the experiences of CYP and their parents with these alternative models and their level of satisfaction with the care provided. Therefore, the main aim of this review was to understand those experiences of the accessibility of alternative models to inpatient care, as well as overall CYP/parental satisfaction. A searching strategy of peer-reviewed articles was conducted from January 1990 to December 2018, with updated searches conducted in June 2019. The initial search resulted in 495 articles, of which 19 were included in this review. A narrative synthesis grouped the studies according to emerging themes: alternative models, tele-psychiatry and interventions applied to crisis, and experiences and satisfaction with crisis provision. The identified articles highlighted increased satisfaction in CYP with alternative models in comparison with care as usual. However, the parental experiential data identified high levels of parental burden and a range of complex emotional reactions associated with engagement with crisis services. Furthermore, we identified a number of interventions, telepsychiatric and mobile solutions that may be effective when applied to urgent and emergency care for CYP experiencing a mental health crisis. Lastly, both parental and CYP experiences highlighted a number of perceived barriers associated with help-seeking from crisis services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31637520/"}

Data from surveys administered repeatedly over 15 years (1997-2011) described changes over time in the prevalence of chronic mental illness among US adults. The data allowed us to pinpoint changes characterizing the White majority--but not Black, Hispanic, or Asian minorities--and to ask whether such changes were attributable to economic conditions (measured via national unemployment rates). We combined 1.5 decades' worth of National Health Interview Survey data in one secondary analysis. We took social structural and demographic factors into account and let adjusted probability of chronic mental illness indicate prevalence of chronic mental illness We observed, as a general trend, that chronic mental illness probability increased as the unemployment rate rose. A greater increase in probability was observed for Blacks than Whites, notably during 2007-2011, the heart of the recession Our results confirmed that structural risk posed by the recent recession and by vulnerability to the recession's effects was differentially linked to Blacks.

To improve adherence to guideline recommendations on mental health problems, an implementation strategy was developed for Dutch occupational physicians (OPs). The aims were 1) to assess adherence to a mental health guideline in occupational health care and 2) to evaluate the effect of a tailored implementation strategy on guideline adherence compared to traditional guideline dissemination. An audit of medical records was conducted as part of a larger RCT study. Participants were 66 OPs (32 intervention and 34 control) employed at one of six sites of an Occupational Health Service in southern Netherlands. OPs in the intervention group received multiple-session peer group training which focused on identifying and addressing barriers to using the guideline, using a Plan-Do-Check-Act approach. The control group did not receive training. Medical records of 114 workers sick-listed with mental health problems were assessed (56 intervention and 58 control). Guideline adherence was determined by auditing the records using 12 guideline-based performance indicators (PI), grouped into 5 PIs: process diagnosis, problem orientation, interventions/treatment, relapse prevention, and continuity of care. Differences in performance rates of the PIs between the intervention and control groups were analyzed, taking into account the cluster study design. OPs who received the training showed significantly greater adherence compared to the controls (p < .028) in 4 out of 5 grouped PIs, i.e. process diagnosis, problem orientation, interventions/treatment and relapse prevention. In one out of 12 PIs adherence was found adequate (53% of the medical records), in 6 PIs adherence was found minimal, and in 5 PIs the majority of the records showed no adherence. An implementation strategy which addressed key barriers for change and tailor-made interventions improves adherence to an occupational health guideline for mental health problems compared to traditional guideline dissemination. However, adherence to the guideline recommendations is still far from optimal. To optimize adherence, it is recommended that implementation strategies focus on the workers level, organizational level, and the professional level. ISRCTN86605310 .

Combining the material and psychosocial explanations of health, this study explores the potential interactions between social and economic capital in influencing older adults' health in urban and rural China. Using data from the China Family Panel Survey, physical and mental health in 2018 were regressed on social and economic capital indicators in 2016, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics of 3535 respondents aged 65 and older. Rothman's synergy index was calculated to investigate potential interaction effects. Economic hardships were significantly related to both self-reported health and mental health. Neighborhood cohesion and social participation were significantly associated with mental health for all, bonding trust was significantly associated with mental health for urban older people. We found no significant associations between social capital components and self-reported health. There was an interaction effect between low neighborhood cohesion and economic hardships, and between low social participation and economic hardships, creating an increased burden of poor mental health. The interaction effect between low bonding trust and economic hardships on mental health was apparent only among urban older people. Geographical settings are important factors in the complexity between social and economic capital in affecting older health. Intervention efforts directed towards reducing simultaneously multiple dimensions of deprivation, such as poverty, social exclusion, social isolation, could be helpful in improving older people's health. In materially deprived places, policies to promote health equity by improving social capital but without eliminating poverty may be less effective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34526016/"}

We collected data on 176 million tweets from 2011 to 2014 with content related to depression or suicide. Using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) data analysis, we identified deviations from predicted trends in communication about depression and suicide. Two types of heightened Twitter activity regarding depression or suicide were identified in 2014: expected increases in response to planned behavioral health events, and unexpected increases in response to unanticipated events. Tweet volume following expected increases went back to the predicted level more rapidly than the volume following unexpected events. Although ARIMA models have been used extensively in other fields, they have not been used widely in public health. Our findings indicate that our ARIMA model is valid for identifying periods of heightened activity on Twitter related to behavioral health. The model offers an objective and empirically based measure to identify periods of greater interest for timing the dissemination of credible information related to mental health. Spikes in tweet volume following a behavioral health event often last for less than 2 days. Individuals and organizations that want to disseminate behavioral health messages on Twitter in response to heightened periods of interest need to take this limited time frame into account.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27707822/"}

To show robustness, globalisation has been divided into three main dimensions such as economic globalisation, political globalisation, and social globalisation while, mental health has been classified through various indicators, i.e., mental disorder, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. The study used panel fixed effect techniques to demonstrate the quadratic effects of globalisation on mental health. A U-shaped curve relationship between globalisation (including economic, political, and political globalisation) and mental disorders, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders was identified.

The great majority of people experience barriers that prevent access to treatment, aggravated by a lack of mental health specialists. Digital mental health is potentially useful in meeting the treatment needs of large numbers of people. A growing number of efficacy trials have shown strong outcomes for digital mental health treatments. Yet despite their positive findings, there are very few examples of successful implementations and many failures. Although the research-to-practice gap is not unique to digital mental health, the inclusion of technology poses unique challenges. We outline some of the reasons for this gap and propose a collection of methods that can result in sustainable digital mental health interventions. These methods draw from human-computer interaction and implementation science and are integrated into an Accelerated Creation-to-Sustainment (ACTS) model. The ACTS model uses an iterative process that includes 2 basic functions (design and evaluate) across 3 general phases (Create, Trial, and Sustain). The ultimate goal in using the ACTS model is to produce a functioning technology-enabled service (TES) that is sustainable in a real-world treatment setting. We emphasize the importance of the service component because evidence from both research and practice has suggested that human touch is a critical ingredient in the most efficacious and used digital mental health treatments. The Create phase results in at least a minimally viable TES and an implementation blueprint. The Trial phase requires evaluation of both effectiveness and implementation while allowing optimization and continuous quality improvement of the TES and implementation plan. Finally, the Sustainment phase involves the withdrawal of research or donor support, while leaving a functioning, continuously improving TES in place. The ACTS model is a step toward bringing implementation and sustainment into the design and evaluation of TESs, public health into clinical research, research into clinics, and treatment into the lives of our patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490417/"}

By introducing and validating a novel conceptual framework that integrates social determinants of health with the stress process model, this study aims to provide actionable insights for improving mental health care in correctional settings. The research seeks to inform policymakers, prison administrators and mental health professionals about effective interventions and systemic reforms that can reduce recidivism, enhance rehabilitation and promote a more humane and just criminal justice system. This study uses a multi-method research design integrating a systematic literature review, qualitative interviews, multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) and a small-scale empirical study within a correctional facility. The systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines, analysing peer-reviewed articles, government reports and policy documents. Semi-structured interviews with 25 mental health professionals provide practical insights, whereas the MCE assesses intervention effectiveness based on expert consensus. The empirical study involves baseline assessments, intervention implementation and follow-up evaluations using validated tools, providing robust data to validate the proposed conceptual framework that integrates social determinants of health with the stress process model. This study finds that mental health disorders are significantly more prevalent in prison populations than in the general population, with interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), peer support programs and trauma-informed care showing considerable effectiveness in reducing symptoms. Emerging technologies such as AI and telemedicine present promising avenues for enhancing care but require careful ethical consideration. The research also highlights the critical role of social determinants and the importance of systemic reforms, such as reducing solitary confinement and integrating prison health care with broader public health systems, in improving inmate mental health and reducing recidivism. This study's quasi-experimental design, while robust, may limit the generalizability of the findings to other correctional settings because of specific facility characteristics. Additionally, the sample size for qualitative interviews, although diverse, could have been larger to provide more nuanced insights, particularly for underrepresented groups. This study highlights the need for more longitudinal research to assess the long-term effects of interventions and the scalability of approaches across different cultural and legal contexts. Future studies should address these limitations by using more diverse sampling, larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods. This study provides actionable insights for policymakers and prison administrators, emphasizing the need to integrate evidence-based mental health interventions, such as CBT and trauma-informed care, into prison reform strategies. It highlights the importance of training correctional staff in mental health first aid and the potential of emerging technologies like AI and telemedicine to enhance care delivery in resource-limited settings. Implementing these recommendations could significantly improve inmate mental health outcomes, reduce recidivism rates and promote a more humane and effective correctional system, with broader benefits for public health and social equity. Improving mental health care in prisons has significant social implications, particularly in promoting social justice and reducing inequalities. Effective mental health interventions can help break the cycle of incarceration and recidivism, particularly in marginalized communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. By addressing the mental health needs of incarcerated individuals, society can foster safer communities, reduce crime rates and alleviate the economic burden on the criminal justice and health-care systems. Furthermore, enhancing mental health care in prisons reflects a commitment to human dignity, fairness and the rehabilitation of offenders, contributing to a more just and compassionate society. This study introduces a novel conceptual framework that integrates social determinants of health with the stress process model, specifically tailored for correctional facilities. It provides original empirical data from a real-world prison setting, offering new insights into the effectiveness of mental health interventions, such as CBT and trauma-informed care. The study's value lies in its comprehensive approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, and its focus on underrepresented populations in correctional settings. By addressing significant gaps in the literature, this research offers practical recommendations for policymakers and practitioners, contributing to improved mental health outcomes and reduced recidivism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39465264/"}

Addressing these unmet needs is becoming one of the urgent public health priorities. In order to develop effective solutions to address some of these needs, it is important first to understand the care and support needs of older people. A scoping review was conducted, using the Arksey and O'Malley original and enhanced framework, to understand the care and support needs of older people, focusing on those living at home with chronic conditions in the UK. The search was conducted using five electronic data bases, grey literature and reference list checks. The WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework was used to analyse and categorise the literature findings. Forty studies were included in the final analysis- 32 from academic literature and 8 from grey literature. The review highlighted that older adults faced a range of physical, social and psychological challenges due to living with chronic conditions and required care and support in three main areas: 1) social activities and relationships; 2) psychological health; and 3) activities related to mobility, self-care and domestic life. The review also highlighted that many older people demonstrated a desire to cope with their illness and maintain independence, however, environmental factors interfered with these efforts including: 1) lack of professional advice on self-care strategies; 2) poor communication and coordination of services; and 3) lack of information on services such as care pathways. A gap in the knowledge was also identified about the care and support needs of two groups within the older population: 1) older workers; and 2) older carers. The review highlighted that older people living with chronic conditions have unmet care needs related to their physical and psychological health, social life, as well as the environment in which they live and interact. Findings of this review also emphasized the importance of developing care models and support services based around the needs of older people.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31331279/"}

The potential buffering effect of regional-level social capital, however, has not previously been explored. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP; 2009-2018) we apply multilevel models to assess the effect of frequent or infrequent perceived discrimination on mental health (MCS subscale of the SF-12) adjusting for individual- and regional-level confounding in a cross-sectional research design. We assess interaction with general social capital (civic engagement, electoral participation, generalised trust) and migrant-specific resources (proportion of non-nationals). We juxtapose non-refugee migrants (n = 13478) with refugees subject to mobility restrictions (n = 5558) to account for bias introduced by selective mobility into regions. In the non-refugee sample, we confirm the negative effects of discrimination experiences on MCS (ß frequent: -3.74, 95%-CI: [-4.40; -3.09]/ß infrequent: -1.88, 95%-CI: [-2.24; -1.52]). Moderation analyses among non-refugees show no buffering of general social capital, but a negative interaction effect of the proportion of non-nationals with experiences of discrimination (ß frequent: -0.54, 95%-CI: [-0.87; -0.21]/ß infrequent: -0.68, 95%-CI: [-1.29; -0.07]). Analyses among refugees also demonstrate a negative effect of discrimination on MCS with stronger overall effects than in the migrant sample (ß frequent: -6.24, 95%-CI: [-7.44; -5.05]/ß infrequent: -3.56, 95%-CI: [-4.25; -2.86]). In the refugee sample, the effect is exacerbated by the proportion of non-nationals (ß frequent: -1.70, 95%-CI: [-2.84; -0.56]) and buffered by generalised trust (ß: 0.87, 95%-CI: [0.13; 1.60]). When faced with experiences of discrimination, levels of community trust seem to buffer the negative mental health impacts for refugees. We do not find buffering effects of social capital on the mental health of non-refugee migrants, possibly due to established social networks. Furthermore, our results suggest that the proportion of non-nationals within a community may have a negative reinforcing impact on the relationship between discrimination and mental health for both migrant samples. As this dynamic is currently underexplored in the German context, more community-based research is needed to develop appropriate policy interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40022956/"}

Early interpersonal trauma and subsequent removal from home and repeated relocations to new placements are expected to affect mental health and self-esteem. We therefore investigated if domain-specific self-esteem contributed to QoL among adolescents living in RYC institutions over and beyond their levels of psychopathology. All youth in Norwegian RYC institutions between the ages 12-23 years were invited to participate. Of a total of 98 RYC institutions, 86 participated, and 400 of 601 eligible youths were examined. The participants' primary contact completed the Child Behavior Checklist to assess psychopathology. The adolescents completed a revised version of the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents and the questionnaire for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (KINDL-R). After adjusting for psychopathology, age, and gender, self-esteem domains uniquely explained 42% of the variance in Qol, where social acceptance (β = 0.57) and physical appearance (β = 0.25) domains significantly predicted concurrent QoL. The self-esteem domains, social acceptance and physical appearance, add substantially to the explained variance in QoL among adolescents living in RYC institutions, over and beyond the levels of psychopathology.

Logit models were employed to describe the associations among heat (assessed using temperature, °C), humidity (assessed using vapour pressure, hPa) and two measures of mental health, (i) high or very high distress (assessed using K10 scores ≥ 22) and (ii) having been treated for depression or anxiety. We found a one-unit increase in temperature and vapour pressure was associated with an increase in the occurrence of high or very high distress by 0.2% (p < 0.001, 99% CI: 0.1-0.3%) and 0.1% (p < 0.001, 99% CI: 0.0-0.3%) respectively. However, when humidity rose to the 99th percentile of the sample, the estimated marginal effect of heat was more than doubled (0.5%, p < 0.001, 99% CI: 0.2-0.7%).

This personal story seeks to reveal the nuanced challenges confronting Asian Americans, with a focus on the insidious implications of the model minority myth. While this stereotype might appear as a commendation, it casts Asian Americans in a monolithic mold of success. The author gains insights into their parents' reluctance to seek help for him, uncovering stories of generational silence and community backlash against those who dare to step outside societal norms for mental health care. This reflection highlights the societal pressures that discourage open discussions about mental health and stigmatize seeking help, acting as significant barriers to care within the Asian American community. The current psychiatric paradigms, rooted in Western ideologies, fail to address the cultural contexts in Asian American communities. This oversight underscores an imperative for mental health modalities that resonate with the cultural ethos of Asian Americans. Through a meticulous examination guided by lived experience of culturally competent care, this article highlights the pivotal role of such culturally-informed mental health interventions, advocating for the deconstruction of detrimental stereotypes and championing the integration of culturally resonant practices in psychotherapy for Asian Americans.

The challenge in identifying the mental health consequences of moving is that most moves are (at least partly) voluntary so that the sample of movers is self-selected. We focus on a natural experiment, the government-mandated relocation of some households after all households experienced an exogenous shock. We use this experiment to identify the causal impact of moving on people's mental health, distinguishing between less severe and more severe health conditions, and between individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions and those without. The event we focus on is the 2011 Christchurch (New Zealand) earthquake, and the consequent decision of the government to relocate about 8000 households from some of the earthquake-affected areas. We use a comprehensive administrative dataset that includes health records with information on hospital attendance, specialist services, and prescribed medications for (almost) every resident in the city and compare the relocated individuals to those who lived elsewhere in the earthquake-damaged city. We examine both the likelihood of receiving mental health treatment (the extensive margin), and the intensity of treatment, measured by the number of visits to a clinic or hospital (the intensive margin). We find a statistically significant increase in the likelihood and frequency of receiving treatment for moderate mental health problems among individuals compelled to relocate, when compared to other residents of the earthquake-affected city who were allowed to remain in situ. This increase persisted to December 2013 for everyone, and remained significant for the elderly to the end of 2018.

In line with an existing literature, males reported better mental health over life span, although the declines of mental health in very-late-life are particularly pronounced for males. Decline in mental health was only reported by the youngest and oldest respondents, and was notable only in the last 4-5 years. However, the magnitude of the decline was small and further follow-up will be needed to determine whether this is a trend of substantive declining mental health for these specific age cohorts.

A scoping review was complemented by an expert survey in 24 countries. Mental health-care practice in the region differs greatly across as well as within individual countries. National policies often exist but reforms remain mostly in the realm of aspiration. Services are predominantly based in psychiatric hospitals. Decision making on resource allocation is not transparent, and full economic evaluations of complex interventions and rigorous epidemiological studies are lacking. Stigma seems to be higher than in other European countries, but consideration of human rights and user involvement are increasing. The region has seen respectable development, which happened because of grassroots initiatives supported by international organisations, rather than by systematic implementation of government policies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28495549/"}

To date, there has been no exhaustive review that provides an overview of existing models. To conduct a quasi-systematic review of theoretical models of mental health problems. We searched academic databases, reference lists, and an electronic bookshop for literature that proposed, endorsed, reviewed, or critiqued such models. Papers, book chapters, and books were included with material by researchers, clinicians, non-medical professions, and service users writing between 2000 to June 2020 being considered. The study was registered with the Open Science Framework (No. osf.io/r3tjx). Based on 110 publications, we identified 34 different models which were grouped into five broader categories. Many models bridged two or more categories. Biological and psychological approaches had the largest number of models while social, consumer and cultural models were less diversified. Due to the non-empirical nature of the publications, several limitations in terms of search and quality appraisal apply. We conclude that mental health care needs to acknowledge the diversity of theoretical models on mental health problems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35014924/"}

Although WAH will likely remain after COVID-19, its consequences on workers' health are unclear. This study examines the association of WAH and the change of four mental health (MH) domains. We used data from the last wave of the Survey on Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe, collected in June and July 2020 on European people aged 50 and older. We restricted our analysis to people aged 50-65 who were working before COVID-19 (N = 7065). We modeled the risk of worsening of depression and anxiety feelings, sleeping trouble, and feelings of loneliness as a function of the working situation (usual setting, at home and usual setting, at home only), using logistic regressions. A first model adjusted for sociodemographic variables, a second one adding country fixed effects, and the last one adding the stringency of COVID-19-related restrictions. WAH was significantly associated with a worsening of all MH symptoms. Nevertheless, when the stringency index was factored in, no significant association of WAH was found with any of the health outcomes except for anxiety feelings (+4.3% points). However, the increased anxiety feelings among people in WAH were not greater than the one observed among nonworkers. Our findings show that WAH was not a major cause of mental health deterioration among European mature adults during the first month of the pandemic. Further evidence is needed on WAH under post-COVID-19 \"normal\" circumstances.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894172/"}

The study comprised 1636 subjects, aged 46 and 52 years at baseline. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to model PE trajectories based on a score combining multiple items from the dimensions employment insecurity and income inadequacy. The association between PE trajectories (2011-2022) and mental health (2022) was tested using weighted logistic regression. We identified a PE trajectory with upward movement that best described 13.6% of the study sample. Representation in this group was socially unequally distributed with noticeably larger shares of female, lower-educated and lower-skilled workers in PE. Women following this trajectory had increased odds [odds ratio (OR) 1.68-1.82] of reporting poor mental health in 2022 compared to their counterparts in constant non-PE. This was not the case for men (OR 0.37-0.51). Our findings highlight horizontal and vertical inequalities with respect to exposure to and consequences of PE.

Complex dynamic systems theory states that a slower recovery from small perturbations indicates a loss of resilience of a system. This study is the first to test whether the speed of recovery of affect states from small daily life perturbations predicts changes in psychopathological symptoms over 1 year in a group of adolescents at increased risk for mental disorders. We used data from 157 adolescents from the TWINSSCAN study. Course of psychopathology was operationalized as the 1-year change in the Symptom Checklist-90 sum score. Two groups were defined: one with stable and one with increasing symptom levels. Time-series data on momentary daily affect and daily unpleasant events were collected 10 times a day for 6 days at baseline. We modeled the time-lagged effect of daily unpleasant events on negative and positive affect after each unpleasant event experienced, to examine at which time point the impact of the events is no longer detectable. There was a significant difference between groups in the effect of unpleasant events on negative affect 90 min after the events were reported. Stratified by group, in the Increase group, the effect of unpleasant events on both negative (B = 0.05, p < 0.01) and positive affect (B = - 0. 08, p < 0.01) was still detectable 90 min after the events, whereas in the Stable group this was not the case. Findings cautiously suggest that adolescents who develop more symptoms in the following year may display a slower affect recovery from daily perturbations at baseline. This supports the notion that mental health may behave according to the laws of a complex dynamic system. Future research needs to examine whether these dynamic indicators of system resilience may prove valuable for personalized risk assessment in this field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32066437/"}

At the same time, pressure on reactive health and care services in the UK is increasing. Previous work to quantify the relationship has focused on particular age groups, conditions, or single-item self-rated health. This article reports findings from a study that aimed to provide more comprehensive estimates with an objective of creating an evidential basis for microsimulation modelling of upstream income interventions. We analyse the relationship between income and two health measures - SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) and Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) - across 12 waves (2009/11-2020/22) of Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study. Using a 'within-between' model (Model 1), we find that increases in income compared with an individual's average and a higher income compared with the sample average is associated with better mental health (higher MCS-12 score) and better functional physical health (higher PCS-12 score). However, for a given increase in household income (say £100 per month), the association with better mental and physical health is smaller at higher incomes. This suggests that redistribution from high-income to lower income households would increase average population physical and mental health, other things being equal. Using a random-effects logistic regression (Model 2), we similarly find that average income quintile is inversely and monotonically associated with the probability of having clinically significant symptoms of depressive disorders (MCS-12 ≤ 45.6) and physical health problems (PCS-12 score ≤ 50.0), with smaller changes in these probabilities from increases in income at higher points in the income distribution. These findings facilitate microsimulation modelling including an estimation of the impact of changes in QALYs, from changes in income, enabling a more detailed and complete understanding of which socioeconomic interventions might begin to address some of the causes of long-term health conditions that are underpinned by socioeconomic determinants.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40048442/"}

Specifically, rumination was related to greater levels of suicidal symptoms, social anxiety, anxious arousal, number of mood and anxiety disorders, and disability among individuals with higher, but not lower, levels of negative affectivity. The form of the interaction for depressive symptoms was in line with this pattern, but more extreme; rumination was related to greater levels of depressive symptoms among individuals with both higher and lower levels of negative affectivity. Together, these data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is clinically relevant interplay between rumination and negative affectivity in regard to a relatively wide array of anxiety and depressive variables among Latinos in a primary care medical setting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27294754/"}

Limited work considered cultural norms and the time changing nature of culture and policy. In this study, we draw from the structural stigma theory and hypothesize that both policy protection and cultural acceptance will independently promote LGB mental health and explore their interactive roles. Composing a novel state-year longitudinal dataset on policy and culture related to sexual minority people, we link it to a sample of cisgender LGB adults from the large-scale, representative Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2016-2023). Our multilevel regression models predicted depressive diagnosis and frequent mental distress from varied stigma measures, controlling for state-level and individual-level factors. The results revealed that LGB adults especially bisexual women faced elevated mental health challenges. Models generally showed structural stigma measures in the policy and culture domains were not independent, significant predictors of LGB mental health. Moreover, there was generally no significant and sizable interactions between policy and culture. One exception came from lesbian women, where policy protection was negatively associated with worse mental health, reducing frequent mental distress by around 6 percentage points across policy score ranges. We conclude by discussing the varied findings and encouraging future studies to incorporate the time-changing nature of policy and culture when linking structural stigma to LGB mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40158448/"}

Geriatrics healthcare professionals have long championed innovations in IPE and patient care, but there is increased urgency to address challenges in aging, dementia, and geriatric mental health in America. In 2010, the Partnership for Health in Aging multidisciplinary competencies and a related position statement in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society addressed interdisciplinary team (IDT) training in geriatrics. The position statement reported that training in higher education, academic, and continuing education settings has not been sufficiently responsive to workforce needs. In recent years, health professions educators and health systems leaders have increasingly recognized that IPE should be integrally linked with, and performed within, emerging models of team-based, value-driven health care. In this way, IPE will align with learning healthcare systems' pursuit of the Quadruple Aim: improving patient experience, provider experience, and the health of populations, and reducing per capita health care costs. Backed by decades of developing effective team care models and the skill set needed to care for older adults with complex needs, geriatrics healthcare providers from multiple disciplines are uniquely positioned to lead learning healthcare systems in a new effort to develop, implement, and sustain IPE and practice models congruent with these Aims.

To assess fatigue prevalence and its relationship with mental health outcomes and markers of inflammation, as indexed by C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in bereaved individuals. Seventy-eight-bereaved adults were examined for fatigue (SF-36 energy/vitality scale), perceived stress (PSS), depression (CES-D), sleep quality (PSQI), pain (SF-36 pain scale), and general health (SF-36 general), and their serum levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured. Group differences between fatigued versus non-fatigued individuals were estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with adjustment for body mass index (BMI). Fatigued bereaved individuals (33%; SF-36 energy/vitality score 0-45) had significantly higher CRP levels (p < .05) as compared to non-fatigued bereaved individuals and reported higher levels of pain (p < .001), greater stress (p < .001), depression (p < .001), and sleeping problems (p < .001), as well as poorer social functioning (p < .001) and general health (p < .001) than those in the non-fatigued group.

At 24 months after the death, participants had not attained the same level of mental health as the general population. Within limitations of the design and sample, 2 conclusions were reached: (a) the overall pattern of change in bereavement was similar to that of distressed patients receiving outpatient mental health services, and (b) the patterns of change for individuals vary, making it important to consider clinical characteristics that might account for individual differences.

In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex connection between greenspace and mental health, a variety of perspectives and methodological combinations are needed. The aim of this review is to assess the current methodologies researching greenspace and mental health. A scoping review was conducted. Four electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science) were searched for relevant studies. A wide range of greenspace and mental health keywords were included to provide a comprehensive representation of the body of research. Relevant information on publication characteristics, types of greenspaces, mental health outcomes, and measurements of greenspace exposure and mental health was extracted and assessed. 338 studies were included. The included studies encompassed a multitude of methods, as well as outcomes for both greenspace and mental health. 28 combinations were found between seven categories each for greenspace and mental health assessment. Some pairings such as geoinformation systems for greenspace assessment and questionnaires investigating mental health were used much more frequently than others, implying possible research gaps. Furthermore, we identified problems and inconsistences in reporting of greenspace types and mental health outcomes. The identified methodological variety is a potential for researching the complex connections between greenspace and mental health. Commonly used combinations can provide important insights.

The aims of this study were to (i) obtain an understanding of the relationships between social exclusion, mental health and wellbeing of young people; and (ii) identify potentially modifiable targets, or population groups that require greater or targeted supports. Data were obtained from the Mission Australia 2022 <i>Youth Survey</i>, Australia's largest annual population-wide survey of young people aged 15-19 years (<i>n</i> = 18,800). Participants' experiences of social exclusion in different domains were explored (e.g., prevalence, co-occurrence and controlling for differences in demographic characteristics). Multivariable linear regression models were used to map the relationships between social exclusion domains and mental health and wellbeing, controlling for confounding factors where necessary. Sixty per cent of all young people experienced social exclusion in at least one domain, 25% in multiple. Young people who identified as gender diverse, Indigenous, living in a remote/rural or socio-economically disadvantaged area and with a culturally diverse background were more likely to report social exclusion. A strong association was seen between all domains of social exclusion and poor mental health (e.g., higher psychological distress and loneliness, reduced personal wellbeing, reduced sense of control over their life and a more negative outlook on the future). Notably, difficulties in socialising and obtaining social support were critical factors linked to increased psychological distress and reduced wellbeing. Findings underscore the need to address multiple domains of social exclusion concurrently, and in collaboration with youth mental healthcare. Prevention efforts aimed at early identification and intervention should be prioritised to support young people vulnerable to social exclusion. Screening approaches are needed to identify individuals and groups of young people in need of support, and to facilitate care coordination across multiple providers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39801367/"}

This suggests that well-being and health should be affected by biodiversity change, but few studies have begun to explore these relationships.

Our hypothesis is that YAM operates through interactions with coping strategies (CS) on the reduction of suicidal ideation (SI). In the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study, five coping strategies were assessed at baseline (T0) and 12-month follow-up (T12): \"learning\", \"help-seeking\", \"arts\", \"sports\" and \"fight\". We analyzed interactions between the YAM intervention, coping strategies and SI in the YAM group (N = 1693) and the minimal intervention group (N = 1909), after excluding prevalent cases with SI and previous suicide attempts from our total sample (N = 5654). General Linear Mixed Model regressions were performed. The present study confirms that coping strategies play an influential role on suicidal ideation. Our results showed that YAM acts whatever the prevailing coping strategies used. It is particularly efficient for pupils insufficiently using adaptive coping strategies such as LEARN and HELP-SEEKING or using maladaptive coping strategies, such as ARTS and FIGHT. The socialization induced by the YAM intervention seems to be a strong component of its efficiency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32025960/"}

Relevant studies were identified through conducting searches in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsyInfo, Social Services Abstracts, and PILOTS. Two reviewers analyzed and selected studies. A qualitative synthesis was made. 3149 references were obtained, among which eight articles describing nine interventions from the USA and the UK. Most were intended for women with mental/intellectual disability and assessed intimate partner or sexual violence. Only one study showed high methodological quality. They were found to be particularly effective as regards improvement of the skills acquired by participants, but the results as regards improved mental health are not consistent.

Health care systems and policymakers should take a key role in all three levels of prevention of violence against women with disabilities. Interventions with longer follow-up times are required. It is also important for interventions to be designed in consultation with people with disabilities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38804594/"}

There are myriad challenges and barriers ranging from testing interventions that do not target priority needs of populations or policymakers to interventions that cannot achieve adequate coverage to decrease the treatment gap in LMIC. We propose a 'roadmap to impact' process that guides planning for interventions to move from the research space to the implementation space. We establish four criteria and nine associated indicators that can be evaluated in low-resource settings to foster the greatest likelihood of successfully scaling mental health and psychosocial interventions. The criteria are relevance (indicators: population need, cultural and contextual fit), effectiveness (change in mental health outcome, change in hypothesised mechanism of action), quality (adherence, competence, attendance) and feasibility (coverage, cost). In the research space, relevance and effectiveness need to be established before moving into the implementation space. In the implementation space, ongoing monitoring of quality and feasibility is required to achieve and maintain a positive public health impact. Ultimately, a database or repository needs to be developed with these criteria and indicators to help researchers establish and monitor minimum benchmarks for the indicators, and for policymakers and practitioners to be able to select what interventions will be most likely to succeed in their settings. A practicable roadmap with a sequence of measurable indicators is an important step to delivering interventions at scale and reducing the mental health treatment gap around the world.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33239113/"}

To date, there is limited research on the mental health of young people aged 12-25 years in Ireland. The My World Survey (MWS) national study provides data on risk and protective factors of mental health among 14 306 young people. The MWS was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 - MWS-Second Level (MWS-SL) with adolescents aged 12-19 years, and Phase 2 - MWS-Post Second Level among young adults aged 17-25 years. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the MWS-SL study. Another aim is to identify key learning points when conducting research in the second-level school system. The MWS-SL study was conducted with 6085 adolescents aged 12-19 years in 72 second-level schools. The MWS consists of standardized reliable and valid measures that have been used internationally to assess a range of risk and protective factors associated with adolescent mental health. Schools recruited for the MWS-SL study represented quite well the national distribution of second-level schools based on gender composition, disadvantaged/non-disadvantaged status and geographic location. Key learning points when collecting survey data in schools include pilot testing of survey instruments; building relationships with key stakeholders to ensure buy-in for the study from schools; establishing rigorous data collection and processing protocols; and recognizing the value of online surveys.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22947343/"}

Although the structured data are used for reporting purposes, the free text remains untapped for DV reporting and surveillance purposes. In this paper, we explore whether text mining can automatically identify mental health disorders from this unstructured text. We used a training set of 200 DV recorded events to design a knowledge-driven approach based on lexical patterns in text suggesting mental health disorders for POIs and victims. The precision returned from an evaluation set of 100 DV events was 97.5% and 87.1% for mental health disorders related to POIs and victims, respectively. After applying our approach to a large-scale corpus of almost a half million DV events, we identified 77,995 events (15.83%) that mentioned mental health disorders, with 76.96% (60,032/77,995) of those linked to POIs versus 16.47% (12,852/77,995) for the victims and 6.55% (5111/77,995) for both. Depression was the most common mental health disorder mentioned in both victims (22.25%, 3269) and POIs (18.70%, 8944), followed by alcohol abuse for POIs (12.19%, 5829) and various anxiety disorders (eg, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder) for victims (11.66%, 1714). The results suggest that text mining can automatically extract targeted information from police-recorded DV events to support further public health research into the nexus between mental health disorders and DV.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30213778/"}

To evaluate associations among sociodemographic and behavioral factors and mental health after exposure to sexual violence. Participants were 780 men and women who experienced sexual violence who participated in the 2005 South Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. The factors analyzed were gender, age, race, income, and education; having health insurance, an identified healthcare provider, and adequate emotional support; and diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol use. Poor mental health was defined as 5 or more poor mental health days in the past 30 days. Data were analyzed using the SAS Procedures for Analysis of Sample Survey Data. Victims of sexual violence were at greater risk of experiencing 5 or more poor mental health days than those who did not (95% confidence interval for odds ratio = 2.05-3.07, p < .0001). Poor mental health among those who experienced sexual violence was associated with younger age (p = .005), lower income (p = .02), lower educational attainment (p = .0007), lack of emotional support (p = .0001), and lack of health insurance (p = .03). Gender, race, and having an identified healthcare provider were not associated significantly with mental health. Behavioral factors significantly associated with better mental health (after controlling for socio-economic status) were healthy diet (p = .05), exercise (p = .02), and not smoking (p = .0001). Alcohol use was not associated with mental health. Treatment after sexual violence should include attention to risk factors including low income, low educational attainment, and lack of emotional support and to the protective influence of behavioral factors including a healthy diet, exercise, and not smoking. Comprehensive integrated models of care addressing mental, physical, and social sequelae of sexual violence are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18496103/"}

Consequently, this study examines subsequent mental health associations of low-quality employment. Associations between EQ and mental health are investigated through a typology of employment arrangements. This study also investigates whether the relation between EQ types and subsequent mental health is different for workers with varying intensities of work and family values (i.e., importance of success at work and of having children, respectively) across genders. Using a large representative German panel dataset and Latent Class Cluster Analysis, EQ types are built and linked to mental health two years later. We assess two- and three-way interactions between EQ types and values, and between EQ types, gender and values, respectively. We found six EQ types: SER-like, precarious unsustainable, precarious full-time, SER-light, portfolio and protected part-time employment. Controlled for socio-demographic characteristics, precarious unsustainable employment for men and precarious full-time employment for women were associated to lower mental health after two years, compared to SER-like employment. Although protected part-time employment related to worse mental health for those with moderate to strong work and family values, compared to those with mild values, the interactions show an unclear pattern of the moderating role of values for the relation between EQ and subsequent mental health, for both men and women. This study should be replicated in other countries to confirm similar associations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40081166/"}

Whereas social inclusion as an outcome is not a new concept in the field of mental health, its measurement has been hampered by varying definitions, concepts and instruments. To move the field forward, this paper reviews the currently available instruments which measure social inclusion and are reported in the literature, realizing that no single measure will be appropriate for all studies or contexts. A systematic literature search of English language peer-reviewed articles published through February 2013 was undertaken to identify scales specifically developed to measure social inclusion or social/community integration among populations with mental disorders. Five instruments were identified through the search criteria. The scales are discussed in terms of their theoretical underpinnings, domains and/or key items and their potential for use in global settings. Whereas numerous reviewed abstracts discussed mental health and social inclusion or social integration, very few were concerned with direct measurement of the construct. All identified scales were developed in high-income countries with limited attention paid to how the scale could be adapted for cross-cultural use. Social inclusion is increasingly highlighted as a key outcome for global mental health policies and programmes, yet its measurement is underdeveloped. There is need for a global cross-cultural measure that has been developed and tested in diverse settings. However, until that need is met, some of the scales presented here may be amenable to adaptation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24306926/"}
{"id": "29636316", "title": "Harnessing Reddit to Understand the Written-Communication Challenges Experienced by Individuals With Mental Health Disorders: Analysis of Texts From Mental Health Communities.", "text": "Mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are common, incapacitating, and have the potential to be fatal. Despite the prevalence and gravity of mental disorders, our knowledge concerning everyday challenges associated with them is relatively limited. One of the most studied deficits related to everyday challenges is language impairment, yet we do not know how mental disorders can impact common forms of written communication, for example, social media. The aims of this study were to investigate written communication challenges manifest in online mental health communities focusing on depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as the impact of participating in these online mental health communities on written communication. As the control, we selected three online health communities focusing on positive emotion, exercising, and weight management. We examined lexical diversity and readability, both important features for measuring the quality of writing. We used four well-established readability metrics that consider word frequencies and syntactic complexity to measure writers' written communication ability. We then measured the lexical diversity by calculating the percentage of unique words in posts. To compare lexical diversity and readability among communities, we first applied pairwise independent sample t tests, followed by P value adjustments using the prespecified Hommel procedure to adjust for multiple comparison. To measure the changes, we applied linear least squares regression to the readability and lexical diversity scores against the interaction sequence for each member, followed by pairwise independent sample t tests and P value adjustments. Given the large sample of members, we also report effect sizes and 95% CIs for the pairwise comparisons. On average, members of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia communities showed indications of difficulty expressing their ideas compared with three other online health communities. Our results also suggest that participating in these platforms has the potential to improve members' written communication. For example, members of all three mental health communities showed statistically significant improvement in both lexical diversity and readability compared with members of the OHC focusing on positive emotion. We provide new insights into the written communication challenges faced by individuals suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. A comparison with three other online health communities suggests that written communication in mental health communities is significantly more difficult to read, while also consisting of a significantly less diverse lexicon. We contribute practical suggestions for utilizing our findings in Web-based communication settings to enhance members' communicative experience. We consider these findings to be an important step toward understanding and addressing everyday written communication challenges among individuals suffering from mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29636316/"}

Results indicated significant ethnic differences across dimensions of religiousness. African Americans were significantly higher on religious engagement and religious conservatism than the other ethnic groups and significantly lower on religious struggle than European Americans. Moderated multiple regressions revealed that increases in religious struggle was associated with poorer mental health for African Americans and Latino Americans, while increases in religious engagement and ecumenical worldview were associated with better mental health for African Americans.

The weighted analysis showed that educational standards and student interest were large facilitators for both HICs and LMICs. Faculty expertise stood out as a facilitator and the lack thereof as a barrier, both across HICs and LMICs. For HICs, regulation issues, lack of recognition, lack of supervised/fieldwork practice, and lack of workforce demand were frequently reported barriers, whereas lack of teaching resources and practice evidence were often perceived as barriers in LMICs.

Study I and II had cross-sectional designs and used logistic regression analysis to study differences in poor mental health (measured with prescribed psychotropic drugs purchased) between refugee and non-refugee immigrants. In Study I, there was a significant difference in poor mental health between female refugees and non-refugees (OR=1.27; CI=1.15-1.40) when adjusted for socio-economic factors. In Study II, refugees of most origins had a higher likelihood of poor mental health than non-refugees of the same origin. Study III and IV had cohort designs and used Cox regression analysis. Study III analysed mortality rates among non-labour immigrants. Male refugees had higher relative risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease (HR=1.53; CI=1.04-2.24) and external causes (HR=1.59; CI=1.01-2.50) than male non-refugees did, adjusted for socio-economic factors. Study IV included the population with a strong connection to the labour market in 1999 to analyse the relative risk of hospitalisation due to depressive disorder following unemployment. The lowest relative risk was found among employed Swedish-born men and the highest among foreign-born females who lost employment during follow-up (HR=3.47; CI=3.02-3.98). Immigrants, and particularly refugees, have poorer mental health than native Swedes. Refugee men have a higher relative mortality risk for cardiovascular disease and external causes of death than do non-refugees. The relative risk of hospitalisation due to depressive disorder following unemployment was highest among immigrant women. To promote mental health and reduce mortality among immigrants, it is important to consider pre- and post-migration factors and the general social determinants of health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23810108/"}
{"id": "30072159", "title": "Positive mental health and supportive school environments: A population-level longitudinal study of dispositional optimism and school relationships in early adolescence.", "text": "The present study examined the degree to which early adolescents' relationship experiences in school (i.e., peer group belonging, peer victimization, and supportive relationships with adults)-at the individual level and at the school-level-were associated with their dispositional optimism, concurrently and over time. Self-report data from over 4000 4th and 7th graders were obtained via a population-level measure designed to assess students' supportive relationships, well-being, and resilience (i.e., the Middle Years Development Instrument). An indicator for family income (SES) was obtained through tax filer information. Multilevel modeling revealed that in Grade 4, greater peer belonging, fewer experiences of peer victimization, and higher levels of adult support in school were linked to higher optimism, above and beyond the effects of sex, age, English as a Second Language (ESL), and SES. Additionally, school-wide levels of peer belonging and adult support (i.e., indicators of a supportive social school climate) were significant positive school-level predictors of optimism. Longitudinally, school-wide peer belonging in Grade 4 was associated to increases in students' optimism from 4th to 7th grade. The findings suggest that positive relationship experiences in school are key contributors to positive mental health, over and above the absence of negative relationship experiences (i.e., victimization). These findings also suggest that being embedded in a school with a positive social relational climate contributes to students' current and future positive mental health, over and above individual relationships with peers and adults. The present research extends previous research by identifying contextual assets that are linked to dispositional optimism and can be applied in the context of school-based intervention programs to promote positive mental health in schools.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30072159/"}

A subsequent survey used advertisements linking to a Facebook page that featured links to the external survey, recruiting 610 participants at $1.51 per completion. Both surveys were more cost-effective than similar postal surveys conducted previously, which averaged $19.10 per completion. Online and postal surveys both had somewhat unrepresentative samples. However, online surveys tended to be more successful in recruiting hard-to-reach populations.

The objective of this review is to synthesise findings on the effectiveness of MMH interventions to improve child-related outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched for randomised controlled trials conducted in LMICs evaluating interventions with a MMH component and reporting children's outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed on outcomes included in at least two trials. We identified 21 trials with 28 284 mother-child dyads. Most trials were conducted in middle-income countries, evaluating home visiting interventions delivered by general health workers, starting in the third trimester of pregnancy. Only ten trials described acceptable methods for blinding outcome assessors. Four trials showed high risk of bias in at least two of the seven domains assessed in this review. Narrative synthesis showed promising but inconclusive findings for child-related outcomes. Meta-analysis identified a sizeable impact of interventions on exclusive breastfeeding (risk ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.71, ten trials, N = 4749 mother-child dyads, I2 = 61%) and a small effect on child height-for-age at 6-months (std. mean difference = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.24, three trials, N = 1388, I2 = 0%). Meta-analyses did not identify intervention benefits for child cognitive and other growth outcomes; however, few trials measured these outcomes. These findings support the importance of MMH to improve child-related outcomes in LMICs, particularly exclusive breastfeeding.

Declared as a public health crisis in 2024, It disproportionately affects African Americans. It is linked to discriminatory policies like \"redlining,\" which fostered racial segregation and systemic inequities, perpetuating cycles of violence and mental health disparities. This study explores the relationships between racial segregation, systemic inequities, gun violence, and mental health through a data-driven, longitudinal study (2005-2021) of Milwaukee, WI, a hyper segregated metropolitan region. Our investigation aims to inform evidence-based, place-sensitive policies to promote social justice, reduce disparities, and foster healthy communities. Utilizing location-based demographic and socio-economic data from the U.S. Census, gun violence data from the Wisconsin Incident-Based Reporting System, and mental health data from the CDC's PLACES dataset, we conduct spatial and temporal analyses and geovisualization in GIS. To understand trends and correlations, we conduct time series decomposition, Mann-Kendall trend tests, and entropy statistics. Our findings indicate that racially segregated neighborhoods experience higher rates of gun violence and poorer mental health outcomes. Predominantly African American neighborhoods exhibit patterns of \"consecutive,\" \"sporadic,\" and \"new\" hotspots of gun violence, while predominantly white neighborhoods are characterized as \"cold spots.\" Physical and mental health disparities in Milwaukee indicate similar patterns. The results of this study highlight the profound impact of historical and systemic socioeconomic discrimination on contemporary public health issues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40263236/"}

Union of India. In its judgment, the Court held that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is unconstitutional in as much as it criminalises consensual sexual acts between two adults. The Court held that Section 377 discriminates against persons of the LGBTIQ community based on their sexual orientation and violates their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The Court arrived at this conclusion after considering established principles of constitutional law, foreign precedents and expert opinions. However, a crucial part of the Court�s reasoning was based on a close reading of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. The Court relied on the anti-discriminatory provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 to observe that homosexuality is not a mental illness or mental disorder, and that LGBTIQ persons cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation. The Court�s reading of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 and Section 377 is significant as its rationale can be extended further to challenge other laws which discriminate against persons with mental illness. The Court also highlights the responsibilities of mental health professionals and counsellors while providing mental healthcare to LGBTIQ persons. Finally, the Court�s reading of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is also a recognition of its commitment as an anti-discrimination legislation which upholds constitutional values and protects the rights of persons with mental illness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30683633/"}

However, their joint contribution to mental health has received limited attention. The present study used cross-sectional data from the Mental Health Million Project to examine the independent and joint effects of sleep and PA on mental health among a global sample of adults, and whether these effects differ among individuals receiving mental health treatment. The sample included 200,743 participants (33.1% young adults, 45.6% middle-aged adults, 21.3% older adults; 57.6% females, 0.9% other) from 213 countries, territories, and archipelagos worldwide that completed a comprehensive 47-item assessment of mental health including both problems (i.e., ill-being) and assets (i.e., well-being): the Mental Health Quotient. Participants also reported their weekly frequency of PA and adequate sleep, and mental health treatment status. A series of generalized linear mixed models were computed. Independent dose-response associations were observed, whereby greater amounts of PA and adequate sleep were each associated with better mental health. In addition, a synergistic interaction was observed in which the positive correlation of PA with mental health was strengthened with greater frequency of adequate sleep. These benefits were less pronounced among adults receiving mental health treatment. While findings suggest sleep can help to offset the negative influence of a physically inactive lifestyle (and vice versa), our results point to a \"more is better\" approach for both behaviors when it comes to promoting mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38532194/"}

Multilevel study of 568 Ecuadorian adults in 33 AR randomly selected from civil registries and interviewed at home. Possible psychiatric case (PPC) was measured by scoring ≥5 in General Health Questionnaire-28. Ecuadorians' ethnic density was dichotomized in high and low EED (<6 %). Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Prevalence of PPC, 24 % (95 %CI 20-28 %), varied by area of residence. Ecuadorians' ethnic density varied by area of residence ranging from 0.9 to 19.5 %. PPC prevalence in High Ecuadorians' ethnic density AR was 29.5 and 20.4 % in low EED AR (p 0.013). Ecuadorians from High EED AR had higher odds of PPC than those from Low EED AR (OR 1.65 95 %CI 1.01-2.72).

The objectives of this qualitative study were to (1) understand how LHD officials perceive population mental health; (2) identify factors that influence these perceptions and LHD activities to address population mental health; and (3) develop an empirically derived conceptual framework of LHD engagement in population mental health. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of LHD officials and analyzed using thematic content analysis in 2014-2015. Transcripts were double coded, inter-rater reliability statistics were calculated, and categories with κ ≥0.60 were retained. Respondents perceived mental health as a public health issue and expressed that it has emerged as a priority through community health needs assessment processes, such as those conducted for health department accreditation. However, most LHDs were not substantively engaged in population mental health activities because of limited resources, knowledge, data, and hesitancy to infringe upon the territory of local behavioral health agencies. LHDs and local behavioral health agencies had difficulty communicating and collaborating because of divergent perspectives and financing arrangements.

This cross-sectional study included 1489 4-6-year-old children - residents of Kaunas city, Lithuania. Responses to the questionnaires completed by parents were used to ascertain children's general and mental health. We estimated exposure to greenness by the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and time spent in a park (i.e. park use). We used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the independent associations between health outcomes and surrounding greenness and time spent in the nearest city park, controlling for potential confounders. Of all the studied children, 14% had poor perceived general health, and 44.7% spent 5 or more hours per week in city parks. A significant increase in sedentary behaviour was observed in children with poor health. Every additional hour of time spent in parks was associated with decreased sedentary behaviour and a lower risk of poor health; meanwhile, lower residential greenness was associated with poorer mental and general health. Compared with NDVI-100 m > median and park use exceeding 5 h per week, lower greenness exposure and shorter park usage were associated with the risk of poor health (adjusted odds ratio 2.32 (95% CI: 1.43, 3.78) and the general risk of mental difficulties (adjusted odds ratio 1.43 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.18) in 4-6-year-old children.

This paper extends previous assessments of development assistance for mental health (DAMH) in two significant ways; first by contrasting DAMH against that for other disease categories, and second by benchmarking allocated development assistance against the core disease burden metric (disability-adjusted life year) as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Studies. In order to track DAH, IHME collates information from audited financial records, project level data, and budget information from the primary global health channels. The diverse set of data were standardised and put into a single inflation adjusted currency (2015 US dollars) and each dollar disbursed was assigned up to one health focus areas from 1990 through 2015. We tied these health financing estimates to disease burden estimates (DALYs) produced by the Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study to calculated a standardised measure across health focus areas-development assistance for health (in US Dollars) per DALY. DAMH increased from USD 18 million in 1995 to USD 132 million in 2015, which equates to 0.4% of total DAH in 2015. Over 1990 to 2015, private philanthropy was the most significant source (USD 435 million, 30% of DAMH), while the United States government provided USD 270 million of total DAMH. South and Southeast Asia received the largest proportion of funding for mental health in 2013 (34%). DAMH available per DALY in 2013 ranged from USD 0.27 in East Asia and the Pacific to USD 1.18 in the Middle East and North Africa. HIV/AIDS received the largest ratio of funds to burden-approximately USD150 per DALY in 2013. Mental and substance use disorders and its broader category of non-communicable disease received less than USD1 of DAH per DALY. Combining estimates of disease burden and development assistance for health provides a valuable perspective on DAH resource allocation. The findings from this research point to several patterns of unproportioned distribution of DAH, none more apparent than the low levels of international investment in non-communicable diseases, and in particular, mental health. However, burden of disease estimates are only one input by which DAH should be determined.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28046059/"}

Since floods and heavy precipitation are the most frequent EWE in Germany, the focus was placed on them.An increase in anxiety disorders, depression symptoms, posttraumatic stress and behavioural disorders can be observed in children and adolescents after an EWE. The literature provides little information on the prevalence of such mental health effects as a result of EWEs and their effects, and which risk factors are of importance. There is thus still considerable need for research internationally and especially in Germany.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30976819/"}

Single level linear regression models stratified by welfare regime and multilevel regression models, containing interaction terms between socioeconomic position and welfare regime type, were calculated. socioeconomic inequalities in life satisfaction were present in all welfare regimes. Educational inequalities in life satisfaction were narrowest in Scandinavian and Bismarckian regimes among both genders. Post-communist and Southern countries experienced both lower life satisfaction and larger socioeconomic inequalities in life satisfaction, using most measures of socioeconomic position. Current wealth was associated with large inequalities in life satisfaction across all regimes. Scandinavian and Bismarckian countries exhibited narrower socioeconomic inequalities in life satisfaction. This suggests that more generous welfare states help to produce a more equitable distribution of wellbeing among older people.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24476800/"}

Yet the mental health implications of engaging in these relationships are unclear; past research has found negative associations, positive associations, or no association with mental health. In addition, little research has accounted for mental health status prior to entering casual sexual relationships. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 12,401), we measured mental health prior to engaging in casual sexual relationships and subsequent mental health after engaging in these relationships. We found that suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in adolescence were associated with entrance into casual sexual relationships in emerging adulthood. Furthermore, casual sexual relationships were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation in emerging adulthood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24168063/"}
{"id": "24035399", "title": "The impact of peer support in the context of perinatal mental illness: a meta-ethnography.", "text": "this paper is a report of a systematic review and meta-ethnography to explore the impact of peer support in the context of perinatal mental illness (PMI). systematic review methods identified five qualitative studies about women's experiences of PMI, and the impact peer support has on their journey towards emotional well-being. Findings from the identified studies were synthesised into themes, using meta-ethnography. the meta-ethnography produced four themes; 'Isolation: the role of peer support', 'Seeking validation through peer support', 'The importance of social norms of motherhood', and 'Finding affirmation/a way forward; the impact of peer support'. These themes represent women's experiences of PMI, their encounters with peer support groups within that context, and the impact of such encounters on their mental health status. recognising the risk of isolation and having pathways of referral to peer support networks is important, as are practitioners roles in nurturing peer support networks in perinatal care. More research is required to establish the most successful formats/structures of peer support. Practitioners should also recognise their individual and collective professional duty to challenge stereotypical depictions of motherhood wherever they arise, as this 'gold standard' benchmark of good mothering engenders guilt about not being good enough, often leaving women feeling inadequate. isolation is a key factor in PMI. Practitioners should be instrumental in their acceptance and development of peer support for PMI, ensuring these networks are valued, nurtured and encouraged. This study illustrates the powerful effect of professional and social forces on how new mothers feel about themselves.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24035399/"}

This article presents the results of a regional audit of assessments under the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. The aims of the audit were to examine routine practice, identify any issues and so inform how policy and practice may be developed. The audit was designed by an inter-agency advisory group and audit team. Data were collected for a sample of 189 assessments. The sample was weighted to ensure all Health and Social Care Trusts and settings were appropriately represented. These assessments involve high levels of need, risk and complexity. There were no major issues or concerns identified in the majority of assessments. The issues that were identified were mainly due to the difficulties in coordinating professionals and in securing a bed. In 3/189 (2%) of assessments, these issues were identified as contributing to increased distress and risk. The results highlight the complexities of these processes and confirm the need for opportunities, such as joint training and inter-agency interface groups, to further promote cooperation and identify when pressures on resources are increasing risk and distress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31240967/"}
