We seek to analyze the incidence and epidemiology of LUTI with special attention to trends in urology consultation. A retrospective review was conducted of patients presenting to our Level I trauma center with LUTI from 2002 to 2016. Demographics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, injury severity score (ISS), American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) injury scales, and clinical hospital course were analyzed. A total of 140 patients (0.47% of all trauma patients) were identified with LUTI, with 72.1% of these presenting with blunt trauma. Bladder injuries were more common than urethral injuries (79% vs. 14%) with 6% of patients having both. In-hospital mortality was 9.2% (13/140). Among patients with LUTI, 115 patients (82%) received urology consultation. There was no significant difference in sex, age, or LOS (hospital and ICU) between the groups. The consult group had a lower mean ISS (21.7 vs 27.9, p = 0.034), but a higher mean AAST bladder injury scale (2.57 vs 2.00, p = 0.016), than the non-consult group. There was a statistically significant difference in the diagnosis methods between the two groups (χ<sup>2</sup> test of independence, p = 0.002). Urology service is important in the management of LUTI with high AAST injury scale. While further study is needed to look at degree of urology service involvement in the management of LUTI, we recommend a consultation for severe LUTI or when the management of injuries is out of the comfort zone of the trauma surgeons. Whether consultation is obtained or not, there is room for improvement in appropriate work up of lower urinary tract injury.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31677053/"}

Treatment decisions are frequently made with little or no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and thus require evidence from other data sources. Clinical routine data reflect real-world treatment pathways. However, evidence for LUTS from routine data means that heterogeneous pathways need to be simultaneously analyzed for compiling evidence in the absence of RCTs. Statistical multi-state model approaches can provide a powerful framework for achieving this goal. More extensive statistical and methodological efforts in the area of similarity of small data are needed to enable the valid pooling of pathways towards joining evidence. PATIENT SUMMARY: Treatment decisions should rely primarily on evidence from clinical trials. When treatment for which there is limited trial evidence needs to be provided, analysis of results from routine clinical practice can represent valuable complementary evidence, but this requires integration of data from heterogeneous treatment pathways.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35414493/"}

Specific etiologies are unknown; most cases are suspected by discovering hydronephrosis on prenatal ultrasonography. Congenital UTO can reduce nephron number and cause bladder dysfunction, which contribute to ongoing injury. Severe UTO can impair kidney growth in utero, and animal models of unilateral ureteral obstruction show that ischemia and oxidative stress cause proximal tubular cell death, with later development of interstitial fibrosis. Congenital obstructive nephropathy, therefore, results from combined developmental and obstructive kidney injury. Because of inadequacy of available biomarkers, criteria for surgical correction of upper tract obstruction are poorly established. Lower tract obstruction requires fetal or immediate postnatal intervention, and the rate of progression of CKD is highly variable. New biomarkers based on proteomics and determination of glomerular number by magnetic resonance imaging should improve future care. Angiotensin inhibitors have not been effective in slowing progression, although avoidance of nephrotoxins and timely treatment of hypertension are important. Because congenital UTO begins in fetal life, smooth transfer of care from perinatologist to pediatric and adult urology and nephrology teams should optimize quality of life and ultimate outcomes for these patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26088076/"}

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria after negative workup should be followed with annual urinalysis with repeat urologic evaluation if it persists after 5 years. Hydronephrosis is another commonly encountered diagnosis. Functional urinary obstruction should be excluded using a diuretic nuclear renography in the appropriate population. Asymptomatic, stable hydronephrosis can be observed, but those with acute, symptomatic obstruction, or patients with suspected obstruction with signs of infection, should seek urologic care for intervention. Hydronephrosis is common in pregnant women; symptomatic patients merit intervention similar to nonpregnant patients. The management of patients with an acute stone episode is similar to that for those with hydronephrosis. Patients with first stone episodes need evaluation for risk factors for stone formation, whereas patients with identified risk factors or recurrent stones need comprehensive metabolic workup. Patients with incidentally found kidney masses should be referred to urology for possible intervention when they have solid kidney masses or cystic masses that need further evaluation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23978551/"}

This study aims to elucidate specific practice patterns for treatment of prenatal unilateral urinary tract dilation and to assess surgical intervention patterns for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. An online survey was distributed to 234 pediatric urologists through the Society of Pediatric Urology. The survey was composed of five clinical case scenarios addressing evaluation and management of unilateral urinary tract dilation. The response rate was 71% (n = 168). Circumcision status, gender, and grade were significant factors in recommending prophylactic antibiotics for newborn urinary tract dilation. Prophylactic antibiotic use in the uncircumcised male and female was twice that of a circumcised male for grade 3 (Table). This difference was minimized for grade 4. Use of VCUG was high for circumcised males with grade 3 or 4 (Table). The choice of minimally invasive surgery for ureteropelvic junction repair increased with age from 19% for a 5-month-old, 49% for a 2-year-old, and 85% for a 10-year-old. Notably, 44% of respondents would observe a 10-year-old with intermittent obstruction. Retrograde pyelography was recommended in conjunction with repair in 65% of respondents. Antegrade stent placement was the most common choice (38-47%) for urinary diversion after pyeloplasty. Regarding postoperative imaging, only 5% opted for routine renal scan whereas most would perform renal ultrasound alone. Practice patterns seen for use of prophylactic antibiotics are in agreement with the literature, which promotes selective use in those at highest risk for urinary tract infections. Interestingly, use of aggressive screening was not concordant with this literature. Several studies have indicated an increased usage of robotic pyeloplasty; however, results indicate that minimally invasive surgery is not preferred in those younger than 6 months. Study limitations include use of clinical case scenarios as opposed to actual clinical practice. Practice patterns for prophylactic antibiotic use for neonatal urinary tract dilation are dependent on gender, circumcision status, and grade. The use of minimally invasive surgery for ureteropelvic junction repair increased with patient age, with 50% preferring this modality at 2 years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28506597/"}

Predicting renal recovery from obstructive uropathy, can be challenging and necessitates treatment, as in percutaneous nephrostomy (PNS) drainage. The choice of drainage method depends on patient-specific factors and local expertise. According to the data for the Republic of North Macedonia, in the register of the European Renal Association, in the last few years, there has been an increase in the percentage of patients with obstructive nephropathy from 7.6% to 8.9% who end up on a chronic hemodialysis program. Prompt relief from urinary tract obstruction is essential to preserve renal function and prevent complications. The aim of this study is to present our initial data analysis of recent experience in the use of nephrostomies as a method for temporary or long-term resolution of obstructive nephropathy, in terms of safety and success in preserving kidney function and reducing the number of patients on hemodialysis. This study analyzed the medical records of 24 patients with obstructive uropathy who underwent PNS placement. Data were collected for the type and degree of obstruction from the ultrasonographic examination. A pig tail nephrostomy was used, with a dilator, guided under ultrasound and controlled with contrast and fluoroscope. Obstructive nephropathy was defined as an elevation of the serum creatinine > 109 µmol/L, before the intervention. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to the formula CKD epi in ml/min. Each placement of the PNS was considered as an individual procedure and the data of 38 placed nephrostomies were analyzed. We compared the laboratory analyses from the day before (D0) PNS placement and on the seventh day (D7) after PNS placement. The reduction of values for red blood cells (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) baseline values from D0 to D7 and the need for transfusion after the procedure were defined as a complication-bleeding. The increase in total counts of the white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) from the baseline values from D0 to D7 were defined as a complication-infection. Standard statistical methods were used for data processing. Most patients, 17 (70%), had malignant disease as the cause of obstruction. Unilateral obstruction was more common, detected in 24 (63%) of procedures, with a high degree of hydronephrosis. Obstructive nephropathy, marked by elevated serum creatinine, was observed in 23 (60%) cases before PNS placement. Complications included bleeding and infection but did not result in any fatalities. When comparing the laboratory analysis before PNS placement (D0) and seven days later (D7), a statistically significant decrease in serum creatinine (225±161 vs. 162±145, p=0.005) and an increase in GFR (47±39 vs.59±34, p= 0.005) were observed. Percutaneous nephrostomy is a safe and effective treatment option for urinary tract obstruction, especially in patients with malignancies. Continuous monitoring is essential to assess long-term complications and the longevity of PNS functionality. This procedure offers a significant benefit in preserving renal function and minimizing the need for hemodialysis in these patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38575377/"}

Eleven staff urologists and 9 urology learners performed cystoscopy on a series of pig bladders containing mock papillary and flat lesions. Each provided three sets of size estimates: two using only the cystoscope to assess intraobserver agreement and the third with the aid of a ureteral catheter as a visual reference. Similar estimates were made with a flexible ureteroscope on papillary lesions within an inorganic upper urinary tract model. Differences in mean estimates and the agreement between repeated estimates were assessed. The level of endoscopic training did not influence the mean error of estimation (MEE) for either cystoscopy or ureteroscopy regardless of lesion size and appearance. Staff and learners consistently underestimated lesion size with median errors of 34% and 43%, with excellent (median intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.97) and fair (median ICC of 0.56) reproducibility for cystoscopy and ureteroscopy, respectively. Use of the visual reference during cystoscopy did not improve the MEE. Urologists, regardless of their level of training, substantially underestimate lesion size by 34% to 43%. These findings are independent of lesion size and appearance, and the use of a visual reference during cystoscopy.

A full version of the guidelines is available in print (EAU Guidelines 2014 edition, ISBN/EAN 978-90-79754-65-6) and online (www.uroweb.org). Blunt trauma is the main cause of LUTI. The preferred diagnostic modality for bladder and urethral injury is cystography and urethrography, respectively. In the treatment of bladder injuries, it is important to distinguish between extra- and intraperitoneal ruptures. Treatment of male anterior urethral injuries depends on the cause (blunt vs penetrating vs penile-fracture-related injury). Blunt posterior urethral injuries can be corrected by immediate/early endoscopic realignment. If this is not possible, such injuries are managed by suprapubic urinary diversion and deferred (>3 mo) urethroplasty.

A variety of worldwide experts from multiple disciplines in the ICCS leadership who care for children with lower urinary tract dysfunction were assembled as part of the standardization committee. A critical review of the previous ICCS terminology document and the current literature was performed. In addition, contributions and feedback from the multidisciplinary ICCS membership were solicited. Following a review of the literature during the last 7 years the ICCS experts assembled a new terminology document reflecting the current understanding of bladder function and lower urinary tract dysfunction in children using resources from the literature review, expert opinion and ICCS member feedback. The present ICCS terminology document provides a current and consensus update to the evolving terminology and understanding of lower urinary tract function in children.

We performed a literature review by searching the MEDLINE database for articles published between 1996 and 2011, limiting the searches to the words: urinary tract endometriosis, bladderendometriosis, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Deep pelvic endometriosis usually involves the urinary system, with the bladder being affected in 85% of cases. The diagnosis has to be considered as a step-by-step procedure. Currently, the treatment is usually surgical, consisting of either transurethral resection or partial cystectomy, and eventually associated with hormonal therapy. The hormonal therapy alone counteracts only the stimulus of endometriotic tissue proliferation, with no effects on the scarring caused by this tissue. The overall recurrence rate is about 30% for combined therapies and about 35% for the hormonal treatment alone. The bladder is the most common affected site in urinary tract endometriosis. Most of the time, this condition is diagnosed because of the complaint of urinary symptoms during gynecologic follow-up procedures for a deep pelvic endometriosis: a close collaboration between the gynecologist and the urologist is advisable, especially in highly specialized centers.

Slow drainage demonstrated at Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renography does not necessarily mean obstruction. Obstruction is defined as resistance to urinary outflow with urinary stasis at the level of the pelvic-ureteric junction (PUJ) which, if left untreated, will damage the kidney. Unfortunately this definition is retrospective and not clinically helpful. Therefore, the identification of the kidney at risk of losing function in an asymptomatic patient is a major research goal. In the context of renovascular hypertension a DMSA scan can be useful before and after revascularisation procedures (angioplasty or surgery) to assess for gain in kidney function. Renal calculi are increasingly frequent in children. Whilst the vast majority of patients with renal stones do not need functional imaging, DMSA scans with SPECT and a low dose limited CT can be very helpful in the case of complex renal calculi. Congenital renal anomalies such as duplex kidneys, horseshoe kidneys, crossed-fused kidneys and multi-cystic dysplastic kidneys greatly benefit from functional imaging to identify regional parenchymal function, thus directing further management. Positron emission tomography (PET) is being actively tested in genito-urinary malignancies. Encouraging initial reports suggest that F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is more sensitive than CT in the assessment of lymph nodal metastases in patients with genito-urinary sarcomas; an increased sensitivity in comparison to isotope bone scans for skeletal metastatic disease has also been reported. Further evaluation is necessary, especially with the promising advent of PET/MRI scanners.

Endourological Society members were e-mailed a web-based survey about their prior experience with contrast-related ADRs and practices for contrast administration into the urinary tract among patients with known intravenous contrast allergies. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare management patterns between patients with established allergies and those without. An estimated 2300-2500 e-mails were reached, resulting in an estimated response rate of 6.3%-8%. Over 75% of respondents were fellowship trained. Average time in practice was 16 years, and respondents performed a mean of 6.7 urologic contrast studies per week. Among respondents, 32.6%, 14.7%, and 4.0% had treated at least 1 patient with a mild, moderate, or severe reaction, respectively. Contrast-related ADRs were most commonly associated with retrograde pyelogram (50%). For patients with known contrast allergies, 5.4% pursue additional work-up before administering contrast in the urinary tract. Pretreatment with antihistamine or steroids is used by 24.8% and 23.4%, respectively. When performing retrograde pyelograms for such patients, urologists are more likely to use dilute contrast (P = .003), but otherwise do not significantly alter technique.

Urinary tract injuries can occur even with an initially inconspicuous status and always require explicit exclusion diagnostics by means of contrast medium tomography of the entire urinary tract and, if necessary, by means of urographic and endoscopic examinations. The most common urological intervention is catheterization of the urinary tract which is often required. Less common is urological surgery, which should be coordinated interdisciplinarily with visceral and trauma surgery. More than 90% of vitally threatening kidney injuries (usually up to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grades 4-5) are now treated by interventional radiology.

When bacteria enter the bladder or kidney and multiply in the urine, a URI can occur. The urethra is shorter in women than in men, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause infection. A comparison of the research differences between Urology and Nephrology (UN) authors regarding UTI pertaining to the 4 areas (i.e., Chronic Kidney Disease, Hemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, and Renal Transplantation [CHPR]) is thus necessary. We propose and verify 2 hypotheses: CHPR-related articles on UTI have equal journal impact factors (JIFs) in research achievements (RAs) and UN authors have similar research features (RFs). Based on keywords associated with UTI and CHPR in titles, subject areas, and abstracts since 2013, we obtained 1284 abstracts and their associated metadata (e.g., citations, authors, research institutes, departments, countries of origin) from the Web of Science core collection. There were 1030 corresponding and first (co-first) authors with hT-JIF-indices (i.e., JIF was computed using hT-index rather than citations as usual). The following 5 visualizations were used to present the author's RA: radar, Sankey, time-to-event, impact beam plot, and choropleth map. The forest plot was used to distinguish RFs by observing the proportional counts of keyword plus in Web of Science core collection between UN authors. It was observed that CHPR-related articles had unequal JIFs (χ2 = 13.08, P = .004, df = 3, n = 1030) and UN departments had different RFs (Q = 53.24, df = 29, P = .004).

Bibliometric analyses have been performed across a range of biomedical disciplines. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of Irish urology and nephrology research and to analyse how this compares internationally. We performed a retrospective bibliometric analysis of the top 20 ranking journals in the field of \"Urology and Nephrology\" based on their 5 years impact factor, as obtained from the ISI Journal Citation Report database over the 15-year study period, 2000-2015. Utilising the Pubmed database, a search phrase was constructed using country of affiliation, year of publication and journal title. The abstracts of the Irish publications identified were analysed for their institution of origin, article theme and content. A total of 67,740 article abstracts were analysed over the 15 years study period. As anticipated, the USA accounted for the largest number of publications by a country [28,206 (41.64 % of all articles)]. Ireland contributed 347 articles in total (0.51 % of all articles); however, ranking according to population per million was 13th worldwide. Ireland's contribution to urology and nephrology research was highest in the BJUI-British Journal of Urology International [76 articles (21.90 % of Irish total)]. We believe this study to be the largest bibliometric analysis in the field of urology and nephrology internationally.

The objective of this study was to describe the variability in opinion between subspecialists in the diagnosis of a UTI in CIC-dependent children. A scenario-based survey was distributed to physicians in the divisions of urology, nephrology, and hospital medicine at a single free-standing children's hospital. Respondents rated their degree of confidence on whether a specific scenario represented UTI or colonization on an 11-point Likert Scale. Median responses were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test with pair-wise comparisons. Back/flank pain, abdominal pain, and vomiting were the most common symptoms that were suggestive of a UTI in a non-febrile child. There was no single symptom chosen that was the most suggestive of a UTI in CIC-dependent child. There was significant variability between specialists in the diagnosis of UTI in specific clinical scenarios on the survey. Hospitalists were significantly less confident about the diagnosis of a UTI than urologists in two of the clinical scenarios.

Research activities related to bladder physiology, neurophysiology and neuropharmacology have increased in the last 10 years. Primarily a purely basic scientific field, neurourology now commences to become a clinically highly significant and useful research domain. This article offers insight into the latest developments in the diagnostic techniques of this exciting field. One of these is smooth muscle EMG of the urinary bladder that aims at distinguishing between signal pattern changes and subsequent evaluation of the different functional and electrophysiological states of smooth muscle cells in various pathologies or in pharmacological tests during urodynamic investigation. A second innovative method in geriatric patients is the measurement of the sensory input to the brain due to bladder distention.

We conducted a retrospective study by searching our hospital's electronic database. We found a total of 16 APMs performed between 1987 and 1995 (10 boys, six girls; mean age 61 months). In nine cases, action was undertaken immediately after the APM had been performed; in seven cases, this was a surgical procedure (re-implantation/re-calibration or pyeloplasty) after obstruction was demonstrated. In two cases (both postoperative after previous pyeloplasty), absence of obstruction was demonstrated and nephrostomy tubes were subsequently closed. In one case, this resulted in hydronephrosis that had to be treated with a new JJ stent. In all the seven cases in which no action was deemed necessary as a result of the outcome of the APM, long-term follow-up showed that intervention had indeed not been necessary.

The disease spectrum includes developmental and cystic diseases, involvement by systemic diseases, iatrogenic complications, ascending infections and urinary tract obstruction, and neoplastic diseases. The diagnosis of kidney disease is unique involving 2 subspecialties, urologic pathology and renal pathology. Both renal and urologic pathologists employ the renal biopsy as a diagnostic modality. However, urologic pathologists commonly have a generous specimen in the form of a nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy while a renal pathologist requires ancillary modalities of immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The 2 subspecialties differ in the disease spectrum they diagnose. This separation is not absolute as diseases of one subspecialty not infrequently appear in the diagnostic materials of the other. The presence of medical renal diseases in a nephrectomy specimen is well described and recommendations for reporting these findings have been formalized. However, urologic diseases appearing in a medical renal biopsy have received less attention. This review attempts to fill that gap by first reviewing the perirenal anatomy to illustrate why inadvertent biopsy of adjacent organs occurs and determine its incidence in renal biopsies followed by a discussion of gross anatomic features relevant to the microscopic domain of the medical renal biopsy.

Certainly, with emergence of obesity epidemic, we started to see an increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and nephrolithiasis. Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have shown that the incident stone risk increases with body mass index (BMI), and no further increase in risk is noticed when the BMI > 30 kg/m(2). Furthermore, metabolic syndrome and diabetes are also associated with an increase in the incidence of renal stones disease. The shared links between these metabolic disorders are insulin resistance. Furthermore, insulin resistance is thought to alter renal acid-base metabolism, resulting in a lower urine pH and increased risk of uric acid stone disease. Obesity is also associated with excess nutritional intake of lithogenic substances such as refined sugars, low fluid intake, calcium, oxalate, and purine-rich foods. Obesity is also associated with an increase in incidence of urinary tract infection. Recent reports suggested that renal stone disease carries risk of myocardial infarction, progression of CKD, and diabetes. Alarmingly, orlistat (obesity medication) and bariatric surgery are associated with hyperoxaluria and associated stone formation and even oxalate nephropathy.

Using a case study approach, ancient medical texts were analyzed to clarify the etymology and use of both terms. In addition, selected anatomy textbooks from the 15th to 17th centuries were searched to identify and compare descriptions, illustrations, and various expressions used by contemporary authors to designate the upper and lower parts of the urinary tract. The Ancient Greek words \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" appear early in Hippocratic and Aristotelian writings. However, both terms designated what we today call the urethra. It was only with increasing anatomical knowledge in Greek medical texts after the 1st century AD that definitions of these words evolved similar to those we employ today. Numerous synonyms were used which served as a basis for translation into Arabic and later Latin during the transfer of ancient knowledge to the cultures of the medieval period. When Greek original texts and their Arabic-Latin version were compared during the Renaissance, this led to terminological confusion which could only be gradually overcome. Around the year 1600, the use of the latinized terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" became generally accepted. The dissemination of these terms in modern national languages and the emergence of clinical derivatives complete this historical development. The history of the terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" is exemplary of the difficulties with which the development of a precise urologic terminology had to struggle.

These findings led to the elaboration of methods of destroying bacteria in the urethra before operation, improving the disinfection of cystoscopes, and preventing the entry of bacteria via the indwelling catheter.

We assess the successful endoscopic completion and oncological efficacy of the various minimally invasive transurethral techniques devised for the management of the intramural ureter during nephroureterectomy. A comprehensive review of the English literature until February 2009 using the PubMed database returned 42 relevant papers. Five methods of endoscopic management of the distal ureter were identified and compared to the open technique. There are no randomised studies. Successful completion of the endoscopic procedure was less (91%) for the ureteric stripping technique than for the other endoscopic modalities (99.8-100%). Recurrences were highest for laparoscopic extravesical ureteric stapling in conjunction with cystoscopic detachment of the ureter, although the numbers analysed were small. For the other endoscopic modalities, bladder recurrence, positive margins and retroperitoneal recurrence (20-37, 0-4 and 1-3%, respectively) in case series were similar compared with the open method (36, 5 and 3%, respectively). Current non-randomised evidence is open to selection bias and is insufficient to support or refute endoscopic management of the distal ureter as an alternative to open bladder cuff excision. We highlight the reported inefficiency of the ureteric stripping technique.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20332611/"}

In this article, we briefly trace the course of nephrology's history to show a clear arc in its evolution-of increasing resolution in nephrological data-an arc that is converging with computational capabilities to enable precision nephrology. In general, precision medicine refers to tailoring treatment to the individual characteristics of patients. For an operational definition, this tailoring takes the form of an optimization, in which treatments are selected to maximize a patient's expected health with respect to all available data. Because modern health data are large and high resolution, this optimization process requires computational intervention, and it must be tuned to the contours of specific medical disciplines. An advantage of this operational definition for precision medicine is that it allows us to better understand what precision medicine means in the context of a specific medical discipline. The goal of this article was to demonstrate how to instantiate this definition of precision medicine for the field of nephrology. Correspondingly, the goal of precision nephrology was to answer two related questions: ( 1 ) How do we optimize kidney health with respect to all available data? and ( 2 ) How do we optimize general health with respect to kidney data?", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36951457/"}

The theory of the 'filter kidney' cannot thus be attributed to Aristotle. The function of the kidney was described as being to separate the surplus liquid from the blood inside the renal meat (not in the renal pelvis) and to transform this liquid into what Aristotle called residuum, i.e. the urine.

Results already published in the last ten years based on characterisation techniques present in laboratories or specific to large-scale instruments are presented. Their usefulness for the clinician is discussed. The presence and role of heavy metals in urinary stones through data collected through μX-ray fluorescence is debated. If these data suggest a simple substitution process of calcium, recent data suggest that weddellite is associated to a Zn-rich environment, partly favoured by an inflammation process. Investigation on the chemistry and the structure of unusual deposits in kidney biopsies show a great chemical diversity of ectopic calcifications. Such diversity shows that staining procedures to characterize such deposits are obsolete. Finally, several diseases which can be assessed through techniques specific to large-scale instruments and defined by the clinician are presented.

Renal injuries between these two extremes require careful assessment and clinical judgement to decide the best management. An intravenous urogram remains the mainstay of investigation but computed tomography, ultrasound and arteriography can be useful in some circumstances. The management of urethral trauma remains controversial and depends largely on the assessment of whether the posterior urethra is partially or completely ruptured. There remain two schools of thought concerning early or late intervention but all are agreed that suprapubic diversion is essential and that a urethral catheter should not be passed blindly in the initial stages. A ruptured bladder should always be repaired and early intervention is recommended for ureteric injuries.

Surface-based geometric data for the lower urinary tract were generated from the National Library of Medicine Visible Human dataset. The three-dimensional texture map of the surface geometry was developed from recorded endoscopic video procedures. Geometry and associated texture maps were rendered in real time using the Silicon Graphics Extreme Impacts program. The surgical interface device incorporated all normal ranges of motion and resistance that occur within an actual operative environment. The hands-on endoscopic device attached to the interface device was provided by Circon-ACMI, Inc. Urologic residents evaluated the program for correlation with actual endoscopic procedures. Texture-mapped digitized images provided a close anatomic similarity to actual videoendoscopic images. Virtual endoscopy of the lower urinary tract was reproducible and closely simulated actual visual and tactile endoscopic experience. Virtual reality surgical simulation is feasible for a variety of lower urinary tract procedures. This system coordinates visual perception with appropriate haptic feedback in both longitudinal and rotational axes. These types of procedures may be incorporated into future educational experiences for urologists to introduce new techniques and to provide documentation of surgical experience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12028630/"}

Traditional medical education has many drawbacks, such as residency working hour restrictions, patient safety conflicts with the learning needs, and the lack of hands-on workshops. The MedTRain3DModsim Project aimed to produce 3-dimensional (3D) medical printed models, simulations, and innovative applications for every level of medical training using novel worldwide technologies. It was aimed herein to improve the interdisciplinary and transnational approaches, and accumulate existing experience for medical education, postgraduate studies, and specialty training. This project focused on models of solid organs and the urinary system, including the kidney, prostate, ureter, and liver. With 3D medical printing, it is possible to produce a body part from inert materials in just a few hours with the standardization of medical 3D modeling. The target groups of this project included medical students and residents, graduate students from engineering departments who needed medical education and surgical training, and medical researchers interested in health technology or clinical and surgical an atomy. It was also intended to develop a novel imaging platform for education and training by reevaluating the existing data using new software and 3D modalities.

It affects as many as 2-4 in 1000 live births, however there are no epidemiological studies available from India. Anatomical and neurogenic abnormalities of the urinary tract are known to occur in these patients. Scanty literature is available regarding the utility of radionuclide procedures in the evaluation of urinary tract in patients of MMC. The aim of this study was to evaluate urinary tract dysfunction and malformations in patients operated of MMC by diuretic renal dynamic scintigraphy (RDS) and direct radionuclide cystography (DRCG). In this retrospective analysis, 140 operated patients for MMC, mean age: 4.46, range: 1-18 years; 83 male and 57 female, referred to our department for evaluation of the upper renal tract, were studied. Neurogenic bladder (NB) was associated in 69 patients. The diagnosis of NB was based on clinical features like incontinence, expressibility of urine bladder and on urodynamic studies. RDS was performed after the intravenous administration of 10.36 MBq/kg of technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetate or 99mTc-L, L-ethylenedicysteine. All patients with hydronephrosis (HDN) or hydroureteronephrosis (HDUN) on RDS underwent DRCG using 11.1-18.5 MBq of 99mTc-sulphur colloid. Our results showed that: out of the 140 patients, 78 (56%) including 33 with NB, had normal renal scintigraphy. Six patients (4%) had congenital renal anomalies. Twenty patients (14%) revealed non-obstructive HDN and had no vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). Thirty-six patients (26%) with bilateral HDUN also had NB of which 19 (53%) had VUR. Fourteen (74%) of these patients with VUR had impaired renal function. In discussion, patients with MMC may present with disordered innervation of the detrussor muscle and external sphincter, which adversely affects the bladder function and potentially threatens the upper urinary tract. Patients of MMC with or without NB can be evaluated with RDS for congenital anomalies and initial assessment of renal function. Patients with NB and particularly those with HDUN can be evaluated with DRCG for the presence of VUR to prevent renal scarring and subsequent impairment of renal function. Long-term surveillance of the urinary tract is important in the management of these patients and this can be accomplished with RDS and DRCG. In conclusion, in our patients with MMC, the tests of RDS, and DRCG could differentiate those with normal or our abnormal renal anatomy and function while the major group of patients had bilateral HDUN and NB, and/or VUR or impaired renal function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17684585/"}

We investigated the risk factors (RF) for delayed graft function (DGF) and patient and graft survival (SV). We analyzed retrospectively the characteristics and evolution of 1500 KT performed by INU until December 2014. The incidence of DGF and RF for patient and graft SV were analyzed in 4 eras, according to the year that KT was performed. The number of KT per year has progressively increased until reaching 40 KT per million population in 2006, with a decrease of the living donor KT (LDKT) rate. The age of the donors (D) and recipients (R) as well as the time on dialysis (TOD) have progressively increased over the different eras. Five hundred twenty-five R (35%) presented with DGF. The RF for DGF were the age of the R and the D, the TOD, the DDKT, and the warm ischemia time (WIT). In the DDKT group, the cold ischemia time and \"died of stroke\" were added factors. The death-censored graft SV at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 90%, 76%, 62%, and 49%, respectively. They improved as from era I, the patient SV being 92%, 83%, and 75% at 1, 5, and 10 years, in era I; 98%, 93%, and 86% in era II; 98%, 92%, and 83% in era III; and 95% and 90% at 1 and 5 years in era IV (P < .001). The graft SV over the same periods was 76%, 58%, and 40% in era I; 88%, 68%, and 52% in era II; 93%, 81%, and 70% in era III; and 93% and 85% at 1 and 5 years in era IV (P < .0001). The RF for patient SV were diabetes mellitus, era I, lower albuminemia, older age or TOD, and DGF. For kidney SV, the era, the age of the R, TOD, DGF, and D older than 60 years were RF associated with a worse evolution. In DDKT, the RF for the graft SV were the era, younger age of the R, and DGF. The group with the worst graft SV was the one made up of children and adolescents. Our results relating to patient and graft SV are acceptable and comparable to those mentioned on large records such as the OPNT/SRTR and the Collaborative Transplant Study. This has been the case, even though we have transplanted increasingly aged patients, with increasingly aged donors, or donors with associated pathology. The risk factors that we found both for DGF and SV have also been pointed out by other authors. The validity of some findings has the limitation of being from a retrospective analysis; hence, they should be corroborated by a prospective study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27110015/"}

We recorded 486 cuff inflation cycles during 142 voids from 42 subjects recruited from urology out-patient's and prostate assessment clinics. Each inflation cycle was assessed independently by three experienced observers, a total of 1,458 ratings. According to our standard assessment procedure, the observers (i) indicated whether the inflation should be analyzed, (ii) estimated p(cuff,int) for those inflation cycles judged suitable for analysis, and (iii) discarded measurements that were clearly inconsistent with others from the same voiding cycle. Overall, 689 of the 1,458 ratings (45%) were excluded, with just 4% of all ratings discarded for inconsistency. For 385 of the 486 inflation cycles (79%) there was complete agreement that the cycle should or should not be analyzed. Thereafter, for the 262 inflation cycles analyzed by two or three observers, the overall SD error in measurements of p(cuff,int) was 4.6 cm H(2)O.

Summarized confidential responses were stratified by specialty, AHN grade, and laterality. A total of 88 of 139 responses were received (response rate, 63.3%; 95% confidence interval, 55.0%-71.0%): 46 nephrologists, 39 urologists, and 3 undisclosed. Only 17 of 88 (19.32%; 95% confidence interval, 12.4%-28.8%) reported following standardized AHN protocols. Concern surrounding the development of urinary tract infections was the main deciding factor for prescribing CAP (nephrology, 65.4%; urology, 71.4%). Almost a third of nephrologists (29.6%) recommend CAP for bilateral low-grade AHN compared with 11.4% of urologists (P = .02); in contrast, 73% of nephrologists and 38.2% of urologists (P = .02) offer CAP in the presence of isolated high-grade AHN. In regards to indications for voiding cystourethrogram, 31% of pediatric nephrologists would recommend this test for patients with unilateral low-grade AHN compared with 7.7% of urologists (P < .01), although almost all nephrologists (96.6%) and 69.2% of urologists (P = .02) would obtain this test for patients with unilateral high-grade isolated AHN. Our results show important practice variability between pediatric nephrologists and urologists in the management of children with AHN, which are partially explained by laterality and degree of dilation.

Transit time has been mainly used in urinary obstruction, renal artery stenosis, or renovascular hypertension and renal transplant. Despite a large amount of published data on obstruction, only the value of normal transit is established. The value of delayed transit remains controversial, probably due to lack of a gold standard for obstruction.

The book begins with a 3 page letter to Francis Maria della Rovere Duke of Montefeltro, and a 2 page letter to the readers. We discuss the novelties of the chapters on renal colic (de dolorerenum), hematuria (de sanguinis profluvium), pyuria, anuria (de urina suppressa) and its cure, polyuria (de urina profluvio), renal abscesses, hydrops and its treatment by skin incisions. We also analyze the chapter on kidney and bladder stones (Book X, Chapter XVIII, pp. 354-356) - a masterpiece of scholarly teaching - encompassing localization of stones, their formation and shape, renal colic and its irradiation according to the site and gender, the best antalgic position to pass stones, the use of laxatives, cathartics, warm baths, the plants to be used, their preparation and quality, the waters to be drank and their quantity (up to 15 pounds a day), the removal of bladder stones without surgery (methods learned in Cairo and described in Aegyptyan Medicine), and lithotomy and its feasibility even in old people. De Medicina Methodicawas a modern monograph devoted to clinical medicine including urinary disease. The book reflected the polyhedral personality of the author, his experience as physician of the Republic of Venice at Cairo, and his capabilities as a director of the Botanical Garden of the University of Padua, a unique research centre in those times.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913897/"}

We prospectively collected data on a total of 270 patients (540 kidneys) who underwent CT-urography. We then constructed three-dimensional images of the renal pelvis and examined their morphologic classification. Forty-eight kidneys were excluded from this study because of severe hydronephrosis or large renal cysts. The remaining 492 kidneys were included. We systematically categorized each minor calix into five levels: top, upper, middle, lower, and bottom. The upper, middle, and lower calices were typically found in pairs: anterior and posterior. The most common total number of minor calices was eight (51%), followed by seven (30%). We also classified the form of the pelvis into type I: single pelvis (58%) and type II: divided pelvis (42%), according to the branch patterns of the renal pelvis. In type II, the renal pelvis is always bifurcated into the upper branch (top and upper) and lower branch (middle, lower, and bottom). Type I was subclassified into three types: type Ia (43%), the standard type; type Ib (4%), with a wide pelvis; and type Ic (11%), with a narrow pelvis. This anatomical classification can divide the renal pelvis into two major types (subdivided into four types) and name each minor calix. This simple classification enables to share common intrarenal information, thus leading to the development of concrete treatment strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29845879/"}

Two separate questionnaires were issued for renal mpMRI and for MRU. Consensus was strictly defined using a priori criteria. Forty-two expert uroradiologists completed both survey rounds with no attrition between the rounds. Fifty-six of 84 (67%) statements of the mpMRI questionnaire and 44/71 (62%) statements of the MRU questionnaire reached final consensus. For mpMRI, there was consensus that no injection of furosemide was needed and that the imaging protocol should include T2-weighted imaging, dual chemical shift imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value, 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and fat-saturated single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic) contrast-enhanced imaging; late imaging (more than 10 min after injection) was judged optional. For MRU, the patients should void their bladder before the examination. The protocol must include T2-weighted imaging, anatomical fast T1/T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value, 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and fat-saturated single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, excretory) contrast-enhanced imaging.

Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients regarding other parameters such as experience and available facilities. Guidelines are not mandates and do not purport to be a legal standard of care. To present a summary of the 2023 version of the EAU guidelines on the management of urological trauma. A systematic literature search was conducted from 1966 to 2022, and articles with the highest certainty evidence were selected. It is important to note that due to its nature, genitourinary trauma literature still relies heavily on expert opinion and retrospective series. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries, covering a time frame between May 1, 2021 and April 29, 2022. A total of 1236 unique records were identified, retrieved, and screened for relevance. The guidelines provide an evidence-based approach for the management of urological trauma. Trauma is a serious public health problem with significant social and economic costs. Urological trauma is common; traffic accidents, falls, intrapersonal violence, and iatrogenic injuries are the main causes. Developments in technology, continuous training of medical professionals, and improved care of polytrauma patients reduce morbidity and maximise the opportunity for quick recovery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37968186/"}

We developed a new noninvasive test to measure bladder pressure in males based on controlled inflation of a penile cuff during voiding. We compared the new technique with simultaneous invasive bladder pressure measurement. We evaluated 7 volunteers and 32 patients. A conventional pressure flow study was performed first. The bladder was refilled, a penile cuff was fitted and after voiding commenced the cuff was inflated in steps of 10 cm. water every 0.75 seconds until urine flow was interrupted. The cuff was rapidly deflated, allowing flow to resume, and the cycle was repeated until the end of voiding. The flow rate was graphed against cuff pressure for each interruption cycle to determine the pressure at which flow was interrupted. This pressure was compared with simultaneous invasive isovolumetric bladder pressure. Invasive and noninvasive pressure measurements agreed well. Average cuff pressure at interruption of flow exceeded mean simultaneous isovolumetric bladder pressure plus or minus standard deviation by 14.5 +/- 14.0 cm. water. The new method provides noninvasive quantitative information on voiding bladder pressure in males.

The results were considered \"positive\" when urinary incontinence decreased and the patient referred a subjective sensation of improvement, and \"negative\" if otherwise. Positive results were demonstrated in 8 patients (40%). Ten patients (50%) refused to continue, mainly due to urinary tract infection in 7 cases (35%), difficulties in plug use (loss of plugs, anomalous urethral anatomy, cystocele,...) in 6 cases (30%) and urethral mucosa irritation in one case (5%).

The cuff is then deflated slowly until urinary flow of at least 1 ml/s is detected and is then released rapidly to permit unimpeded flow. Cuff pressure, voided volume, and flow rate are recorded as functions of time. From the resulting tracings it is possible to determine the isovolumetric bladder pressure, the impulsive flow rate, and the flow pattern specific to the test. We studied 53 male patients demonstrating that data thus obtained are reproducible and that the cuff pressure at the initiation of voiding does measure the bladder pressure at this moment. We then modeled the lower urinary tract by an analog electrical circuit which facilitated the analysis of the urodynamic data. This analysis suggests that it is possible to separate the effects of bladder dysfunction from the effects of urethral resistance and to localize the resistance to the proximal or distal urethra without invasive testing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7780437/"}

In order to improve the generally unsatisfactory situation, we developed, together with the Rüsch Co., a new type of directable and deconnectable ureteral stent. This polyurethane catheter features a membrane valve made of soft Wiruthan at the bladder end, which closes automatically with increasing bladder pressure. Thus, urinary backflow from the urinary bladder into the renal pelvis is prevented. Experimental data from antireflux stenting justify the clinical use of such a stent in children, as the urodynamic in vivo criteria and requirements were fulfilled completely. We now have clinical experience with the application of 340 pyeloureteral DD stents in 241 children from 1993 through 1996; 259 stents were inserted intraoperatively, and 81 stents were applied by endoscope. It was impressive that secondarily, renal function that had been considerably reduced could be regained and stabilized by long-term stenting, even in some older children with chronic supravesical ureteral obstruction. Although small technical details have to be clarified, such as simplification of stent retrieval and an antireflux valve that can be applied using an anterograde approach, the DD valve stent used in this patient population after reconstruction of a malformed supravesical urinary tract can be recommended without any reservations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9440853/"}

Nevertheless, his 2100 page Traité which begins with a description of his innovative and highly disciplined method of study, most unusual at this time, is by no means lacking in interest for today's nephrologists.

At nearly the same time in Marburg, Carl Ludwig, unaware of Bowman's findings, proposed that urine formation begins with glomerular filtration followed by tubule reabsorption. The controversy lasted 80 yr. Prominent investigators weighed in on both sides. Rudolph Heidenhain's findings in 1874 swung the pendulum toward Bowman's theory until Arthur Cushny published his book, The Secretion of Urine, in 1917, in which he found the evidence insufficient to prove either theory. In 1921, a young physician, Joseph Wearn, began his postresidency training in the laboratory of Alfred N. Richards. He read Cushny's book and learned how to expose the glomerulus of a living frog. Richards proposed that Wearn use that experimental preparation to inject epinephrine into the glomerulus. Wearn proposed a different experiment: instead of using injection, collect fluid from the glomerulus and analyze it. Richards agreed, and the landmark results of that experiment, published in 1924, settled the controversy. The modern era of renal physiology was born.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434011/"}

An identical, 31-question multiple-choice survey was sent to program directors of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited urology residency programs in 2006 and 2013. The areas of focus included program demographics, extent of urotrauma exposure, program director perceptions regarding educational value of urotrauma, and impact of GURS fellowship trained faculty. Responses were de-identified, compiled, and compared for differences. Response rates were 57% (64/112) and 43% (53/123) for the 2006 and 2013 survey, respectively (P = .03). Trauma Level 1 designation (56/64 [89%] vs 44/53 [88%], P = .84) and presence of GURS faculty (22/64 [34%] vs 22/53 [43%], P = .43) were similar between survey periods. Although survey respondents felt urotrauma volume had remained constant (34/64 [53%] vs 30/53 [56%], P = .71), more recent respondents reported that conservative management strategies negatively impacted resident exposure (14/64 [22%] vs 23/53 [43%], P = .01). Residencies with GURS faculty in 2013 (22/53, 42%) were positively associated with residents publishing urotrauma literature (9/22 [41%] vs 4/31 [13%], P = .02), the presence of multidisciplinary trauma and urology conferences (3/22 [14%] vs 0/31 [0%], P = .03), and residents matriculating to GURS fellowships (15/22 [68%] vs 10/31 [32%], P = .009). Many contemporary urology residencies report poor resident exposure to urotrauma during training. Although presence of GURS faculty may influence resident career choice, additional strategies may be warranted to expose residents to urotrauma during training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26494295/"}

A report is presented on 101 children with bilateral, severe urinary passage anomalies, who were operated on in the first year of life, with the goal of early, total correction. The following experiences are of general significance: 1. The earlier the symptoms -- in 90% of cases, pyuria -- the more severe are the findings. -- 2. Males are primarily affected, here at a ratio of 7:3. As a result, pyuria in infants must be explained urologically, particularly when it occurs in males. -- This report is a plea for early, total correction and against periodic urinary drainage. Results show a 50% decrease in infections, flow disturbances, and biochemical changes, as well as a postoperative burst of growth also in 50% of cases. Cinematographic examinations show normal peristalsis even after skeletization and drastic reduction of a megaureter. The mortality was 9%, in the first year of life, 6%. Surprisingly, the result was not influenced by the presence or absence of reflux, but rather by stigmas and inferior development. Reflux had probably already played its fateful part in this severe bilateral disease, so that antireflux plastic surgery loses its prophylactic value. Compared with reports of experiences with periodic urinary drainage, our aim is to disprove the argument that, in difficult cases, total correction is dangerous: on the contrary, our results are better and coincide with the experiences of Hendren.

Here a non-invasive method to determine the isovolumetric bladder pressure to judge contractility is presented. This is based on interruption of urine flow by sudden occlusion of a specially fixed condom catheter. The pressure inside the condom is recorded and used to estimate the isovolumetric bladder pressure. Combined with, for example, home uroflowmetry, this non-invasive method may overcome some of the disadvantages (e.g., invasiveness, cost) of the conventional pressure flow test. To determine the isovolumetric bladder pressure reliably with this non-invasive method, two constraints have to be met. First, the bladder neck and urethra have to remain open after occlusion of the condom catheter. This was tested combining the non-invasive test with radiography in five patients. Second, a steady state has to be reached, i.e., the flow in the urethra, due to the elastic properties of the biological and the condom systems, should come to a stop when the bladder pressure and the condom pressure equilibrate. This was investigated by comparing the non-invasively recorded condom pressure with the simultaneously invasively recorded intravesical pressure in 52 patients. In these patients, three different methods of condom fixation were evaluated. The results show that the bladder neck and urethra remain open during the test. However, a steady state is often not reached. In more than 80% of the cases with the best condom fixation, the bladder pressure has not stabilized, although the condom pressure reached a plateau. Therefore, this method of sudden occlusion is not yet clinically applicable for determining the isovolumetric bladder pressure. Neurourol.

{"id": "12579409", "title": "Twenty-one years of developmental nephrology: the kidney then and now.", "text": "Developmental renal physiology was guided for a long time by the notion that the \"immature\" kidney is characterized by glomerular-tubular imbalance, with glomerular preponderance. In accordance with this concept, the filtering capacity of the developing kidney exceeds the ability of the renal tubules to handle the filtrate, resulting in the urinary loss of substances such as amino acids and bicarbonate. Estimates of age-related changes in glomerular volume, based on measurements of glomerular diameter, and of proximal tubular volume, based on measurements of tubular length and tubular diameter, appeared to support this contention. The experimental approach that led to these conclusions was based on the assumptions that the increase in glomerular size is distributed evenly between the vascular and nonvascular elements and that tubular volume increases pari passu with the luminal surface area. Both assumptions were proved wrong. Moreover, micropuncture studies performed in guinea pigs and rats revealed that the proportionality between glomerular filtration and proximal reabsorption of fluid (i.e., glomerulo-tubular balance) is maintained throughout development. Subsequent studies showed that several transport mechanisms function quite adequately from the first days of extrauterine life. Sodium is avidly reabsorbed in distal nephron segments, under the stimulus of the high levels of aldosterone present during infancy. The increase in the secretion of potassium that would occur in the adult under these circumstances is mitigated by the low expression of potassium channels. In the case of phosphate, there is enhanced reabsorption, particularly at the level of the proximal tubule, due in part to a growth-specific NaPi type II transporter. These different adaptive mechanisms converge towards the maintenance of a positive external balance for substances that are essential to growth. The emergence of cellular and molecular biology has also encouraged research in the field of renal morphology. The genes that control mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and the signaling factors that mediate their effect have been described. Progress is being made in the identification of genes involved in certain forms of renal malformations. Novel methods of investigation, such as DNA arrays, are likely to lead to an even fuller, dynamic portrayal of gene expression during nephrogenesis. Characterizing the functional correlates of these genes will require investigators who are not only proficient in molecular biology, but who are also masters of physiological methods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12579409/"}

Skill scores and procedure times were recorded for both groups, and participants completed surveys to evaluate content, face, and construct validation of the models. Group S completed the procedures faster and achieved higher skill scores than Group T in both models. Group T, however, performed better with VRRS compared to 3D-AUSM. The most challenging steps for both groups were \"exposing the intrarenal collecting system\" and \"relocating the stone\".

We evaluated our experience with this procedure. Special attention was paid to the effect of the experience of the surgeon on operative outcome. The patient files of 201 patients were evaluated retrospectively for operation outcome parameters. Statistical analysis was performed where appropriate. The different parameters were also analyzed separately for patients operated on by the head of the department and those operated on by residents. We found significant differences in pre- and postoperative median residual urine volume (85 vs 0.0 ml; p < 0.001) and pre- and postoperative median urinary flow (6.0 vs 20.8 ml/s; p < 0.001). There was a moderate correlation between preoperative determination of the prostate volume by means of transrectal ultrasound and postoperative histological weight. Patients operated on by the head of the department had a significantly shorter operation time. Postoperative complications were rarely seen in either group. The rates of postoperative complications were as follows: permanent incontinence, 0.5%; endoscopic revision (bleeding), 3%; open revision, 1%; urinary tract infection, 13%; and secondary wound healing, 5.5%. We feel that open prostatectomy remains an excellent technique for large prostate adenomas and should always be offered in such cases as a true alternative to endoscopic techniques. Having a well-trained urologist perform the procedure is the best guarantee of minimal blood loss and minimal complication rates. Therefore, open prostatectomy should be part of the education program of all prostate centers and urological departments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15841780/"}

To this end, an experimental study was performed which compared a ureteral double-J wire stent versus a standard 7F ureteral stent after endopyelotomy. Twenty healthy female pigs were randomly divided into 2 groups: group I (double pigtail ureteral stent 7F) and group II (lumenless ureteral double-J wire stent, Zebrastent™, 0.035 inches in diameter). Percutaneous, endoluminal ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic studies were analyzed during the 3 different phases of the study. The first phase included premodel documentation of normal urinary tracts and laparoscopic ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction induction. During the second phase, 6 weeks later, diagnosis and endopyelotomy were carried out. Sixteen weeks after the obstruction treatment, follow-up imaging studies and postmortem evaluations of all animals were performed. After the sonographic and fluoroscopic assessments, we determined the success rate for each group: 80% for group I and 90% for group II. No significant statistical differences were evident in the evolution of the diameter of the UPJ between groups. Better healing of the UPJ and a lower level of retroperitoneal repercussions were seen in group II. The ureteral double-J wire stent (Zebrastent) has been shown to be highly effective after endopyelotomy. This means that it is possible to reduce the size of ureteral stents after endopyelotomy with the advantages that this entails. Double-J ureteral stents probably act as a scaffold rather than a mold.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20389053/"}

A total of 45 (54%) pediatric nephrologists and 38 (56%) pediatric urologists responded. The threshold for the diagnosis of abnormal fetal renal pelvis dilatation was significantly higher among pediatric urologists than nephrologists. All responders perform renal ultrasound examinations after birth. Postnatal renal pelvis dilatation was considered abnormal if the anteroposterior diameter was >/=11+/-1.9 mm by the pediatric urologists and >/=9+/-2.9 mm by the pediatric nephrologists ( P=0.003). Pediatric urologists were more likely than nephrologists to recommend routine voiding cystourethrography [41% versus 20% ( P=0.04)]. Mercaptoacetyl-triglycine renography was the most routinely used tool to achieve functional evaluation during follow-up among the responders. Pediatric urologists were more likely to recommend surgical treatment in dilated kidneys with initial function <40%. In conclusion, pediatric urologists had significantly higher thresholds for the detection of prenatal and neonatal renal pelvis dilatation. They also more frequently recommended routine voiding cystourethrography and surgical therapy of dilated kidneys with low function than pediatric nephrologists. The variability in attitudes is most probably due to the absence of clear guidelines based on prospective and controlled trials.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15241673/"}

Thirty-eight kidneys from large white pigs were used for the study. We describe the process of preparation of the kidney and polyester resin for injection into the PC systems. The setting process of the resin is an exothermic reaction with an associated change in consistency. The PC systems of the kidneys were injected with resin in a controlled manner and casts obtained by maceration of the kidneys. Some of these kidneys had been distended previously with 11% glycerol and three-dimensional ultrasound reconstructions of their PC systems were compared to resin casts to assess accuracy of the reconstructions. Thirty-eight casts were created out of which 13 were poor. The quality of the casts improved with practice and pelvi-calyceal morphology could be faithfully recreated. Controlled perfusion and watching for signs such as a \"turgid feel\" of the kidney help avoid pelvi-calyceal disruption. Anatomically accurate casts of the kidney PC system can be created using polyester resin with the technique described.

Formal systems of clinical supervision have not been implemented in the Republic of Ireland. There is a growing awareness of their effectiveness in enhancing analytic skills and in helping to retain staff in clinical practice. Clinical supervision was incorporated in the MSc/Graduate Diploma Programme to enhance professional growth and development for students. A qualitative descriptive research design was used in this study. A purposive sample of 10 Registered Nurses participated in the study; five were clinical supervisors and the other five were supervisees. The study was undertaken at a large teaching hospital in the Republic of Ireland. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews and analysed using content analysis. Following data analysis, six major categories emerged. These were, 'positive aspects''negative aspects', 'factors, which had an impact on the process of clinical supervision', 'support', 'formal systems of clinical supervision', 'reflective practice in groups'. There was a general feeling that clinical supervision was a good experience for many members of this study group. The concept of clinical supervision was perceived as an inappropriate term to encompass the complexity of the clinical supervision sessions. This begs the question: is clinical supervision a practice with no name or should it be called something else? Giving a practice an appropriate name may empower registered nurses to implement this practice with confidence.

Using three urine-meters (the Braun Ureofix 511, the Kendall Curity 4000 and the Unoplast Unometer 500) the in vitro model was constantly flushed with a solution of Mueller-Hinton broth diluted with saline. On the first day, the urine collecting bag was inoculated with 10(8) cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The system was operated for 12 days with daily sampling of the model bladder to detect any contamination. After 12 days the experiment was stopped and sampling performed at various locations, including the urine-meter and the tubing. Nine of each type of urine-meter were tested, i.e. three in three different experiments. In the clinical study, 45 patients were randomized to each of the three urine-meters and the nurses attending them were asked to complete a questionnaire on the practical handling of the urine-meters. When the urine-meters was omitted from the model system, the 'bladder' became contaminated with the test bacteria within 3 days. None of the nine Unometer 500 systems became contaminated, compared with four of each of the other two systems (P < 0.05). In clinical use, the Unometer 500 and Ureofix 511 were easier to suspend and empty than was the Curity 4000. The Unometer 500 was significantly easier to handle when the collecting bag was emptied. Urine-meters can prevent retrograde contamination in a closed bladder-drainage model, but the degree of prevention depends upon the type of urine-meter.

Since then, various sectors have been developed including: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation, urological and genital surgery, antenatal screening and rapid management of uronephropathies, treatment of voiding dysfunction and neurogenic bladder, management of tubular and glomerular diseases. The progress in genetics, medical imaging, obstetrics, neonatology and surgery has allowed us to take care of our young patients within a multidisciplinary framework. The most original contributions of the department are related to the performance of combined liver-kidney transplantation in primary hyperoxaluria, to the determination of the natural history of several congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, to the assessment of the role of genetic mutations on tubular and glomerular diseases, to the usefulness of radioisotopic tracers in the measurement of renal function in infants, and to the study of experimental tolerance of allografts. The transition of young renal patients from pediatric to adult care is actually well organized due to our 30 years experience and the excellent collaboration with the adult nephrologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18497217/"}

He showed that the nephrons were heterogeneous in their structure and could be divided in 2 categories: the short-looped and the long-looped ones. Peter's scheme of the human nephrons was published in many journals and textbooks. Another contribution was the demonstration of a relationship between the relative occurrence of long thin loops (versus short loops) and the maximal urinary concentration capacity. Peter was also the first to describe the cells of the macula densa, which are of fundamental importance in the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. Furthermore, Peter gave a detailed description of the principal zones of the human kidney: the cortex, the outer medulla with outer and inner stripes, and the inner medulla.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21614779/"}

The survey was carried out by questionnaire and included questions about the activity and equipment of each nephrology unit, dedicated personnel and relevant training, and the fields of ultrasonography application. Seventy-five percent of the contacted care units replied to the questionnaire. Twenty-six percent of these performed their ultrasound examinations outside the care unit, sharing equipment with other units. The mean lifetime of ultrasound devices was longer (5.8 years) than allowed by the electro-medical equipment regulations. In spite of an increasing number of nephrologists with ultrasonographic expertise, in each care unit the percentage of physicians performing ultrasound examinations was very low. The number of operators who learned this methodology directly at surgeries using ultrasound devices was higher than that of operators who attended training courses and obtained the relevant certificates. In addition to the kidneys and urinary tract, other body districts investigated included abdominal organs, parathyroids, vascular access for hemodialysis treatment, and the bone-joint system. Moreover, ultrasonography was widely used for surgical procedures in nephrology. However, in spite of the widespread application of ultrasound imaging, the use of radiology was unexpectedly high (80%). Finally, the questionnaire results evidenced the particular care of nephrologists towards follow-up for situations of nephrological interest, such as acquired renal cysts, vascular access visualization, and monitoring of parathyroids.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19644841/"}

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it is now possible to understand which areas of the brain contribute to the proper function of the storage and voiding of the lower urinary tract. This field of research has evolved from simple anatomical descriptions to elucidating the complex micturition network. A keyword search of the Medline database was conducted by two reviewers for relevant studies from January 1, 2010, to August 2022. Of 2047 peer-reviewed articles, 49 are included in this review. In the last decade, a detailed understanding of the brain-bladder network has been described, elucidating a dedicated network, as well as activated areas in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex that share reproducible connectivity patterns. Research has shown that various urological diseases can lead to specific changes in this network and that therapies used by urologists to treat lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are also able to modify neuronal activity. This represents a set of potential new therapeutic targets for the management of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). fMRI technology has made it possible to identify subgroups of responders to various treatments (biofeedback, anticholinergic, neuromodulation) and predict favourable outcomes. Lastly, this breakthrough understanding of neural control over bladder function has led to treatments that directly target brain regions of interest to improve LUTS. One such example is the use of non-invasive transcranial neuromodulation to improve voiding symptoms in individuals with multiple sclerosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37062631/"}

To preserve detrusor function in the early stage of urinary system impairment, such as BOO, we establish a novel method for cystometry and Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) assessments in rodents without cystostomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty mice and rats were divided into three groups (control, sham-operated and BOO group) respectively. The cystometry and IAP assessments were measured by the pediatric venous indwelling sheath and coronary dilatation catheter connected to Laborie urodynamic system on postoperative day 7. Data was collected simultaneously through urethra and rectum in each group. In addition, bladder histology was assessed to confirm BOO. RESULTS The novel method can collect the urodynamic parameters successfully, including the BLPP, IAP, MBC, etc. IAP was elevated in BOO rats, but no significantly difference was found between the sham-operated rats and the control rats. The hypertrophy of detrusor muscle in bladder section was observed by Masson trichrome staining in BOO group compared with other groups. CONCLUSIONS Our novel method based on innovative research implement for cystometry and IAP assessments in rodents is a reliable and replicable approach for evaluating the lower urinary tract function. Especially it provides detailed information to evaluate lower urinary tract structures and function in the early stage of BOO.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28538709/"}

The observed changes in peristaltic pattern during high diuresis, obstruction and urinary reflux have influenced management of stone disease and neurogenic bladder. The demonstration that high intravesical pressure is reflected to the kidney not only when the ureteric orifice is incompetent, but also during high diuresis, established the necessity for low pressures in neobladders.

The correlation coefficients and simple regression equations were computed for AG versus DAMPF and AG versus URA. Using the provisional International Continence Society method for definition of obstruction to categorize the AG values as obstructed, equivocal, or unobstructed, we obtained the corresponding DAMPF and URA values for our study population. The Pearson correlation coefficient, r, for AG versus DAMPF and AG versus URA was 0.941 and 0.889, respectively. The corresponding regression equations obtained were AG = - 32.6 + (DAMPF)1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 to 1.32) and AG = - 16.4 + (URA) 1.67 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.77). The 5th to 95th percentiles of the DAMPF and URA for men who were obstructed (AG number more than 40) were 56 to 92 and 28 to 71, those for men who were equivocal (AG 20 to 40) were 35 to 62 and 17 to 38, and those for men who were unobstructed (AG less than 20) were 12 to 44 and 5 to 24, respectively.

Together with ureters and urethra, it forms the lower urinary tract that facilitates urine collection, low-pressure storage, and volitional voiding. However, pathological disorders are often liable to cause irreversible damage and compromise the normal functionality of the bladder, necessitating surgical intervention for a reconstructive procedure. Non-urinary autologous grafts, primarily derived from gastrointestinal tract, have long been the gold standard in clinics to augment or to replace the diseased bladder tissue. Unfortunately, such treatment strategy is commonly associated with several clinical complications. In absence of an optimal autologous therapy, a biomaterial based bioengineered platform is an attractive prospect revolutionizing the modern urology. Predictably, extensive investigative research has been carried out in pursuit of better urological biomaterials, that overcome the limitations of conventional gastrointestinal graft. Against the above backdrop, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and one-stop update on different biomaterial-based strategies that have been proposed and explored over the past 60 years to restore the dynamic function of the otherwise dysfunctional bladder tissue. Broadly, two unique perspectives of bladder tissue engineering and total alloplastic bladder replacement are critically discussed in terms of their status and progress. While the former is pivoted on scaffold mediated regenerative medicine; in contrast, the latter is directed towards the development of a biostable bladder prosthesis. Together, these routes share a common aspiration of designing and creating a functional equivalent of the bladder wall, albeit, using fundamentally different aspects of biocompatibility and clinical needs. Therefore, an attempt has been made to systematically analyze and summarize the evolution of various classes as well as generations of polymeric biomaterials in urology. Considerable emphasis has been laid on explaining the bioengineering methodologies, pre-clinical and clinical outcomes. Some of the unaddressed challenges, including vascularization, innervation, hollow 3D prototype fabrication and urinary encrustation, have been highlighted that currently delay the successful commercial translation. More importantly, the rapidly evolving and expanding concepts of bioelectronic medicine are discussed to inspire future research efforts towards the further advancement of the field. At the closure, crucial insights are provided to forge the biomaterial assisted reconstruction as a long-term therapeutic strategy in urological practice for patients' care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35016066/"}

Clinical studies have shown a close correlation between bladder ischemia and lower urinary tract symptoms in elderly patients. Confluent cultured human bladder smooth muscle cells were incubated under normoxia, continuous hypoxia, and oxidative stress (hypoxia/reoxygenation) conditions using a computerized oxycycler system. After 48 hours, cell samples were collected and processed for fluorometric assessment of oxidative injury, enzyme immunoassay of antioxidant capacity, and transmission electron microscopy. Lipid peroxidation was found in cell hypoxia and oxidative stress, whereas protein oxidation was evident in oxidative stress only. Cell antioxidant capacity decreased in oxidative stress but remained unchanged in hypoxia. Oxidative products were present in cell oxidative stress only, whereas nitrosative products increased in both hypoxia and oxidative stress conditions. Forty-eight hours of hypoxia and oxidative stress had no effect on cell senescence. Thickened deformed cell membrane, swollen mitochondria, and enlarged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were found in cell hypoxia. Partially lost cell membrane with increased caveolae, swollen mitochondria with degraded cristae, splintered ER, and increased lysosomes were evident in cell oxidative stress. Human bladder smooth muscle cells are highly reactive to nonconforming oxygen tension. Reactions to hypoxia are consistent with cell survival signaling to cope with lack of oxygen. Changes in oxidative stress indicate extensive damage and deterioration of the subcellular elements. Hypoxic and oxidative damage may be an important mechanism of smooth muscle degeneration in bladder conditions with disturbed oxygen tension.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21872910/"}

Sophisticated methods are now available for transcriptome analysis. They are based on serial, partial sequencing of cDNAs (sequencing of expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)), or on parallel hybridization of labeled cDNAs to specific probes immobilized on a grid (macro- and microarrays and DNA chips). Some methods were designed specifically to compare gene expression under different conditions (substractive hybridization, glass microarrays). However, all these methods require several microg of mRNA as starting material, making impossible, in most tissues, to analyse gene expression in homogeneous cell populations. To get around this limitation, we developed a scaled-down SAGE method (SAGE adaptation to downsized extracts: SADE) in our laboratory. SAGE is based on the following: a) each cDNA is characterized by a 10-bp informative sequence called tag, b) the information from several transcripts is condensed into a single DNA molecule by concatenation of several tags, c) sequencing of individual clones from the library of concatemers, computer analysis of sequences and interrogation of sequence databases allow quantitative gene expression profiling. Applied to microdissected mouse nephron segments, SADE made it possible to determine segment-specific transcriptomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12027216/"}

White's interest in the function of the kidney was evident early in his academic career when he pioneered research related to renal physiology. His first papers dealt with studies of renal tubular function (1923). He performed what appear to represent the first micropuncture studies in the kidney of Necturus maculosus (1926) and thus confirmed the observations of Wearn and Richards regarding glomerular filtration. Through these studies, he was the first to show that glucose reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubules of Necturus. It also appears that White et al. were the first to demonstrate that volume expansion increases bicarbonate excretion in dogs (1926). He studied the influence of posture on renal \"activity\" in man (1926). Intracapsular pressure determinations in Necturus kidney (1928) were done using micropuncture techniques. White and co-workers presented (1933) a comparison of clearances of creatinine and various sugars confirming the work of Jolliffe, Shannon and Smith (1932) who had proposed the clearances of non-metabolizable sugars to be a measure of glomerular filtration. Between 1932 and 1936, in an effort to better understand the process of glomerular filtration, he began a series of studies on streaming potentials, surface conductance, electro-endosmosis and other related topics. In 1937, White began work on yet another aspect of renal physiology--endocrine influences on renal function. He would immerse himself in these investigations throughout the remainder of his scientific career.

Several criteria have been proposed to define fBOO, but the comparative diagnostic accuracy of these remains uncertain. To identify and compare different tests to diagnose fBOO through a systematic review process. A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. The EMBASE/MEDLINE/Cochrane databases were searched up to August 4, 2020. Studies on women ≥18 yr of age with suspected bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) involving diagnostic tests were included. Pressure-flow studies or fluoroscopy was used as the reference standard where possible. Two reviewers independently screened all articles, searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and performed data extraction. The risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Overall, 28 nonrandomised studies involving 10 248 patients were included in the qualitative analysis. There was significant heterogeneity regarding the characteristics of women included in BOO cohorts (ie, mixed cohorts including both anatomical and functional BOO). Pressure-flow studies ± fluoroscopy was evaluated in 25 studies. Transperineal Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate bladder neck dynamics in two studies. One study tested the efficacy of transvaginal ultrasound. The urodynamic definition of fBOO also varied amongst studies with different parameters and thresholds used, which precluded a meta-analysis. Three studies derived nomograms using the maximum flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub>) and voiding detrusor pressure at Q<sub>max</sub>. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy ranges were 54.6-92.5%, 64.6-93.9%, and 64.1-92.2%, respectively. The available evidence on diagnostic tests for fBOO is limited and heterogeneous. Pressure-flow studies ± fluoroscopy remains the current standard for diagnosing fBOO. Evidence on tests used to diagnose female bladder outlet obstruction was reviewed. The most common test used was pressure-flow studies ± fluoroscopy, which remains the current standard for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in women.

A single pressure transducer is used since the lines of the probe are separately and successively connected to the transducer through a 6-channel manifold, as one proceeds to the next diameter. Pressure diameter curves are obtained and reported on a graph. The data are analyzed by fitting the graphs with a one exponential equation P = PoeaD; 2 parameters are computed: Po, the initial pressure when the urethra is catheter free, and a, the rate of exponential increase in pressure as higher diameters are introduced to measure urethral wall stiffness.

His contributions were many: he played a major role in introducing and popularizing renal clearance methods, introduced non-invasive methods for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate, of renal blood flow and tubular transport capacity, and provided novel insights into the mechanisms of excretion of water and electrolytes. Homer Smith's contributions went far beyond his personal investigations. He was a superb writer of several inspiring textbooks of renal physiology that exerted great and lasting influence on the development of renal physiology. Smith's intellectual insights and ability for critical analysis of data allowed him to create broad concepts that defined the functional properties of glomeruli, tubules and the renal circulation. A distinguishing feature of Homer Smith's career was his close contact and collaboration, over many years, with several clinicians of his alma mater, New York University. For initiating these pathophysiological investigations, he is justly credited to have advanced, in a major way, our understanding of altered renal function in disease. Smith's lasting scientific impact is also reflected by a whole school of investigators that trained with him and who applied his methods, analyses and concepts to the study of renal function all over the world. So great was his influence and preeminence that Robert Pitts, in his excellent tribute to Homer Smith in the Memoirs of the National Academy of Science states that his death brought an end to what might be aptly called the Smithian Era of renal physiology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15151273/"}

To provide a summary of the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on Pediatric Urology, which were first published in 2015 in European Urology. A structured literature review was performed of new publications between 2015 and 2020 for UTIs in children. The guideline was updated accordingly with relevant new literature. The occurrence of a UTI can be the first indication of anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract, especially in patients with a febrile UTI. The basic diagnostic evaluation should include sufficient investigations to exclude urinary tract abnormalities, but should also be as minimally invasive as possible. In recent years, more risk factors have been identified to predict the presence of these anatomical anomalies, such as a non-E. Coli infection, high grade fever and ultrasound abnormalities. When these risk factors are factored into the diagnostic work-up, some invasive investigations can be omitted in a larger group of children. In addition to the treatment of active UTIs, it is also essential to prevent recurrent UTIs and consequent renal scarring. With the increase of antimicrobial resistance good antibiotic stewardship is needed. In addition, alternative preventative measures such as dietary supplements, bladder and bowel management and antibiotic prophylaxis could decrease the incidence of recurrent UTI. This paper is a summary of the updated 2021 EAU guidelines on Pediatric Urology.

Rather than employing an H(+)-exchange mechanism, intercalated cells have V-ATPase on the plasma membrane and in plasmalemma-associated tubulovesicles, which functions in the bicarbonate reabsorption, regeneration, and bicarbonate secretion required for acid-base homeostasis. Several distinct mechanisms participate in regulating V-ATPase-driven H+ secretion in different cell types: (1) Renal epithelial cells have the capacity to express different structural forms of V-ATPase that have intrinsic differences in their enzymatic properties. 2) The kidney produces cytosolic regulatory proteins, capable of interacting directly with the V-ATPase, that may modify its activity. V-ATPases in different cell types may differ in the degree to which their activity is affected by regulatory factors, as a result of variations in V-ATPase structure. (3) In the alpha intercalated cell, the number of active V-ATPases on the luminal membrane is controlled in vivo by membrane vesicle-mediated traffic that may require unidentified mediators. In the beta intercalated cell, the number of active V-ATPases on the basolateral membrane may be controlled by regulated assembly and disassembly, responding directly to extracellular pH.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8743472/"}

In this study, we validated a newly developed external catheter to measure non-invasively this pressure, which avoids the risk of damaging or infecting the urethral and bladder wall as occurs with invasive urodynamics. To evaluate the external catheter, we simultaneously recorded the internal bladder pressure signal (measured invasively) and the external pressure signal (measured non-invasively) in 40 non-obstructed and obstructed patients. Additionally, we tested whether the external pressure depended on bladder volume in five healthy volunteers. The simultaneously measured internal bladder pressure and external pressure showed good agreement in the non-obstructed patients. There was less agreement in the obstructed group. Nevertheless, the external pressure in these patients was significantly higher than in the non-obstructed patients. The maximum external pressure depended significantly on the bladder volume in all volunteers. We concluded that isovolumetric bladder pressure can be measured non-invasively with the external catheter. In non-obstructed patients, this pressure accurately represents the internal bladder pressure. We think that it is possible to distinguish between obstructed patients and patients with a weak detrusor by combining the non-invasively measured isovolumetric bladder pressure with a separately measured maximum flow rate.

Thus, dysfunction is common with impairment of either the central or peripheral nervous system. This monograph presents an overview of the neural control of the bladder as it is currently understood. A description of pertinent peripheral anatomy and neuroanatomy is provided, followed by an explanation of common neurophysiological tests of the lower urinary tract and associated structures, including both urodynamic and electrodiagnostic approaches. Clinical applications are included to illustrate the impact of nervous system dysfunction on the bladder and to provide indications for testing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18563721/"}

This tendency for radiology referral by nephrologists has two main drawbacks: 1) No follow-up care from the physician performing the procedure and 2) Loss of required procedure training for nephrology fellows. This study assesses for differences in glomerular yield and immediate procedure-related complications between radiology-performed (RP) and nephrology-performed (NP) percutaneous native kidney biopsies at our institution for an 11-month period. All biopsies were done with real time ultrasound guidance. Further analysis was done to look for any correlation between the number of needle insertions (\"passes\"), needle size and procedure-related complications (graded on a score from 0-4). A total of 37 native kidney biopsies were performed during the study period. Fourteen biopsies (38%) were performed by radiology while a nephrology fellow performed 23 biopsies (62%). The mean glomerular count for RP biopsies was 15+/-10 and for NP 16+/-11 (p=ns). The number of passes ranged from 1-5 in the RP group with a total of 33 passes in 14 patients (mean 2.36 passes/patient). Passes ranged from 1-6 in the NP group with 57 passes in 23 patients (mean 2.48 passes/patient). Mean complication scores were similar in both groups. However, severe complications (score 4) were significantly lower in nephrology fellow performed biopsies (p = 0.001). Despite similar pre-biopsy risk assessment and treatment protocols with real-time ultrasound guidance of all biopsies, these results show no statistically significant differences in glomerular yield or overall complication scores but did demonstrate a significantly higher rate of severe complications (score 4) in the RP performed biopsies.

In order to help during this design process, many computational models have been developed to simulate the behaviour of different biological tissues and provide a realistic computational environment to evaluate the stents. However, due to the high complexity of the involved tissues, they usually introduce simplifications to make these models less computationally demanding. In this study, the interaction between urine flow and a double-J stented ureter with a simplified geometry has been analysed. The Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) of urine and the ureteral wall was studied using three models for the solid domain: Mooney-Rivlin, Yeoh, and Ogden. The ureter was assumed to be quasi-incompressible and isotropic. Data obtained in previous studies from ex vivo and in vivo mechanical characterization of different ureters were used to fit the mentioned models. The results show that the interaction between the stented ureter and urine is negligible. Therefore, we can conclude that this type of models does not need to include the FSI and could be solved quite accurately assuming that the ureter is a rigid body and, thus, using the more simple Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27127535/"}

However, with the increasing focus on healthcare costs and quality, judicious use of diagnostic imaging to optimize outcomes while minimizing resource utilization is a priority. We sought to identify post-ureteroscopy imaging practices among experienced urologists. A REDcap questionnaire was sent to urologists in North America. The questionnaire surveyed demographic data, clinical volume, and imaging preferences post-ureteroscopy. Additionally, we surveyed the extent to which stone, anatomic, and procedure-related factors influenced these preferences. The likelihood of altering clinical practice and the desire for specific imaging guidelines were also assessed. The interquartile range (IQR) was utilized as a measure of median consensus. Three hundred twenty-two urologists completed the questionnaire. The mean number of years in practice was 18 ± 10; 82% of respondents performed more than five ureteroscopic stone procedures monthly. Routine postoperative imaging was obtained by 48% of participants as follows: ultrasound (US) (47%), kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) (17%), CT (4%), intravenous pyelogram (IVP) (2%), and KUB+US (30%). Urologists who did not routinely image patients were more concerned about cost (55% vs 25%, p ≤ 0.0001), radiation exposure (69% vs 44%, p ≤ 0.0001), and diagnostic inaccuracy of US (57% vs 44%, p ≤ 0.02). These urologists were also less likely to have completed an endourology fellowship (7% vs 23%, p ≤ 0.0001). The most compelling predictors of obtaining postoperative imaging were postoperative pain and fever (median 5, IQR 1), residual stones (median 5, IQR 1), ureteral perforation (median 5, IQR 2), and presence of a solitary kidney (median 4.5, IQR 2). Currently, about 50% of urologists who regularly perform ureteroscopic stone procedures obtain postoperative imaging. Imaging preferences were guided by the presence of residual fragments, ureteral perforation, solitary kidney, and postoperative pain or fever.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25963170/"}

In 1882, he published novel observations on the mechanism of renal hypertrophy, which he understood to be due to renal cell proliferation. Two years later, he described tubular cell mitoses in the kidney of a patient with tubulointerstitial nephritis, which he interpreted as an essential part of the repair process. His most important findings, published in 1889, were obtained by studying the microscopic anatomy of the kidney with an original technique that allowed the isolation of whole intact nephrons. He discovered that the ascending limb of Henle's loop always returned to the glomerulus from which the tubule originated, and he realized that the early distal tubule passed between the glomerular arterioles. In addition, applying the same method to dissect nephrons in progressive phases of development, he identified exactly what tubular segments originated from the various parts of the metanephric early S-shaped structure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10213832/"}

Therefore, we conducted a standardization study for evaluating renal biopsies from patients with systemic vasculitis. Four experienced renal pathologists from four European centres joined in the study. A scoring protocol was devised that required the observers to score an extensive number of histopathological lesions either quantitatively (as a percentage of the total number of glomeruli) or dichotomously (on a present/absent scale). Twenty renal biopsies were scored individually by all the observers, from which the inter-observer variability was analysed. Ten randomly chosen biopsies were scored again, in order to obtain the intra-observer variability. For inter-observer agreement, the evaluation of the quantitative variables was satisfactory for both rounds (0.55 < or = Kendall's W < or = 0.95 and 0.59 < or = W < or = 0.96, respectively, with all P < 0.05). However, the inter-observer agreement for the dichotomous data was poor (kappa < or = 0.30 in more than half of the parameters in both rounds). Also the data on intra-observer agreement showed more favourable results for the analysis of the quantitative data (Pearson's r > 0.45 in more than 85% of the variables in both rounds) than for the dichotomous scoring system (kappa < or = 0.30 in more than half of the variables). It is concluded that even between experienced renal pathologists discrepancies occur in scoring kidney biopsies. Inter- and intra-observer agreement is greater if a quantitative method for reviewing the biopsies is applied that requires the observers to score the tissue specimens systematically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8918712/"}

The characteristic phraseology of the scriptures uses the kidneys as symbols of the human emotions, contrary to the heart, which is regarded as the location of wisdom. The kidney is considered to be the individual's seat of their deepest desires--perhaps because it is an \"internal\" organ, well hidden, surrounded by a capsule and by a layer of perinephric fat. The Talmudic corpus considers the kidneys to be the origin of secret counsels--\"the kidneys advise\". An injury to the kidneys is used symbolically as an example of a cruel and serious injury. The sages were concerned with nephrological problems such as a diseased kidney of small size, fluid and pus in the kidney, injuries, perforations and more. Fascinating advice is given regarding micturition, its timing, characteristics and significance. The Halakhah is concerned with the kidneys during the examination of an animal after slaughter for the fitness for its ritual consumption.

These powerful methods, which enable label-free and multiplexed detection of many molecular classes across omics domains (including metabolites, drugs, proteins and protein post-translational modifications), are beginning to reveal new molecular insights related to kidney health and disease. The complexity of the kidney often necessitates multiple scales of analysis for interrogating biofluids, whole organs, functional tissue units, single cells and subcellular compartments. Various MS methods can generate omics data across these spatial domains and facilitate both basic science and pathological assessment of the kidney. Optimal processes related to sample preparation and handling for different MS applications are rapidly evolving. Emerging technology and methods, improvement of spatial resolution, broader molecular characterization, multimodal and multiomics approaches and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches promise to make these applications even more valuable in the field of nephology. Overall, spatially resolved MS and MS imaging methods have the potential to fill much of the omics gap in systems biology analysis of the kidney and provide functional outputs that cannot be obtained using genomics and transcriptomic methods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40148534/"}

The Association of Vascular Access and intervenTionAl Renal Physicians (AVATAR) Foundation from India conducted a multinational online survey among interventional nephrologists from the APR to investigate who does KB, if the nephrology training curriculum includes KB, and whether nephrologists have access to ultrasound. Out of 21 countries from the APR that participated in our survey, 10 countries (47.4%) reported that more than 70% of their nephrologists performed KB, whereas in 11 countries (57.6%), KB was most likely done by an IR. The frequency of nephrologists performing KB ranged from 0% in Afghanistan to 100% in countries such as Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand. Formal training for KB and access to ultrasound was available to nephrologists in 80% of the responding countries. Our study shows that despite the availability of training and access to USG, a significant number of nephrologists are not performing KB in the APR. Similar to the trends observed in Western countries, the observed pattern in the APR could be due to lack of time, less incentive, hospital policy, or interest of nephrologists in other aspects of intervention nephrology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38156781/"}

In this consensus statement, the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology summarizes the current knowledge on CSK and presents recommendations for its management, including diagnostic approach, nutritional and lifestyle habits, and follow-up. We recommend that any antenatal suspicion/diagnosis of CSK be confirmed by neonatal ultrasound (US), avoiding the routine use of further imaging if no other anomalies of kidney/urinary tract are detected. A CSK without additional abnormalities is expected to undergo compensatory enlargement, which should be assessed by US. We recommend that urinalysis, but not blood tests or genetic analysis, be routinely performed at diagnosis in infants and children showing compensatory enlargement of the CSK. Extrarenal malformations should be searched for, particularly genital tract malformations in females. An excessive protein and salt intake should be avoided, while sport participation should not be restricted. We recommend a lifelong follow-up, which should be tailored on risk stratification, as follows: low risk: CSK with compensatory enlargement, medium risk: CSK without compensatory enlargement and/or additional CAKUT, and high risk: decreased GFR and/or proteinuria, and/or hypertension. We recommend that in children at low-risk periodic US, urinalysis and BP measurement be performed; in those at medium risk, we recommend that serum creatinine also be measured; in high-risk children, the schedule has to be tailored according to kidney function and clinical data.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35713730/"}

The objective of this manuscript is to \"read\" with a nephrologist's point of view the main frameworks of diseases of phosphate/calcium metabolism, to illustrate the three crucial messages of nephro-protection sent to endocrinologists. First, calciuria must be interpreted both in absolute value (concentration hypercalciuria) and in ratio (flow hypercalciuria). Second, renal monitoring of therapies inducing hypercalciuria on kidneys with normal renal function (e.g. active vitamin D analogs or teriparatide) should be systematic.

Genetic findings are increasingly used to inform the clinical management of many nephropathies, enabling targeted disease surveillance, choice of therapy, and family counselling. Genetic analysis has excellent diagnostic utility in paediatric nephrology, as illustrated by sequencing studies of patients with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Although additional investigation is needed, pilot studies suggest that genetic testing can also provide similar diagnostic insight among adult patients. Reaching a genetic diagnosis first involves choosing the appropriate testing modality, as guided by the clinical presentation of the patient and the number of potential genes associated with the suspected nephropathy. Genome-wide sequencing increases diagnostic sensitivity relative to targeted panels, but holds the challenges of identifying causal variants in the vast amount of data generated and interpreting secondary findings. In order to realize the promise of genomic medicine for kidney disease, many technical, logistical, and ethical questions that accompany the implementation of genetic testing in nephrology must be addressed.

Material consists of 7 cm of a 30F garden hose, a suprapubic tube, a Tupperware box (Frankfurt, Germany), three catheter plugs, and silicone gel. Cost of materials is below $40 U.S. Transurethral procedures such as mono- and bipolar resection and RevoLix laser vaporesection were carried out. Different meat types were tested to develop a close to real resection feeling. Further, flexible cystoscopy was trained with the simulator. Multiple markings were placed inside the box. These markings had to be identified by flexible cystoscopy. The time to completion of this task was recorded. Transurethral resection and flexible cystoscopy is feasible. Pork and beef lead to a realistic feeling compared with transurethral resection. For laser surgery, pork and chicken seem to be most realistic. Further, confidence in flexible cystoscopy could be obtained. During the flexible cystoscopy task, an average time reduction of 50.96% could be achieved. This cheap and simple resection simulator allows easy training of lower urinary tract procedures. It helps young urologists to acquire basic endourologic skills.

For the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC), fosfomycin-trometamol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline, pivmecillinam, and trimethoprim (depending on the local rate of resistance) are all equally recommended. Cotrimoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins are not recommended as antibiotics of first choice, for concern of an unfavorable impact on the microbiome. Mild to moderate uncomplicated pyelonephritis should be treated with oral cefpodoxime, ceftibuten, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin. For AUC with mild to moderate symptoms, instead of antibiotics symptomatic treatment alone may be considered depending on patient preference after discussing adverse events and outcomes. Primarily non-antibiotic options are recommended for prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection. In accordance with the global antibiotic stewardship initiative and considering new insights in scientific research, we updated our German clinical UTI guideline to promote a responsible antibiotic use and to give clear hands-on recommendations for the diagnosis and management of UTIs in adults in Germany for healthcare providers and patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29539622/"}

In 1871, the osmotic pressure, not so well understood by scientists, was again suggested by de Vries who described the \"plasmolysis\", a phenomenon corresponding to cell retraction when incubated in high molecular concentration solutions. Although the results were not well interpretated, this phenomenon was related to the osmotic pressure. Van't Hoff studied the mechanisms phenomena and compared it to the gas volume/pressure relationship. Dreser measured in urine the cryoscopic delta that had just discovered by Raoult in animal and man, after a water load (-0.20 degree C) or a water restriction (-2.50 degrees C) and calculated approximately the amount of energy required to eliminate water at various different concentrations of solutes. Koranyi used the same methods in disease states. The loss of difference between the maximal and minimal delta indicates a functional renal insufficiency. This was the term first proposed by Koranyi outlining the role of the kidney in the regulation of the milieu interieur and more specifically in the regulation of water and solute concentration. Hyposthenuria, best named isosthenuria, in the range of osmotic pressure usually indicates terminal renal failure. Koranyi named this test funktionelle Nierendiagnostik, a start for the physiological investigations of renal functions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10418008/"}

In 1936, after the military coup and during the subsequent Spanish civil war, he was in charge of the Surgery Service at the Hospital de la Santa Creu y Sant Pau and begins to performe a closed method to treat open fractures of the limbs, dramatically lowering the number of gangrenes and amputations between troops and civilians. At the end of the war came the exile, and he was invited by the british Health Service, he teach in Oxford and applies his knowledge on war surgery, was named PhD (Hon) and professor of ortopedics, and creates an school of clinical investigation that generates important findings in bone growing and pathology and, amont other areas, in the knowledge of renal function and kidney injuries induced by shock and blood hypertension. One of the most outstanding fruits of this investigation is the book \"Studies on renal circulation\", first published in English in 1947 (Oxford), then in Spanish in 1949 (Barcelona). Study of Josep Trueta's biography and works on kidney function, especially the book \"Studies on the renal circulation\", relating them to the state-of- the- art of nephrologic studies of his time. Trueta and his group were pioneers in the study of the causes of postraumatic oliguria in war wounds. On the basis of the first studies on crush syndrome, published in 1941, were the kidney failure that followed the extended injuries of the limbs was pointed out, they could demonstrated the changes in renal circulation that followed different injuries to the limbs, such as ischemia, haemorrhage and infections. \"Studies on the renal circulation\" and other papers published in journals of high scientific impact, shown the renal cortical ischemia with preservation or increase of the medullar and yuxtamedullar circulation that takes place in those pathological situations (Trueta shunt). Although their contributions and hypothesis were not definitives, they served as the basis to studies performed later on, on acute kidney failure secondary to shock, glomerulonephritis, transplant rejection and blood hypertension. Trueta's works are unusual examples of investigations directed to answer clinical questions. What may calls one's attention is the wide field of investigation he moves on, that today would involved several medical specialities, different to his task as orthopedic surgeon. On the other hand, his love by Catalonia, his country, moves him to write \"The spirit of Catalonia\" (1946), a short text for English-speaking people, on the political and scientific history of Catalonia. Trueta was in the end, an humanistic intellectual with broad interests, reflected on his books on travels or on the life of classic sages such as Luis Vives, Miguel Servet or Cajal. He returned back to Catalonia in 1966 and died in 1977. His book \"Studies on the renal circulation\", exquisitely illustrated and edited deserves a distinguished place in the European medical and urological historiography.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18512383/"}

The main determinants of glomerular filtration rate are glomerular capillary pressure and glomerular blood flow, which are adjusted via resistance changes in the pre- and postglomerular vasculature. Overall pre- and postglomerular resistances were first determined by micropuncture in superficial glomeruli. While the predominant source of postglomerular resistance is the efferent arteriole, several results indicate that preglomerular resistance might be rather uniformly distributed among all preglomerular vessels (interlobar, arcuate and interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles). Over the last decade, several techniques have been used to visualize renal vessels and to study the action of various vasoactive hormones thereon. Results obtained with the split hydronephrotic kidney model, which permits in vivo microscopy of all renal vessels, provide evidence for a differential regulation of the various preglomerular vessels by vasoactive hormones. In particular, mediators of inflammation almost selectively constrict interlobar and arcuate arteries. We conclude that, given the renal vascular architecture, differential regulation of preglomerular vessels can alter haemodynamic parameters specifically for different nephron populations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8994546/"}

Hydration was maximized with oral fluids. Cases ranged in age from 2 days to 13 years. We determined HI as follows: Operators outlined the perimeters of the kidney and dilated renal pelvis in the maximal longitudinal view. Respective areas were automatically calculated. We obtained HI by outlining the area of the kidney and separately outlining the area of the dilated renal pelvis within the kidney. We calculated HI percentage as 100 x (Total area of kidney minus area of dilated pelvis and calices)/(Total area). This percentage calculation represents the renal area determined reproducibly in a standardized fashion as if the calices were not there and is recorded as a dimensionless number. Hydronephrosis for 30 of 60 kidneys (50%) showed decreasing HN, and for 17 of 60 kidneys (28%) showed increasing HN. In 13 of 60 (22%) HN was unchanged. Statistical analysis showed that HI was determined with an objectivity of 99.8%. Hydronephrosis is the most common abnormality detected with ultrasonography.

The purpose of this study was to validate a cognitive and technical skills curriculum to teach urologists ultrasonic propulsion to reposition kidney stones in tissue phantoms. Ten board-certified urologists recruited from a single institution underwent a didactic session on renal ultrasound imaging. Subjects completed technical skills modules in tissue phantoms, including kidney imaging, pushing a stone through a translucent maze, and repositioning a lower pole calyceal stone. Objective cognitive and technical performance metrics were recorded. Subjects completed a questionnaire to ascertain face and content validity on a five-point Likert scale. Eight urologists (80%) had never attended a previous ultrasound course, and nine (90%) performed renal ultrasounds less frequently than every 6 months. Mean cognitive skills scores improved from 55% to 91% (p<0.0001) on pre- and post-didactic tests. In the kidney phantom, 10 subjects (100%) repositioned the lower pole calyceal stone to at least the lower pole infundibulum, while 9 (90%) successfully repositioned the stone to the renal pelvis. A mean±SD (15.7±13.3) pushes were required to complete the task over an average of 4.6±2.2 minutes.

General practitioner referral levels and thresholds for patients developing end-stage renal disease; referral routes (nephrologist vs other physicians); influence of patient age, marital status and co-morbidity on referral. Referral levels varied widely with the full range of cases (0-32; median = 15) referred by different doctors after consideration of first laboratory results. Less than half (44%) of cases were referred to a nephrologist. Patient age (40 vs 70 years), marital status, co-morbidity (none vs rheumatoid arthritis) and general practitioner prior specialist renal training (yes or no) did not influence referral rates. Many patients were not referred to a specialist at creatinine levels of 129 micromol/l (47% not referred) or 250 micromol/l (45%). While all patients were referred at higher levels (350 and 480 micromol/l), referral to a nephrologist decreased in likelihood as scenarios became more complex; 28% at 129 micromol/l creatinine; 28% at 250 micromol/l; 18% at 350 micromol/l and 14% at 480 micromol/l. Referral levels and routes were not influenced by general practitioner age, sex or practice location.

Stone burden, stone location, number of sessions/shockwaves, and auxiliary procedures were noted for each patient. Stones were located in the upper, middle, and lower calices of 35, 43, and 40, patients respectively, with mean stone burdens of 81.4 mm2, 75.2 mm2, and 96.3 mm2, respectively. Patients were evaluated with intravenous urography, plain film, or ultrasonography. Success was determined 3 months after the last session. Re-treatment rates were calculated. The effect of anatomic factors on the success of treatment for lower-caliceal stones also was determined. The mean stone burden, median number of treatment sessions, and mean number of shockwaves were 84.2 mm2, 2, and 4344, respectively.

Tc-99m-MAG 3 diuretic renal scans are most commonly used in the evaluation and follow up of urinary track dilatations. They provide functional information on the differential renal function and on drainage quality which is allows distinction between obstructed and non-obstructed kidneys and the need for surgical correction vs conservative management in kidneys with impaired drainage. Standardized imaging and processing protocols are essential for correct interpretation and for meaningful comparisons between follow up scans. Different approaches and conceptions led to some contradicting recommendations between SNMMI and EANM guidelines on diuretic renography in children which caused confusion and to the emergence of self-made institutional protocols. In Late 2018 the two societies published joint procedural guidelines on diuretic renography in infants and children which hopefully will end the confusion. Tc-99m DMSA scans provide important information about the function of the renal cortex allowing detection of acute pyelonephritis, renal scars dysplasia and ectopy as well as accurate determination of the differential renal function. They are commonly used in the evaluation of children with urinary tract infections and affect clinical management. A standardized imaging and processing protocol improves the diagnostic accuracy of these studies. SPECT or pinhole images should be a routine part of the imaging protocol. This is one of the recommendations in the new EANM and SNMMI procedural guidelines for renal cortical scintigraphy in children available online on the SNMMI website and is under publication.

URSuu are newer and associated with many advantages: no sterilization procedure, immediate availability of equipment in the operating room, reduced waste production at the institutional level. A hybrid use of URSr and URSuu currently seems to be the best compromise from a medico-economic point of view for high volume centers.

Seventy-three pediatric transplant centers from 32 countries contributed to the survey. All centers performed urological evaluation prior to pediatric kidney transplantation (KTx) with subsequent interdisciplinary discussion. Screening for VUR in native kidneys (30% in all, 70% in selected patients) led to surgical intervention in 78% (11% in all, 89% in selected patients) with a decided preference of endoscopic intervention over ureterocystoneostomy. Following KTx, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis was applied in 65% of the patients and screening for allograft VUR performed in 93% of selected patients. The main management strategies of symptomatic allograft VUR were continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (83%) and surgical treatment (74%) (endoscopic intervention 55%, redo ureterocystoneostomy 26%).

A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE. The topics discussed include the commonest home-care, outpatient, endourologic and open surgical procedures. In addition, we discuss iatrogenic urinary infections associated with special situations, including urinary diversion, urologic prostheses, diabetes mellitus, dialysis, kidney transplantation and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). The findings of the literature review are as follows. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended with clean intermittent catheterization. With prolonged catheterization, antibiotics should not be used unless symptoms of pyelonephritis or septicemia become apparent. With transrectal prostate biopsy, infection can be prevented by rectal cleansing, use of smaller needles and administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis before and after the procedure. With ureteral stents, antibiotics should be restricted to patients with clinical signs of infection and high-risk patients. Infections after transurethral resection of the prostate can be prevented by avoiding risk factors and using perioperative antibiotics. In endourological procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of infected stones, preoperative UTIs or prolonged procedures. Antibiotics are not recommended for clean wounds, as prophylaxis for clean-contaminated wounds or as therapy for contaminated and dirty wounds. In patients with urinary diversion, the objective is to prevent pyelonephritis by avoiding both reflux and obstruction of the upper urinary tract. In patients with urological prostheses, the most important measure to overcome iatrogenic infection is prevention. In dialysis patients, iatrogenic infections can be prevented by the development of new catheter materials that are less susceptible to biofilms. In kidney transplant recipients, iatrogenic infections can be prevented by treating all types of infection prior to transplantation and by using peri- and postoperative prophylactic antibiotics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16608804/"}

The literature on his person and texts has been reviewed. Born in Cuba, he studied Medicine in Barcelona, graduating with an outstanding level 1877. He went to Paris to extend his studies where he settled and began an extraordinary professional career that led him to be a Professor of the Urinary Tract in the Parisian University and Chief of the Urology Clinic in the Hospital Necker, a pioneer center of specialization that was attended by many physicians from all nations world. He wrote five books on urology disease, of great importance in the literature on the specialty. These books are currently classics and still maintain their validity due to the profound anatomy-clinical and pathophysiological knowledge explained and the extraordinary description of the urinary tract operation techniques. An eminent urologist, not only because of the importance of his word but also due to design of the nail that carries his name as well as different urological eponyms, his human stature, his category as an investigator and his scientific excellence.

All providers are likely to encounter genomic data in practice with the expectation that they are able to successfully apply it to patient care. Pharmacogenomics tests for genetic variations in genes that are responsible for drug metabolism, transport, and targets of drug action. Variations can increase the risk for drug toxicity or poor efficacy. Pharmacogenomics can, therefore, be used to help select the best medication or aid in dosing. Nephrologists routinely treat cardiovascular disease and manage patients after kidney transplantation, two situations for which there are several high-evidence clinical recommendations for commonly used anticoagulants, antiplatelets, statins, and transplant medications. Successful use of pharmacogenomics in practice requires that providers are familiar with how to access and use pharmacogenomics resources. Similarly, clinical decision making related to whether to use existing data, whether to order testing, and if data should be used in practice is needed to deliver precision medicine. Pharmacogenomics is applicable to virtually every medical specialty, and nephrologists are well positioned to be implementation leaders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793969/"}

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance and a better understanding of the ecological adverse effects (collateral damage) of antibiotics warrant a reevaluation of the treatment recommendations for uncomplicated UTI. The new S3 guideline contains updated recommendations. The new S3 guideline is based on a review of publications on uncomplicated UTI retrieved by a systematic search of the Medline and Cochrane Library databases. Guidelines from abroad were also considered in the review. Uncomplicated UTI is classified as either uncomplicated cystitis (UC) or uncomplicated pyelonephritis (UP). The choice of a suitable antibiotic is determined by the following main criteria: the patient's individual risk profile and prior antibiotic treatment, if any; the spectrum of pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility; the proven efficacy of the antibiotic; the ecological adverse effects (collateral damage) of antimicrobial therapy; the side effects for the patient under treatment. On the basis of these criteria, co-trimoxazole/trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones can no longer be recommended as first-line empirical treatment for UC. Rather, the new recommended treatment of first choice consists of fosfomycin-trometamol, nitrofurantoin, or pivmecillinam. High-dose fluoroquinolones are still recommended, however, as first-line oral treatment for UP. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should only be treated in exceptional situations such as pregnancy or before urological procedures that will probably injure the mucosa of the urinary tract.

He often wrote his observations not as a diatribe, but as a confrontation with other physicians, mainly of the Erasistratian School. He outlined the great importance of the disproportionally large blood supply of the kidneys, an over-proportion not observed in any other organ, rightly arguing that this is a teleological procedure to achieve satisfactory body clearance. He challenged the dominant idea that blood purification and hence the formation of urine took place in the large branches of the renal vessels. He strongly argued that the special structure of the kidney tissue was responsible for their cathartic ability. Although he had no idea of the histology of the kidney, he made some beautiful similitudes to explain the filtering capacity of the renal tissue. From Galen onwards, very few changes and additions can be traced in Greek and thereafter Byzantine medical texts, regarding renal physiology. It is Johannes Actuarius who, 12 centuries later, writes an extensive treatise on urine and presents his point of view on renal physiology, mainly as conclusions from the pathological findings of uroscopy. In the present paper, we compare the 2 physicians' approaches on the function of the kidneys, which can be attributed to the accumulation of medical knowledge over the 12 centuries that separate them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20013728/"}

Several guidelines, including the 2011 AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) guidelines, no longer recommend routine voiding cystourethrogram after the initial urinary tract infection in children. The recent trend in voiding cystourethrogram use remains largely unknown. We examined practice patterns of voiding cystourethrogram use and explored the impact of these guidelines in a single payer system in the past 8 years. We identified all voiding cystourethrograms performed at a large pediatric referral center between January 2008 and December 2015. Patients 2 to 24 months old who underwent an initial voiding cystourethrogram for the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection in the first 6 months of 2009 and 2014 were identified. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. During the study period 8,422 voiding cystourethrograms were performed and the annual number declined over time. In the pre-AAP and post-AAP cohorts 233 and 95 initial voiding cystourethrograms were performed, respectively. While there was no statistically significant difference in the vesicoureteral reflux detection rate between 2009 and 2014 (37.3% vs 43.0%, p = 0.45), there was a threefold increase in high grade vesicoureteral reflux in 2014 (2.6% vs 8.4%, p = 0.03). A clear trend toward fewer voiding cystourethrograms was noted at our institution. This decrease started before 2011 and cannot be attributed to the AAP guidelines alone. While most detected vesicoureteral reflux remains low grade, there was a greater detection rate of high grade vesicoureteral reflux in 2014 compared to 2009. This may reflect a favorable impact of a more selective approach to obtaining voiding cystourethrograms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27593475/"}

A questionnaire was mailed to members of the Canadian Urological Association. The assessment and follow-up of upper and lower urinary tract function in neurogenic bladder patients, their optimal frequency and management of related infections were the topics of inquiry. One hundred and five of 602 urologists responded, for a response rate of 18%. Twenty-three (22%) of the respondents did not treat neurogenic bladder patients. Four out of five urologists who treated these patients favored a yearly renal ultrasound for routine surveillance of the upper urinary tract and routinely performed urodynamic studies for evaluation of the lower tract. Only a relatively small percentage used videourodynamics. Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) was preferred for the management of neurogenic bladder in patients with emptying difficulties. Asymptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) was preferably not treated. Symptomatic UTI was treated with antibiotics for 7 to 10 days by about 75% of the responding urologists, while 23% of female patients and 9% of male patients were treated for less than 7 days. Although most of the urologists had access to established treatment modalities, like CIC education and bladder augmentation, only 30% made use of botulinum toxin injections. This study confirms that most urologists in Canada, working with neurogenic bladder patients, follow principles reported in the literature regarding the need for evaluation, surveillance, and management of the urinary tract. However, there is no consensus on the specific methods used for surveillance of the urinary system.

The subsequent focus on dialysis care as a principal form of reimbursement led to a host of benefits and challenges for nephrologists. While the specialty initially enjoyed great popularity and exponential growth, a widening schism between researchers and clinicians developed. This limited the growth of robust clinical research in nephrology while dialysis care encumbered clinicians with exhausting travel, routinized rounding schedules, and burdensome navigation of electronic medical record systems. Poor morale and burnout among practitioners, coupled with the ethical issues associated with corporatized medicine have resulted in severe challenges for the specialty including difficulties with recruitment. The history of nephrology elucidates the convergence of medical science, public policy, and corporatization while providing a lens on the wider issues of contemporary American health care.

Percutaneous needle renal biopsy was introduced after first, the successful liver biopsy and second, demonstration of the value of aspiration needle biopsy in tumours of the kidney. In addition, a number of physicians obtained renal tissue by accident and without problems during intended biopsies of the liver. Nils Alwall of Sweden performed the first systematic aspiration needle biopsies of the kidney in 1944, but did not publish his results because of an early death which led him to abandon the technique. However, when Iversen and Brun in Copenhagen described their results in 1951, a number of physicians around the world immediately began to attempt renal biopsy, using cutting as well as aspiration techniques. Success was inconsistent and operator dependent: the refinements of technique and needles introduced by the group in Chicago led by Robert Kark, plus their advocacy of the technique and their training of many physicians in its performance rapidly led to widespread acceptance. New techniques of immunofluorescence and electron microscopy arrived at the same time so that the technique could be fully exploited.

In addition to the patient's urologic symptoms and urodynamic findings, other issues that may influence management options of the lower urinary tract include cognition, hand function, type of neurologic disease, mobility, bowel function/management, and social and caregiver support. This Guideline allows the clinician to understand the options available to treat patients, understand the findings that can be seen in NLUTD, and appreciate which options are best for each individual patient. This allows for decisions to be made with the patient, in a shared decision-making manner, such that the patient's quality of life can be optimized with respect to their bladder management.

However, experimental studies that demonstrate the effects of implanted ECMs on important biomechanical properties such as total bladder capacity (TBC) and compliance (C) are lacking. In the current study, the effects of ECM scaffold surface area (SA) on TBC and C was assessed, ex vivo, in an ovine model (n=5). TBC and C were measured at pressures (P) of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm Hg prior to performing a 3×3 cm (9 cm(2)) partial cystectomy defect. Equal-sized 3×3 cm (9 cm(2)) and larger 6×6 cm (36 cm(2)) urinary bladder matrix (UBM) scaffolds of porcine origin replaced the 3×3 cm cystectomy defect, and TBC and C were re-recorded for comparative analysis. The results showed that TBC decreased by 39.6%±0.005% (122.9 ml±15 ml, p<0.05) and C by 38.9%±0.51%, (ΔP=0-5mmHg, p<0.05) in ovine bladders reconstructed with 3×3 cm UBM scaffolds compared to their native values. It was also found that TBC increased by 25.6±0.64% (64.2 ml ± 8.8 ml, p>0.05) and C by 24.5±0.43% (ΔP=0-5mmHg, p>0.05) in the 6×6 cm UBM scaffold group compared to the 3×3 cm UBM scaffold group; however, these values were not statistically significant. The present work demonstrates that a fourfold increase in ECM scaffold SA relative to its intended defect does not lead to a significant improvement in TBC and C values.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21316625/"}

Many of them also become experts in Dermatology and Syphiliography. Until progress of anaesthetics and surgical techniques in the last decade of the century, do not allow to conduct more risked procedures, urology surgery of greater substance will continue in the hands of general surgeons who retain a certain degree of specialization in the urinary tract.

Online questionnaires were distributed electronically to physicians of the American College of Surgeons and American Urological Association. This survey queried demographic data, clinical factors that may influence urology consultations, and bladder injury scenarios of varying severities. Two questions were presented for each scenario, the first querying GS comfort level in bladder trauma management, the second assessing the likelihood of obtaining urology consultations in such scenarios. Responses were graded on a Likert scale. Overall, 108 (51%) GS and 104 (49%) urologists responded. When compared to managing Grade I injuries, the comfort level of GS decreased as the severity of bladder trauma increased, while the likelihood of obtaining a urology consultation increased. While the perceived comfort of GS by urologists decreased from 84% to 5% for Grade I to Grade V injuries, GS reported a significantly higher comfort level (Grade I: 92%, p = 0.09; Grade V: 31%, p < 0.001). Majority of GS indicated that preoperative diagnosis on imaging (56%), intraoperative diagnosis (62%), and timing of patient presentation (76%), did not affect their decision to consult urology for assistance in bladder trauma (p < 0.001). GS-reported comfort levels for bladder trauma management remains higher than urology-perceived comfort levels. Contrary to urologists' perception, most peri-injury factors did not affect GS decision to consult urology for bladder trauma.

More than minimal leakage was seen in 13 patients by Doppler and in 16 by fluoroscopic imaging. Results were in agreement in 28/37 cases (kappa 0.49). The observed discrepancies may have been due to initial technical difficulties, differences in bladder filling and the presence of a catheter on fluoroscopic imaging. In five incontinent patients, urethral flow velocities ranged from 0.064 to 0.34 m/s, which is equivalent to physiological venous and slow arterial blood flow and one to two orders of magnitude above the detection threshold of standard Doppler ultrasound equipment.

The document provides a throughout explanation on how to approach a child who presents with lower urinary tract dysfunction, whether it be of neurogenic, anatomic or functional origin. Formation of an urodynamic question after a comprehensive history and physical examination is paramount in selecting the urodynamic study(ies) that will be most appropriate for each child. Appropriate application of each test with careful consideration of the needs of the child and family will provide the most accurate and reproducible results. Recommendations on how to execute each of the components of an urodynamic study as well as interpretation are included in the document. Urodynamic studies have become a major tool in evaluating lower urinary tract dysfunction in children. There are many subtleties in performing these studies in children in juxtaposition to adults; therefore, adaptations specific to children must be made to achieve accurate and reproducible results.

Course faculty consisted of two Consultant Nephrologists, two Nephrology trainees experienced in PRB, and one Radiologist. Classroom instruction included discussion of PRB indications, risk minimisation, and management of complications. Two faculty members acted as models for the demonstration of kidney localisation using real-time ultrasound scanning. PRB was demonstrated using a cadaveric model, and candidates then practised PRB using each cadaver model. Written candidate feedback was universally positive. Faculty considered the cadaveric model a realistic representation of live patients, while the use of multiple cadavers introduced anatomical variation. Our model facilitates safe simulation of a high risk procedure.

The success rate is similar to open surgery. However, few comparative studies have been conducted. According to the most recent findings, retroperitoneoscopic surgery in children is feasible and safe if performed by well-trained surgeons.

In earlier times, nephrologists relied less on controlled randomized prospective trials and more on common sense. One such notion was the idea that kidneys could be \"rested\" by requiring them to make less urine. Particularly in Germany early in this century, patients with chronic renal disease were advised to go to Assuan in Egypt, where the warm sunny weather and low humidity decreased their urinary output. Thus, a \"vacation\" was prescribed for sick kidneys, and indeed, early in his career Volhard also supported this notion. In a small but excellent study, Loewy, Wohlgemuth, Bickel, and Schweitzer concluded that a decreased urinary output, rather than decreasing renal work, would require a considerable increase in concentration of excreted solutes, a task that patients with renal insufficiency would not be likely able to meet. These findings, as well as the observation that renal patients often failed to return from Egypt, caused Volhard to change his mind.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9159316/"}

As from the last quarter of the century, however, a clear trend can be glimpsed in some professionals in Spain towards specialization in this branch of surgery. Albeit the influence of the French School and French publications on the first specialists is manifest, since most of them were training in Paris, it is obvious that the genesis and progress of specialization on genitourinary organs disorders, as well as other areas, in Spain would have not been possible without the concourse and political support received from relevant personalities such as Dr. Federico Rubio y Gali and Dr. Angel Pulido Fernández, both with partial dedication to the urinary tract and to whom the Spanish Association of Urology still owns further recognition for the role they played in the promotion of these earlier specialists and the establishment of centres and hospital services where their work could be carried out. Since, during the final third of last century, the number of Spanish publications, journals and monographs devoted to urological topics, a extensive revision of which is covered in this paper, is increasingly profuse, the boom of the specialty in genitourinary tract disorders will determine its ultimate consolidation at the beginning of the 20th Century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8928675/"}

We hypothesized that this difficulty is rooted in a student's misunderstanding of virtual volume. This was tested by having students select from several drawings the one they thought plasma would look like after a certain volume of it has been cleared of sodium by the kidneys. About half the participating students selected plasma pictured as having a certain volume of it devoid of sodium molecules. That is, their misconception of clearance seemed to be due to a lack of understanding about virtual volume, a deficiency which is reinforced by the classic definition of clearance. To address this misconception, a demonstration was devised in which a beaker of concentrated colored water was used to represent plasma before renal clearance, a beaker of the same concentrated colored water in which the top third had been replaced by clear mineral oil was used to represent what the definition of clearance said would happen to plasma after a third of it had been cleared of sodium, and a beaker of dilute colored water was used to represent what really happens to plasma when a certain volume of it is cleared of a solute. Incorporating this demonstration into discussions of renal clearance helped students to understand this concept, as evidenced by improved scores on related questions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15545350/"}

The itinerant surgeon was known to go from town to town to remove bladder stones in the early middle ages. In this century, urologists had been at the forefront in pioneering minimally invasive surgery with the introduction of transurethral resection of the prostate more than 50 years ago in the United States. This could be considered the first revolution in urology and this has influenced the evolution of urology in Singapore. Transurethral surgery had proved to be far superior to open surgery for most lesions of the lower urinary tract. This technique was introduced to Singapore in the early 1970s by Dr N E Wong. Because of the need for special instruments, skill and training, there was a need for a Department of Urology. This was not to be until after the second revolution in urology. The second revolution saw the introduction of endoscopic surgery of the upper urinary tract and Extra-corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy in the early 1980s. This had truly revolutionised the treatment of urinary stones and today almost 95% of patients can be treated with these non to minimally invasive techniques. These new modalities of treatment were rapidly introduced in Singapore in the mid 1980s. The need for the establishment of urology as a specialty was more urgently felt. The Singapore Urological Association was formed in February 1986 and in March 1987, a Division of Urology was formed at the Singapore General Hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8363345/"}

Nine residents, four from Nephrology and five from internal medicine program, attended a 16-hour course that covered theoretical and practical aspects of ultrasonography. The course addressed topics related to urinary tract, lung, heart, and blood vessel ultrasonography and use of ultrasound to guide kidney biopsy and central venous catheter insertion. The resident evaluation consisted of cognitive tests (CT) with multiple-choice questions and image association tests, before and after the course, and assessment of skills in generating ultrasound images and performing procedures using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). All residents completed the course. A significant improvement in knowledge was observed by comparing the residents' scores obtained on the CT (p < 0.004) and image association tests (p < 0.02) before and after the course. With the exception of the station regarding the lungs, they demonstrated very good performance on the assessment of the skills using the OSCE exams.

Mean stone diameter was 701.52±510.65 mm(2). Guy and CROES nephrolithometry scores were calculated for each patient, and their correlation with stone-free status, operative and fluoroscopy time, and length of hospital stay was evaluated. Post-PCNL stone status was evaluated with plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien classification, and the correlation of both scoring systems with postoperative complications was also investigated. The mean Guy grade was 2.28±1.12, and the mean CROES score was 196.92±65.89. The overall stone-free rate was 75.1%. There was a significant correlation between the Guy stone score (GSS) and CROES score and stone-free status (P<0.001, P<0.001). Also, both scoring systems were correlated with operative time (P<0.001, P<0.001) and length of hospital stay (P=0.002, P=0.01). The overall complication rate was 34.6%, with most being modified Clavien grade I and grade II. Both scoring systems were significantly correlated with complication rates. Regression analysis showed that both scoring systems were significantly associated with stone-free rates, estimated blood loss (EBL) (>250 mL), and operative time.

A systematic literature review was carried. All national and international recommendations have been reviewed. Data collection has been performed from the Cochrane, LILACS and the Medline database. 31 publications were selected for inclusion. Risk of infection in patients without ureteral stents or urinary catheters with previous polymicrobial urine culture is low. In the absence of leukocyturia, the urine sample can be considered as sterile. With ureteral stents or urinary catheters, the colonisation by biofilm ranges from 4 to 100% depending on the duration and ureteral stents or urinary catheters type. Urine culture is positive 24 to 45% of the time when ureteral stents or urinary catheters are known to be colonised. The post-operative risk of infection in endo-urological surgery in a patient with ureteral stents or urinary catheters is estimated around 8 to 11% depending on the type of surgery. A retrospective study reports a postoperative infections rate of 18.5% in photo selective vaporization of the prostate with preoperative polymicrobial urine culture. Scientific data are limited but for patients without ureteral stents or urinary catheters, in the absence of leukocyturia, the polymicrobial urine culture can be considered as negative. Considering a preoperative polymicrobial urine culture as sterile in patients with colonised ureteral stents or urinary catheters is at risk of neglecting a high risk of postoperative infections or sepsis even in case of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. It should not always be considered sterile and therefore, a perioperative antibiotic therapy could be an acceptable option.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30962140/"}

In medicine the saints were venerated as intercessory figures in the cure of diseases. Particularly, urology has 6 saints that stand out: firstly, the couple of Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian, venerated for healing diseases related to the urinary tract and kidney stones. There is also Saint Margaret of Antioch, who is represented with a belt that surrounds the kidneys, which is why she is associated as the protector of nephrology. St. Liborius of Le Mans healed an archbishop from \"the disease of stones,\" which made him the patron saint of kidney stones. St. Zoilo of Cordoba was a martyr who was tortured with the removal of his kidneys before his execution, which made him a symbol of healing for kidney problems and urinary retention. Lastly, St. Roch of Montpellier was a martyr associated with the \"plague of pleasure,\" syphilis, since he devoted his life to the treatment of patients with plague. Medieval urological practice is noted as well due to uroscopy, a 6000-year-old method consisting of macroscopic analysis of urine that evolved from ancient Babylonian texts, went to the observations recorded by Hippocrates, and ended in the systematization by Theophilus of Constantinople in his work De Urinis. Uroscopy, although primitive, represented a significant step towards a medicine based on observation and systematic analysis of diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40267414/"}

Recommendations for assessing BPH were modified and updated and include patient history, symptom questionnaires, physical examination, urine analysis, prostate-specific antigen, uroflowmetry, ultrasound examination of the urinary bladder (including postvoid residual urine), and ultrasound examination of the upper urinary tract or creatinine measurement. Optional tests are voiding diary, pressure-flow studies, ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness, urethrocystography, and urethrocystoscopy. For the first time, tests for the differential diagnosis of bladder symptoms and BPH are described. Furthermore, the latest knowledge was added on disease progression, indications for urodynamic assessment, and ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness for evaluating bladder outlet obstruction.

One thousand posts about pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome were randomly selected. We analyzed these posts for recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of these diseases, which were then compared to recommendations in available clinical guidelines and assessed for level of evidence. A total of 158 of 1000 posts contained 239 prevention strategies. For pelvic organ prolapse, there were 41 strategies identified, 25 (61%) of which had no evidence. For urinary tract infection 14 of 58 (29%) had no evidence, including recommendations for dietary modifications and urinary alkalization. For overactive bladder 8 of 28 (29%) had level 4 or no evidence. For stress urinary incontinence, 12 of 34 (36%) of prevention strategies had no evidence, such as laser rejuvenation and bladder training. Interstitial cystitis had the highest number of prevention strategies, and most were low or nonevidence based (70/79, 89%). Prevention and treatment strategies are common in online discussions of pelvic floor disorders, but at least one third of these recommendations have no evidential support.

From March 2000 to November 2006, the surgical records of 28 children (< or = 18 years) who had been admitted for treatment of posttraumatic posterior urethral strictures were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been followed up for a median of 36 months (range 3-58). The cause of trauma, extent of urinary tract injury, radiologic examination findings, previous treatment, and its effect on the final outcome, treatment complications,, and failures were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 12.1 years (range 5-18) at the injury. The estimated radiographic mean stricture length before surgery was 3.41 cm (range 2-6). Of the 28 patients, 27 were treated with transperineal anastomotic urethroplasty, with a success rate of 75%. All treatment failures were at the anastomotic site and occurred within the first year of anastomotic urethroplasty. The failed repairs (7 cases) were successfully managed endoscopically in 4 patients and by redo urethroplasty in 3, for a final success rate of 100%. Of the 28 patients, 15 (80%) with urethral manipulation before anastomotic urethroplasty had a satisfactory result compared with 69.3% of patients without previous surgical treatment. The difference was not statistically significant. Most posttraumatic posterior urethral strictures in children can be managed through the perineal route. The transpubic approach should be reserved for more complex posterior strictures.

The study comprised 12 female mongrel dogs; three dogs were used to study the effect on urethral resistance of inserting a vaginal magnet (control experiment) and five were assessed in a urodynamic study. With the animals under general anaesthesia, the bladder and the urethra were exposed by a low midline incision. One magnet, embedded in a silicon layer, was placed on the anterior side of the urethra 3 cm distal to the bladder neck and fixed with a few sutures. To increase the urethral resistance as required, a second magnet was inserted into the vagina and the device activated. Urethral pressure profiles and leak-point pressures were recorded in the anaesthetized animals under resting conditions and after the urethra was compressed between the magnets. Recordings were also made after pharmacological blockade of the urethral musculature. In four additional dogs, chronic experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of continuous compression of the urethra and the vaginal wall for 14 days. Urethral compression between the magnets resulted in a doubling of the maximal pressure in the proximal urethra and in a threefold increase of the leak-point pressure. After pharmacological denervation of the urethra the differences between the control pressures and those after activating the device were even greater, although not significantly so. After 2 weeks of continuous compression of the vaginal wall and the urethra between the magnets there was no detectable tissue damage. These results suggest that the magnetic device can efficiently increase urethral pressure and that prolonged compression caused no apparent damage to the urethra or vagina. It may therefore be a useful potential method of providing urinary continence in women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10619964/"}

The study aims to discern the factors influencing this trend using ChatGPT, a leading chatbot model, for insights into the comparative appeal of nephrology versus other internal medicine specialties. Using the GPT-4 model, the study compared nephrology with 13 other internal medicine specialties, evaluating each on 7 criteria including intellectual complexity, work-life balance, procedural involvement, research opportunities, patient relationships, career demand, and financial compensation. Each criterion was assigned scores from 1 to 10, with the cumulative score determining the ranking. The approach included counteracting potential bias by instructing GPT-4 to favor other specialties over nephrology in reverse scenarios. GPT-4 ranked nephrology only above sleep medicine. While nephrology scored higher than hospice and palliative medicine, it fell short in key criteria such as work-life balance, patient relationships, and career demand. When examining the percentage of filled positions in the 2024 appointment year match, nephrology's filled rate was 66%, only higher than the 45% (155/348) filled rate of geriatric medicine. Nephrology's score decreased by 4%-14% in 5 criteria including intellectual challenge and complexity, procedural involvement, career opportunity and demand, research and academic opportunities, and financial compensation.

A nephrological view of the Whitechapel murders in 1888.", "text": "In the poor Whitechapel district of the East End of London in the fall of 1888, at least five prostitutes were brutally murdered, and in all but one case, also mutilated. The murderer was never caught and became known by his nickname 'Jack the Ripper'. The left kidney and the uterus were cut out and taken away from one of the victims named Catherine Eddowes. A kidney was also cut out of the body from another victim, but not taken away. Two weeks later, George Lusk, president of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, received a small cardboard box with half of a longitudinally divided kidney and a letter entitled 'From hell' claiming that the kidney inside the box was taken from the victim. The kidney was brought to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw, the Curator of the London Pathological Museum, where the kidney could be microscopically examined. The press jumped on the topic and made a circumstantial case that this kidney had been indeed torn from the body of Catherine Eddowes. According to the later memoirs of Major Henry Smith of the City Police published more than 20 years after the incident, the kidney left in the corpse of Catherine Eddowes was in an advanced stage of Bright's disease and the kidney sent to George Lusk was in exactly a similar stage. Today, the majority of criminologists believe that the kidney sent to Mr Lusk was a hoax as were other letters signed with Jack the Ripper. However, the murderer took organs from his victims, and in the case of Catherine Eddowes, the kidney. Serial killers often mutilate their victims and abscond with the removed body parts as trophies. By removing the kidney from Catherine Eddowes, Jack the Ripper may have tried to take possession of the conscience, emotions and desires of one of his victims, attributes residing in the kidney as described in the Bible. Jack the Ripper was never caught; many suspects have been suggested, and the murder series ended as suddenly as it had begun. We will never know who this mentally disturbed 'nephrophilic' was. Today, the story of Jack the Ripper is part of contemporary culture.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408073/"}

The aims of this study were to 1) to assess whether available medical textbooks provided students with adequate information about bile salt transporters, 2) compare the level of detail and the amount of information provided in current textbooks on hepatic transport mechanisms with those available in the literature, and 3) compare the amount of information provided in medical textbooks on hepatocyte transport mechanisms with those involving other transporters e.g., those found in the nephron. Seventy medical textbooks from disciplines including physiology, pathology, cell biology, medicine, pediatrics, pharmacology, pathophysiology, and histology published during the past six years were examined. The literature on bile salt transport has been searched mainly from the Internet (MEDLINE and PubMed). Most textbooks failed to provide any information on transporters found in the basolateral and canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. There are also deficiencies in information on bile salt transporters in the terminal ileum. However, up to the end of 2002, 3,610 articles and reviews had been published on hepatobiliary and enterocyte transport of bile salts. During the same period (from 1965), 10,757 articles had been published on renal transport. Thus the contents of textbooks may reflect the overall volume of research knowledge on renal transport. However, despite our current understanding of hepatic and intestinal transport of bile salts and extensive research, particularly over the past 12 years, there are major deficiencies in textbooks in this area. These findings indicate that there is an imbalance in the contents of current textbooks and a lack of information about hepatobiliary physiology, bile salt transporters, bile formation, and mechanisms underlying cholestasis and drug-induced injury. Authors, editors, and publishers of medical textbooks should consider the need to update the information provided on bile salt transporters.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15149958/"}

We developed a novel technique of intraoperative stent placement that allows removal via the flank. Herein, we report on our initial clinical experience. Thirty consecutive patients (36 renal moieties) undergoing tubeless PCNL had ureteral stents placed at the end of the procedure with a stent tether exiting the flank incision. Patients were discharged home with the tether protected by a clear occlusive bandage. The stents were removed in the office between 3 and 12 days postoperatively by gently pulling on the tether. Patients were assessed for difficulty in removing the stent, leakage of urine from the flank, and any other postoperative complications. All stents could be removed from the flank using the tether. No urine leakage was noted in any patient, nor did any patient develop any complication related to stent placement or removal. Stents from several manufacturers were employed, with no difference noted. Patients reported no additional discomfort from the presence of the flank tether, and no significant pain was noted during stent removal. Utilization of the tether to remove the ureteral stent via the flank after tubeless PCNL is a feasible, safe, and cost-effective improvement on the standard tubeless PCNL technique.

We utilized Q methodology to understand first-year medical student attitudes after an innovative kidney physiology curriculum redesign that focuses on blending multiple learning methods. First-year medical students were invited to take a Q sort survey at the conclusion of a kidney physiology course. Students prioritized statements related to their understanding of kidney physiology, learning preferences, preferred course characteristics, perceived clinical relevance of kidney physiology, and interest in nephrology as a career. Factor analysis was performed to identify different student viewpoints. At the conclusion of our modified course, all students (n = 108) were invited to take the survey and 44 (41%) Q sorts were returned. Two dominant viewpoints were defined according to interest in nephrology. The Potentials are students who understand kidney physiology, perceive kidney physiology as clinically relevant, attend class sessions, utilize videos, and are willing to shadow a nephrologist. The Uninterested are students who are less satisfied with their kidney physiology knowledge, prefer to study alone with a textbook, avoid lectures, and are not interested in learning about nephrology. In an updated renal physiology course, students that use multiple learning methods also have favorable attitudes toward learning kidney physiology. Thus, modern curriculum changes that accommodate a variety of learning styles may promote positive attitudes toward nephrology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27758129/"}

{"id": "21312083", "title": "[National S3 guideline on uncomplicated urinary tract infection: recommendations for treatment and management of uncomplicated community-acquired bacterial urinary tract infections in adult patients].", "text": "Urinary tract infections (UTI) belong to the most frequent bacterial infections in outpatients. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates and a new appreciation of the epidemiological side effects of antibiotics (\"collateral damage\") have warranted an update of the guidelines on uncomplicated UTI as an S3 clinical guideline. The guideline was developed by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Urologie (DGU) in collaboration with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Allgemein- und Familienmedizin (DEGAM), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gynäkologie und Geburtshilfe (DGGG), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hygiene und Mikrobiologie (DGHM), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Infektiologie (DGI), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nephrologie (DGfN), Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft für Chemotherapie (PEG) and a patient representative. The systematic review of the literature on the topics of the guideline was performed for the time period of 1 January 1998 to 30 April 2008 in the databases of the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE. International guidelines of the years 1999-2007 were included. Uncomplicated UTI comprise uncomplicated cystitis and uncomplicated pyelonephritis. The leading uropathogen is Escherichia coli. The choice of the antibiotic substance follows the five primary aspects: (1) individual patient risk and antibiotic pretreatment; (2) bacterial spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility; (3) effectivity of the antimicrobial substance demonstrated in clinical studies; (4) epidemiological effects (\"collateral damage\"); and (5) adverse effects. If antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolones have previously been given, the risk for pathogens to become resistant against these substances is increased. Because of increasing resistance rates of E. coli against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also in uncomplicated UTI, trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole is no longer regarded as the first-line agent in the empiric treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, unless the regional resistance rate is below 20%. The antibiotic resistance rates of fluoroquinolones in uncomplicated UTI are still below 10% in Germany, but there is a significant emergence of resistance compared to earlier years. Moreover, fluoroquinolones and group 3 cephalosporins exhibit negative epidemiological effects resulting in selection of multi-resistant pathogens. Because these antibiotic classes are needed in therapy of life-threatening infections, such effects should be taken seriously. For substances like fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin or mecillinam\"collateral damage\" has not been documented or only to a lesser degree. Therefore, for empiric therapy of frequent uncomplicated cystitis fosfomycin-trometamol, nitrofurantoin or pivmecillinam (not listed in Germany) are recommended as first-line antibiotics. For oral first-line treatment of uncomplicated pyelonephritis, fluoroquinolones are still recommended in sufficiently high dosage due to the resistance rates of E. coli still being below 10% and the superior effectivity compared to other antibiotics. Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) should only be treated in exceptional cases such as pregnant women or prior to expected mucocutaneous traumatising interventions of the urinary tract. The S3 guideline on uncomplicated urinary tract infections is a comprehensive set of evidence- and consensus-based recommendations dealing with epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy and management of uncomplicated bacterial UTI of adult outpatients. A broad implementation in all disciplines taking care of patients with UTI is necessary in order to ensure a prudent antibiotic policy in these frequent infections and thus improve patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312083/"}

The current study re-examined the relationship of MPA and Cavalieri values for glomerular volume in humans and rats. Both methods were used to measure the volume of 1201 glomeruli from 58 humans and 281 glomeruli from 15 rats. Tissue was embedded in Epon. Further mathematical analysis was performed to assess the extent to which deviation of glomeruli from spherical shape affects the relationship of values obtained by the MPA and Cavalieri methods.

The relationship of MPA to Cavalieri values was similar in individual humans and rats, with widely varying values for average glomerular volume. Neither the development of sclerosis nor the loss of any connection to a tubule affected the relationship of the MPA and Cavalieri values for the volume of individual glomeruli. Mathematical analysis showed that MPA values would not exceed Cavalieri values if glomeruli had ellipsoidal rather than spherical shape. Similar values for glomerular volume are obtained using the Cavalieri and MPA methods in humans and rats.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10844635/"}

This is in part due to poor pharmacology of many, if not most, therapeutics with respect to the sites of kidney disease within the glomerulus or nephron. Considering this, within the past decade, and more pointedly over the past 2 years, there have been substantial developments in nanoparticle systems to deliver therapeutics to the sites of kidney disease. Here, we provide a broad overview of the various classes of nanomaterials that have been developed to improve therapeutic development for kidney diseases, the strategy used to provide kidney accumulation, and briefly the disease models they focused on, if any. We then focus on one specific system, polymeric mesoscale nanoparticles, which has broadly been used over 13 publications, demonstrating targeting of the tubular epithelium with 26-fold specificity compared with other organs. While there have been several nanomedicines that have advanced to the clinic in the past several decades, including mRNA-based coronavirus disease vaccines and others, none have focused on kidney diseases specifically. In total, we are confident that the rapid advancement of nanoscale-based kidney targeting and a concerted focus by clinicians, scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders will push one or more of these technologies into clinical trials over the next decade.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38414130/"}

En bloc mass stapling of the renal pedicle with an endovascular gastrointestinal anastomosis (Endo-GIA) stapler without individual dissection of the renal artery and vein was done. All procedures were successful. No hilar bleeding was encountered during the process of hilar division. The overall success rate of en bloc stapling to control the renal hilum in the 23 patients was 100%. The average patient age was 59.0 years (range 32-78), the operative time was 177.3 minutes (range 135-343), and the estimated blood loss was 117 mL (range 50-500). The time to oral intake and ambulation was 2.0 and 3.1 days, respectively. Two patients had postoperative complications, one pneumonia and the other wound hematoma. No immediate or short-term complications were related to this method of en bloc hilar division. No case of symptoms or imaging findings of arteriovenous fistula had developed at a mean follow-up of 24.5 months. No statistically significant difference was found in preoperative and postoperative systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Routine use of en bloc stapling and division of the renal pedicle in dialysis patients with upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma is safe.

Variation in practice surrounding the diagnosis and management of suspected renal colic could have substantial implications for both quality and cost of care as well as patient radiation burden. Previous literature has suggested that CT scanning has increased with no improvements in outcome, owing at least partially to the spontaneous passage of kidney stones in the majority of patients. Concerns about the rising medical radiation burden in the US necessitate scrutiny of current practices and viable alternatives. Our objective was to use data from a diverse sample of US EDs to examine rates of and variation in the use of CT scanning, admission, and inpatient procedures for patients with renal colic and analyze the influence of patient and hospital factors on the diagnostic testing and treatment patterns for patients with suspected renal colic. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who received a diagnosis of renal colic via a visit to an ED at 444 US hospitals participating in the Premier Healthcare Alliance database from 2009-2011. We modeled use of CT, admission, and inpatient urologic intervention as functions of both patient characteristics and hospital characteristics. Over the 2-year period, 307,612 patient visits met inclusion criteria. Among these patients, 254,211 (82.6%) had an abdominal CT scan, with 91.5% being non-contrast (\"renal protocol\") CT scans. Nineteen percent of visits (58,266) resulted in admission or transfer, and 9.8% of visits (30,239) resulted in a urologic procedure as part of the index visit. On multivariable analysis male patients, Hispanic patients, uninsured patients, and privately insured patients were more likely to have a CT scan performed. Older patients and those covered by Medicare were more likely to be admitted, and once admitted, white patients and privately insured patients were more likely to have a urologic intervention. Only hospital region was associated with variation in CT rates, and this variation was minimal. Region and size of the hospital were associated with admission rates, and hospitals with more practicing urologists had higher intervention rates. In this dataset, the majority of patients did not require admission or immediate intervention. Despite this, the large majority received CT scans, in a cohort representing 15-20% of all US ED visits. The CT rate was minimally variable at the hospital level, but the admission rates varied 2-fold, suggesting that hospital-level factors affect patient management. The high rate of CT usage coupled with the low rate of immediate intervention suggests that further research is warranted to identify patients who are at low risk for an immediate intervention, and could potentially be managed with ultrasound alone, expectant management, or delayed CT.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28046001/"}

A percutaneously placed antepubic catheter was used for bladder infusion and recording intravesicular pressures during cystometrography (CMG). A fine-wire electrode was placed percutaneously into or near the EUS for recording EMG during CMG. The bladder was infused with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution at a rate of 2 to 3 ml/min until a detrusor reflex was initiated. Intravesicular pressures at the onset of infusion, immediately prior to micturition, at the onset of urine flow, and at the maximal voiding pressure were recorded. The time from infusion to micturition, from opening pressure to return to baseline, and from the beginning to the end of the CMG were also recorded. The total volume of 0.9% NaCl solution infused and the residual bladder volume after micturition were also measured. Recordings were replicated once during each trial in all cats, and trials were replicated once approximately 1 week later in 4 cats. Micturition patterns were characterized by slight to moderate EUS EMG activity during vesicular filling, with reduction in activity during emptying.

The simultaneous recording of CMG and EUS EMG with fine-wire electrodes was simple and reliable for assessing the neuromuscular integrity and synchrony of detrusor and EUS muscles.

The glomerular filtration rate is a dynamic function that can change almost instantaneously in response to stressors. Despite its central role in nephrology, there are no techniques available to the clinician for monitoring glomerular filtration rate in real time. Recent advances in technology to measure fluorescent compounds through the skin are providing a new approach for real-time monitoring of glomerular filtration rate. This review frames these technologies within how such measurements might be used in clinical medicine. Fluorescent molecules that act as ideal filtration markers are now available. Using transdermal sensors, the plasma disappearance rate of these exogenous markers can be measured rather than their steady state concentration. This eliminates the delay inherent in using an endogenous marker of filtration and permits continuous monitoring of GFR. These new technologies provide enhanced opportunities for diagnosis of kidney dysfunction and therapeutic monitoring. Accurate assessment of measured GFR will eliminate the erroneous diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from many patients. Assessment of renal reserve will provide a new risk factor for progression of CKD. Real-time monitoring of GFR in critically ill patients will allow for earlier diagnosis of acute kidney injury and a dynamic metric to guide therapeutics. These are but a few of the many opportunities that this new technology will provide in both the clinical and research arenas.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28953557/"}

Although clinical risks factors for developing AKI have been identified, there is no reasonable surveillance technique to definitively and rapidly diagnose and determine the extent of severity of AKI in any patient. Because patient outcomes correlate with the extent of injury, and effective therapy likely requires early intervention, the ability to rapidly diagnose and stratify patients by their level of kidney injury is paramount for translational progress. Many groups are developing and characterizing optical measurement techniques using novel minimally invasive or noninvasive techniques that can quantify kidney function independent of serum or urinary measurements. The use of both one- and two-compartment models, as well as continuous monitoring, are being developed.

The management of renal trauma has long been an evolving and at times controversial field of study within urology. Though surgical exploration and nephrectomy were more common in the past, practice has shifted to observation and avoidance of intervention in most cases. Over the past century, technological advancements have given urologists and trauma surgeons the tools to improve clinical outcomes, which we outline in the following essay. A broad literature review was performed of archival material and medical journal articles that included both primary and secondary documents related to renal trauma management and advances in relevant technology. Primary subject interviews were conducted with subject matter experts including Dr Jack McAninch and Dr Jeremy B. Myers. The earliest days of renal trauma were marked by conservatism that was largely a consequence of the few options available for evaluation and worthwhile intervention. As surgical techniques developed and the role of exploratory laparotomy became established, there was considerable debate over how aggressive surgical management should be. Alongside these operative advances, the evolution of radiographic techniques became one of the most impactful aspects in renal trauma management, culminating with the introduction of CT and subsequent grading scales. Over the past century, urologists have progressed from stabbing in the dark without imaging or clinical consensus, to managing renal trauma with high quality imaging and evidence-based guidelines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40107460/"}

The clinical diagnostic groups were: spinal cord injury/disease in 32 (27%), myelodysplasia in 27 (22%), interstitial cystitis in 21 (17%), idiopathic detrusor instability in 13 (11%), radiation cystitis in 8 (7%), Hinman-Allen syndrome in 5 (4%), and miscellaneous in 11 (9%). A detubularized ileal augmentation was used in 82 (67%) patients. In 36 (30%) a detubularized ileocecocystoplasty was fashioned and in the remainder detubularized sigmoid was used. In 19 patients augmentation accompanied undiversion. Sixteen patients had a simultaneous fascial sling for urethral incompetence. Mean follow-up was 37 months (range 6-96 months). There was no postoperative mortality. During follow-up 4 patients died from unrelated causes, 11 have been lost to follow-up, and 5 patients await planned transplantation. Bladder capacity was increased from a preoperative mean of 108 ml (range 15-500 ml) to 438 ml (200-1,200 ml) postoperatively. Of the 106 assessable patients, 80 (75%) had an excellent result, 21 (20%) were improved, and 5 (5%) had major ongoing problems.

In contrast to the renin-angiotensin system, which upregulates pressure, the medullipin system downregulates blood pressure. THE MECHANISM: A rise in arterial pressure has two important consequences. First, medullary blood flow increases, renal interstitial fluid pressure rises and there is a reduction in the medullary urea osmotic gradient. Second, secretion of medullipin I is increased, which circulates to the liver, where it is converted to the active hormone, medullipin II, by a P-450 cytochrome oxidase pathway. Both of these mechanisms work in parallel to reduce arterial pressure with an increase in the urinary excretion of sodium and water coupled with systemic arterial vasodilation by medullipin II.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7769488/"}

However, not all medical texts of the period were written in Arabic. As central power eroded, provincial principalities arose, and regional cultures flourished, medical texts began to be written in local dialects, particularly in Persia. Notable amongst those and probably the oldest is the Hidayat al-Muallimin fi-al-Tibb (Learner's; guide to medicine) written by Abubakr al-Akawayni al-Bokhari in the closing decades of the 10th century. Written in Farsi and dedicated to his son and other students of medicine, the Hidayat is a relatively short and simplified pandect of medicine at the time and provides a glimpse of the teaching of medicine of the period.

The RFR is a measure of the change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from baseline to a peak value when the kidney is stimulated to increase its function. This concept has a strong physiologic basis in nephrology and the presence, magnitude or absence of RFR capacity may have prognostic significance in many clinical scenarios where individuals are at risk of hyperfiltration or kidney dysfunction. Unlike in other medical specialties, where organ reserve function is reliably measurable and used routinely, measurement of RFR in nephrology has not been integrated into clinical care. Methodologic challenges including standardization of methods to stimulate GFR and the ability of measures of GFR to discriminate acute dynamic changes in GFR upon kidney stimulation have hampered the robustness and use of RFR measurements in research and clinical care. Given the emergence of many new disease-modifying therapies in nephrology, it is imperative that we move forward and develop more robust tools to further our understanding of kidney physiology and pathophysiology, such as the RFR, which should be integrated into research and clinical care to support optimal personalization of therapeutic kidney care strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37706475/"}

Surprisingly, and in spite of him being the most prolific author in urological issues during the last century (my investigations show he is the author of 2 books, 3 brochures and 40 articles in journals), neither his name nor his work, as far as we know, are mentioned by none of the historians consulted, which is nothing but highly surprising if we also take into consideration that Alejandro Settier was the founder of the first Spanish monographic journal for urinary disorders: \"Gaceta de enfermedades de los órganos génito-urinarios\" (Gazette of genitourinary organs disorders), Madrid 1887, which in spite of its short existence, can be considered as the first scientific periodical publication in our specialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8928678/"}

We tested the underlying assumption that cuff pressure is transmitted to the penile urethra. In 35 men we simultaneously recorded penile cuff and urethral pressure during 2 experimental protocols for 6 cuffs of various widths and manufactures. Initially a urethral pressure transducer was placed at the mid point of the cuff and urethral pressure was continuously recorded during cuff inflation. In experiment 2 cuff pressure was set at 120 cm. water and the urethral pressure profile was measured by withdrawing the urethral transducer through the cuff width. There was excellent agreement of cuff with urethral pressure over the range of 0 to 200 cm. water for cuffs 37 to 54 mm. wide. Narrower cuffs showed wider variation with less efficient transmission of cuff pressure to the urethral lumen. Similarly maximum pressure in the urethral pressure profile showed best agreement for cuffs 38 and 46 mm. wide. Wider cuffs produced higher and narrower cuffs produced lower transmitted pressure within the urethra. Cuff performance was also related to penile size. Results had good within-subject repeatability. We demonstrated that pressure transmission from cuff to urethra is optimal at a cuff width of 40 to 50 mm. and recommended this width for other investigations of noninvasive bladder pressure measurement.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11696826/"}

Patient characteristics, perioperative complications, and treatment outcomes were assessed by the treating physician. Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien grading system. A total of 5537 eligible patients were entered in the database from November 2007 to December 2009, including 2277 (41.1%) who received balloon dilation and 3260 (58.9%) who received telescopic/serial dilation. The predominant method used was telescopic/serial dilation in Asia (94.7%) and South America (98.0%), and balloon dilation in North America (82.6%). In Europe, the rates of balloon (50.7%) and telescopic/serial (49.3%) dilation procedures were similar. The rates of bleeding (9.4% vs. 6.7%), blood transfusions (7.0% vs. 4.9%), and drop in mean hematocrit level (4.5% vs. 2.5%) were higher in the balloon vs. telescopic/serial dilator group. Clavien scores II and IIIA were slightly in favor of the telescopic/serial dilator group. Median operative time was longer in the balloon dilation group (94.0 min vs. 60.0 min). The Global PCNL Study has identified differences in the method of dilation used between centers in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In the balloon dilation group, a total longer operative time and higher bleeding and transfusion rates were observed. The differences in outcome may be influenced by patient heterogeneity, including previous anticoagulation therapy or surgical procedures, in addition to the number of stones treated and rate of staghorn calculi, which were all higher in the balloon group.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21388242/"}

Na MRI of the kidney has demonstrated the sensitivity to measure the CMSG, providing the normal range in healthy individuals and demonstrating a reduction in CMSG in kidney disease and transplanted kidneys. Studies using Na and H MRI have shown that in humans, skeletal muscle and skin can store sodium without water retention, and that sodium concentrations in muscle and skin increase with advancing age. Recent studies have shown that TSC can be mobilised during haemodialysis, and that skin sodium content links closely to left ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Renal trauma is the most common urogenital trauma in children. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) scale is most commonly used to stratify the severity of injury. There is no consensus in the existing literature with respect to the recovery stage following renal trauma. A survey was constructed by the European Association of Urology (EAU) - Young Academic Urologists (YAU) Pediatric Urology Working Group and then made digitally available on SurveyMonkey. The survey consists of 15 questions exploring relevant factors and timing to start again with mobility and activity. In total 153 people responded, of whom 107 completed the entire survey. The presence of pain and severity of trauma were acknowledged as most important factors to commence mobilization, whereas presence of hematuria was identified as an additional factor for sporting activity. Regardless of severity of trauma a minimum of 90% of respondents recommend return to noncontact sports within 12weeks. For contact sports, a minimum of 33% of respondents advised >12weeks minimum before starting again. A small number of respondents would never allow sporting activities again. The time to allow sporting activity shows high variation among the respondents, some even restricting sporting activities completely.

A total of 194 physicians completed and returned the questionnaire (30%). Overall, 48.2% of practitioners used dilation six or fewer times during the past year; 23.7% reported having used it more than 30 times. Most urologists used dilation for urethral syndrome only (61.1%), although urethral stricture was also a frequently reported condition requiring dilation (29%). Most urologists trained within the past decade (60.9%) reported never offering dilation for urethral syndrome; only 34.2% of the remainder never offered it (P = 0.002).

Rovida (1844-1877) was an Italian physician who graduated in Pavia (1866) and worked in Milan (1868) and Turin (1874), where he ran the Institute of Clinical Medicine at the university. Between 1870 and 1876 Rovida published several studies on the nature of urinary casts, which can still be considered valid today. He distinguished two main types of casts, i.e., \"colorless\" (hyaline) and \"yellowish\" (waxy). By painstaking microscopic observation of the urine, performed mainly by microchemical techniques, and histological examination of the kidneys, he came to the conclusion that both types of casts were produced by tubular cells. In addition, he found that the colorless casts were composed of a unique protein, which was different from any other protein known at the time, and which he called \"cilindrina\" (cylindrine). Instead, Rovida found that the yellowish casts contain a different, ill-defined protein, which was also present in the lateral and basal membrane of the tubular cells. Rovida should be remembered today because his views were much ahead of the prevailing theories of the time, which considered the casts as coagulated fibrin (a view sustained mainly in Germany) or as elements derived from either tubular degeneration or tubular production (a view sustained mainly in the United Kingdom and Sweden); his results concerning the site of production of hyaline casts and their unique nature were confirmed 90 years later, in the early 1960s, when it was demonstrated that these casts are made of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, a protein which is produced by the cells of Henle's loop; and his conclusions about the special nature of waxy casts were also correct. In fact, even though the true composition of these casts is still not yet totally clear, there is now evidence that they contain a substance different from Tamm-Horsfall protein. Rovida is also a paradigm of how the progress of science is strictly dependent on the development of technology. In fact, it was only when appropriate techniques (e.g., electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunofluorescent microscopy) became available that the nature of casts could be defined with certainty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12097757/"}

Eight residents at various training levels utilized a simulator with a camera-operating assistant to practice placing interrupted stitches. The time necessary for completion of an anastomosis and the quality of the anastomosis were documented. The time required to recreate a simulated urethrovesical anastomosis by placing six interrupted stitches declined from an initial mean of 60.75 minutes to 20.5 minutes after each resident had performed 20 anastomoses each. The mean improvement was 39.5 minutes, with one postgraduate year-3 resident demonstrating an improvement of 50 minutes.

The model was specifically developed for a pre-congress course organized as part of the National Pediatric Urology Congress. The course involved a 2-day online theoretical segment followed by hands-on training. Bovine kidneys were chosen for their anatomical resemblance to human kidneys. The kidneys were sourced from a local slaughterhouse, ensuring the intactness of the pelvis, ureters, and perirenal fat. A Modified Larssen solution was used for tissue preservation. The tissue was positioned within a cardboard box, with specific preparation techniques to ensure realism. During the hands-on training, participants utilized a flexible ureterorenoscope for practice. After the course, participants completed an 18-question survey assessing the model and training experience. Twenty-four participants completed the training and survey. Four out of 8 procured kidneys were suitable. The model's cost was 18 euros. Around 87.5% of participants reported increased RIRS confidence. Those with prior course experience rated the model's anatomical resemblance higher (P = .016). No significant difference was observed in feedback on the model's durability or tactile feedback based on prior experience (P >.05). The ex-vivo bovine model provides a promising alternative for RIRS training. While further studies are needed to validate its widespread application, initial feedback suggests it offers a balance between cost-effectiveness and realistic training experience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38942389/"}

Minkowski (1853-1931) on the presence of beta-hydroxybutyric acid in urine and on increased ammonia excretion in urine from patients with diabetic coma. Also it was found that patients with uremia had decreased titratable \"alkali' in blood (R. von Jaksch 1855-1947) and reduced ability to excrete ammonia (W. W. Palmer and L. J. Henderson 1915). Finally, studies by R. F.

The steady-state intratubular pH was measured with pH-sensitive glass microelectrodes and compared with the equilibrium pH calculated from the HCO3- concentration of the tubular fluid (measured with quinhydrone electrodes) and plasma Pco2. In the proximal tubule the intratubular pH and the equilibrium pH were identical, indicating no accumulation of excess H2CO3. After inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, however, intratubular pH was significantly lower (0.85 pH U) than the equilibrium pH. It was concluded that HCO3- reabsorption in the proximal tubule was mediated by H+ secretion, but that carbonic anhydrase located in the luminal membrane of the cell prevented H2CO3 from accumulating in the tubular fluid. In the distal tubule the intratubular pH was 0.85 U lower than the equilibrium pH. This difference could be obliterated by an intravenous injection of carbonic anhydrase. It was concluded that HCO3- reabsorption in this segment was also accomplished by H+ secretion. The accumulation of excess H2CO3 in the tubular fluid indicated that, in contrast to the proximal tubule, carbonic anhydrase was not located in the luminal membrane of distal tubular cells.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9621300/"}

The diagnostic process varied considerably due to a varying choice of diagnostic tests and the large differences in interpreting the qualities described by the tests. The probability that a patient would be offered a treatment within the region was analysed. For many patients the probability that a treatment was chosen was in the vicinity of 50%. No treatment probability was correlated to the symptom score of the patients. While the probability that a transurethral prostatic resection would be offered to the patients within the region was correlated significantly to urodynamic variables, residual urine and to cystoscopy findings, the probability that transurethral microwave or finasteride therapy would be offered was not correlated to any of the described qualities. The costs of the diagnostic process in all the patients incurred by each of the urologists varied by up to 500%. It was estimated that approximately 40% of the costs involved diagnostic tests that did not influence the decision to offer or not to offer treatment.

This method of bedside ultrasonography by physicians in real time is called point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS). Given the limitations of collecting information by routine physical examination in kidney diseases and the simplicity of performing ultrasonography to examine kidney location, architecture, and restricted pathologies, nephrologists that have been lagging in this area, should join the spectrum of clinicians using the POCUS to provide safe and rapid diagnosis of common renal abnormalities.

There is considerable controversy regarding its management. Preservation of kidney function is the main goal of treatment, which necessitates identification of patients requiring early intervention. To present a management approach for VUR based on early risk assessment. A literature search was performed and the data reviewed. From selected papers, data were extracted and analyzed with a focus on risk stratification. The authors recognize that there are limited high-level data on which to base unequivocal recommendations, necessitating a revisiting of this topic in the years to come. There is no consensus on the optimal management of VUR or on its diagnostic procedures, treatment options, or most effective timing of treatment. By defining risk factors (family history, gender, laterality, age at presentation, presenting symptoms, VUR grade, duplication, and other voiding dysfunctions), early stratification should allow identification of patients at high potential risk of renal scarring and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Imaging is the basis for diagnosis and further management. Standard imaging tests comprise renal and bladder ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, and nuclear renal scanning. There is a well-documented link with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD); patients with LUTD and febrile UTI are likely to present with VUR. Diagnosis can be confirmed through a video urodynamic study combined with a urodynamic investigation. Early screening of the siblings and offspring of reflux patients seems indicated. Conservative therapy includes watchful waiting, intermittent or continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, and bladder rehabilitation in patients with LUTD. The goal of the conservative approach is prevention of febrile UTI, since VUR will not damage the kidney when it is free of infection. Interventional therapies include injection of bulking agents and ureteral reimplantation. Reimplantation can be performed using a number of different surgical approaches, with a recent focus on minimally invasive techniques. While it is important to avoid overtreatment, finding a balance between cases with clinically insignificant VUR and cases that require immediate intervention should be the guiding principle in the management of children presenting with VUR.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22698573/"}

Indeed, loop diuretics are the first-line therapy to overcome fluid overload in heart failure patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms of fluid and sodium retention are complex and depend on several neuro-hormonal signals mainly acting on sodium reabsorption along the renal tubule. Consequently, doses and administration modalities of diuretics must be carefully tailored to patients in order to overcome under- or overtreatment. The frequent and tricky development of diuretic resistance depends in part on post-diuretic sodium retention, reduced tubular secretion of the drug, and reduced sodium/chloride sensing. Sodium and chloride depletions have been recently shown to be major factors mediating these processes. Aquaretics and high-saline infusions have been recently suggested in cases of hyponatremic conditions. This review discusses the limitations and strengths of these approaches. Long-term diuretic use may lead to diuretic resistance in cardio-renal syndromes. To overcome this complication intravenous administration of loop diuretics and a combination of different diuretic classes have been proposed. In the presence of hyponatremia, high-saline solutions in addition to loop diuretics might be beneficial, whereas aquaretics require caution to avoid overcorrection.

Despite its status as the gold standard, electron microscopy has significant limitations: it requires laborious sample preparation, works only with very small samples, is mainly qualitative, and is prone to misinterpretation because of section angle bias. In addition, combining imaging and protein staining with antibodies poses a challenge, limiting electron microscopy's integration into routine research and diagnostic workflows. As imaging technology advances, super-resolution microscopy, with an optical resolution below 100 nm, presents a promising alternative for detailed insights into glomerular ultrastructure. This review explores various super-resolution techniques, particularly 3-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, and demonstrates how they can be applied to standard histological sections. The 3-dimensional structured illumination microscopy-based measurement procedure-podocyte exact morphology measurement procedure-offers a novel approach to quantifying podocyte foot process morphology and can detect podocyte foot process changes even before proteinuria is present.

The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of a number of urological conditions in the paediatric population. The aim is to provide practical recommendations for clinical management of these conditions with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. For the guidelines update, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations in the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences. Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with the conditions outlines. The guidelines stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and the importance of shared decision-making with patients and their guardians/caregivers. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of undescended testes, testicular tumours in prepubertal boys, acute scrotum, hypospadias, congenital penile curvature, urinary tract infections, daytime lower urinary tract conditions, urachal remnants, and transitional urology. Part II of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of a number of paediatric urological conditions, with recommendations designed for effective integration into clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40118740/"}

To date, no specific medical treatment exists to specifically target biofilms in the human host. Similarly, the identification of a biofilm has relied upon the analysis of tissue samples with electron microscopy or DNA identification with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Standard culture and sensitivity test is not able to detect a presence of biofilms. Two types of molecular microbial diagnostic testing 'levels' are performed as noted below. In both types of analysis, the microbial DNA is extracted from the patient's sample. The patient report contains information about the pathogenic bacterial and fungal microorganisms detected, bacterial load and resistance genes to different antibiotics. Once the bacteria have been identified antibiotic recommendations are made based on research confirming the effectiveness of treatment. The technique was tested in 112 patients in different areas of urology for prevention and treatment purpose. The clinical application of next generation sequence in different clinical phase I-II trials (acute cystitis in 56 patients, rectal swabs before transrectal prostate biopsy in 32 men, neurogenic bladder in 13 patients, chronic bacterial prostatitis in 17 men) demonstrated that this novel approach extends our knowledge about the microbiome of the urogenital tract in both men and women. DNA sequence has a high sensitivity to detect a bacterial and fungal association with resistant genes to antibiotics revealed allowing to implement a targeted and individual prevention and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) with improved efficacy compared to standard culture and sensitivity technique. The next generation DNA sequence technology enables the discovery of new concepts regarding the role of microorganisms in diseases of the urinary tract with an individualized approach for a more accurate diagnosis, prevention, prophylaxis and treatment of UTI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29900824/"}

Instead, the terms can coexist and be used in their relevant contexts. Cardiologists use \"heart\" and \"cardio\" as appropriate such as \"heart failure\" and \"cardiac care units\" and have not replaced \"cardiovascular\" with \"heartvessel\", for instance. Likewise, in nephrology, we consider that \"chronic kidney disease\" and \"continuous renal replacement therapy\" should coexist.

We call to embrace the terms \"kidney\", \"renal\" and \"nephro\" as they are used in different contexts and ask that scientific and medical journals not impose terminology restrictions for kidney disease and kidney health.

Electronic health record review at an integrated health care network. Factors associated with referral status were identified using Fisher's exact tests, t tests, and multivariable logistic regression. Of 133,913 patients regularly seeing PCPs between October 2017 and September 2019, 1119 had a final eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and were not on renal replacement therapy. Care was provided by 185 PCPs (61 practices). Analyses were restricted to the 97.1% (n = 1087) of patients who were African American or European American. Of these, 54.6% had not been referred to nephrology. Nonreferred patients had higher numbers of PCP visits (P = .004). In contrast, referred patients were younger, were more often African American, and had PCPs at the academic medical center (all P < .0001). Referred patients had more complex medical histories with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, more hospitalizations, and greater numbers of inpatient days (all P < .0001). Analyses restricted to patients with serum creatinine concentration of at least 2 mg/dL yielded similar results.

It is in this context that the Project Group on Kidney and Pregnancy of the Italian Society of Nephrology has drawn up these best practice guidelines, merging a literature review, nephrology expertise and the experience of obstetricians and gynaecologists involved in medically assisted reproduction. Although all medically assisted reproduction techniques can be used for chronic kidney disease patients, caution is warranted. Inducing a twin pregnancy should be avoided; the risk of bleeding, thrombosis and infection should be considered, especially in some categories of patients. In most cases, controlled ovarian stimulation is needed to obtain an adequate number of oocytes for medically assisted reproduction. Women with chronic kidney disease are at high risk of kidney damage in case of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and great caution should be exercised so that it is avoided. The higher risks associated with the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and the consequent risk of chronic kidney disease progression, should likewise be considered if egg donation is chosen. Oocyte cryopreservation should be considered for patients with autoimmune diseases who need cytotoxic treatment. In summary, medically assisted reproduction is an option for chronic kidney disease patients, but the study group strongly advises extensive personalised counselling with a multidisciplinary healthcare team and close monitoring during the chosen medically assisted reproduction procedure and throughout the subsequent pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37354277/"}

The pressure response was characterised by a steep pressure increase simulataneous with the urethral dilation, followed by a decay during the next seconds until a new equilibrium pressure was reached. The pressure decay could be described by a double exponential function in the form Pt = Pequ + P alpha e-t/tau alpha + P beta e-t/tau beta, where Pt represents the pressure at the time t, Pequ represents the pressure at equilibrium, P alpha and P beta express the decline in pressure, and tau alpha and tau beta are time constants. The size of the pressure response proved highly dependent on velocity and size of dilation as well as urethral site of measurement, with the maximum values in the high pressure zone. The time constants, on the other hand, were uninfluenced by these factors. The pressure response represents an integrated stress response from the surrounding tissues which may reflect the visco-elastic properties of the structures involved. The findings indicate that striated muscle fibres are of dominating significance for the pressure response, and the varying size of the response along the urethra is in accordance with the localization of the horseshoe-shaped rhabdosphincter, which quantitatively is the dominating circularly arranged structure around the female urethra. Functionally, the stress response will oppose any dilation, and increasingly with rising size or velocity of dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7780438/"}

A statistical study was made on new outpatients according to the international classification of disease. There were 146 malignant (urogenital) tumors (1.8%). The major diseases of the new outpatients were cystitis (acute or chronic: 20.7%), upper urinary tract stone (18.5%), prostatitis (13.0%), and benign prostatic hypertrophy (11.2%). In males the major diseases were prostatitis, upper urinary tract stone, benign prostatic hypertrophy, balanoposthitis, phimosis and in females they were cystitis, upper urinary tract stone, pyelonephritis, renoptosis, and neurogenic bladder.

The existence of a significant number of affected patients and the recent increase in scientific attention has resulted in various experimental and clinical efforts in order to evaluate the mechanisms controlling the function of urinary tract organs. This review attempts to describe the physiology and pharmacology of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes with special regard to their (potential) use in disorders of the human urogenital tract. The promising clinical data for the orally active phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil, used in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction (MED), has boosted research activities on the significance of the cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP pathway in other genitourinary tract tissues, such as the bladder, prostate, ureter, urethra, as well as female genital tissues. Based on the more extensive understanding of the pathways controlling the function of the male and female urogenital tract, orally administered phosphodiesterase inhibitors are considered a logical and straightforward approach for treating urological diseases. Due to the unending charge to conceive advanced first-line treatments, new therapeutic options taking into consideration the cyclic nucleotide signaling have been introduced or might be launched in the near future. Upcoming strategies will not only focus on the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP cascade but also on compounds modulating signal transduction mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate, as well as combined agents in order to affect multiple peripheral intracellular targets.

Chronology of Spanish publications specialized in urologic topics].", "text": "The history of Spanish urological periodicals, like that of the surgical specialties, encompasses several periods as the specialties emerge, are then defined and finally established. It is difficult to determine precisely when the urological specialty began in Spain, since there were surgeons with some dedication to Urology early in the 19th century. Perhaps it began in 1884, when the first service dedicated to the diseases of the urinary tract was created at the Instituto de Terapéutica Operatoria (Institute of Surgical Therapeutics) of the Hospital de la Princesa in Madrid. Although some periodicals with urological descriptions that date back to an earlier period (1800-1850) can be found, it is widely recognized that regular publication of literature and periodicals on the urinary tract started in the mid-19th century, when 'El Especialista' (The Specialist) first appeared in Madrid in 1859. This was the first non monographic specialized periodical where the section 'Genitourinary Disorders' appeared for the first time together with three other specialties. During this second period, journal names were nonspecific or too comprehensive to the point that other medical fields became indiscernible, but they became more explicit as the specialties became more defined. In 1887, the first issue of 'Gaceta de Enfermedades de los Organos Génito-Urinarios' (Gazette of Diseases of the Genitourinary Organs) was published in Madrid. It was the first Spanish journal dedicated exclusively to urological topics. It ushered in a third period, which can be defined as the period of specialized monographic publications, that concluded in 1911 with the founding of the Asociación Española de Urología (Spanish Urological Society). The present article reviews the historical and bibliographical data concerning the six periodicals that were established during these two latter periods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9133290/"}

The results of the first 23 years were compared with those of the last 7 years. The judgment criteria were professional standards and required care. Ninety-five treatment errors were registered in 1975-2005. From 1975 to 1998 there were 60 such errors (2.6 per year) and from 1999 to 2005 there were 35 (5.0 per year). These errors concerned diagnosis in 14.7% of cases (mainly testicular torsion), indication in 7.5%, and explanations of the surgery in 2.1%. About half the cases (46.3%) applied to surgical technique, especially for injuries to the spermatic cord, urinary bladder, ureter, or urethra. In nearly one third of cases (29.4%), errors were found in postoperative care, concerning especially lesions of the spermatic cord and ureter. There is considerable risk of misjudging or even causing urologic disorders in abdominal and vascular surgery. This applies most strongly to diagnosis, above all for testicular torsion.

Key features of this effort included a pipeline for internal referrals, flexible scheduling, close coordination between the nephrologist and a genetic counselor, and utilization of commercial panel-based testing. Over the first year, we examined the outcomes of genetic testing, the time to return of genetic testing, and out-of-pocket cost to patients. Thirty patients were referred and 23 were evaluated over the course of five clinic sessions. Nineteen patients underwent genetic testing with new diagnoses in nine patients (47%), inconclusive results in three patients (16%), and clearance for kidney donation in two patients (11%). On average, return of genetic results occurred 55 days (range 9-174 days) from the day of sample submission and the average out-of-pocket cost to patients was $155 (range $0-$1623).

A MEDLINE search was performed on UUT-UC using the following terms: urinary tract cancer; urothelial carcinomas; upper urinary tract; molecular markers; renal pelvis; ureter; ureteroscopy; nephroureterectomy; adjuvant treatment; neoadjuvant treatment; recurrence; risk factors and survival. Conservative surgery for low-risk UUT-UCs allows for preservation of the upper urinary renal unit, while sparing the patient the morbidity associated with open surgery. Such surgical strategy might be more appropriate in tumors displaying certain molecular markers: microsatellite instability, E-cadherin, MET, Aurora-A, and Ki-67. These markers could help to identify more candidates to nephron-sparing treatment without compromising the oncologic outcome. Susceptibility means an increase in risk conferred by one or more polymorphisms (allele types) of a given gene or genes, which expose the individual to the genotoxic effects of environmental carcinogens. The variant allele SULT1A1*2 with reduced sulfotransferase activity and the T allele of rs9642880 on chromosome 8q24 enhance the risk of UUT-UCs. If an at-risk genetic profile could be established, it might be possible to prevent urothelial carcinomas in some patients. Surgical practice is gradually moving towards minimally invasive techniques which spare the functional unity of the kidney and urinary tract. The ongoing identification of distinct carcinogenic mechanisms for UUT-UCs might open the way to specific treatments adapted to the molecular pattern of each tumor. The next era might hopefully be that of chemoprevention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793771/"}

The existing simulators for training have drawbacks or are unavailable, so a non-biological simulator was developed to teach the technique of this procedure. To provide the characteristics of the developed non-biological simulator for teaching the RIRS technique and the results of its testing. We have developed a non-biological simulator for teaching the RIRS technique, the main part of which is a quadrangular box of 60 30 cm, having special internal recesses for models of the bladder, ureters and 3D-collecting system, as well as transparent and dark covers. The simulator has three or more pairs of 3D-models of the collecting system. After the insertion of the ureteral access sheath and instructions from an expert urologist at the RIRS, a training session with 15 urologists (10 without experience and 5 with experience in endourology, except for the RIRS) was carried out. Intrarenal navigation with inspection of all groups of calyces was initially performed with the simulator closed with a transparent top, while the trainee looked at the 3D model of the kidney itself. Then the training continued with an opaque top and the physician looked only at the video monitor. Ten navigations were performed on each side. The navigation time from the moment of insertion of the flexible ureteroscope into the renal pelvis was determined. A total of 268 intrarenal navigations were performed (134 on each side). Thirty-two (10.7%) tests were not completed, since 6 and 4 urologists stopped the training on the 8th and 9th tests, showing the minimum navigation time. For all trials, the average navigation time was 155.8+/-92.4 s, and it significantly decreased from 252.6+/-107.0 in the first to 94.5+/-34.0 s in the last attempt (p<0.001). In experienced physicians, the navigation time decreased from 185.0+/-52.4 to 85.6+/-26.8 s (p=0.045), while in inexperienced urologists from 290.5+/-109.6 to 96.7+/-35.4 s (p<0.0001). The experienced urologists demonstrated better results in the initial test compared to the inexperienced group (185.0+/-52.4 s vs. 290.5+/-109.6 s, p=0.037), but after training, the navigation time in the final test did not differ (85.6+/-26.8 s vs. 96.7+/-35.4 s, p=0.984). Our non-biological simulator allows to improve surgical skills in RIRS. The obtained results show that both experienced and inexperienced urologists significantly improve their skills in the navigation in the collecting system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40377549/"}

Databases covered by the search included Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Libraries. Previous guidelines were updated, and levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were assigned. It is strongly recommended to offer pure or hand-assisted laparoscopic/retroperitoneoscopic surgery as the preferential technique for living donor nephrectomy. Decisions on the acceptance of a donor organ should not be based on histological findings alone since this might lead to an unnecessarily high rate of discarded grafts. For ureterovesical anastomosis, a Lich-Gregoir-like extravesical technique protected by a ureteral stent is the preferred technique for minimisation of urinary tract complications. It is also strongly recommended to perform initial rejection prophylaxis with a combination therapy comprising a calcineurin inhibitor (preferably tacrolimus), mycophenolate, steroids, and an induction agent (either basiliximab or anti-thymocyte globulin). The long version of the guidelines is available at the EAU website (http://uroweb.org/guidelines). These abridged EAU guidelines present updated information on the clinical and surgical management of RT for incorporation into clinical practice.

On the first day, all students performed FLS peg-transfer and intracorporeal knot-tying tasks on a pediatric laparoscopic simulator. On the second day, students were randomized to receive either positive or negative comments during the procedure. Task performances, measured by task time and errors, was compared between both groups. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. The difference in execution time between exercises with and without feedback was significantly greater in the group that received negative feedback compared to the group that received positive feedback (p = 0.003). Students who received positive feedback increased their time by a median of 2 s, whereas students who received negative comments increased their time by a median of 34 s.

The PubMed® and Embase® databases were searched for publications on urolithiasis, its treatment, and the risk of chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease and nephrectomy in stone formers. In general, renal stone formers have twice the risk of chronic kidney disease or end stage renal disease, and for female and overweight stone formers the risk is even higher. Patients with frequent urinary tract infections, struvite stones, urinary malformations and diversions, malabsorptive bowel conditions and some monogenic disorders are at high risk for chronic kidney disease/end stage renal disease. Shock wave lithotripsy or minimally invasive urological interventions for stones do not adversely affect renal function. Declines in renal function generally occur in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease or a large stone burden requiring repeated and/or complex surgery. Although the effect size is modest, urolithiasis may cause chronic kidney disease and, thus, it is mandatory to assess patients with renal stones for the risk of chronic kidney disease/end stage renal disease.

{"id": "6353735", "title": "History of cystometry.", "text": "Looking back on the changes in the conceptualization of micturition and the development of cystometry, it is reasonable to arrive at several conclusions. Considering their poor technical equipment, Budge's and Goltz's neurophysiologic observations in the 19th century were impressive. The pontine center for micturition, found by Budge, was later confirmed, by Barrington, to have a facilitating and coordinating function. Goltz's demonstration that micturition could be partially accomplished by a spinal reflex was unfortunately given too little attention by clinicians practicing cystometry in the beginning of this century. Dubois' careful pioneering investigations of bladder pressure, and Mosso and Pellacani's studies in bladder motility were outstanding. From Born's and Genouville's contributions, continuously recordable filling cystometry was developed as early as the end of the last century. However, due to a fixation on \"bladder tone\" and the concept of \"crossed innervation\" by succeeding investigators, development of cystometry was at a standstill for almost forty years before gradually attaining its modern interpretation. Compared to our century, it is striking how carefully all investigators from the 19th century cited each other and knew about each other's work. This was possible, in spite of poor communication, because of the small number of investigators involved in studies of bladder function. Although cystometry today is quite informative in many cases, two main points, the presence of detrusor contraction reflex and the patient's capacity to suppress its occurrence, are still highly dependent on the technique used and the subject's cooperation. The more complicated urodynamic investigations flourishing during the last fifteen years have been met with the same uncertainty as the preceding ones since they are partially or completely dependent on patient compliance. Frequently, findings in the laboratory do not relate to the clinical situation. Hopefully, future development of monitoring of bladder-urethral function and the use of neurophysiologic electrodiagnostic methods will reduce these difficulties. The authors believe that modern cystometry began in the 1950s, and that discussion of this period and up to the present is more appropriately the subject of a review on modern methodologies.

In urology, in particular, new fields of application are continuously emerging, which are being studied both in preclinical basic research and in clinical applications. Potential applications include image recognition in the operating room or interpreting images from radiology and pathology, the automatic measurement of urinary stones and radiotherapy. Certain medical devices, particularly in the field of AI-based predictive biomarkers, have already been incorporated into international guidelines. In addition, AI is playing an increasingly more important role in administrative tasks and is expected to lead to enormous changes, especially in the outpatient sector. For urologists, it is becoming increasingly more important to engage with this technology, to pursue appropriate training and therefore to optimally implement AI into the treatment of patients and in the management of their practices or hospitals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40553373/"}

However, no urological study has raised the question, what are barriers or reasons for this nonadherence, yet. Consequently, we performed a survey among German urologists with the primary endpoint identification of barriers for nonadherence to German guidelines on UTI. A 19-item questionnaire was developed and transferred to the online portal \"Survey Monkey®\" (Private Equity, San Mateo, CA, USA) and tested for usability by our study group. The link for the survey was sent twice to the members of the German Society of Urology (DGU). Overall, 307 questionnaires were completed. The mean age of the study population was 46.7 years (standard deviation 11.5). The majority (34.9%) followed guidelines in 80% of the cases. Main reasons for nonadherence on the physicians' side were 23.4% personal experience and lacking practicality of UTI guidelines on the individual complex patient. On the open questions urologists mostly stated (11.7%) that the main reason on the physician side for nonadherence is ignorance. Therefore they, in open questions, suggest to promote guidelines more in meetings and more designed practically with shortcuts and simple layout. Patient-associated factors mentioned were mostly in 26.7%. Furthermore, German urologists stated that guidelines should also have a patient section, where the main recommendations are explained in plain language. We performed the first survey on identifying barriers for nonadherence to guidelines in urology. Despite some limitations, our results are very important for the further design of guidelines. This has the potential to improve guideline adherence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30623216/"}

Infrastructure that permits the integration of clinical data, patient biospecimens and advanced technologies is required for institutions to contribute to, and benefit from research in molecular disease classification and to devise specific and patient-oriented treatments. We describe the establishment of the Biobank for the Molecular Classification of Kidney Disease (BMCKD) at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The BMCKD consists of a fully equipped wet laboratory, an information technology infrastructure, and a formal operational, ethical and legal framework for banking human biospecimens and storing clinical data. The BMCKD first consolidated a large retrospective cohort of kidney biopsy specimens to create a population-based renal pathology database and tissue inventory of glomerular and other kidney diseases. The BMCKD will continue to prospectively bank all kidney biopsies performed in Southern Alberta. The BMCKD is equipped to perform molecular, clinical and epidemiologic studies in renal pathology. The BMCKD also developed formal biobanking procedures for human specimens such as blood, urine and nucleic acids collected for basic and clinical research studies or for advanced diagnostic technologies in clinical care. The BMCKD is guided by standard operating procedures, an ethics framework and legal agreements with stakeholders that include researchers, data custodians and patients. The design and structure of the BMCKD permits its inclusion in a wide variety of research and clinical activities. The BMCKD is a core multidisciplinary facility that will bridge basic and clinical research and integrate precision medicine into renal pathology and nephrology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28747168/"}

However, over the past 30 years, PRB has transitioned from a procedure performed only by nephrologists to interventional radiologists (IRs). We surveyed practicing nephrologists completing training in our program to determine the clinical practice patterns of PRB. The 78 fellows completing the nephrology program at Rush University Medical Center from June 1984 through June 2017 were successfully contacted and surveyed regarding their opinion on adequacy of their training and whether they performed PRB in practice and if not or no longer, why. To evaluate for differences in the performance of PRB over time, a comparison of 4 periods of fellowship completion (i.e., 1984-1990, 1991-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2017) was performed. All 78 nephrologists felt they had been adequately trained to perform PRB. PRB was performed by 45 (58%) nephrologists post-fellowship, but a significant decline was observed over the 4 periods of time from 1984 to 2017 (100 vs. 86 vs. 52 vs. 20%, p < 0.0001). The primary reason that 33 nephrologists did not perform PRB was that it was too time consuming and IR was available to perform PRB. Of the 71 nephrologists still in practice only 12 (17%) continue to perform PRB. A greater proportion of nephrologists completing training from 1984-1990 continue to perform PRB relative to those trained after 1990. The universal reason that nephrologists were no longer performing PRB was again an issue of time and the fact that IRs were available to perform PRB. We find that there has been a significant transition over time in the performance of PRB by a nephrologist to IR. The major reason for this is the time burden associated with PRB and the availability of IRs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30355906/"}

We examined factors that could increase the error rate and measuring techniques to decrease measurement errors. We also reviewed the training effects of measurement for a year. Actual measured values in all patients correlated well with the average value of 3 measurements after a trial of BVI6100 in male mode. The correlation coefficient was 0.941 (0.967 after a year), the mean +/- SD error rate was -2.0% +/- 22.0% (-2.0% +/- 13.8% after a year) and the average variation coefficient was 12.4 (7.6 after a year). It was found that measurement results using the BVI6100 were influenced by patient factors, including extracted edges between the bladder wall and urine, thickened bladder wall, irregular bladder wall, flattened bladder, mistaking the prostate for the bladder in male mode, mistaking the bladder for the uterus in female mode, etc, and examiner factors, including changes in the angle between the BVI6100 and the abdominal wall, compatibility between the abdominal wall and the ultrasound probe, controlling deflection while using the probe, etc. It was also found that measurement accuracy could be improved regarding patient and examiner factors by choosing appropriate patients and performing concise measurement procedures (training effects).

Synthesizing progress to illuminate the future.", "text": "This review will summarize and synthesize recent findings in regard to monogenic kidney disorders, including how that evidence is being translated into practice. It will add to existing key knowledge to provide context for clinicians in consolidating existing practice and approaches. Whilst there are long established factors, which indicate increased likelihood of identifying a monogenic cause for kidney disease, these can now be framed in terms of the identification of new genes, new indications for genomic testing and new evidence for clinical utility of genomic testing in nephrology. Further, inherent in the use of genomics in nephrology are key concepts including robust informed consent, variant interpretation and return of results. Recent findings of variants in genes related to complex or broader kidney phenotypes are emerging in addition to understanding of de novo variants. Phenocopy phenomena are indicating a more pragmatic use of broader gene panels whilst evidence is emerging of a role in unexplained kidney disease. Clinical utility is evolving but is being successfully demonstrated across multiple domains of outcome and practice. We provide an updated framework of evidence to guide application of genomic testing in chronic kidney disease (CKD), building upon existing principles and knowledge to indicate how the practice and implementation of this can be applied today. There are clearly established roles for genomic testing for some patients with CKD, largely those with suspected heritable forms, with these continuing to expand as new evidence emerges.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36093902/"}

We studied the effect of a urology point-of-care US module on the performance of questions designed to assess clinical reasoning in urinary tract obstruction and voiding dysfunction. All second-year medical students at the University of Saskatchewan (Regina [n = 36] and Saskatoon [n = 61]) were enrolled in the study. Each cohort participated in the urology point-of-care US module concurrently with its Foundations in the Kidney and Urinary Tract course. The Regina cohort completed the point-of-care US module 1 week before the Saskatoon cohort, thus allowing for a control-intervention comparison of script concordance question scores to evaluate the effect that the urology point-of-care US module had on clinical reasoning skills. Secondary outcomes included program evaluation metrics, such as overall course performance, urology point-of-care US objective structured clinical examination performance, and student course evaluation data. The introduction of the urology point-of-care US module was not associated with a deterioration in scores on script concordance questions. There were no statistically significant differences between the Regina and Saskatoon students in their responses to the script concordance questions. There were statistically significant increases in student self-reported achievement of learning objectives, with the effect size being medium to large (Cohen d, 0.5-0.8). Point-of-care US training complements standard undergraduate classroom teaching of urology. Students effectively learned the skills to apply point-of-care US in their assessment of patients, and this process did not interfere with achieving the course objectives.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29476563/"}

New roles of NO have been proposed recently in diabetes, nephrotoxicity, and pregnancy. NO derived from all 3 NOS isoforms contributes to the overall regulation of kidney function, and recent advances in our understanding of their regulation have been made lately. In this regard, substrate and cofactor availability play important roles in regulating nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity not only by limiting enzyme activity but also by influencing the coupling of NOS with its cofactors, tetrahydrobiopterin and NADPH. Protein-protein interactions are now recognized to be important negative and positive regulators of NOS. Phosphorylation is another component of the mechanism whereby NOS is activated or deactivated. Increased NOS expression can also influence enzyme activity; however, the degree of expression does not always correlate with enzyme activity because increased NO levels can result in inhibition of NOS. Finally, other potential regulators of NOS such as endogenous L-arginine analogs may also be important. In this article, we summarize recent advances in the regulation of activity and expression of the NOS isoforms within the kidney.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15753231/"}

Students prioritized statements related to their understanding of renal physiology, learning preferences, preferred course characteristics, perceived clinical relevance of renal physiology, and interest in nephrology as a career. By-person factor analysis was performed using the centroid method. Three dominant factors were strongly defined by learning preferences: \"readers\" prefer using notes, a textbook, and avoid lectures; \"social-auditory learners\" prefer attending lectures, interactivity, and working with peers; and \"visual learners\" prefer studying images, diagrams, and viewing materials online. A smaller, fourth factor represented a small group of students with a strong predisposition against renal physiology and nephrology.

Findings of a Systematic Qualitative Review.", "text": "When treating patients with kidney failure, unavoidable ethical issues often arise. Current clinical practice guidelines some of them, but lack comprehensive information about the full range of relevant ethical issues in kidney failure. A systematic literature review of such ethical issues supports medical professionalism in nephrology, and offers a solid evidential base for efforts that aim to improve ethical conduct in health care. To identify the full spectrum of clinical ethical issues that can arise for patients with kidney failure in a systematic and transparent manner. A systematic review in Medline (publications in English or German between 2000 and 2014) and Google Books (with no restrictions) was conducted. Ethical issues were identified by qualitative text analysis and normative analysis. The literature review retrieved 106 references that together mentioned 27 ethical issues in clinical care of kidney failure. This set of ethical issues was structured into a matrix consisting of seven major categories and further first and second-order categories. The systematically-derived matrix helps raise awareness and understanding of the complexity of ethical issues in kidney failure. It can be used to identify ethical issues that should be addressed in specific training programs for clinicians, clinical practice guidelines, or other types of policies dealing with kidney failure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26938863/"}

Sociodemographic, clinical and resource use data for the 6 months prior to study inclusion were collected. Additionally, through a theoretical clinical case, clinicians described their attitude toward the diagnostic and therapeutic management of males with mixed LUTS and persisting storage symptoms during the first and second visits. Answer options given to clinicians about LUTS management were aligned with those recommended by EAU guidelines. 610 patients included in the study were evaluated. 87.7% of them consumed some health resource mainly due to: urologist visits (79.7%), PSA determination (76.6%) and treatment with alpha-blockers (37.5%) and alpha-blockers plus antimuscarinics (37.2%). According to the theoretical clinical case, urologists preference toward diagnostic tools and pharmacological treatment in first visit were mainly PSA determination (97.7%), digital rectal examination (91.4%) and treatment with alphablockers as monotherapy (56.6%), whereas in the second visit uroflowmetry (48.9%), voiding diary (40.3%) and treatment with alpha-blockers plus antimuscarinics (70.6%) were mainly preferred.

Our program is performed on a pelvic trainer with a videolaparoscopic unit and consists of passage of a ligature, intracorporal knotting, intracorporal suturing, linear anastomosis and circular running suture anastomosis. The trainees performed the first 3 tasks during the initial lessons and then advanced to the 2 final tasks. At the end of each lesson time was recorded and progression curve was plotted for each participant for each task. The end point of the study was participant ability to perform an accurate circular anastomosis. Logarithmic regression analysis was used to assess the significance of progression. All 10 urologists who participated in this study showed a rapid and significant decrease in the time required to perform the first 3 tasks accurately. The participants were able to perform a linear anastomosis after 3 to 5 lessons and an accurate circular anastomosis after 5 to 10 lessons. By using this model and dividing a complicated surgical step to simplified tasks, we were able to improve trainee performance significantly in a short time.

US identifies 90% of fetal kidneys by 20 weeks of gestational age. Kidney weight and volume at birth are approximately only 10% of the mature kidney. Kidney growth is most rapid during the first few weeks of life, with the kidney length increasing by as much as 15-20% in full-term neonates. There is a good correlation between relative function shown by scintigraphy and relative volume estimated from sonography. The most accurate measurement of kidney size is provided by kidney volume, which is correlated with subject's height, weight, and total body area. Kidney length is the most easily reproduced. Kidney volume is a better approximation of size than length because of the shape of the kidney varies considerably, but it is technically more demanding and needs four measurements in two different planes. It has been shown that in normal adult kidneys, the sonography measurements of kidney length differ by values of between about 1 cm and 1.85 cm in 95% of the cases, irrespective of whether the measurements are performed by the same or by different sonographers.

From the very beginning of its existence, the municipal hospital was constantly in the process of extension and rebuilding. A hospital base was set up and new departments and clinics were opened. In 1937, the number of the hospital beds had increased to 1,004. The official existence of an independent urology department with 30 beds, first headed by Dr. Felix Hagen (1880-1962), dates back to March 1919. The aim of this new department was to carry out examinations and differential diagnoses, together with the department of internal medicine, for those patients from the urological surgery sector including evaluation for surgery. Surgical urology was the responsibility of the surgery department. The remaining cases requiring urological experience, such as those involving transurethral intervention, diseases of the bladder and urinary tract infection, were treated in the new urology department. As an auxiliary department, de facto dependent on the departments of surgery and internal medicine, urology could not develop properly and survive. In October 1935, the position of the head of the urological department was terminated, and urology was incorporated into the department of surgery. During the Second World War, between 1939 and 1945, as during the World War 1, a field hospital was set up in the municipal hospital at Pommerensdorf in Stettin.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15338136/"}

If Aerococcus sp. is now well known, Actinobaculum sp., Alloscardovia sp. and Trueperella sp. remain rarely isolated and unknown from clinicians. Importance of these germs could be underestimated because of the identifying and isolation difficulties which existed beforehand. They are particularly found in a population of elderly people with underlying conditions or urological risk factors of urinary tract infection. Actinobaculum schaalii is also found more frequently in young children. Aerococcus sp. et A. schaalii are true uropathogens not to be underestimated.

The most important cost factor within the total cost is the treatment of recurrent, non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) improves the early detection rate of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, especially the detection of carcinoma in situ and severe dysplasia. PDD also reduces the number of residual tumors after TUR-B compared to white-light guided TUR-B and also the early recurrence rate although long-term outcome with hexylaminolaevulinic acid with regards to the general course of bladder cancer is still lacking. PDD has been used mainly for detection of bladder cancer and specifically carcinoma in situ in conjunction with diagnostic and therapeutic transurethral resection of the bladder. In 2006 hexylaminolaevulinic acid (HAL) was approved in the EU (EMEA) as a photosensitizer for the use in photodynamic diagnosis of the bladder. Several guidelines have incorporated PDD as optional form of diagnosis during endoscopy in proven or suspected bladder cancer, but no specific recommendations regarding indication and application of PDD exist. The German group of urologic oncology (AKO) invited urologists and biologists involved in the development of hexylaminolaevulinic acid as well its clinical use to participate in evaluating the data for HAL and its predecessor delta-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA). A consensus with regards to the indications, contraindications, technique, pre-clinical data, comparison of HAL and 5-ALA, current results, costs and follow-up was reached and are presented in this paper.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18587549/"}

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the Sysmex UF-1000i analyser for the rapid prediction of UTIs in hospitalized patients with or without indwelling catheters at a comprehensive teaching hospital that encounters complex disease types. Urine specimens (n = 1016) were cultured and examined for WBC, RBC, bacteria (BACT) and yeast-like cell (YLC) count using the Sysmex UF-1000i. The results were compared with the urine culture results. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to determine BACT and YLC cutoff values for bacterial and fungal UTIs independently. The diagnostic ability of the UF-1000i was also compared for patients with and without indwelling catheters. A cutoff value of 38.7/μL was acceptable for ruling out bacterial UTIs. In this setting, we achieved a sensitivity of 90%, a negative predictive value of 94.5%, a false negative rate of 2.85% (29 cases), and avoided culturing in 52% of the samples. The BACT count presented a larger area under the curve for patients with indwelling catheters than for those without (0.939 vs. 0.861); however, no significant difference in the diagnostic ability of the two curves was found.

Renal parenchymal area, hydronephrosis area (HA), PHAR, anteroposterior diameter (APd), and SFU grade were captured at baseline and most recent visit. Data were analyzed based on the need for surgical intervention to address obstruction. Out of 193 infants (159 boys; 135 left side), 58 (30%) underwent surgery. Patients managed surgically compared with those managed nonsurgically had worse baseline HN severity markers: SFU grade (3.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.1 ± 0.4; P <.001), urinary tract dilation classification (2.7 ± 0.5 vs 2.2 ± 0.4; P <.001), APd (20.3 ± 10.1 vs 12.8 ± 8.0; P <.001), HA (10.0 ± 6.6 vs 4.7 ± 2.8; P <.001), and PHAR (1.3 ± 1.0 vs 3.0 ± 2.9; P <.001); but both patient groups had similar renal parenchymal area (9.4 ± 3.5 vs 9.7 ± 2.8; P = .5).

The aim of the cooperative project between the pediatric nephrology units of Milan, Italy, and Managua, Nicaragua was to improve the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases and CKD in Nicaraguan children. When the project started, in 2000, there were many constraints in human and material resources in the Children's Hospital in Managua. Since 2001, a specialized Unit of Pediatric Nephrology and Urology has developed, offering free of charge basic clinical assistance to hospitalized children, and training abroad of the whole staff. Shared protocols, renovation of infrastructure and an information technology (IT) program were implemented. In 2003, renal replacement therapy (RRT) for selected children was initiated, along with a network of six department hospitals in 2005 and, in 2007, a CKD prevention program in the most peripheral Health Units, so that 61% of the Nicaraguan pediatric population is now covered by the project. To ensure implementation of the project, applications for funds to Italian private and public institutions were made and a Nicaraguan charity foundation was activated. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and the hospital directors were always involved in the plans of the development of the project and accepted the progressive transfer of the costs to the government, throughout the 9-year duration of the project. The IT program, inclusive of a database of children with kidney and other urinary tract (UT) diseases and a web connection between Milan and Managua, was crucial in monitoring the activities and providing epidemiological data, in order to better allocate resources. The clinical activities and the number of children managed in Managua in 2008 are similar to those of pediatric nephrology units worldwide and depict the level of clinical autonomy achieved.

We report on the use of hand-held personal digital assistants (PDA's) to document all clinical and academic activities of urology residents at one academic institution. Software was developed to create customized pick lists allowing residents to record all activities on their individual PDA's. Categories included Adult Ambulatory, Pediatric Ambulatory, Adult operative, Pediatric operative, and Academic. Activities were subcategorized into detailed pick lists and time-tracking fields. Residents synchronized with a central database on a standalone hotsync server. In the first 8 months, 21 178 resident-hours and 5333 activities were recorded. Preliminary observations can be made regarding how residents spend the majority of their time: 28% operative, 20% self-study, 19% ward work, 10% Academics, 6% ER consultations, 5% clinic, and 4% inpatient consultations. The most common adult diagnoses encountered while attending to clinic, ward, or ER consultations were lower urinary tract symptoms, urolithiasis and hematuria. Similarly for Pediatrics: neurogenic bladder, antenatal hydronephrosis, infection, and hypospadias were most often reported. Residents reported 5,333 activities, relating to the following spheres of Urology: academics (23%), endourology (18%), oncology (15%), lower urinary tract symptoms (10%), congenital anomalies (5%), urolithiasis (5%), reconstruction (5%), and infection (3%). This tool provides an objective assessment of resident experience as it relates to selection of rotations, and for addressing curriculum weaknesses.

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences. Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence. This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice. The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections.

This study evaluates the ability of urology trainees to learn basic pelvic anatomy and sling assessment on TUS. Eight urology trainees (six residents and two medical students) received a lecture reviewing basic anatomy and sling assessment on TUS followed by review of two training cases. Next, they underwent a 126-question examination assessing their ability to identify anatomic planes and structures in those planes, identify the presence of slings, and assess the location and intactness of a sling. The correct response rate was compared to that of an attending radiologist experienced in reading TUS. Non-parametric tests (Fisher's exact, chi-squared tests, and Yates correction) were used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant. 847/1008 (84.0%) of questions were answered correctly by eight trainees compared to 119/126 (94.4%) by the radiologist (P = 0.001). The trainees' correct response rates and Fisher's exact test P values associated with the difference in correct answers between radiologist and trainee were as follows: identification of anatomic plane (94.4%; P = 0.599), identification of structure in sagittal view (80.6%; P = 0.201), identification of structure in transverse view (88.2%; P = 0.696), presence of synthetic sling (95.8%; P = 1.000), location of sling along the urethra in (71.5%; P = 0.403), intactness of sling (82.6%; P = 0.311), and laterality of sling disruption (75.0%; P = 0.076).

Recurrent and de novo hemolytic uremic syndrome occur after renal transplantation. Relapses are also common and probably reflect incomplete resolution of the initial episode. The major differential diagnoses of hemolytic uremic syndrome in the renal allograft include acute vascular rejection, cyclosporine, FK506 or antilymphocyte antibody nephrotoxicity, and malignant hypertension, all of which may display overlapping clinical and histologic features with primary hemolytic uremic syndrome; in such instances, the exact diagnosis may be quite difficult.

Even more important, the practical value of a classification is proved by the ability of providing elements that guide therapeutic decisions and can be used in the follow-up of the patient. With these aims, new histologic classification systems have been proposed in the last decade for lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy under the leadership of the Renal Pathology Society and the International Society of Nephrology. These classifications have gained a significant level of worldwide acceptance and have been the subject of multiple single-center and multicenter validation studies, which have underpinned their clinical benefits and limitations and served to highlight remaining questions and difficulties of interpretation of the biopsy sample. More recently, a classification system has also been proposed for ANCA-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis (ANCA-GN), although the validation process for this is still in an early stage. In this review, we examine in some detail the ISN/RPS classification for lupus nephritis and the Oxford classification for IgA nephropathy, with emphasis on clinicopathologic correlations, their value for and evolving impact on clinical studies and clinical practice, and their significant limitations in this regard as exposed by validation studies.

In immunosuppression, the newer drugs now used in organ transplantation (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil) can also be used in the treatment of glomerulonephritis. In nonspecific supportive treatment, angiotensin II receptor antagonists are now used in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Positive effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on the nephrotic syndrome have not yet been proven. Cyclooxygenase II inhibitors must be tested but probably have too many renal side effects, similar to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Heparinoids or glycosaminoglycans serve as polyanions and thus have protective effects on the negative charge of the glomerular basement membrane. They can now be administered as oral medications. The removal of a supposed glomerular basement membrane toxic factor that induces proteinuria has been attempted for 20 yr and now is usually performed using immunoadsorption. Especially in cases of recurrent nephrotic syndrome after renal transplantation for patients with glomerulonephritis, this approach has been successful in decreasing proteinuria, although in most cases its effect is not lasting but must be continuously renewed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11251031/"}

We considered challenges to continuing the predominantly lower urinary tract dysfunction centric approach that has dominated previous research of lower urinary tract symptoms. We developed a new, comprehensive framework for urology research that includes a broader set of potential factors contributing to lower urinary tract symptoms. This framework aims to broaden research to consider a comprehensive set of potential contributing factors and to engage a broad range of researchers in the investigation of as many extra-lower urinary tract factors as possible, with the goal of improving clinical care and prevention. We propose a new framework for future urology research, which should help to reduce the medical and economic burden of lower urinary tract symptoms in the United States population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27341750/"}

Despite technological advances in making flexible ureteroscopes smaller, they suffer from a grainy image. Therefore, new technology with better resolution is needed. The new Invisio DUR-D digital flexible ureteroscope from Gyrus ACMI was tested. The tip houses dual LED-driven light carriers, which obviates the need for an external light source, thus eliminating the risk of drape fires and patient burns. A 1-mm digital camera at the tip eliminates the need for fragile low-resolution fiberoptics and provides superior resolution. Since there are no external cameras or light cables, the DUR-D is much lighter (505 g compared with 1012 g). Laser detection system deactivates the laser to prevent accidental misfiring of the laser within the ureteroscope. The latest generation of digital ureteroscopes provides superior resolution and safety. Long term use is needed to test its durability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419206/"}

In this article, we present the findings of the American Board of Urology's P/C objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which was implemented on the 2023 and 2024 certifying examinations. The certifying examination was administered to 694 candidates (335 in 2023 and 359 in 2024). Each candidate was administered two 5-item OSCEs and four 10-item standard oral examinations (SOEs). One OSCE focused on P/C with simulated patient (SP) actors and one on diagnosis/imaging. SP actors interacted with examinees on the 10-minute P/C OSCE. A criterion-referenced standard was used for pass/fail decisions, and the Rasch model was used for scoring. The candidate's mean score and protocol difficulty did not differ significantly from 2023 to 2024. Reliability with the P/C and diagnostic OSCEs was similar both years. In 2023, the diagnostic OSCE had a higher average score than the P/C OSCE, with both OSCEs scoring higher than the SOEs. In 2024, the average diagnostic OSCE score was higher than that of the P/C OSCE and SOEs, which had similar scores. There was low correlation between the OSCEs and SOEs both years. The initial experience of P/C OSCEs on the American Board of Urology certification examination showed acceptable scoring, reliability, and low correlation with standard protocols. Initial data suggest that the P/C OSCE is a distinct construct from SOEs that specifically assesses P/C skills in the oral certification process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40042498/"}

Hence, we analyzed the tubulointerstitial lesions in patients with lupus nephritis within the different classes and subclasses of the 2003 ISN/RPS system. Among 313 patients from five centers in northern China with lupus nephritis, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were severe in 170 patients with class IV, moderate in 55 with class III, and mild in 19 with class II and in 69 with class V disease, each with significance. The severity of tubulointerstitial lesions in classes IV-segmental and III was similar, whereas the score of interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration in patients with subclass IV-global was significantly higher than that in those with subclass IV-segmental. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were each significantly more prominent in patients with both active and chronic lesions than in those with active lesions alone. The correlation coefficient ranged from 0.222 to 0.811 comparing glomerular and tubulointerstitial indices. In multivariate Cox hazard analysis of tubulointerstitial lesions, indices of interstitial infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were confirmed as significant independent risk factors for renal outcome. Thus, we found that the 2003 ISN/RPS classification system of lupus nephritis, based on glomerular lesions, could also reflect related tubulointerstitial lesions. Hence, we suggest that the extent of tubulointerstitial lesions may be helpful in predicting renal outcome in patients with lupus nephritis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182417/"}

The project was carried out in phases: a systematic literature review generating key questions, surveys sent to Live Surgery Panel members, and Internet- and panel-based consensus finding using the Delphi process to agree on and formulate a policy. The EAU will endorse LSEs, provided that the EAU Code of Conduct for live surgery and all organisational requirements are followed. Outcome data must be submitted to an EAU Web-based registry and complications reported using the revised Martin criteria. Regular audits will take place to evaluate compliance as well as the educational role of live surgery. This policy represents the consensus view of an expert panel established to advise the EAU. The EAU recognises the educational role of live surgery and endorses live case demonstration at urologic meetings that are conducted within a clearly defined regulatory framework. The overriding principle is that patient safety must take priority over all other considerations in the conduct of live surgery. Controversy exists regarding the true educational value of live surgical demonstrations on patients at surgical meetings. An EAU committee of experts developed a policy on how best to conduct live surgery at urologic meetings. The key principle is to ensure safety for every patient, including a code of conduct and checklist for live surgery, specific rules for how the surgery is organised and performed, and how each patient's results are reported to the EAU.

Twelve urologists involved in a cadaveric fURS training course were enrolled into this prospective study. All the participants were inexperienced in fURS. Theoretical lectures and step-by-step tips and tricks video presentations on fURS were used to incorporate the technical background of the procedure to the hands-on-training course and to standardize the operating steps of the procedure. An 8-item survey was administered to the participants upon initiation and at the end of the course. Pre- and post-training scores were similar for each question. All the participants successfully completed the hands-on-training tasks. Mean pre-training duration [3.56 ± 2.0 min (range 1.21-7.46)] was significantly higher than mean post-training duration [1.76 ± 1.54 min (range 1.00-6.34)] (p = 0.008). At the end of the day, the trainers checked the integrity of the collecting system both by endoscopy and by fluoroscopy and could not detect any injury of the upper ureteral wall or pelvicalyceal structures. The functionality of the scopes was also checked, and no scope injury (including a reduction in the deflection capacity) was noted. The fURS simulation training model using soft human cadavers has the unique advantage of perfectly mimicking the living human tissues.

A broad literature search was performed for each condition. Recommendations were developed and rated as strong or weak on the basis of the quality of the evidence, the benefit/harm ratio, and potential patient preferences. Recommendations for perioperative management include points related to fasting, premedication, antibiotic prophylaxis, pain control, and thromboprophylaxis in patients requiring general anaesthesia. MIS use is increasing in paediatric urology, with no major differences observed among different MIS approaches. For hydrocele, observation is the initial approach recommended. For persistent cases, treatment varies according to the type of hydrocele. CLUTO cases should be managed in tertiary centres with multidisciplinary expertise in prenatal and postnatal management. Neonatal valve ablation remains the mainstay of treatment, but associated bladder dysfunction requires continuous treatment. Among urological traumas and emergencies, renal trauma is still an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Conservative management has become the standard approach in haemodynamically stable children. Ischaemic priapism is a medical emergency and requires stepwise management. Initial management of nonischaemic priapism is conservative. Fertility preservation in prepubertal children and adolescents has become an increasingly relevant issue owing to the ever-increasing number of cancer survivors receiving gonadotoxic therapies. A major limitation is the scarcity of relevant literature. This summary of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of some paediatric urological conditions. We provide a summary of the updated European Association of Urology/European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines on paediatric urology.

Only a minority of urologists perform specific lower urinary tract cultures. Although many Chinese urologists (64.6%) considered CP to be nonbacterial in nature, many (74.0%) still chose antibiotics as the first choice of therapy. Most urologists said they would prescribe antibiotics when bacterial culture was positive (64.4%), or when excessive leukocytes and/or pyocytes were present in expressed prostate secretions (65.9%). The second most commonly used pharmaceutical therapy was alpha-blockers (60.3%), which were prescribed by most urologists (70.3%) to relieve the obstructive voiding symptoms.

These guidelines are adapted from the Male Urethral Stricture : American Urological Association Guideline 2016, updated by an additional bibliography from January 2016 to December 2019. Twenty-seven main scenarios seen in clinical practice are identified: from diagnosis, to treatment and follow-up. In addition, this guidelines are powered by anatomical diagrams, treatment algorithms, summaries and follow-up tables. Anterior urethral strictures are a common condition (0,1 à 1,4 %) in men. The diagnosis is based on a trifecta including an examination with patient reported questionnaires, urethroscopy and retrograde urethrography with voiding cystourethrography. Short meatal stenosis can be treated by dilation or meatotomy, otherwise a urethroplasty can be performed. First line treatment of penile strictures is urethroplasty. Short bulbar strictures (<2cm) may benefit from endourethral treatment (direct visual internal urethrotomy or dilation). In case of recurrence or when the stenosis measures more than 2 cm, a urethroplasty will be proposed. Repeated endourethral treatment management are no longer recommended except in case of palliative option. Urethroplasty is usually done with oral mucosa graft as the primary option, in one or two stages approach depending on the extent of the stenosis and the quality of the tissues. Excision and primary anastomosis or non-transecting techniques are discussed for bulbar urethra strictures. Follow-up by clinical monitoring with urethroscopy, or retrograde urethrography with voiding cystourethrography, is performed at least the first year and then on demand according to symptoms. Anterior urethral strictures need an open surgical approach and should be treated by urethroplasty in most cases. This statement requires a major paradigm shift in practices.

Medical evidence supports that these skills can be learned outside the operating room (OR). The aim of the current study was to describe the first laparoscopic simulator for ureteral reimplantation (LAP-SPUR) following Lich- Gregoir technique. LAP-SPUR was manufactured using reusable and disposable materials. The technique can be summarized in the following five steps: (1) a transperitoneal approach; (2) extra-vesical ureteral dissection; (3) detrusor division until exposing the mucosa; (4) reimplanting ureter into the new tunnel; and (5) reapproximation and suturing of the detrusor. LAP-SPUR was evaluated through a survey answered by urologists and surgeons. A 5-point Likert scale was employed for most items and the medians test was chosen to compare the response among physicians according to the number of laparoscopic surgical procedures performed per week (≤2 versus >2) and the experience in ureteral reimplantation of the respondent as a dichotomous variable (0 versus ≥1 repairs). Thirty-four surveys were answered. The simulator was reported to: have a very high level of realism by the experts; be a reproducible procedure with similar anatomical structures and working space to pediatric patients by the non-experts; be extremely useful, easy and ergonomic for laparoscopic training outside the OR; be lightweight and portable for straightforward transportation; be inexpensive; and be reusable and have low maintenance requirements. It was found to provide a secure environment for trainees, to enhance cognitive knowledge acquisitions, and to increase technical performance. Only tissue handling was non-significant when groups were compared. Augmenting surgical dexterity using LAP-SPUR offered great promise because maneuvers could be rehearsed over and over until they were mastered. Of the urologists and surgeons who were evaluated, 100% reported lack of training at their institutions; therefore, all of them would definitely benefit by practicing with LAP-SPUR to enhance technical skill acquirement. Further development and validation are still needed to assess its true benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29428359/"}

Modern field emission scanning EM may be utilized to scan thin sections of resin-embedded tissue mounted on a conductive support. Here we sought to achieve automated imaging without the typical limitations of transmission EM with equivalent or superior quality. Extended areas of tissue were either imaged in two (nanotomy) or in three dimensions (volume EM) by serial-section-based array tomography. Single-beam and fast-recording multi-beam field emission scanning EM instruments were compared using perfusion-fixed rodent kidneys. High-resolution scans produced excellent images of tissue, cells, and organelles down to macromolecular complexes. Digital stitching of image tiles in both modes allowed seamless Google Earth-like zooming from overview to regions of interest at the nanoscale. Large datasets were created that can be rapidly shared between scientists of different disciplines or pathologists using open source software. Three-dimensional array tomography of thin sections was followed by segmentation to visualize selected features in a large volume. Furthermore, correlative light-EM enabled the identification of functional information in a structural context. Thus, limitations in biomedical transmission EM can be overcome by introducing field emission scanning EM-based technology that permits high-quality, large field-of-view nanotomy, volume EM, and correlative light-EM modes. Advantages of virtual microscopy in clinical and experimental nephrology are illustrated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30143069/"}

These special requirements mean that nephropathology is not available at all pathology institutes, but is carried out on a large scale in a few highly specialised centres. The history of nephropathology, or in a narrower sense the specialised histopathological examination of kidney biopsies, began in 1958 with the first use or performance of a kidney biopsy [1]. It thus replaced the practice of urinalysis, which had been common since the Middle Ages, as a diagnostic tool for kidney diseases. Specialised techniques such as immunofluorescence or immunohistology but also electron microscopy are required to assess specific renal changes, for which the examination of renal biopsies is one of the few remaining routine applications today. In Germany and German-speaking countries, the discipline developed thanks to the work of outstanding people in the field of pathology who were primarily involved in this discipline and had the necessary technical and human resources in their laboratories to ensure that these biopsies could be analysed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38512473/"}

This study investigated the utility of this simulation tool for improving trainees' confidence in performing renal biopsy and biopsy-associated bleeding complications. We have quantitatively assessed the confidence level of renal fellows before and after their initial renal biopsy simulation training. Subsequently, we determined the effect of this simulation training on trainees' procedural competence by comparing outcomes of clinical renal biopsies performed by fellows that did versus those who did not participate in the simulation training. We show that renal biopsy simulation has improved the confidence level of trainees (23.4 presimulation to 70.3 postsimulation on a 0-100 scale; p = 0.001; η(2) = 0.69). The improvement in trainees' confidence did not vary across their prior experience performing renal biopsies (η(2) = 0.23; p = 0.060). Additionally, fellows who participated in the simulation training demonstrated improved competence in performing the renal biopsy procedure in patients. Successful retrieval of renal tissue per pass was 94% (vs. 73% in fellows who did not participate in this simulation training; p = 0.002) and procedure-related blood loss was reduced as indicated by smaller postbiopsy versus prebiopsy hematocrit decline (1.18 vs. 2.68; p = 0.049).

A total of 465 children with urolithiasis were investigated retrospectively. Patients were categorized based on their ages to infancy, early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence. When the hyperechogenic spots on ultrasound imaging were <3 mm, they were considered RCM, and if they were ≥3 mm, they were considered overt urolithiasis. Metabolic abnormalities were detected in 71%; hyperuricosuria in infants, hyperoxaluria in younger children and hypocitraturia in older children were the most common metabolic abnormalities. Hypercalciuria was the only metabolic abnormality that was significantly associated with overt urolithiasis in all pediatric ages (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.21-4.19). The clinical presentations were not significantly different between RCM and overt urolithiasis; however, complications such as urinary tract infection was significantly higher with overt urolithiasis in infancy (p = 0.01), early childhood (p = 0.02), middle childhood (p = 0.007) and adolescence (p = 0.01). Also, growth retardation was significantly higher with overt urolithiasis in infancy and early childhood (p = 0.02). Most children with urolithiasis have underlying urinary metabolic abnormalities that differ according to the child's age.

Social media, including Twitter, has been one method used by the Society to accomplish this goal. Twitter is a popular microblogging service that serves as a potent tool for disseminating information. It allows for short messages (140 characters) to be composed by any author and distributes those messages globally and quickly. The dissemination of information is necessary if Twitter is to be considered a tool that can increase public awareness of kidney disease. We hypothesized that content, citation, and sentiment analyses of tweets generated from Kidney Week 2011 would reveal a large number of educational tweets that were disseminated to the public. An ideal tweet for accomplishing this goal would include three key features: 1) informative content, 2) internal citations, and 3) positive sentiment score. Informative content was found in 29% of messages, greater than that found in a similarly sized medical conference (2011 ADA Conference, 16%). Informative tweets were more likely to be internally, rather than externally, cited (38% versus 22%, p<0.0001), thereby amplifying the original information to an even larger audience. Informative tweets had more negative sentiment scores than uninformative tweets (means -0.162 versus 0.199 respectively, p<0.0001), therefore amplifying a tweet whose content had a negative tone. Our investigation highlights significant areas of promise and improvement in using Twitter to disseminate medical information in nephrology from a scientific conference.

Studies were done to assess the reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of a simple cystometer. Standing incremental, retrograde cystometry was found to be relatively inexpensive, simple, reproducible, and sensitive. The two cystometrograms yielded similar results in 84% of the patients. The sensitivities were found to be 84.3 and 90.2% for the first and second cystometrograms, respectively. Using both cystometrograms together, we were able to detect detrusor instability with a sensitivity of 92.3% and to predict its absence with a negative predictive value of 86.7%. Detrusor instability was found in 64% of these patients. Based on these results, it was concluded that when multichannel urodynamics are not available in a high-prevalence population, standing retrograde incremental water cystometry done on two occasions may offer the physician an accurate alternative for the diagnosis of detrusor instability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1992416/"}
{"id": "34316720", "title": "Progress toward the Clinical Application of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Other Disease-Modulating Regenerative Therapies: Examples from the Field of Nephrology.", "text": "Drawing from basic knowledge of stem-cell biology, embryonic development, wound healing, and aging, regenerative medicine seeks to develop therapeutic strategies that complement or replace conventional treatments by actively repairing diseased tissue or generating new organs and tissues. Among the various clinical-translational strategies within the field of regenerative medicine, several can be broadly described as promoting disease resolution indirectly through local or systemic interactions with a patient's cells, without permanently integrating or directly forming new primary tissue. In this review, we focus on such therapies, which we term disease-modulating regenerative therapies (DMRT), and on the extent to which they have been translated into the clinical arena in four distinct areas of nephrology: renovascular disease (RVD), sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and kidney transplantation (KTx). As we describe, the DMRT that has most consistently progressed to human clinical trials for these indications is mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), which potently modulate ischemic, inflammatory, profibrotic, and immune-mediated tissue injury through diverse paracrine mechanisms. In KTx, several early-phase clinical trials have also tested the potential for <i>ex vivo</i>-expanded regulatory immune cell therapies to promote donor-specific tolerance and prevent or resolve allograft injury. Other promising DMRT, including adult stem/progenitor cells, stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and implantable hydrogels/biomaterials remain at varying preclinical stages of translation for these renal conditions. To date (2021), no DMRT has gained market approval for use in patients with RVD, SA-AKI, DKD, or KTx, and clinical trials demonstrating definitive, cost-effective patient benefits are needed. Nonetheless, exciting progress in understanding the disease-specific mechanisms of action of MSCs and other DMRT, coupled with increasing knowledge of the pathophysiologic basis for renal-tissue injury and the experience gained from pioneering early-phase clinical trials provide optimism that influential, regenerative treatments for diverse kidney diseases will emerge in the years ahead.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34316720/"}

{"id": "38182493", "title": "Update and Summary of the European Association of Urology/European Society of Paediatric Urology Paediatric Guidelines on Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children.", "text": "The prescriptive literature on vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is still limited and thus the level of evidence is generally low. The aim of these guidelines is to provide a practical approach to the treatment of VUR that is based on risk analysis and selective indications for both diagnostic tests and interventions. We provide a 2023 update on the chapter on VUR in children from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines. A structured literature review was performed for all relevant publications published from the last update up to March 2022. The most important updates are as follows. Bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) is common in toilet-trained children presenting with urinary tract infection (UTI) with or without primary VUR and increases the risk of febrile UTI and focal uptake defects on a radionuclide scan. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) may not be required in every VUR patient. Although the literature does not provide any reliable information on CAP duration in VUR patients, a practical approach would be to consider CAP until there is no further BBD. Recommendations for children with febrile UTI and high-grade VUR include initial medical treatment, with surgical care reserved for CAP noncompliance, breakthrough febrile UTIs despite CAP, and symptomatic VUR that persists during long-term follow-up. Comparison of laparoscopic extravesical versus transvesicoscopic ureteral reimplantation demonstrated that both are good option in terms of resolution and complication rates. Extravesical surgery is the most common approach used for robotic reimplantation, with a wide range of variations and success rates. This summary of the updated 2023 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides practical considerations for the management and diagnostic evaluation of VUR in children. For children with VUR, it is important to treat BBD if present. A practical approach regarding the duration of CAP is to consider administration until BBD resolution. We provide a summary and update of guidelines on the diagnosis and management of urinary reflux (where urine flows back up through the urinary tract) in children. Treatment of bladder and bowel dysfunction is critical, as this is common in toilet-trained children presenting with urinary tract infection.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182493/"}

Virtual reality (VR) training simulators have been developed to improve surgical skills. We evaluated the advantages and limitations of the novel Uro Trainer (UT) (Karl Storz GmbH, Germany) with respect to training for TUR-BT. Participants underwent VR training based on 4 different TUR-BT cases accompanied by self-assessment and evaluation questionnaires. Results were compared between experienced endourologists and novices, and furthermore, correlated with self-rated capabilities for content and construct validity. Student's t tests, Pearson's correlation, and chi-squared tests were performed for statistical evaluation. The study was performed at the tertiary care urological department of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. A total of 22 urological physicians, including residents and consultants, were included in the study. There is a need to improve TUR-BT training as 27.3% of the participants had already experienced overtaxing situations during TUR-BT and only a few reported of high satisfaction with the classical \"see one-do one\" teaching mode. Construct validity was demonstrated, as consultants achieved significantly higher overall scores (p < 0.001) and safety (p = 0.004) and visualization (p = 0.001) subscores. Interestingly, the self-assessed capability to perform a TUR-BT correlated significantly (p = 0.01) with overall UT scores. Significant progress of self-rated abilities was shown for several parameters, including inspection (p = 0.046) and resection (p = 0.026). Although participants indicated improvements in several procedural skills and overall benefit of the VR training with the UT was rated 4.6 on a 5-point scale by consultants, limitations of the UT were demonstrated predominantly for tissue feedback and authenticity of different tissue layers. The novel VR simulator showed a high face and construct validity, and therefore has a great potential to complement endourological training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30181038/"}

Urological biomaterials are sub-classified into xenogenic extracellular matrices (ECMs) or synthetic polymers. ECMs are decellularised, biocompatible, biodegradable biomaterials derived from animal organs. Synthetic polymers vary in chemical composition but may have the benefit of being reliably reproducible from a manufacturing perspective. Urological biomaterials can be 'seeded' with regenerative stem cells in vitro to create composite biomaterials for grafting in vivo. Mesenchymal stem cells are advantageous for regenerative purposes as they self-renew, have long-term viability and possess multilineage differentiation potential. Currently, tissue-engineered biomaterials are developing rapidly in regenerative urology with many important clinical milestones achieved.

Kidneys from two anesthetized adult Wistar rats were flushed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) and then perfused in situ with recirculated KHB containing collagenase and hyaluronidase at 125 mmHg. Cortices were excised, minced, and incubated in KHB containing enzymes for 35 min at 37 degrees C. Dissociated tubules were removed at 10-min intervals, rinsed, and placed in KHB containing 10% calf serum, vitamins, and amino acids at 4 degrees C. Separation was achieved by suspending the tissue in 45% isosmotic Percoll layered over an undiluted Percoll cushion and centrifuging. Proximal tubules sedimented near the cushion. Distal segments were isolated in the uppermost bands of a second 35% Percoll separation. Viability was greater than 95% as measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage and quantitated by oxygen consumption and ATP content. Basal oxygen consumption was greater than 33 nmol O2 X min-1 X mg protein-1 in all fractions and was stimulated by succinate and inhibited by amiloride and ouabain. Basal ATP content averaged 9.7 nmol/mg ATP. An average 3.3-fold separation for the proximal fraction and 24.5-fold separation for the distal fraction was assessed by the enrichment of six specific enzyme markers, with several of the markers indicating separations up to 32-fold. Isolated tubules also displayed functional responses to parathyroid hormone and vasopressin. Distal, but not proximal, segments demonstrated significantly increased adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate formation with vasopressin.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3039859/"}

Thirty-eight bovine kidneys were used. The total number of lobes, along with the number of lobes located in the cranial polar, caudal polar and hilar regions, were recorded. Several measurements of the kidneys were made and evaluated. The hilar region presents the greatest length (mean of 76.87 mm) of the 3 renal regions of the kidney. The large area of the bovine renal hilus could make access to hilar structures easier than in the human kidney. The coefficient of variation for renal length was small (8.14%), while the coefficient of variation for the lobar number was high (26.82%). The number of renal lobes ranged from 13 to 35, with a mean of 20.62. The hilar region presents the highest number of lobes, while the cranial pole presents the lowest. The number of lobes in the cranial and caudal poles increases with the width of these regions. This is different from the hilar region, in which the lobar number increases with the length of the hilus. These data indicate that the adult bovine kidney can be used as a model for certain urologic procedures, but researchers must be aware that there are some major differences between the adult bovine kidney and the human kidney, as indicated by the data reported in this paper.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18824839/"}

It was the aim of this review to validate the significance of PET as a diagnostic tool in malignant tumors of the urogenital tract. A systematic review of the current literature concerning the role of PET for malignant tumors of the kidney, testicles, prostate, and bladder was carried out. The role of FDG PET for renal cell cancer can be seen in the detection of recurrences after definitive local therapy and metastases. The higher sensitivity of PET in comparison to other therapeutic modalities (CT, ultrasound, MRI) in recurrent and metastatic renal cell cancer suggests a supplemental role of this diagnostic procedure to complement other imaging modalities.The clinical value of PET is established for the identification of vital tumor tissue after chemotherapy of seminomatous germ cell tumors. This diagnostic method has little significance for primary tumor staging and diagnosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor because of the high probability of false-negative results in adult teratomas. FDG PET is not sensitive enough in the diagnosis of primary or recurrent tumors in prostate or bladder cancer. Also PET did not prove to be superior to conventional bone scintigram in the detection of mostly osteoblastic metastases in prostate cancer. The recent use of alternative tracers, which are partly not eliminated by urinary secretion (acetate, choline) has increased the sensitivity and specificity of PET also in this tumor entity so that further clinical investigations are needed to validate these technical modifications in their significance for this imaging modality. PET appears to be sufficiently evaluated only for the diagnostic follow-up of patients with seminomatous germ cell tumors after chemotherapy to regard it is the diagnostic tool of first choice.

Its interest consists, on the one hand in the lack of similar studies, and on the other in the novelty resulting from the fact that the author decided to write in Romance language at a moment in which scientific treaties were written in Latin. We performed a meticulous reading of the treaty on a facsimile edition of the original of the same title edited in Madrid in 1588. We extract 1.288 medical terms that we consulted in three modern dictionaries to analyze the lexicon used by Diaz in its composition. We analyze the words from the point of view of their make up and ethimology; we review the meaning of the medical terms in relation to their current use--meaning conservation or loss--, and also the date of appearance of those terms in the spanish language, to know how many of them appeared in the work of Diaz for the first time, and to know the conservation or loss of the meaning that Diaz gave them currently. We extract 1.288 medical terms, 195 of them have been conserved with the same meaning from their origin to date; on the contrary, 35.5% are not found in either of the three dictionaries, so that they are medical terms used by Francisco Diaz for the first time and that were erased by time. 543 medical terms were contributions from Diaz in their first written appearance.

We studied 28 patients referred with a presumptive diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis based on filling defects noted on excretory urograms. At percutaneous endoscopy tumor was resected in 26 patients, while no tumor was found in 2. All 19 men and 7 women smoked, and mean age at presentation was 65 years. Of the patients 18 presented with hematuria and 6 had bilateral upper tract tumors. After percutaneous resection, the access tract was irradiated either with iridium wire in 12 patients or a commercial high dose rate radiation delivery system in 12. Thiotepa was instilled into the nephrostomy tube without brachytherapy in 1 patient and 1 received no adjuvant treatment in all. All patients were followed by excretory urography and urine cytology. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography were performed when technically possible. After percutaneous tumor resection 6 patients (23%) had local recurrence in the treated renal pelvis, including 3 at 44, 55 and 60 months, respectively. Further conservative treatment was initially possible in 4 of these patients but ultimately only 2 (both of whom had late recurrences) retained the treated kidney. Of the 11 patients with recurrence elsewhere in the urinary tract the bladder was invariably involved (11), while synchronous or metachronous ureteral recurrence was less common (3). Nine patients remained free of any urothelial recurrence in the upper or lower tract. No patient had recurrent tumor in the nephrostomy tract. Of the patients 7 suffered from procedure-related complications, including 1 who had a persistent urinary fistula that failed to heal after brachytherapy and required nephroureterectomy. There have been 6 deaths during followup, of which 2 were disease related. The 3-year estimated local recurrence-free survival rate was 86% (95% confidence interval 63 to 95%), cause-specific survival rate 91% (95% confidence interval 67 to 98%) and overall survival rate 78% (95% confidence interval 55 to 90%). Differences in recurrence-free survival, comparing those with recurrence in the treated renal pelvis or elsewhere in the urothelium and those remaining disease-free, did not translate to a significant overall survival difference (p < 0.5) between these groups. Our results suggest that the combination of percutaneous local resection and tract irradiation offers an effective long-term alternative to radical extirpation in the management of select patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma confined to the renal pelvis.

However, acellular materials have not proven to work sufficiently well, and cell-seeded materials are technically challenging and time consuming to generate. An important function of the urinary tract is to prevent urine leakage into the surrounding tissue--a function usually performed by the urothelium. We hypothesize that by providing an impermeable barrier in the acellular graft material, urine leakage would be minimized, as the urothelium forms in vivo. However, since urothelial cells require access to nutrients from the supporting vasculature, the impermeable barrier must degrade over time. Here we present the development of a novel biomaterial composed of the common degradable polymers, poly(ε-caprolactone) and poly(L-lactic acid) and generated by electrospinning directly onto spin-coated thin films. The composite scaffolds with thin films on the luminal surface were compared to their electrospun counterparts and commercially available small intestinal submucosa by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy and by analysis of permeability to small molecules. In addition, the materials were examined for their ability to support urothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and multilayered urothelium formation. We provide evidence that these unique composite scaffolds provide significant benefit over commonly used acellular materials in vitro and suggest that they be further examined in vivo.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20830673/"}

We mechanically investigated 4.8F (n = 9), 6F (n = 9), and 7F (n = 9) ureteral stents to determine parameters that contribute to resisting radial compression forces. Digitalized images of luminal reduction values under incrementally increased reductions of stent outer diameters were obtained (0%, 25%, 50%, and 60% of original outer diameter). Forces (Newton [N]) and percentage luminal reduction that resulted in complete ureteral stent obstruction were determined. Uniaxial incremental compression in the radial direction demonstrated complete luminal reduction (95%-100%) when 58% to 62% of the outer stent diameter was compressed. The 6F ureteral stents demonstrated the greatest resistance to extrinsic compression and the greatest \"material area\" relative to \"CSA\" (mm<sup>2</sup>). The force (N) required for 50% compression of outer stent diameter was 10.44, 28.13, and 25.39 N for 4.8F, 6F, and 7F ureteral stents, respectively.

The survey consisted of questions pertaining to practice and training background, and case scenarios with treatment options for upper urinary tract calculi of different sizes at various locations. The responses were then statistically analyzed to determine practice trends. Seven urologists did not fill out the survey, as they did not manage patients with stone disease. The overall response rate was 23% (167/783). Although more than 75% of urologists were trained to perform extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), ureteroscopy (URS), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) during their residency, only 61% and 17% were trained to perform open stone surgery (OSS) and medical expulsive therapy (MET), respectively. Twelve percent of respondents were fellowship trained in endourology. Observation was most commonly recommended for asymptomatic renal calculi <5 mm in size (92%). Although SWL continues to be the most commonly utilized therapy for renal (43%-92%) and proximal ureteral calculi <20 mm in size (29%-51%), and PCNL for renal calculi >20 mm in size (72%-92%), many urologists (48%) favored PCNL for lower pole calculi 10 to 20 mm in size. Use of URS was mostly favored for distal (44%-90%) and proximal ureteral calculi (23%-46%), while MET was recommended for small ureteral calculi <5 mm in size (25%-32%). Fellowship-trained endourologists, academic urologists, and urologists in practice for less than 5 years were more likely to utilize URS, PCNL, and MET, and less likely to utilize SWL for urinary calculi.

We developed and validated a porcine bladder training model for transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Urology residents and specialists were invited to test the training model. They were asked to complete a pre-task questionnaire, to perform piecemeal and en bloc resection of 'bladder tumours' within the training model, and to complete a post-task questionnaire afterwards. Their performances were assessed by faculty members of the AUSTEG. For the face validity, a pre-task questionnaire consisting of six statements on TURBT and the training model were set. For the content validity, a post-task questionnaire consisting of 14 items on the details of the training model were set. For the construct validity, a Global Rating Scale was used to assess the participants' performances. The participants were stratified into two groups (junior surgeons and senior surgeons groups) according to their duration of urology training. For the pre-task questionnaire, a mean score of ≥ 4.0 out of 5.0 was achieved in 5 out of 6 statements. For the post-task questionnaire, a mean score of ≥ 4.5 out of 5.0 was achieved in every item.

The aim of this study is to review the literature for different types of simulators described for PCA. Databases of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, OvidSP, and Google Scholar were systematically searched until May 2016. The studies were analyzed regarding the type of simulator (nonbiologic, biologic, live animal, and virtual reality [VR]), type of validity (face, content, construct, and predictive), cost-effectiveness, and whether these simulators have been used for training and/or assessment of PCA. In addition, the study looked at the educational impact of these simulators in terms of the transfer of PCA skills to the operating room. Several bench, animal, and VR simulators for training in PCA were identified. Only few studies were found on assessment of PCA skills. Biological bench models used porcine or bovine kidneys wrapped within foam, silicone, chicken carcass, or full-thickness skin flap alone. Other biological models used additional subcutaneous fascia, muscle, or ribs. Nonbiological models used prototypes, including 3D printing. Only one study reported the use of anesthetized live pig for training. The PERC Mentor™ was the only VR simulator, which has been validated for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, none of these studies assessed the educational impact of PCA simulators. Furthermore, most of the studies did not address the validity and the cost of the simulator. While several biological and nonbiological PCA models exist, there is paucity of literature regarding the validity and educational impact of these simulators. The PERC Mentor simulator is the sole validated simulator for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, it is expensive and there is little evidence of its educational impact. Therefore, more research is needed to validate the available simulators and assess their educational impact for urology trainees.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27617641/"}

Highlights include dynamic cell culture to precondition grafts and the use of omental wrapping to promote vascularization. Emphasis on specific cell culture conditions is set to shift towards the monitoring of differentiation and functional outcome. The future might encompass the use of stem cells to overcome the issues of harvesting cells from diseased tissues. Improved understandings of scaffold and cell interactions are particularly important to advance graft development and outcome. Recent trials give some indication of clinical outcome for tissue-engineered treatments, but patient benefit could be difficult to interpret in salvage cases. Tissue engineering applications can be broken down into tissue- or organ-based approaches, only through examining these in clinical settings can potential success can be judged.

The overall response rate was 49% (235 responders), representing 78% of urological departments, including all the targeted individuals.

Another four (2%) saw one or two cases per year and the remaining 98 (41%) saw PFUT less frequently. Acutely, 69% of urologists who treated PFUT did so by placing a urethral catheter. Subsequent strictures were treated endoscopically for as long as this was possible. The other 31% inserted a suprapubic catheter and referred the patient for reconstructive surgery if needed. Those who used urethroplasty for strictures after PFUT were identified and targeted; half used urethral mobilization and spatulated anastomosis alone.

The very construction of instruments and devices depends on the Author's ideas assembled with the basic theories of the time. For instance, at the end of the nineteenth century, when medical instruments became essential, the bacterial origin of diseases revolutionised their construction and application. In this context, the invention and use of the microscope became an outstanding feature of the clinical approach by disclosing the cellular universe. The microscope had become crucial in locating some major causes of physical suffering and death in man, and was considered the pre-eminent diagnostic instrument in medicine. In the nephrological field, the microscope drew the physician into a universe of physical changes that were concealed to the naked eye. The microscope made possible the verification of some of Bright's brilliant ideas, something that helped physicians classify glomerulonephritis. Many nephrologists confessed \"how few things are established in this subject (nephrology) and how many more difficulties are established, we have learned by experience with the microscope\". The modesty of this claim is striking. In nephrology, as in other fields, the admission of ignorance proved to be the beginning of wisdom. This wisdom, based on the admission of ignorance and assembled through the commitment and ingenuity of the pioneers of the dialysis treatment, led to the treatment of end-stage renal disease and the guarantee of success.

The discipline of pediatric nephrology mainly emerged during the 20th century in response to problems in fluid and electrolyte balance, characterization of the nephrotic syndrome, use of renal biopsy, antibiotic therapy of urinary tract infections, dialysis and transplantation in children, growth problems associated with chronic renal failure, detection and therapy of hypertension, and the creation of both national and international pediatric nephrology societies and a journal now in its 18th year. The development of molecular and cell biology, genetic and genomic techniques and bioinformatics methods underlie many future directions. We should anticipate further elucidation of single gene disorders, of complex trait analysis of disorders, such as diabetic nephropathy and hypertension, the interplay of developmental genes and gene products and interactions within the podocyte. Specific therapies directed against inflammation, vascular damage, cyst development, the ravages of proteinuria and graft rejection (or induction leading to tolerance) will be developed. Stem cell therapies may replace lost renal mass, even of specific nephron sites. Novel therapies will also modulate the cell cycle, tyrosine kinase signaling and apoptosis. In addition, drugs will be specifically tested in children for many renal conditions. Larger and more specialized registries will be developed; epidemiologic studies and exploration of large data sets will lead to clinical guidelines that are evidenced-based. There is a need for more careful measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and cytokines, and a fuller appreciation of the nutritional and hormonal role of the kidney. Finally, the antecedents of adult renal disease and the need to intervene in a proactive fashion will be realized. Despite these impressive advances in care, the greatest challenges will be in providing children with renal disease access to well-trained pediatric nephrologists, especially in Asia (1 billion children), Africa, Central and South America, and in immigrant and refugee populations. Included in this challenge is the capacity to have affordable access to use of contemporary techniques, and effective medications and prevention strategies. The International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA), its journal, and pediatric advocates will need to use their energies to take on these challenges.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15880269/"}

Cystic kidneys may enlarge up to 20 times the weight of a normal kidney due to the growth of renal cysts, and patients with ADPKD have an increased risk of morbidity, premature mortality, and other life-time complications including renal and hepatic cyst and urinary tract infection, intracranial aneurysm, diverticulosis, and kidney pain which impair quality of life. Despite some therapeutic advances and the growing number of clinical trials in ADPKD, the outcomes that are relevant to patients and clinicians, such as symptoms and quality of life, are infrequently and inconsistently reported. This potentially limits the contribution of trials to inform evidence-based decision-making. The Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) project aims to establish a consensus-based set of core outcomes for trials in PKD (with an initial focus on ADPKD but inclusive of all stages) that patients and health professionals identify as critically important. The five phases of SONG-PKD are: a systematic review to identify outcomes that have been reported in existing PKD trials; focus groups with nominal group technique with patients and caregivers to identify, rank, and describe reasons for their choices; qualitative stakeholder interviews with health professionals to elicit individual values and perspectives on outcomes for trials involving patients with PKD; an international three-round Delphi survey with all stakeholder groups (including patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, policy makers, researchers, and industry) to gain consensus on critically important core outcome domains; and a consensus workshop to review and establish a set of core outcome domains and measures for trials in PKD. The SONG-PKD core outcome set is aimed at improving the consistency and completeness of outcome reporting across ADPKD trials, leading to improvements in the reliability and relevance of trial-based evidence to inform decisions about treatment and ultimately improve the care and outcomes for people with ADPKD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29169385/"}

A model simulating the performance of a laparoscopic running urethrovesical anastomosis was fashioned using skin of a supermarket chicken set in a laparoscopic training box. A circular continuous anastomosis was performed, following exactly the technique we use in vivo for performing a vesicourethral anastomosis after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Details regarding the use of the right or the left needle holder, needle positioning, precise stitch position, and use of forehand or backhand stitch were strictly respected in order to reproduce the continuous stitch currently done in vivo in our department. The learning curve was analyzed in terms of the time necessary to perform the task and the quality of the anastomosis. The model was created and used by the junior authors during their year of fellowship in advanced laparoscopic urology. The authors had no previous experience with hands-on laparoscopic suturing but have assisted in a great number of laparoscopic radical prostatectomies. The time required for performing the anastomosis on the model declined from 75 minutes initially to 20 minutes after the trainees had performed 20 anastomoses each. After this training, it was possible to create a watertight running laparoscopic vesicourethral anastomosis in patients in a mean time of 40 minutes (range 30-55 minutes). This simple model allows the trainee in laparoscopic urology to acquire the skills necessary to perform a laparoscopic vesicourethral anastomosis, one of the most complex steps in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, as well as to develop dexterity and facility in laparoscopic manipulation of needles, sutures, and fragile tissues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14565878/"}

The recent development of the ''omics'' (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) following the enormous progress of high-throughput technologies and information technology tools is profoundly transforming our knowledge in every biomedical field, including nephrology. It is expected that in a very short time a better understanding of both physiological and pathological events in the kidney will translate into different therapeutic strategies, possibly targeted to individual needs. Nephrologists and renal pathologists must take these changes into account and realize that a new approach to renal biopsy is urgently required. Renal biopsy material has in fact an enormous importance in the generation of new knowledge and in the validation of experimental results from high-throughput technologies and animal models. Furthermore, it is conceivable that a new classification of renal diseases will be needed soon as a result of the improved knowledge.

We reviewed our database of all anterior urethroplasties performed by a single surgeon from 2007 to 2009. Urethral rest was accomplished by removal of the indwelling catheter, cessation of self-catheterization, and/or suprapubic urinary diversion before urethral reconstruction. During the study period, 210 patients underwent urethral reconstruction at our center. Men who had undergone meatoplasty or posterior urethroplasty were excluded, leaving 128 anterior urethroplasty patients available for analysis. Of these men, 28 (21%) were preoperatively given an initial period of urethral rest (median duration 3 months) because of recent urologic manipulation occurring immediately before referral. Of the 28 patients, 15 (54%) received suprapubic catheters. Urethral rest promoted identification of severely fibrotic stricture segments, enabling focal or complete excision in 75% (excision and primary anastomosis in 12 [43%] and augmented anastomosis in 9 [32%]), a percentage similar to that for those undergoing reconstruction without preliminary manipulation mandating urethral rest (82%). Stricture recurrence developed in 4 (14%) of the 28 rest patients, a rate again similar to that for the remainder of the urethroplasty population (10%). The results of our study have shown that recently manipulated anterior urethral strictures often declare themselves to be obliterative within several months of urethral rest, thus enabling successful urethroplasty by focal or complete excision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21513968/"}

Increasing awareness entails increasing knowledge at various levels, and it is for this reason that we are presenting this review focusing on educational activities that have been and could further be undertaken to spread knowledge of these topics. We start from a description of the various approaches to green nephrology: technical, mainly focused on dialysis, clinical, encompassing medical and nonmedical treatments in all CKD phases, and comprehensive, embedding kidney care in the society. We further summarize what is known and the fundamental needs and problems we presently face in reducing dialysis carbon-print, optimizing the pathways of care, avoiding futility in clinical work and research, and implementing lifestyle interventions and education. We further acknowledge the lack of data on lifecycle of items and procedures, including commonly used drugs, and identify research needs at various levels. We finally discuss some examples of educational programs on green nephrology that are already available at various levels, from medical schools (an educational game), to medical meetings (healthy eating and reduction of plastic and paper waste), and daily clinical practice, in which teaching passes also through examples (personalizing dialysis and adapting schedules to each patient).

Both continent and incontinent diversions are available to patients after cystectomy. In appropriately selected patients, orthotopic neobladder reconstruction can offer preservation of body image and continence, and continent cutaneous diversions represent a reasonable alternative. Conduit diversion, which remains the most commonly performed diversion technique, is ideal for patients who would benefit from a less morbid surgical procedure that negates the need for self-catheterization. This installment of the Core Curriculum in Nephrology outlines numerous aspects of urinary diversion, in which a multidisciplinary approach to postoperative management at the intersection of nephrology and urology is required to effectively optimize patient outcomes.

According to the guideline, the dipstick (nitrite) test and dipslide form the two cornerstones of the diagnosis of urinary-tract infections. The value of the dipslide, however, seems to have been overestimated and that of microscopic examination of the urine by skilled physicians to have been underestimated. New in this guideline compared to that of 1999 is that nitrofurantoin (the treatment of first choice in uncomplicated infections) should be given for five instead of three days. The guideline motivates this change in policy on the basis of the numerous treatment failures seen in practice. The most convincing type of evidence, however, is not available due to the lack of relevant randomised clinical trials. The introduction of the prescription of phosphomycin, which is unusual in the Netherlands, as an alternative treatment for uncomplicated infections requires supportive evidence before it will be accepted by general practitioners.

Some researchers consider Hippocrates to be the father of clinical nephrology, while John Merrill is widely regarded as a specialty founder of modern nephrology. The situation is similar in Poland, where early references to urinary tract diseases appeared in medieval works of Polish authors. Poland's first clinic of nephrology, established in Wrocław in 1958, was managed by Zdzisław Wiktor. During the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association and International Association for the History of Nephology congresses, Polish authors presented precursors of nephrology, including Thomas of Wrocław, Simon Sirenius, Samuel Goldflam, Józef Dietl, Jędrzej Śniadecki, Marceli Landsberg, and Witold and Tadeusz Orłowski. This article focuses on late 19th and early 20th century giants who contributed to the development of nephrology in Poland. The period discussed covers memorable milestones in the history of Poland, ranging from the long-term Russian, Prussian, and Austro-Hungarian annexation through World War 1, after which the country regained its independence, to World War 2. These scientists represented clinical medicine and basic sciences, such as pathologic anatomy, physiology, and physiologic chemistry, and came from 3 different regions of Poland. Professor Tadeusz Browicz was associated with the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Professor Anastazy Landau worked in Warsaw, and Stefan Dąbrowski represented the University of Poznań.

Therefore, urethral stricture treatments in Japan are not in line with those used in other countries. To address this, the Trauma, Emergency Medicine, and Reconstruction Subcommittee of the Japanese Urological Association has developed guidelines to offer standardized treatment protocols for urethral stricture, based on international evidence and tailored to Japan's medical landscape. These guidelines target patients with a clinically suspected urethral stricture and are intended for urologists and general practitioners involved in its diagnosis and treatment. Following the Minds Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual 2020, the committee identified eight critical clinical issues and formulated eight clinical questions using the \"patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome\" format.

This effect is usually achieved by interposing a segment of small bowel between the proximal collecting system and bladder. If ileum is not available other substitution alternatives must be sought. We report a new technique in which a tube constructed from a small piece of ascending colon was used to replace a large ureteral defect. Excellent short-term results were achieved by replacing the strictured ureteral segment with a reconfigured colon segment as shown by symptomatic and radiographic improvement. A reconfigured colon segment can be used for ureteral reconstruction in the patient with limited alternatives. This tube has several advantages for ureteral reconstruction over ileal segments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8627855/"}

On the one hand, a positive development toward interdisciplinary management can be observed with verifiably good surgical quality in most of the centers and good outpatient care provided by social services, and in some instances psycho-oncological support. On the other hand, there are substantial problems with data documentation. The quality of documentation declines considerably when the patient leaves the hospital. Concerted efforts must be made to improve documentation of patient data and transfer of aftercare information. The association with hospital cancer registries must be enhanced. The quality of both inpatient care and intersectoral care can only be improved on a long-term basis when the insurance providers support this development.

We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients who received subureteric injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Deflux(®){AQ2}) (225 procedures) for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) by four surgeons. The study included 55 patients, 82 ureters, who had postoperative follow-up with a voiding cystogram or nuclear medicine cystogram. Exclusion criteria were prior anti-refluxing procedures, duplicated collecting systems, and non-achievement of a negative intraoperative cystogram. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they received an intraoperative cystogram after the injection. The two groups were compared for VUR resolution rates on follow-up imaging. Twenty patients underwent an intraoperative cystogram (Group 1, 33 ureters) and 35 did not (Group 2, 49 ureters). The two groups were similar in age, preoperative reflux grade, amount of Deflux injected into each ureter, and time to postoperative studies. In Group 1, 11 ureters (33.3%) and also, in Group 2, 11 ureters (22.4%) had reflux on follow-up imaging. There was no improvement in VUR resolution rate following subureteric injection of Deflux(®) when an intraoperative cystogram demonstrated no reflux to be present immediately after injection. Of ureters that did not reflux on intraoperative cystograms, one-third displayed return of reflux on follow-up imaging, which suggests no learning curve and that failures are not likely to be caused by poor surgical technique.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19740702/"}

MRU was shown to be superior to renal scintigraphy for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. The use of MRU for the assessment of urolithiasis, vesicoureteral reflux, renal trauma, and fetal urinary tract abnormalities is limited and technical refinements are required. Judicious use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was recently shown to avoid new occurrences. Potential future applications include virtual endoscopy and MRU-guided procedures. MRU has the potential to revolutionize imaging of the urinary tract in children. It integrates exquisite anatomical information with a variety of functional data and avoids ionizing radiation. MRU is increasingly employed as a problem solver when conventional imaging studies remain inconclusive and its growing application will likely improve availability and cost in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20531092/"}

A previous low-fidelity, 6-step curriculum was proposed that deconstructed the most important steps of loupe surgery. We expanded on this curriculum with an intermediate-fidelity silicone hypospadias model and designed an abbreviated version of the 6-step curriculum to precede the hypospadias repair simulation. To assess the validity of our prior, low-fidelity conceptual model using the metric of improved performance on the intermediate-fidelity silicone hypospadias model. A silicone model was first prototyped with the design software Solidworks™, and then fabricated using a cast made of a mixture of silicone rubbers designed to function like skin and soft tissue (Mold Star 20T, Dragon skin FX-pro and Slacker). Casts were used to create the penile shaft model and the dorsal hooded foreskin model. The urethral plate was cast separately on a flat surface. The model was then assembled by hand. The model used for simulation included the penile shaft and urethral plate, while the dorsal-hooded foreskin was prepared to simulate the penile anatomy separately. Trainees were then divided into two groups. Group 1 practiced the low-fidelity curriculum (3 tasks) and then performed dissection of the urethral plate and suturing using the intermediate-fidelity hypospadias model. Group 2 practiced hypospadias repair prior to the low-fidelity curriculum. Both groups' models were scored by 3 blinded urologists. Trainees were then asked to complete a post simulation satisfaction survey. Data analysis was performed in IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh (Version 28.0 Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Twenty-two candidates across Wisconsin, USA, and Dublin, Ireland participated in the study. This included 7 s-year residents, 9 third-year residents, 2 fourth-year residents, and 3 fifth-year residents. Both Groups 1 and 2 had a similar distribution of trainees (p = 0.60). Group 1 outperformed group 2 in all tasks (p < 0.05, Table 1). Trainees reported that the platform was very useful (91%). Our curriculum showed improvement in trainee ability and comfort to perform hypospadias repair. Advantages of such a simulated curriculum include improving current resident training in microsurgery, improving surgical ergonomics for trainees prior to real-time experience, and decreasing the learning curve for trainees pursuing pediatric urology. An intermediate-fidelity hypospadias platform externally validates the conceptual model implemented in the low-fidelity loupes curriculum.

The early 20th century saw the first major development, the description of the seminoma by the French investigator Maurice Chevassu, but the pace of knowledge did not accelerate until after World War II with a major article from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) by Nathan B. Friedman and Robert A. Moore, soon followed by the first series testis fascicle by Frank J. Dixon and Moore. Other noteworthy contributions were made by two masters of gonadal pathology, Gunnar Teilum and Robert E. Scully. In the 1970s, Niels E. Skakkebaek played a seminal role in elaborating in-situ neoplasia of the testis. The school of British testicular tumour authored, in the mid-1970s, under the editorship of Roger C. B. Pugh, one of the best texts on testicular pathology. Advances in more recent years have been largely spearheaded by Thomas M. Ulbright of the Indiana University School of Medicine. Observations on the prostate gland date back to Andreas Vesalius and William Cheselden, the latter appearing to have introduced the word for the gland. Note is made of contributions on the anatomy and histology of the gland by Oswald Lowsley, L. M. Franks, and John McNeal. Diagnosing carcinoma of the prostate was brought into the modern age in a landmark 1953 article by Robert S. Totten et al. In the 1960s, Donald F. Gleason introduced a grading system that is now in use worldwide. The topic of premalignant lesions has been well established only for approximately three decades, based initially on the work of Dr McNeal and David G. Bostwick. One of the first to write a book on the bladder was the remarkable British surgeon-pathologist Sir Henry Thompson. Workers at the AFIP, including Colonel James E. Ash and Fatallah K. Mostofi, wrote many outstanding articles on bladder pathology. The roles of other institutions, such as Johns Hopkins University, the Mayo Clinic, and St Peter's Hospital Institute of Urology, London, and those who worked there are noted. Knowledge of the pathology of the urachus dates largely back to the remarkable book on the topic in 1916 by the Hopkins investigator Thomas S. Cullen. Information on renal tumours dates largely to the work of Paul Grawitz, but awareness of the many variants of renal cell carcinoma in general was slow to evolve, and has only accelerated in recent years. The AFIP group of Dr Mostofi, ably assisted by Colonel Charles J. Davis and Isabell A. Sesterhenn, has contributed to knowledge of renal neoplasia with articles of note on oncocytoma, metanephric adenoma, and medullary carcinoma. In the mid-1980s, the German workers Wolfgang Thoenes and Stephan Störkel recognised the distinctive tumour known as chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Work on renal tumours in the young owes much to J. Bruce Beckwith. The observational talents of numerous investigators have, in just over a century, advanced our knowledge of diseases of the urinary tract and testis remarkably.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30565309/"}

Through the establishment of comprehensive biobanks, researchers can collect and store various biological specimens, including urine, blood, tissue, and DNA samples, to study these mechanisms. In the context of neuro-urology, biobanking facilitates the identification of genetic variations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression patterns associated with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. These conditions often present as symptoms of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, and many others. Biobanking of tissue specimens from such patients is essential to understand why these diseases cause the respective symptoms and what can be done to alleviate them. The utilization of high-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression profiling, enables researchers to explore the molecular landscape of these conditions in an unprecedented manner. The development of specific and reliable biomarkers resulting from these efforts may help in early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective monitoring of neuro-urological conditions, leading to improved patient care and management. Furthermore, these biomarkers could potentially facilitate the monitoring of novel therapies currently under investigation in neuro-urological clinical trials. This comprehensive review explores the synergistic integration of neuro-urology and biobanking, with particular emphasis on the translation of biobanking approaches in molecular research in neuro-urology. We discuss the advantages of biobanking in neuro-urological studies, the types of specimens collected and their applications in translational research. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of standardization and quality assurance when collecting samples and discuss challenges that may compromise sample quality and impose limitations on their subsequent utilization. Finally, we give recommendations for sampling in multicenter studies, examine sustainability issues associated with biobanking, and provide future directions for this dynamic field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37762582/"}

Renal biopsy has been performed for several decades in Taiwan; however, a national data registry is still lacking until 2013. The Renal Biopsy Registry Committee was established within the Taiwan Society of Nephrology in January 2013. A biopsy registry format, including basic demographic data, baseline clinical features, laboratory data, and clinical and pathological diagnosis was developed. Approval from the local institutional review board was obtained in each participating medical center. From January 2014 to September 2016, 1445 renal biopsies were identified from 17 medical centers. 53.8% cases were reported in men. After excluding renal transplantation, renal biopsies were commonly performed in patients with primary glomerulonephritis (48.1%), secondary glomerulonephritis (36.2%), followed by tubulointerstitial diseases (12.3%) and vascular nephropathy (3.4%). Among primary glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy (26.0%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (21.6%), and membranous nephropathy (20.6%) were most frequently diagnosed. Diabetic nephropathy (22.4%) and lupus nephritis (21.8%) were the most common among secondary glomerulonephritis. Patients with minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy had heavier proteinuria than those with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (P < 0.001). Patients with minimal change disease had higher serum IgM and IgE levels. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in primary glomerular disease was membranous nephropathy (28.8%), followed by minimal change disease (28.2%). IgA nephropathy was the leading cause of chronic nephritic syndrome, acute nephritic syndrome, and persistent hematuria. The incidence of primary glomerulonephritis was approximately 2.19 in 100,000/year. This is the first report of the National Renal Biopsy Registry in Taiwan.

A questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical students (4th and 6th year students) preparing for the national entrance examination. This questionnaire comprised three parts: (1) information about the student (medical school, attendance of lectures, participation in intern conferences); (2) student's level of satisfaction with the teaching material provided;(3) criteria of choice (18 items) of the photocopies used. Out of the 200 students completing the questionnaire, only 32% used teaching material provided by the university and 22% reported that their medical school did not provide Urology teaching material. Fifty-nine percent of students thought that this teaching material was \"moderately\" to \"not at all adapted\" to the national entrance examination programme and 70% considered that they were \"moderately\" to \"not at all\" prepared for the national entrance examination. We noted that 83.5% of students thought that intern conferences were \"useful\" to \"very useful\" to prepare the urology module of the national entrance examination and 85% thought that photocopies were \"useful\" to \"very useful\" to prepare the national entrance examination. The College of urology photocopies were the most widely used teaching material: 38% of students. The four most important criteria of choices were \"their peers' opinion\", \"the style of presentation and writing\" and \"advice from interns\". \"The author\" and \"price\" were only rated in 11th and 12th positions.

{"id": "16437249", "title": "[Neurourology. Current developments and therapeutic strategies].", "text": "There is no part of urology that has made so much progress in the last 25 years as neurourology. Seminal developments have been made in the selective effectiveness of drugs influencing neurogenic bladder dysfunction but having limited side effects. Additional advances are also likely to be made in the methods of functional electrostimulation and tissue engineering. Neurourology is predominantly influenced by our dynamic-functional understanding and the functionally oriented planning and implementation of treatment. The initial treatment options in many areas of neurourology are conservative, but, when possible, not irreversible. If these are ineffective or lead to late complications (e.g. by congenital paraplegia), there are a series of organ sparing or organ manipulating operations which can restore organ function. These make it possible to save kidney function from continuing damage, and, in many cases, to restore continence. The permanent indwelling catheter should remain excluded from the treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. With adequate treatment, patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction can be protected from severe complications and reintegrated into their normal social environment. After the acute phase of rehabilitation, urology is the most commonly required specialist area for paraplegic patients. In the past, urological problems have contributed most to the short lifespan of patients with an accident related spinal cord injury. Using modern neurourological treatment strategies, not only is lifespan increased but the quality of life of the patient is permanently improved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437249/"}

In all, 21% of TS and 3% of UR (p = 0.005) do not use any tests to confirm the presence of another kidney before exploring an expanding retroperitoneal hematoma, despite lack of preoperative imaging. To confirm the presence of another kidney, UR prefer the \"one-shot\" intravenous pyelogram (82%), whereas TS prefer palpation (61%; p < 0.001). TS do not obtain primary renal vascular control before opening the retroperitoneal, whereas UR do (21% vs. 71%; p < 0.001).

From a pathological standpoint, the typical renal lesion is represented by ''nodular intercapillary glomerulosclerosis'', which is present in 8 out of 20 patients at postmortem. Marked proteinuria and edema are the most typical clinical features. Urinary sediment examination is the only test allowing to differentiate diabetic nephropathy from other glomerular diseases. In the initial phases, the glomerular filtration rate is increased rather than reduced. The evolution is almost invariably towards end-stage renal disease, and a hypoglucidic diet and insulin are the only therapeutic modalities available. Today this work shows us, on the one hand, how many uncertainties still existed about diabetic nephropathy 17 years after its first description by Kimmelstiel and Wilson in 1936. On the other hand, it shows how much relevant and still valid information was already known at the time. Luigi Scapellato, who is almost completely forgotten today, began his career at the Clinica Medica of the University of Rome under the guidance of Cesare Frugoni (1881-1978).

We tried to trace its history from its inception to its recent urological applications. Historical articles about botulinum toxin were reviewed and a Medline search was performed for its urological utility. We hereby present a brief review of historical aspects of BoNT and its applications in urology. In 1793, the first known outbreak of botulism occurred due to 'spoiled' sausage in Wildebad, Germany. The German physician and poet Justinus Kerner published the first accurate description of the clinical symptoms of botulism (sausage poison). He was also the first to mention its potential therapeutic applications. In urology, BoNT has been used in bladder and urethral lesions with varying degree of success. Recently, BoNT applications were explained for prostatic disorders. BoNT applications in urology are in the treatment of detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor overactivity, detrusor underactivity, spastic conditions of the urethral sphincter, chronic prostate pain, interstitial cystitis, non-fibrotic bladder outflow obstruction (including benign prostatic hyperplasia) and acute urinary retention in women. Justinus Kerner is the godfather of botulism research. The role of BoNT in urology has evolved exponentially and it is widely used as an adjuvant in voiding dysfunction. In the future, its utility will broaden and guide the urologist in managing various urological disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20664247/"}

The Spanish health system offers almost universal coverage, a wide variety of services and a high-quality network of hospitals and primary care centers. Spain has a specialized health care training system that is highly developed, highly regulated, with the capacity to provide high-quality training in 54 different specialties. Nephrology is basically a hospital-based specialty. There are no private dialysis patients in Spain. Hemodialysis centers are 40% public, 15% private and 45% run by companies. The National Health System covers 95% of the population, and there is no cost to patients for treatment of renal disease (dialysis and transplant). We observed a clear decrease of nephrology in residents' election rankings, with position 29 out of 47 specialties in 2007. Some of the reasons for this are the complexity of the subject, no clear information at the university, reduction of professional posts and a very good public service with minimal private practice. In Spain, a model of organization for transplantation was adopted based on a decentralized transplant coordinating network. For cadaveric donors, it compares favorably with rates in other Western countries. Living donor transplantation is very low in Spain--just 10% of total renal transplantation activity. New programs due to financial constraints need to include reduced dialysis costs, greater cost-effectiveness of prescriptions, better handling of ethical issues related to the need for using a clinical score of chronic kidney disease patients to make decisions about conservative or renal replacement therapy and an action plan for improvement of organ donation and transplantation. Recovery of skills (acute kidney injury, biopsies, vascular access, etc.), research and advances in autonomous activities (imaging, surgical and medical vascular training, etc.) are some of the future educational paths needed in nephrology. Adequate decisions in the context of economic restrictions need to be discussed for the sustainability of nephrological care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688247/"}

Studies are mixed regarding the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infections. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an evidence-based protocol that reduces unnecessary antibiotic use while avoiding an increase in urinary tract infections. We created a clinic antibiogram based on all urology office visits performed during a 2-year period. Bacterial resistance rates, institutional risk related data and clinical guidelines were applied to create a protocol for antibiotic administration before cystourethroscopy. We then analyzed 1,245 consecutive patients without a renal transplant who underwent outpatient cystourethroscopy, including 610 after protocol initiation. Urinary tract infection rates and antibiotic use were analyzed for an association with the protocol change using the Fisher exact test. Cultures had an overall 20% rate of resistance to fluoroquinolones, representing 40% of the cultures that grew Escherichia coli. Before the protocol change 602 of 635 patients (94.8%) received a preprocedural antibiotic compared to 426 of 610 (69.9%) after protocol initiation (p <0.01). A total of 19 patients (3.0%) had a symptomatic urinary tract infection prior to the protocol change while 16 (2.6%) had a urinary tract infection after the change (p = 0.69). Regarding resistance, fluoroquinolone resistant organisms grew in the cultures of 12 of 19 patients (63.2%) with a urinary tract infection before the protocol change compared to 5 of 16 (31.3%) with a urinary tract infection after the change. Recent antibiotic administration, hospitalization and chronic catheterization were associated with urinary tract infection in the entire cohort (all p ≤0.01).

Experimental studies suggest that abnormalities in T and, possibly, B cells may represent one initial pathogenic trigger, leading to podocyte injury and progressive loss. New data also support the existence of circulating permeability factors able to damage the podocytes, but no single molecule has been consistently identified as the causal pathogenic element in FSGS recurrence. Unfortunately, major progress from mechanistic studies has not translated into substantial advancements in patient treatment, with plasmapheresis (PP) and high doses of cyclosporine (CsA) remaining the mainstays of therapy. Despite consistent experimental and clinical evidence that treatment of proteinuria slows renal function decline in proteinuric nephropathies, maximal use of antiproteinuric agents such as renin angiotensin system antagonists is not routine in the management of FSGS recurrence.

Treatment withdrawal rate was 42% after one month, being most withdrawals before 14 days (19 cases, 40%). The causes of withdrawal were local discomfort (11 cases, 23%) and difficult insertion (3 cases, 6%).

Multivariable logistic regression analysis evaluated potential predictors of suboptimal renal function at 1 mo. Overall, 148 RAKTs were performed during the study period. Of these, 21/148 (14.2%) used GMVs; in all cases, single arterial and venous anastomoses could be performed after vascular reconstruction. Median anastomoses and rewarming times did not differ significantly between the GMV and GSV groups.

For the past several decades Dr. Rosivall has been a charismatic leader of academic institutions, national and international societies, foundations in physiology, nephrology and hypertension, but the most important of his many contributions, is his role as a scientist. He earned his MD with Summa cum Laude at Semmelweis University (1973) and was invited immediately after that to join the laboratory of Hársing. He studied the distribution of intra-renal blood flow employing then state-of-the-art methods as well as developed his own technique at Semmelweis University and at the University of Bergen with Knut Aukland. This led to his PhD thesis and degree in 1980. An important determinant of his early basic scientific training and development was his postdoctoral research fellowship and later many visiting professorships in the Nephrology Research and Training Center (NRTC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA between 1981 and 1983. Actually, this research fellowship not only impacted his own future career, but it also cleared the path for many other young Hungarian scientists who later trained with Dr. Rosivall and then at UAB. The early 1980s were the years of significant scientific discoveries and the NRTC team at UAB made important contributions by their studies on renal and glomerular hemodynamics, the renin-angiotensin system (12, 19, 22) and by the development of classic experimental techniques like renal micropuncture, microperfusion, and the juxtamedullary nephron preparation (3) that are still being used worldwide. When Dr. Rosivall joined UAB in the 1980s, the team at the NRTC included Drs.

In this manuscript, we provide detailed discussion of relevant cases in which clinical genetic testing using a kidney gene panel was applied. The cases demonstrate identification of pathogenic variants for monogenic diseases-contrasting them from genetic risk alleles-and bring up diagnostic limitations and diagnostic utility of these tests in nephrology. This review aims to guide clinicians in formulating pretest conversations with their patients, interpreting genetic variant nomenclature, and considering follow-up investigations. Although providers are gaining experience, there is still risk of testing causing more anxiety than benefit. However, with provider education and support, clinical genetic testing applied to otherwise unexplained kidney-related disorders will increasingly serve as a valuable diagnostic tool with the potential to reshape how we consider and treat many kidney-related diagnoses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36245662/"}

{"id": "25218582", "title": "Achievements and perspectives in prostate cancer phase 3 trials from genitourinary research groups in Europe: introducing the Prostate Cancer Consortium in Europe.", "text": "Phase 3 trials have made major contributions to advances in prostate cancer (PCa). However, funding limitations and excess bureaucracy are now making it difficult to conduct trials. To describe the collaborative groups in Europe and their academic phase 3 PCa trials. Leaders of collaborative groups from Scandinavia, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Ireland were asked to provide information. Approximately 40 academic European phase 3 trials focussing on PCa have been completed, and about 10 are accruing patients. Cross-border trials have been successfully conducted led by EORTC (11), Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (9), European Association of Urology (1), Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficiency (STAMPEDE) (1), and the French Genito-Urinary Tumor Group (1). Among these studies were practise-changing trials showing the superiority of prostatectomy over watchful waiting in patients <65 yr of age, the benefits of combining androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiation therapy (RXT) in high-risk localised disease, the superiority of long-term versus short-term ADT, the benefit of RXT in men treated with ADT, and the role of adjuvant RXT. To bridge the numbers gap for phase 3 studies, the Prostate Cancer Consortium in Europe (PEACE) is a recently established initiative that aims to favour cross-border networks of investigators. PEACE 1 is testing the addition of abiraterone and that of RXT directed at the primary cancer in patients with de novo metastatic PCa treated with ADT. PEACE 2 is testing the addition of cabazitaxel and that of pelvic irradiation in patients with at least two criteria for high-risk localised PCa. European academic phase 3 trials have contributed to establishing the current standard treatment of PCa. The PEACE consortium was recently tasked with the goal of addressing unanswered questions and specific biology-related issues more efficiently. The Prostate Cancer Consortium in Europe was established to conduct comparative trials aiming at assessing new treatments for prostate cancer patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25218582/"}

{"id": "29569211", "title": "Recommendations for urological follow-up of patients with neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal cord injury.", "text": "To review currently available guidelines and recommendations regarding urological follow-up of patients after spinal cord injury (SCI) and present an evidence-based summary to support clinicians in their clinical practice. Maximum data were collected according to different methods, including searches with multiple and specific keywords, reference checks, gray literature searches (congress reports, working papers, statement documents), and browsing-related Web site access. Obtained data were analyzed with the modified version of the Oxford grading system for recommendations using levels of evidence (LE) and grades of recommendation (GR). Different surveillance strategies exist, but there is no consensus among authors and organizations. As a result, practice patterns vary around the world. The present review indicates that proper urological follow-up of SCI patients should consist of medical history (LE 1-4, GR B-C), clinical examination (LE 4, GR C), renal laboratory tests (LE 1-3, GR B), imaging surveillance of the upper urinary tract (LE 1-3, GR A-B), urodynamic study (LE 2-4, GR B-C), and cystoscopy/cytology (LE 1-4, GR D). Clinicians agree that SCI patients should be followed up regularly with an individually tailored approach. A 1-year follow-up schedule seems reasonable in SCI patients without additional risk factors of renal deterioration (LE 3-4, GR C). In those who manifest risk factors, report changes in bladder behavior, or present with already developed complications of neurogenic bladder dysfunction, follow-up plans should be modified with more frequent checkups (LE 4, GR C). Urodynamic study should be repeated and considered as a routine monitoring strategy. Individuals with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction are at increased risk of multiple complications. Nevertheless, proper follow-up after SCI improves the prognosis for these patients and their quality of life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29569211/"}
{"id": "22050527", "title": "Urologic applications of engineered tissue.", "text": "Many congenital and acquired anomalies affect the genitourinary tract, necessitating surgical intervention. Among these are bladder exstrophy, hypospadias, epispadias, posterior urethral valves, myelomeningocele, bladder carcinoma, urethral stricture disease, stress urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, vesicoureteral reflux and traumatic injuries of the urinary tract. Surgical repair of these conditions often utilizes skin, oral mucosa or bowel autograft or xenograft material to replace missing tissue or to augment inadequate tissues. These materials are often sufficient to restore the basic anatomy of the organ to which they are being grafted, but they usually do not completely restore normal function. In addition, postoperative complications are common, especially in the case of bladder augmentation or neobladder creation with autologous bowel. The complications and inherent limitations of these procedures may be mitigated by the availability of alternative tissue sources. Therefore, there has been a great deal of interest in developing tissues engineered from autologous materials, such as mature bladder cells, bone marrow-derived stem cells and adipose tissue. Ideally, an engineered tissue would restore or preserve the normal function of the organ it is augmenting or replacing. In addition, the engineered tissue should be nonimmunogenic to minimize rejection or foreign-body reactions. For the purposes of this article, we will focus on selection of scaffolding materials, selection of cell sources, and the current applications and potential future roles of tissue engineering in urology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22050527/"}
