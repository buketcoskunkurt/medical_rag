Nevertheless, this document aims to define a path whereby the EAU can play a pivotal role in ensuring the highest standard of care throughout Europe, and by setting standards, throughout the rest of the world. The future of urology will be dependent on improved education and training leading to high quality urological care, and to developing a service that is patient focused. The patient focus is becoming increasingly important in urology. This means providing full information about disease processes and urological procedures to patients and allowing them to judge the quality of the urological service that they may choose. Education must start in medical school and as 5% of community medical practice is urology then every medical student must receive urological training. This also applies to nurses and the other professions allied to medicine (PAMS). The EAU should provide a urological curriculum for training of medical students, nurses and PAMS, as well as the more conventional curriculum for postgraduate training and continued medical education for urological specialists. An integrated EAU Knowledge and Learning Centre would provide an invaluable resource to patients and to those who deliver urologic care alike. With high quality training must come a vigorous assessment of knowledge and competence. In the future, the competence of all those delivering urological care will need to be assessed. For urologists in training and specialist urologists this will include not only an assessment of knowledge but an assessment of surgical competence. Improving quality will be supported by the continued subspecialisation of urology, ensuring that all urologists have a surgical portfolio which ensures their competency in the procedures they deliver. This will inevitably result in a concentration of urological services and indeed to the development of larger urological centres. The concept of Centres of Excellence could be developed to include all aspects and subspecialties of urological care. The SPO envisages that all urology will be carried out in Centres of Excellence which will vary in terms of their size and the range of urology offered, but nevertheless all urological care will be of the highest quality. Finally, the future of urology will depend on the medico-political interface and the EAU has a great deal to offer in this respect. The patterns of urological care differ throughout Europe but this should be seen as a challenge for the EAU to define quality, irrespective of the different methods of healthcare provision. The EAU has made extraordinary advances in the last two decades and the SPO hope this document will support the EAU's efforts to maintain its aim of improving urological care for the benefit of patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22137602/"}

A postdoctoral lecture qualification (habilitation), which is mandatory for a successful scientific career, is achieved significantly less often by female urologists in Germany than by their male colleagues. To identify factors to effectively promote female urologists into academic leadership positions, the current situation, as well as factors influencing successful habilitation of women who are members of the German Society of Urology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Urologie [DGU]) were investigated. An online questionnaire was distributed to 1343 female members of the DGU in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The responses of 521 women were statistically analyzed with respect to baseline characteristics and in relation to research funding. The primary endpoint of our study was the habilitation rate. The average age of the 521 participating female urologists who completed the questionnaire was 37 years (range 21-67 years). Of these, most female physicians were in postgraduate training (n = 168, 32%), worked full-time (n = 324, 62%), and had children (n = 277, 53%). Overall, 359 (69%) of the participants had a PhD and 63 (12%) were still working on their PhD. Thirty (5.8%) female urologists had a habilitation. In univariable logistic regression models, age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06), working time model (part-time OR 0.19), a research fellowship (OR 21.4), release from clinical work for research purposes (OR 13.7), and participation in a funding program (OR 6.9) or mentoring program (OR 7.0) were independent predictors of achieving habilitation. Whether a urologist had children was not an independent predictor of achieving habilitation. In multivariable logistic regression models, age (OR 1.08), and a research fellowship (OR 9.04) were independent predictors of achieving habilitation. Promoting habilitation among female urologists is required in order to increase the proportion of women in leading academic positions. The results of the data analysis show that the promotion of research fellowships explicitly for women could be a promising approach.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35925114/"}

The background of the origins of this new specialty and the elements that were responsible for it have not been studied in detail, although this information is relevant in view of contemporary challenges. The existing literature on the history of Urology and original contemporary documents have been researched and analysed. The information gathered has been matched with documentation on general history. Urology started as a specialty on its own, separate from (general) surgery, as a consequence of events and decisions after the French Revolution. Before the French Revolution (<1789) there was no well organised healthcare in France, but the French political revolution caused also a medical revolution. The need for further subspecialisation, also within surgery, as a consequence of the revolutionary principles, prompted some brave individuals to limit their activities to specific organs. Several revolutionaries were surgeons specialised in urogenital surgery, and prepared the way for a surgical subspecialty. Jean Civiale developed and promoted specific skills in open and endoscopic interventions of the urogenital tract. Finally Felix Guyon was accepted at the University of Paris as 'Professeur d'Urologie' in 1890, and changed the name of his department into 'Service d'Urologie'. Urology was a fact. Urology as a separate surgical specialty is the consequence of medical and non-medical developments after the French revolution.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606055/"}

This article describes and discusses the main changes in the system for the specialty of urology insofar as they concern the structure of the DRG system and the catalogues of diagnoses (ICD) and of procedures (OPS). The 2007 edition of the DRG system leads to numerous changes for urology. There are new OPS codes for partial resection of the kidney, treatment of urinary incontinence and radical resection in the pelvis minor. Additional payment for implantation of a prosthetic penis is divided with reference to the type of prosthesis. At DRG level, new DRG splits are found depending on the PCCL and patient age. Combination operations on the bladder and bowel and on the male genitalia are assigned to newly established DRGs. The changes described enhance the professional accuracy of the representations of urological care provision. New strategies designed to solve problems in representation have been established (e.g. multi-step interventions).

Rotations in the interdisciplinary intermediate care unit offer the opportunity to become familiar with the care of complex disease processes, including the differential diagnostic assessment of abdominal diseases, which is important in urology. In summary, the diversity of urological training available can enable junior urologists to receive more individualised and targeted training by promoting multilayered, intersectoral as well as interprofessional training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35925290/"}

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) represents a potential therapeutic modality for tissue destruction due to its very high energy and its capacity to precisely reach a target with a very short emission time. The authors review the current state of art of HIFU in urology at a time when its indication in prostate cancer is being defined. After a brief description of the main physical principles of ultrasound and the main data determining focussing of high energy ultrasound, the main machines available (research and clinical) are described. The published clinical literature concerning the tissue destructive action in urology is reviewed. HIFU has been used in urology to treat renal, vesical, prostatic (BPH and cancer), and external genital organ lesions. Purely extracorporeal machines are gradually being replaced by intracorporeal procedures, especially transrectal techniques for prostatic lesions. The quality of ultrasound detection of the target still limits the use of this minimally invasive modality. The intervening tissues are spared with a good therapeutic efficacy on the target tissues, provided optimal firing parameters are used. HIFU has a demonstrated potential in the treatment of prostate cancer and studies conducted by several teams have defined the technique and its efficacy. Other indications have been studied, but must be validated by further clinical trials. The future will probably see the design of machines adapted to a specific target tissue rather than a single multidisciplinary extracorporeal machine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11217545/"}

Declining undergraduate exposure and the preference for \"lifestyle specialties\" may jeopardize urology's popularity. Our objective was to assess trends in application and matching rates to urology compared with other surgical specialties. We reviewed data collected by Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) and the Canadian Post-MD Education Registry since expansion in Canadian medical school enrollment began (2002-2011). The following were examined: applicant preference, number of positions, gender patterns, and match results. \"Surgery\" included general surgery, orthopedics, plastics, ENT, and urology. From 2002 to 2011 CaRMS applicants increased from 1117 to 2528 (126%). The number of applicants selecting surgery first increased from 178 to 338(90%). The number of surgery positions increased from 138 to 275 (100%). Urology positions increased from 15 to 31 (113%). Applicants to urology increased only 40% (30-42). The proportion of all CARMs applicants selecting urology as their first choice decreased from 2.7% (30) to 1.7% (42). The ratio of first choice urology applicants to positions decreased from 2 to 1.35. The probability of matching urology as first choice increased from 50% to 76%. Female medical graduates increased from 51% to 58%. The female applicants selecting surgery first increased from 21% (49) to 41% (173). In contrast, females selecting urology first rose from 13% (4) to 17% (7). Urology in Canada is becoming less competitive. Residency positions have doubled since 2002 whereas the number of applicants remains static. This trend was not reflected in other surgical specialities. Factors accounting for this may include poor undergraduate exposure, demand for specialties with controllable lifestyles, gender shifts in undergraduate medicine, and lack of role models. The need for undergraduate exposure to urology and vetting numbers of residency positions remains a matter of paramount importance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23725943/"}

The survey covered 3 topics: 1) basic characteristics of the participants, 2) general and 3) subjective influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinics and further residency training. A total of 50 residents took part in the survey; 54% were women. The median age was 31 years. Most of the participants were in their 2nd (22%) and 5th (26%) year of training and worked in a university hospital (44%) or in a clinic of maximum care (30%). 38% of the respondents stated that they only served urological emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 28% this meant a very large delay (80-100%) in the specialisation, while 28% stated only a minor impact. 66% documented training impairments caused by fewer operations, low patient numbers in the outpatient department (50%), congress (50%) and workshop (44%) cancellations. 46% of residents reported direct contact with COVID-19 patients while 10% were deployed on interdisciplinary IMC units. Numerous physical distancing and hygiene measures have been implemented by the clinics. On average, around 50% of the urology residents indicated significant restrictions in training due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The delay in training cannot currently be measured in units of time, but it can be assumed that training for residents during the pandemic is likely to be of a lower quality compared to previous generations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35580617/"}

The overriding principle is that patient safety must take priority over all other considerations in the conduct of live surgery. Controversy exists regarding the true educational value of live surgical demonstrations on patients at surgical meetings. An EAU committee of experts developed a policy on how best to conduct live surgery at urologic meetings.

In Byzantium it was not unusual for prominent people to have many surnames according to their work, political status etc. For his piety two surnames were given to Theophilus : Philotheus (the person who loves god) and Philaretus (Virtuous). These last surnames gave rise to confusion and historians believed that two different medical men lived in Byzantium during the seventh century. Theophilus and Philaretus. This probably was the result of an error in the copies of ancient codes and erroneous translations to the old Latin manuscripts. These errors have been corrected after the studies of Corlieu who stated in 1885 that Theophilus and Philaretus were the same person. The written work left by Theophilus is very extensive.

However, the main drawback of laparoscopy is a steep learning curve, which results from the significant changes in the surgical environment. Although laparoscopy can provide important advantages for the patient, including decreased length of hospitalization, decreased analgesic requirement, and a shortened postoperative convalescence, one concern has been whether laparoscopic techniques should be learned solely in the operating room. For example, sports, music, and aviation are practiced before an actual performance is ever undertaken. In this review, the advantages and limitations of all available training modalities in minimally invasive surgery are described. Testing basic laparoscopic skills on inanimate models, becoming familiar with the principles of dissection and hemostasis on living animals, and studying surgical anatomy on cadavers should be considered as indispensable and complementary elements for laparoscopic training in the future. In addition, telementoring with the help of modern image processing and virtual reality eventually may become the basis of tomorrow's surgical instruction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12648430/"}

The objective of this study was to determine the selection criteria used by medical students to choose their urology teaching materials, in preparation for the national entrance examination. A questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical students (4th and 6th year students) preparing for the national entrance examination. This questionnaire comprised three parts: (1) information about the student (medical school, attendance of lectures, participation in intern conferences); (2) student's level of satisfaction with the teaching material provided;(3) criteria of choice (18 items) of the photocopies used. Out of the 200 students completing the questionnaire, only 32% used teaching material provided by the university and 22% reported that their medical school did not provide Urology teaching material. Fifty-nine percent of students thought that this teaching material was \"moderately\" to \"not at all adapted\" to the national entrance examination programme and 70% considered that they were \"moderately\" to \"not at all\" prepared for the national entrance examination. We noted that 83.5% of students thought that intern conferences were \"useful\" to \"very useful\" to prepare the urology module of the national entrance examination and 85% thought that photocopies were \"useful\" to \"very useful\" to prepare the national entrance examination. The College of urology photocopies were the most widely used teaching material: 38% of students. The four most important criteria of choices were \"their peers' opinion\", \"the style of presentation and writing\" and \"advice from interns\". \"The author\" and \"price\" were only rated in 11th and 12th positions.

Prospective study of all patients who had a remote teleconsultation over a 2-week period during COVID-19 pandemic. Main outcome was the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions related to teleconsultation compared to face-to-face consultation and was calculated as: total teleconsultation CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions-total face-to-face consultation CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions. Secondary outcome measures were the reduction in travel distance and travel time related to teleconsultation. Eighty patients were included. Face-to-face consultations would have resulted in 6699km (4162 miles) of travel (83.7km (52 miles) per patient). Cars were the usual means of transport. CO<sub>2</sub>e avoided due to lack of travel was calculated at 1.1 tonnes. Teleconsultation was responsible for 1.1kg CO<sub>2</sub>e while face-to-face consultation emitted 0.5kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e. Overall, the total reduction in GHGs with teleconsultation was 1141kg CO<sub>2</sub>e, representing a 99% decrease in emissions. Total savings on transport were 974 € and savings on travel time were 112h (1.4h/patient). Teleconsultation reduces the environmental impact of face-to-face consultations. The use of teleconsultation in our urology departments resulted in the avoidance of more than 6000km of travel, equivalent to a reduction of 1.1 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e.

This work reviews the current nomenclature for urologic imaging used in clinical practice and proposes a taxonomy and terminology for urologic imaging studies. A list of terms used in urologic imaging were compiled from guidelines published by the European Association of Urology and the American Urological Association and from the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. Terms searched were grouped into broad categories based on technology, and imaging terms were further stratified based on the anatomic extent, contrast or phases, technique or modifiers, and combinations or fusions. Terms that had a high degree of utilisation were classified as accepted. We propose a new taxonomy to define a more useful and acceptable nomenclature model acceptable to all health professionals involved in urology. The major advantage of a taxonomic approach to the classification of urologic imaging studies is that it provides a flexible framework for classifying the modifications of current imaging modalities and allows the incorporation of new imaging modalities. The adoption of this hierarchical classification model ranging from the most general to the most detailed descriptions should facilitate hierarchical searches of the medical literature using both general and specific terms. This work is limited in its scope, as it is not currently all-inclusive. This will hopefully be addressed by future modification as others embrace the concept and work towards uniformity in nomenclature. This paper provides a noncomprehensive list of the most widely used terms across different specialties. This list can be used as the basis for further discussion, development, and enhancement.

Logistic regression focused on year and journal revealed that studies published in 2017 and Urology were more likely to be negative. The vast majority of studies within the urologic literature are positive, with only a small increase in negative study publication comparing 2012 vs 2017. Continued efforts are needed to identify publication bias and promote dissemination of negative research findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32882304/"}

An e-questionnaire was sent to 1600 students in 16 teaching faculties during the last year of their second cycle. Overall, we obtained 590 answers (36.8%). In our population, 70.2% of the students were women. Of them, 24.1% had been already enrolled in an academic urology unit. Urology was defined as a medical, surgical and medico-surgical discipline by 3.7%, 37.8% and 58% of the students, respectively. Urology was considered as very important, important, not very important and not important at all by 5.1%, 54.4%, 37.5% and 2.4% of the students. The teaching methods used to learn urology were duplicated-notes for ENC preparation (45.3%), conferences for ENC (French national ranking exam) preparation (43.7%), courses of the national urology college (38.6%) and courses of the faculty (32%). The best mastered items were lithiasis disease (86.3%), voiding dysfunction (76.3%) and urological cancers (56.7%). On the contrary, only 34.7% and 28% considered their knowledge sufficient on the erectile dysfunctions and on renal transplantation. Lastly, 7.3% intended to become urologists. Having a work experience in a urology unit was significantly associated to the feeling of being prepared to become an intern (p<0.001) and to the project of becoming a urologist (p<0.001). Urology was considered like an important discipline by half of the students at the end of the second cycle even though it is under-represented in the national teaching programme for ENC. A third of the students used courses from the faculty to learn urology and a quarter of them had a work experience in a urology unit during their second cycle.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20471583/"}

Stress in the daily working routine, not enough free time, too little pay, or too little compensatory time off for overtime as well as inadequate options for continuing education were reported to be the main elements of dissatisfaction. The economic pressure of day-to-day work continues to define the physician's role and places demands on the medical staff by burdening them with nonmedical and administrative tasks.The major causes mentioned were staff shortage and lack of support provided by supervisors and the administration. For this reason, human resource development should be considered a strategic and central goal. This requires a normative, cross-functional approach at all levels of management and inclusion of personnel departments in the strategic processes of the hospital. The most important aspects for resident satisfaction were the work environment, acceptable work-life balance and remuneration, compensation for overtime, and quality of available continuing education, which is often rated as being insufficient.Effective strategies to improve the motivation of residents comprise offering opportunities for structured continuing education, optimizing the everyday work processes, and involving employees in social networks. The establishment of feedback strategies, including recognition of residents' achievements, will help to ensure their loyalty and identification with their clinic.

In a Germany-wide online survey conducted between May and July 2024, 32 questions were asked about patient care, further training and other indications, among other things. In addition, an assessment of the outpatient potential for URS for ureteral and kidney stones and hydrocele resections was requested. A total of 364 urologists responded to the survey: 54.5% were in private practice and 45.5% worked in hospitals. 91.1% were active surgeons. The concept of hybrid DRGs was rated positively by 34% of those working in surgery, but 68% saw no relief in their everyday work. 51% expressed concerns about the negative impact on further training. The proportion of URS performed on an outpatient basis in 2023 was 21% (ureteral stones) and 11% (kidney stones), with a long-term potential increase of up to 33%. Two thirds of hydrocele resections were already performed on an outpatient basis, and 74% of respondents considered these to be billable in a hybrid DRG.

The certifying examination was administered to 694 candidates (335 in 2023 and 359 in 2024). Each candidate was administered two 5-item OSCEs and four 10-item standard oral examinations (SOEs). One OSCE focused on P/C with simulated patient (SP) actors and one on diagnosis/imaging. SP actors interacted with examinees on the 10-minute P/C OSCE. A criterion-referenced standard was used for pass/fail decisions, and the Rasch model was used for scoring. The candidate's mean score and protocol difficulty did not differ significantly from 2023 to 2024. Reliability with the P/C and diagnostic OSCEs was similar both years. In 2023, the diagnostic OSCE had a higher average score than the P/C OSCE, with both OSCEs scoring higher than the SOEs. In 2024, the average diagnostic OSCE score was higher than that of the P/C OSCE and SOEs, which had similar scores. There was low correlation between the OSCEs and SOEs both years. The initial experience of P/C OSCEs on the American Board of Urology certification examination showed acceptable scoring, reliability, and low correlation with standard protocols.

The present, academicals Urology Clinic was founded nearly half a century ago. Its founder and first head doctor was Prof. Alfons A. Wojewski. Felix Hagen, the first chief of urology in Stettin, was born one hundred and thirty years ago on 27 May 1880 in Berlin. The aims of this publication are to present a brief outline of the life and work of this hard working urologist, to show the part he played in the foundation and development of the first ward of urology in Stettin, and to describe his activity in those historically so stormy times. The beginning of urology in Stettin after the World War II is briefly described, as well. The first urological ward of 30 beds in Municipal Hospital of Stettin (today Szczecin) was duly opened in 1919. Its head became a 39-years-old Dr. Felix Hagen a \"specialist in urinary, bladder and kidney diseases\"--from Berlin. In addition to his clinical activity, Dr. Hagen worked in his own urological practise in Stettin. In October 1935, the position of the head of the urological department was terminated, and urology was incorporated in the department of surgery. Thereafter Dr. Hagen was engaged exclusively in his private practice. After 26 years working in Stettin, in February 1945, Dr. Hagen and his wife left Stettin just before invading soviet army for Erfurt. Birth of urology, its slow beginnings, and its struggle for full autonomy and separation from surgery were laborious and difficult. It was only the combination of the political changes in Europe, due to the second World War and changes of Polish boundaries and the personality engagement of Prof. Alfons Wojewski, and the helpful attitude of the Prof. Władysław Heftmann and authorities of the Pomeranian Medical Academy (PAM) that finally brought about the creation of an independent Urology Clinic in Szczecin, in 1962.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21469292/"}

The questions covered 213 of the 252 residents preparing their specialty at the time in Spain. From their answers it can be deduced that a Teaching Service attends 30-35 beds (although there are exceptions) with 8-10 attached physicians, 5 residents on average. They are well equipped (although marked differences can be noted), they mainly do calls in their specialty and most of the services have been training residents for more than eight years. The Heads of the Teaching Services believe the MIR programme is the best way to prepare the degree, although an important portion postulates it should not be the only one.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8677809/"}

This problem continues during residency, especially in surgical subspecialities. The different medical boards in Germany responsible for the training programs have no concepts.

Strengths of urological residency training incorporate the attractiveness of the specialty itself, and the residency training curriculum in urology (\"Weiterbildungscurriculum Urologie\", WECU), including the networking of inpatient and outpatient training and accompanying internal and external further training. The German Society of Residents in Urology (GeSRU) also provides a networking platform for residents. Weaknesses include country-specific differences and a lack of checkpoints during residency training. Opportunities for urological continuing education arise from freelance work, digitalization, and technical and medical progress. In contrast, the aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic, with still limited staff and surgical capacities, an increased psychosocial workload, and the rising number of outpatient treatments in urology pose threats for urological residency programs.

In addition, a questionnaire consisting of epidemiological data, their opinion on the quality of education in anatomy and the willingness to have more courses on this subject was included in the examination. The same scale based on a score out of 20 was applied to both populations. Of the 501 AFUF members solicited, 144 answered all the questions (28.7%). The mean score for urologists was lower than that of DFGSM3 students (10.56±1.82 vs. 11.4±2.37 respectively) (P=0.0013). Moreover, the desire for further education in anatomy was widespread among urologists (87%). According to our study, urologists have less knowledge of urogenital anatomy than third year medical students.

In the future, synthetic biomaterials will have an almost unlimited range of mechanical properties allowing much more specific applications. Another improvement of materials will concern a reduction of the risk of infection, erosion, mineral deposits, migration of particles, secondary reactions, and finally improved durability.

For urologists, the changing political environment in Germany after 1933 offered possibilities to assert their personal and professional interests. Unfortunately, in many cases, moral principles were thrown overboard, and physicians advanced their own careers and the specialty of urology at the expense of their patients and their Jewish colleagues.

He also contributed to reform of the educational system, and to bringing order to the badly neglected city of Cracow. He belonged to the so-called New Vienna School of Medicine. Dietl, chief physician at the Wieden Hospital in Vienna since 1941, had voiced his disbelief in the existing therapy in such strong terms that it was recorded in the history of medicine as the program of therapeutic nihilism. Dietl demonstrated experimentally in Vienna and Cracow that bloodletting in pneumonia is not indicated, since it does not promote recovery and is indeed harmful, raising mortality rates three times compared to those patients who had received dietary treatment only. He eliminated bloodletting in pneumonia therapy. Dietl was the first to investigate and classify Galician and Silesian therapeutic springs as well as work out detailed prescriptions for spa treatments. He understood that treatment in a health resort could not be limited to balneotherapy, and he indicated that climatotherapy and physiotherapy should also play a role. Dietl described the crisis attributable to a kink in the renal vessels or ureter when the kidney dropped. It was also Dietl who gave a description of the floating kidney problem and of kidney partial incarceration, a condition still known as Dietl's crisis. He recommended conservative therapy for these cases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16307223/"}

The objective of this study was to assess the theoretical, practical and assessment modalities of Urology teaching based on a survey. In January 2004, a four-part questionnaire was sent to all urology teachers in 45 French universities. These 4 parts concerned: modalities of theoretical teaching, modalities of practical teaching, assessment modalities, evaluation of teaching, each evaluated by several questions. The response rate was 64.4% (29/45). Twelve medical schools chose teaching by speciality poles and 15 chose modular teaching. CCAs (Senior Registrars) played a greater role in modular teaching than in speciality pole teaching (75% and 53.3% of medical schools). Among the 12 medical schools with a speciality pole organization, 7 provided integrated teaching. An average of 23% of students of any one year receive Urology teaching during their training. Most medical schools conduct evaluation of theoretical (82.7%) and practical teaching (65.5%). Speciality teaching can be performed according to a polar or modular organization. A modular organization would be theoretically more appropriate to achieve the objective of a global approach to medicine, but artificial grouping of diseases can sometimes complicate speciality teaching in a speciality as diverse as Urology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16097148/"}

The PF was scored (out of 20) and contributed to validation of the session. Students completed a satisfaction questionnaire. All students were validated (mean score: 14.2/20). Results of the satisfaction questionnaire showed that, although no student had previously performed a PF, 27/30 expressed the desire to establish a PF for another training attachment.

Biochemical recurrence was the most common endpoint for statistical analysis. Most studies found that the new ISUP 2014/WHO 2016 grading system provides higher prognostic accuracy than the former Gleason grading. Notably, however, only a subset of studies clearly demonstrated that the archived samples were not only re-grouped according to the new grade groups, but also re-graded according to the new histomorphological 2014 ISUP criteria.  The prognostic accuracy of the ISUP 2014/WHO 2016 grade groups was confirmed by the majority of the studies.

The groups of junior scientists who pursued research (partially) during working hours, who had good skills and whose research skills were supported by a mentor/network had significantly more peer-reviewed publications than their counterparts. Junior scientists in urology in Germany lack protected time to pursue research and have varying research skills, which are predominantly acquired by self-study and demonstrate their first research output as peer-reviewed publications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27924352/"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of urology practice-oriented courses for German students in a skills laboratory with respect to acceptance, learning success and enthusiasm of the students for urology. Transurethral catheterization, digital rectal examination and kidney/bladder sonography were trained in the urology course. Using a 12-point questionnaire, acceptance and quality of the training were evaluated. Learning success was checked using a urological OSCE-station (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). Additionally, participants were questioned on interest in urology and the consideration of future work in the field (medical elective or practical year). A total of 147 questionnaires from 190 participating students were suitable for analysis. Acceptance and quality of training were highly ranked accompanied by a very satisfying objective and subjective learning success. Interest for urology was stimulated in 98.4 % and future work in urology was imaginable for 60.4 % of the students. Practice-oriented urology student courses show high acceptance, high learning success and increase of attractiveness of urology. The training of urological skills represents a sufficient tool to entice students for urology and is helpful in enhancing the future of urology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23900484/"}

Seminal developments have been made in the selective effectiveness of drugs influencing neurogenic bladder dysfunction but having limited side effects. Additional advances are also likely to be made in the methods of functional electrostimulation and tissue engineering. Neurourology is predominantly influenced by our dynamic-functional understanding and the functionally oriented planning and implementation of treatment. The initial treatment options in many areas of neurourology are conservative, but, when possible, not irreversible. If these are ineffective or lead to late complications (e.g. by congenital paraplegia), there are a series of organ sparing or organ manipulating operations which can restore organ function. These make it possible to save kidney function from continuing damage, and, in many cases, to restore continence. The permanent indwelling catheter should remain excluded from the treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. With adequate treatment, patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction can be protected from severe complications and reintegrated into their normal social environment. After the acute phase of rehabilitation, urology is the most commonly required specialist area for paraplegic patients. In the past, urological problems have contributed most to the short lifespan of patients with an accident related spinal cord injury. Using modern neurourological treatment strategies, not only is lifespan increased but the quality of life of the patient is permanently improved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437249/"}

We calculated the absolute availability of residents during their residency for working models in 1996, 2000, 2007 and 2017. As a basis we used the working model of 1996 as no compensatory time-off for being on call was used. All days on which a delayed start is planned and no schedule in daily routine is possible had been excluded from education time. The numbers implemented in the regulation on further education in the corresponding years had been used to calculate the expenditure of time on the basis of median length of the different intervention. In addition, the patient numbers on the ward and our outpatient clinic had been documented over time. With increasing patient numbers in the in- and outpatient clinic there is a continuous decreasing time available for education. The absolute available time in our department is calculated to be 3.1 years compared to 5 years in 1996. With the first day of training a resident has to complete 66.9 min of self-contained diagnostics or interventions per day in addition to clinical routine and administration to meet the requested numbers of the regulation on further education.

Between March 2023 and October 2023, 259 urological clinics and a representative sample of 280 outpatient urologists nationwide were surveyed about their UDS procedures. Data on methods, personnel and indications were collected. In all, 80% of clinics and 44% of practices participated. 58% of clinics performed fewer than 100 UDS annually. Only 15% of practices performed UDS themselves. Common procedures such as uroflowmetry (99%) and cystometry (98%) are widely implemented, whereas video urodynamics (53%) are less frequent. The most common indications in clinics are neurogenic bladder dysfunction (24%), overactive bladder (21%) and female stress incontinence (19%). Practices showed similar trends, with neurogenic bladder dysfunction (30%) and overactive bladder (26%) as primary indications. University hospitals and specialized centres performed UDS more often for complex conditions, while non-university clinics frequently addressed stress incontinence. Despite declining numbers, UDS remain central to urological diagnostics. Indication patterns vary by clinic type.

From the start of his academic training he kept a constant union with University and cooperated in all disciplines he had relation with before he got the responsibility of teaching urology. His university spirit and great formation had the chairman of surgical pathology see the convenience of separating urology from the common trunk of surgery, a proposal that, being accepted by the staff meeting of the Faculty of Medicine of Zaragoza and submitted to the Ministry resulted in the designation of urology as an independent subject in the degree of medicine. His labour as responsible was marked by work and continuous achievements in his classes, many publications, doctorate and urological monographic courses carried out, thesis and memories directed, all of which enabled him to create to the Professional Urological Specialization School, the culmination of more than 40 years dedicated to teaching in the university. We find Prof. Romero's life completely dedicated to University and teaching. His wide urological and propedeutical formation made him a person who joined the necessary conditions and abilities to take the responsibility and carry out a satisfactory performance as responsible of teaching urology in the school of medicine of Zaragoza, a subject which thanks to his virtue and good performance was for the first time elevated to the level of independent subject.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18050760/"}

The study was of a mixed design, including qualitative and quantitative components based on focus group interviews during the European Association of Urology (EAU) Robotic Urology Section (ERUS) (2012), EAU (2013) and ERUS (2013) meetings. After introduction to the aims, principles and current status of the curriculum development, group responses were elicited. After content analysis of recorded interviews generated themes were discussed at the second meeting, where consensus was achieved on each theme. This discussion also underwent content analysis, and was used to draft a curriculum proposal. At the third meeting, a quantitative questionnaire about this curriculum was disseminated to attendees to assess the level of agreement with the key points. In all, 150 min (19 pages) of the focus group discussion was transcribed (21 316 words). Themes were agreed by two raters (median agreement κ 0.89) and they included: need for a training curriculum (inter-rater agreement κ 0.85); identification of learning needs (κ 0.83); development of the curriculum contents (κ 0.81); an overview of available curricula (κ 0.79); settings for robotic surgery training ((κ 0.89); assessment and training of trainers (κ 0.92); requirements for certification and patient safety (κ 0.83); and need for a universally standardised curriculum (κ 0.78). A training curriculum was proposed based on the above discussions. This group proposes a multi-step curriculum for robotic training.

Leaders of collaborative groups from Scandinavia, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Ireland were asked to provide information. Approximately 40 academic European phase 3 trials focussing on PCa have been completed, and about 10 are accruing patients. Cross-border trials have been successfully conducted led by EORTC (11), Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (9), European Association of Urology (1), Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficiency (STAMPEDE) (1), and the French Genito-Urinary Tumor Group (1). Among these studies were practise-changing trials showing the superiority of prostatectomy over watchful waiting in patients <65 yr of age, the benefits of combining androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiation therapy (RXT) in high-risk localised disease, the superiority of long-term versus short-term ADT, the benefit of RXT in men treated with ADT, and the role of adjuvant RXT. To bridge the numbers gap for phase 3 studies, the Prostate Cancer Consortium in Europe (PEACE) is a recently established initiative that aims to favour cross-border networks of investigators. PEACE 1 is testing the addition of abiraterone and that of RXT directed at the primary cancer in patients with de novo metastatic PCa treated with ADT. PEACE 2 is testing the addition of cabazitaxel and that of pelvic irradiation in patients with at least two criteria for high-risk localised PCa. European academic phase 3 trials have contributed to establishing the current standard treatment of PCa. The PEACE consortium was recently tasked with the goal of addressing unanswered questions and specific biology-related issues more efficiently.

The controversy over the so-called faculty paintings escalated to the point that in 1905 Klimt irrevocably distanced himself from the commission and bought back his pictures from the state. The paintings were later purchased by the Austrian Gallery and in 1943 placed in storage in Lower Austria at the Immendorf Castle where they were destroyed by a fire in May 1945 when the German troops withdrew. Besides Klimt's preliminary sketches, only black and white photographs of the three paintings now exist as well as a color reproduction of the section depicting Hygieia from the \"Medicine\" painting. Due to the public rejection of the faculty paintings, Gustav Klimt broke away from official government-commissioned art and focused on private clients from among Viennese society. One of these intensive associations was with the anatomist Emil Zuckerkandl and his wife Berta, who was very active in cultural affairs. During the dispute over the faculty paintings, Zuckerkandl was one of the few university professors who signed a petition in favor of retaining the paintings. His brother, the industrialist Victor Zuckerkandl, was one of the major collectors and patrons of Secessionist art. The third brother, the well-known urologist Otto Zuckerkandl (1861-1921), president of the Second and Third Congresses of the German Society of Urology in 1909 and 1911, was also in close contact with Klimt.

A prospective study was conducted from 1/12/1999 to 30/4/2000 with systematic use of the Bladder-Scan to measure PVR. Four operators performed three consecutive measurements of PVR and noted the following data: age, gender, history, type of disease and place of examination. The main endpoint was the need to use a complementary investigation to confirm or invalidate the result obtained. PVR was determined in 250 consecutive patients (167 males, 83 females): 191 patients admitted to the urology department, 36 patients seen in the emergency room and 23 patients seen in other departments of the hospital. PVR was estimated to be between 0 and 400 cc (median: 72 cc) for 181 patients (72%), between 400 cc and 750 cc (median: 521 cc) in 50 patients (20%) and between 750 cc and 1000 cc (median: 942 cc) for 19 patients (8%). A control of the measurement was required for 27% of patients (68/250) using catheterism (n = 53) or sonography (n = 15). In this sub-group, the value of the ICC (intra-class correlation coefficient) for the measurement of the bladder volume using the Bladder-Scan and measurement of the volume controlled by sonography or catheterism was of 0.9888 (significance < 0.0001/nil hypothesis ICC = 0). The Bladder-Scan provides a \"third hand\" in the urologist's daily practice, by supplying a reliable and rapid assessment of bladder volume for volumes < 750 cc. It is a good tool for the evaluation of postvoid residual volume.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12856322/"}

The effect of German urologic guidelines has not been evaluated so far. Therefore, we aimed to systematically investigate the acceptance, use, and quality of the published guidelines from a user's perspective. A link to an online questionnaire concerning use and barriers to the application of guidelines was distributed via e-mail by the German Society of Urology (DGU). German urologists' opinions on differences in national guideline quality were evaluated regarding prostate cancer (PCA), bladder cancer, germ cell tumors (GCT), renal cell carcinomas, and erectile dysfunction. Four hundred sixty-seven German urologists participated. More than 90% of the participants considered guidelines to be helpful. The Internet as the main tool for guideline distribution was favored by 28.4%, followed by publication in Urologe A. The main barrier to guideline usage was attributed to the lack of up-to date clinical data. Guidelines for GCT scored best in all quality categories and reached the highest level of use (65.8%), and 40.5% of participating urologists considered the additional establishment of comprehensive care centers for GCT as more effective for quality improvement than guideline development alone. For the other urologic tumors, especially PCA, guideline development was favored as a tool for quality improvement. More than 90% of participating urologists accept clinical guidelines as useful instruments in clinical practice and for therapeutic decisions. Our results should be integrated into guideline dissemination and implementation strategies in order to achieve a higher degree of treatment conformation to guidelines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19830402/"}

Herein, we detail the contribution of Irish people to Urology. Internet, specific Medline database searches, and individual searches of medical history and urologic history texts and from individual institutions were performed. Sir Francis Cruise, in 1865, perfected the panendoscope using the principle of reflected light from a kerosene lamp, enabling high-quality cystoscopy for the first time. In 1901, Sir Peter Freyer described the suprapubic transvesical prostatectomy, dramatically reducing perioperative mortality for prostate surgery to 3% in 1912. Terence Millin developed a novel in situ rectus fascia pubovaginal sling for incontinence, and revolutionized open prostate surgery with one of the seminal articles in the history of urology. He reported the retropubic extravesical enucleation of the prostate in 20 cases in The Lancet in 1945. Future work on radical retropubic prostatectomy was based on his unique approach to the prostate. In 1956, the first dedicated urology unit was designed and opened in Ireland by Dr. Thomas JD Lane. He reported an overall mortality of 2.3%, in 1540 consecutive prostatectomies, thereby emphasizing the importance of a specialized unit. In the contemporary era, Ralph DeVere White, current president of the Society of Urological Oncology, and John M. Fitzpatrick the current editor of BJU International, the first Irish persons to hold these positions have contributed to the field of urology. Irish urologists have made considerable contributions to urology throughout modern history, particularly in the areas of endoscopy and prostate surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19643466/"}

The year of the end of the course has been determined for each resident in compliance with seniority, and taking into account the availability. The number of fellow and specialist assistant posts available in the same period was estimated by considering the duration of each postinternship, and any change in the number of posts. Our census counted 207 residents, 76 fellow posts, 10 specialist assistant posts. Of the 207 residents, 29 completed their studies in 2008, 57 in 2009, 60 in 2010, 61 in 2011. Following our methodology, there was a lack of fellow and specialist assistant posts available from November 2010 (-15 posts in 2010, -7 posts in 2011). Our study showed an increase in the number of residents enrolled in urology course by years of promotion, causing a lack of fellow and specialist assistant posts from 2010.

A group of subjects, related to the domains and internal consistency of urology as a speciality, were selected and discussed among the members of the SPO and later submitted to open consultation among distinguished members of the urological community. The topics selected for discussion included: what is urology; urology in the university; sub-specialization in urology; training in urology; does kidney transplantation belong to urology, and others. It is shown that urology is going through an exciting and hazardous transition period. Urology has conflicting problems in its traditional domains due to changes in health care policy, and internal identification problems due to its permanent expansion and sub-specialization options. Weaker points are its relation with primary care medicine (shared care options), the presence and role of urology in institutions such as the university, department of surgery, children's hospitals, administration, etc.; the desegregating effect of the sub-specialities; the increasing encroachment of other specialities, and the increasing outpatient effect of technological progress.

At 200 finishing per year, we would have 2300 fewer urologists in the year 2020 than we presently have. AT 225/year, we would have 1700 fewer urologists. At 250 (our present level), we will have 1100 fewer than now. These 8800 urologists would be caring for 60 million more patients, of whom 20 million would be Medicare patients. These patients would provide over 500 additional patient visits/year/urologist. I hope that I have convinced you that the system is correcting and responding to multiple market forces. I predict that urologists in practice in 2020 will be busy and that we will not have too many urologists if the graduating numbers are kept stable. If they drop much more, we could well have too few.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9529533/"}

European instruments were acquired in the nineteenth century, culminating in the instruments developed by Max Nitze. When Wappler started the production of endoscopes in 1905, they were the basis for the development of numerous modifications and innovations such as electrosurgery, developed by Beer in 1910, with the Resonator created by Wappler; the resectoscope, invented by Stern and McCarthy in 1931; \"cold light\" using glass fibers for illumination, described by ACMI in 1960; the flexible fiber ureterorenoscope, described by Marshall in 1960; and fluorescence cystoscopy, introduced by I.

It consists of examining the whole penis in detail with the naked eue and then with a magnitification system after application of 5% acetic acid to the glans and prepuce in order to identify subclinical lesions. Biopsies can be performed when necessary. Three basic types of lesions may be observed: concylomas, macules, papules. However, the signs of mucocutaneous lesions are difficult to interpret, especially when they are subclinical. There are 2 types of false lesions: physiological papules of the corona of the glans and a diffuse acidophilic reaction. Topical treatment or laser destruction of the lesions can be performed at the same time as the examination, when necessary. The current indications for this technique are discussed. When learning this technique, the authors recommend the extensive use of biopsies and training with an experienced examiner.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1302127/"}

In training residents it is important to develop resection skills. We introduce a homemade simulator to improve capabilities for the training of transurethral procedures. Material consists of 7 cm of a 30F garden hose, a suprapubic tube, a Tupperware box (Frankfurt, Germany), three catheter plugs, and silicone gel. Cost of materials is below $40 U.S. Transurethral procedures such as mono- and bipolar resection and RevoLix laser vaporesection were carried out. Different meat types were tested to develop a close to real resection feeling. Further, flexible cystoscopy was trained with the simulator. Multiple markings were placed inside the box. These markings had to be identified by flexible cystoscopy. The time to completion of this task was recorded. Transurethral resection and flexible cystoscopy is feasible. Pork and beef lead to a realistic feeling compared with transurethral resection. For laser surgery, pork and chicken seem to be most realistic. Further, confidence in flexible cystoscopy could be obtained. During the flexible cystoscopy task, an average time reduction of 50.96% could be achieved. This cheap and simple resection simulator allows easy training of lower urinary tract procedures. It helps young urologists to acquire basic endourologic skills. It may be beneficial for residents in the process of learning lower urinary tract surgery.

These regulatory changes are accompanied by significant financial uncertainties for clinics, thus, necessitating careful planning. The need to treat patients in an outpatient setting forces hospitals to adjust their operational processes. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact on revenue in the urology department of a maximum care provider. Data selection is made from the entire dataset of the urology department from the year 2023, including all procedures from the AOP catalog, applying context verification. From this, three risk groups (RG) are formed: 1) all cases that remain after context verification but still contain other procedures than only AOP procedures, 2) cases that contain only AOP procedures, and 3) a RG of the hybrid-DRG. An analysis of individual epidemiological parameters and a cost simulation were carried out. RG 1, with a share of 28.1% of the total number of cases, shows the greatest risk with 701 cases amounting to € 1,742,819 when treated in an outpatient setting. With 3.8%, RG 2 results in a significantly lower risk on revenue with 91 cases amounting to € 161,479 or € 106,071 after the cost-revenue simulation.

As a physician during World War I, he was confronted with numerous bullet wounds to the spinal cord. In 1919, he completed his professorial thesis\"Bladder dysfunction as a result of bullet wounds to the spinal cord\". Oswald Schwarz was known as a committed surgeon. As an urologist he also treated patients with sexual dysfunction. Besides his practical and scientific urology-related work, he was also interested in psychology and philosophy. He held lectures on both subjects earning himself the nickname, the Urosoph. In the 1920s, Oswald Schwarz belonged to the inner circle of Alfred Adler, the founder of Individual Psychology, and was editor of the first psychosomatic textbook published in German, \"Psychological origin and psychotherapy of physical symptoms\" (1925). In addition, Schwarz wrote numerous articles and several books on sexual medicine. He also made many valuable contributions to the development of medical anthropology. Altogether, his work includes over 130 publications. Faced with the rise of fascism and National Socialism in Europe, Oswald Schwarz, who was of Jewish origin, emigrated to England in 1934. There he died in 1949. Unfortunately his scientific work has largely been forgotten.

Analysis of recent data on antibiotic use density in hospital departments of urology in Germany. Annual surveillance data of 107 departments for the period 2022/2023 were evaluated. We used a daily dose definition adapted for adult hospitalized patients (recommended daily doses, RDD), and 100 patient days as the denominator (RDD/100). The overall median antibiotic use density was 71 RDD/100 with a wide range between 15.9 and 138.7 RDD/100 but no significant differences according to hospital size. Fluoroquinolones (median 6.0 RDD/100) were prescribed as the fourth most frequent antibiotic class after broad-spectrum cephalosporins (median 16.2 RDD/100), aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (median 10.8 RDD/100), and broad-spectrum penicillins (piperacillin-tazobactam and piperacillin) (median 8.9 RDD/100). The ratio between penicillin and cephalosporin RDD per hospital ranged from 6:94 to 98:2 (overall 52:48). The proportion of aminoglycosides (< 1%) and parenteral fosfomycin (< 0.1%) was very small. Cotrimoxazole (median 4.0 RDD/100) was less frequently prescribed than fluoroquinolones. The proportion of oral agents was 44.7% overall, with only small differences according to hospital size. Oral fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, and nitroxoline were much less frequently prescribed than oral beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and cotrimoxazole. The overall antibiotic use density in urological hospital departments varied substantially in 2022/2023. Beta-lactam antibiotics were the most frequently used antibiotics, while fluoroquinolones (often as oral agents) continued to be prescribed with a large range similar to overall antibiotic use and independent of hospital size. Inpatient prescribing of the agents recommended and typically used for uncomplicated cystitis was rare. Penicillins and cotrimoxazole should more often be considered as the treatment option.

Questions covered demographics, scholastic achievements, number and region of away rotations, number and locations of interview invitations, and matching results. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t tests were used for continuous variables. Chi-square and fisher exact tests were used for categorical variables. Of 349 applicants, 88 (25.2%) completed the survey. Geographic location was a top consideration for away rotation selection; 86% placed it in their top 3 with 40% selecting it as number 1. Furthermore, 36.4% \"agreed\" and 37.5% \"strongly agreed\" that geographic distribution of home and away rotations impacted their interview invitations. On ANOVA analysis, the ratio of regional to total interview invitations was higher among applicants completing a rotation (either home or away) in a specific AUA section (P < .01). However, completing more away rotations (≥3 vs 0-2) did not increase the ratio of interview invitations to total applications (P = .49), and rotation location was not associated with matching in that region (P > .05). Geography is a key driver in away rotation selection among applicants and may increase the proportion of regional interview invitations. However, match results were not associated with geography of away rotations. With unprecedented changes coming to the urology residency match cycle, these findings suggest that loss of away rotations may have limited impact on interview invitations or match result.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33454359/"}

Forty eight patients who were presented to our erectile dysfunction clinic used the two devices simultaneously, each according to the accepted protocols. Breakage of two and three strings of the Snap Gauge (good rigidity) correlated well with good tip and average rigidity as evaluated by the RigiScan. Snap gauge results also correlated with duration of erection, number of erections, the number of adequate erections, and the longest duration of erection measured by the RigiScan. Therefore, good rigidity according to the Snap Gauge test correlated well with the results of functional erections (number, rigidity, duration) as obtained by the RigiScan.

We decided to develop a simulator for endoscopic resection after having seen the remarkable model of endoscopic simulation developed by French gastroenterologists and presented at the computer science workshop of the AFU symposium. The hypercard program, the laservision disk, and the CD ROM project were elected as a good introduction to this challenging although not unsurmountable problem. We had to adequate our goals to the resources of French urologists: the Macintosh II is the most sophisticated affordable computer. Computerization of the televised images of the endoscopic procedure and formalization of the gestures of the operator are required. Conventional image synthesis programs for use with the Mac II are either very slow or very limited. Conventional simulation programs are highly mathematical. Computerized images take up considerable memory space and large capacity disks or optical disks are required. The urologic laservision to which we contributed in 1986 contains few endoscopic images of the prostate but served as a basis for devising a methodology.

In the south German region he had at his disposal the most comprehensive endoscopic operation collective and the greatest experience in transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P). From 1948 to 1958 he carried out approximately 13,850 prostate resections with an average adenoma weight of 30 g and a mortality rate of <1%. The technical inadequacies of the resection instruments at that time prompted Hösel to develop a new form of resectoscope, namely the type 782. This resectoscope allowed a fast and complete resection of prostatic adenomas due to the improved visual field and better handling (rotating the operational unit) and also made the transurethral resection of larger prostatic adenomas possible. Therefore, in \"Ulm and around Ulm\" substantially larger prostatic adenomas could be endoscopically treated and open enucleation was not necessary. Prof. Hösel was an international force as a urologist and in Germany was ranked as one of the pioneers in the field of endoscopic prostate surgery.

In URS assessment, men vs. women achieved an average of 26.6 vs. 26.1/35 points on the GRS (p = 0.7) and completed the task in 8.1 ± 1.9 vs. 9.9 ± 0.4 min (p < 0.001). In TURB assessment, men vs. women achieved an average of 26.0 vs. 27.3/35 points on the GRS (p = 0.3) and required 7.6 ± 1.9 vs. 7.7 ± 2.2 min (p = 0.9), respectively. Among participants who answered the baseline survey and the evaluation (n = 33), 16 (80%) men vs. 3 (23%) women had surgical confidence to perform URS before (p = 0.01), and 19 (95%) men vs. 7 (54%) women after the workshop (p = 0.03). Regarding the performance of TURB, 10 (50%) men vs. 7 (54%) women reported surgical confidence before (p = 0.1), and 15 (75%) men vs. 10 (77%) women after the workshop (p = 1.0). An increase in surgical confidence to perform URS and TURB was reported by 9 (45%) and 10 (50%) men and 9 (69%) and 8 (62%) women, respectively. Endourologic simulation-based training increases surgical confidence of both female and male residents. Despite comparable surgical outcomes, women approach URS with lower surgical confidence compared to their male counterparts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39190147/"}

The medical school of Algiers, the only known active institution in Maghreb, planned an appointment of urologic surgeon. The urological department of Mustapha Hospital housed my activities after my success. If urinary lithiasis, prostate adenoma, bladder tumor and urethra stricture constituted the majority of my activity, many other diseases specific to the Maghreb should be mentioned such as fistula between bladder and vaginal arising after obstetrical maneuvers and hydatid cyst of the kidney. The idea of organizing a medical maghreb was born in Algiers. In 1964, Mrs Ben Allègue. Mr Moulay Ahmed Mérioua, our lamented surgeon Béchir Mantouri and me took our pilgrim stick, went to Casablanca and Tunis to invite our colleagues of the Maghreb to organize medical meetings. The first medical days of Maghreb were held at Casablanca in May 1965. Nine years later, the first Medical Congress of Maghreb was born. I left Algiers and went to Tunis in 1972. At the mean time and since 1967, I had organized a teaching of urological diseases destined for the first generations of registered students in the medical school of Tunis. I had a new appointment, as head department of urology, in Charles Nicolle's hospital eight yezar after decisive of president Habib Bourguiba. The main reason of my travel to Tunis was the invitation of the late lamented Doctor Zouhair Essafi, one of the pioneers of Tunisian modern surgery. Several new techniques were introduced in Tunisia recently such as \"l'urodynamique\", interventional endoscopy and kidney transplantation. On June the 6th, 1986 the first kidney transplantation was performed, and during three years I performed 60 kidney transplantations. This event provided enthusiasm of young physicians and surgeons who were avid for novelty in the field of transplantation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19213482/"}

In this study, we validated a newly developed external catheter to measure non-invasively this pressure, which avoids the risk of damaging or infecting the urethral and bladder wall as occurs with invasive urodynamics. To evaluate the external catheter, we simultaneously recorded the internal bladder pressure signal (measured invasively) and the external pressure signal (measured non-invasively) in 40 non-obstructed and obstructed patients. Additionally, we tested whether the external pressure depended on bladder volume in five healthy volunteers. The simultaneously measured internal bladder pressure and external pressure showed good agreement in the non-obstructed patients. There was less agreement in the obstructed group. Nevertheless, the external pressure in these patients was significantly higher than in the non-obstructed patients. The maximum external pressure depended significantly on the bladder volume in all volunteers. We concluded that isovolumetric bladder pressure can be measured non-invasively with the external catheter. In non-obstructed patients, this pressure accurately represents the internal bladder pressure. We think that it is possible to distinguish between obstructed patients and patients with a weak detrusor by combining the non-invasively measured isovolumetric bladder pressure with a separately measured maximum flow rate.

The quality of medical aids counselling, which plays a key role in temporary, supportive or palliative care for urinary incontinence, is therefore considered problematic.In 2019, the working group \"Geriatric Urology\" of the German Society for Urology published the first guideline on the counselling process related to the provision of medical aids. An updated version is currently available and has been listed by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies. The underlying idea was to define quality standard in Germany for the individual components of the counselling process - from identifying the type of incontinence and its severity to product trial use, the counselling setting, the counselling itself, the qualification of the counselling personnel, and the communication between prescribing physicians, service providers, and patients.This article presents the published guideline sections regarding the counselling process, its scope, and the assessment of urinary incontinence, including information relevant to patients.As medical aids counselling is expected to be financed from the low reimbursement rates provided by statutory health insurers for what is defined as an \"appropriate and sufficient\" supply - typically amounting to less than EUR 15 a month - more and more providers are withdrawing entirely from the sector of medical aids provision. Others continue to supply medical aids but offer no counselling at all or only to a very limited extent.

Therefore, the urogynaecology training, especially in Germany, is very heterogeneous and requires evaluation as well as improvement. The GeSRU-Academics research group \"Functional urology and LUTS\" evaluated this subject nationwide among urological and gynecological trainees and their chief physicians by using a comprehensive questionnaire (34/38 multiple-choice items) between April 2015 and May 2016. 336 urological residents and 190 chief physicians as well as 171 gynaecological residents and 175 chief physicians participated in the survey. Of all trainees, 70.0 % stated a personal interest in urogynaecology, but 45.4 % (gynaecological residents) and 52.9 % (urological residents) mention not to receive a standardized training in their own department. The chief physicians' survey resulted in discrepancies concerning the same question, <10 % of all residents do not receive a standardized urogynaecological training from their point of view. However, standardized urogynaecological training is of importance for those chief physicians. There is a discrepancy between expectations and reality of urogynaecological education and training. To enable a well-structured and standardized urogynaecological education and training, it is compulsory to focus on an interdisciplinary cooperation and to promote multidisciplinary development. A broad-based, well-designed training network and curricula should be established and used consistently.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27411997/"}

Available laser technologies currently being studied include the frequency doubled double-pulse Nd:Yag (FREDDY) and high-powered potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) lasers. The FREDDY laser presents an affordable and safe option for intracorporeal lithotripsy, but it does not fragment all stone compositions, and does not have soft tissue applications. The high power KTP laser shows promise in the ablative treatment of BPH. Initial experiments with the Erbium:YAG laser show it has improved efficiency of lithotripsy and more precise ablative and incisional properties compared to Ho:YAG, but the lack of adequate optical fibers limits its use in Urology. Thulium:YAG fiber lasers have also demonstrated tissue ablative and incision properties comparable to Ho:YAG.

A statistical analysis was performed to determine the effect of percutaneous access training on current practice patterns in percutaneous renal procedures. A subgroup analysis was conducted for graduates with more than 10 years after residency. Responses were received from 37 of 48 surveys mailed (77%) and 35 surveys were eligible for analysis. A total of 92% of urologists trained in percutaneous access currently perform percutaneous surgical procedures compared to only 33% of those untrained (p <0.001). Urologists trained in access perform a mean of 14.0 percutaneous renal procedures annually while those untrained perform 3.3 procedures (p = 0.02). Only 27% of urologists trained in percutaneous access continue to perform percutaneous renal access compared to 11% of those untrained (p = 0.33). A subset analysis of urologists trained more than 10 years ago shows similar results. The primary reasons stated for not performing their own access are that the radiologist has better equipment (61%) or skills (44%), or obtaining access requires extra time (50%).

Kinematics of end-effector trajectories, as well as cognitive state features of surgeon trainees and mentors have recently been studied as modalities to objectively evaluate the expertise level of trainees and to shorten the learning process. Virtual reality and haptics also have shown promising in research results in improving the surgical learning process by providing feedback to the trainee. 'Cognitive training' is a novel approach to enhance training and surgical performance. The utility of cognitive training in improving motor skills in other fields, including sports and rehabilitation, is promising enough to justify its utilization to improve surgical performance. However, some surgical procedures, especially ones performed during human-robot interaction in robot-assisted surgery, are much more complicated than sport and rehabilitation. Cognitive training has shown promising results in surgical skills-acquisition in complicated environments such as surgery. However, these methods are mostly developed in research groups using limited individuals. Transferring this research into the clinical applications is a demanding challenge.

Examination results and their interpretation depended heavily on the individual tactile skills of the urologist. Because this examination method (if correctly applied) proved the artistic skills and experience of a doctor, urologists did not see any need to replace tactile examinations with a competing method.Nevertheless, urology as well as many other medical disciplines was receptive to techniques aiming at the visualization of pathology. Visualizations served the purposes of science-oriented medicine to be objective and to document examination results. However, it needed the development of specific technologies to create objective images. One major problem in urology was the question of how to light body cavities. After extracorporeal light sources had proven to be ineffective, attempts were made at bringing light sources into the interior of the body. It needed heated tungsten filaments and later mignon bulbs at the tip of endoscopes to illuminate the bladder to such an extent that images from the interior of the bladder could be produced. The paper examines the status of these images as self-evident and objective. It is argued that the images produced were not self-evident.

Adequate antibiotic therapy is based on the stratification into complicated and uncomplicated, as well as upper and lower infections, and on specific risk factors (e.g., urinary tract catheter) that can be classified according to the ORENUC criteria. Based on this classification, the choice for an empirical antibiotic therapy is made. The spectrum of pathogens should therefore be limited in order to use antibiotics with a narrow spectrum of activity and little collateral damage if possible, thus, preventing both the development of resistance and complications. Adequate empirical antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis in line with guidelines is based on the clinical classification and risk factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240318/"}

Increasing experience was associated with comparable operative outcomes to open surgery, and more recently better oncologic and functional results with minimally invasive surgical techniques as shown in large studies in the literature. Robotic surgery was introduced at the beginning of 2000 and has facilitated minimally invasive surgery. Robotic assisted laparoscopic operations (e.g., radical prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy) have evolved rapidly to become widely accepted procedures. However, robotic surgery was monopolized by one company, namely Intuitive Surgical which owns the majority of the patents in this field. The market and the interest were growing, but unfortunately the prices were rising and exceeded 2 million Euros. This reality has been the main obstacle for many clinics who wanted to adopt robotic surgery. In recent years, new companies have developed and patented alternative robotic surgical systems after earlier patents of Intuitive Surgical expired. Thus, real competition could start in the robotic market. In this article, we introduce these new robotic platforms for urologic surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32785733/"}

It was the aim of this review to validate the significance of PET as a diagnostic tool in malignant tumors of the urogenital tract. A systematic review of the current literature concerning the role of PET for malignant tumors of the kidney, testicles, prostate, and bladder was carried out. The role of FDG PET for renal cell cancer can be seen in the detection of recurrences after definitive local therapy and metastases. The higher sensitivity of PET in comparison to other therapeutic modalities (CT, ultrasound, MRI) in recurrent and metastatic renal cell cancer suggests a supplemental role of this diagnostic procedure to complement other imaging modalities.The clinical value of PET is established for the identification of vital tumor tissue after chemotherapy of seminomatous germ cell tumors. This diagnostic method has little significance for primary tumor staging and diagnosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor because of the high probability of false-negative results in adult teratomas. FDG PET is not sensitive enough in the diagnosis of primary or recurrent tumors in prostate or bladder cancer. Also PET did not prove to be superior to conventional bone scintigram in the detection of mostly osteoblastic metastases in prostate cancer. The recent use of alternative tracers, which are partly not eliminated by urinary secretion (acetate, choline) has increased the sensitivity and specificity of PET also in this tumor entity so that further clinical investigations are needed to validate these technical modifications in their significance for this imaging modality. PET appears to be sufficiently evaluated only for the diagnostic follow-up of patients with seminomatous germ cell tumors after chemotherapy to regard it is the diagnostic tool of first choice.

However, the following fields of action must be fulfilled: microbiology, andrology and systemic cancer therapy. There is justifiable concern that various institutions will lose their permission for a complete 5‑year residency program based on the above-mentioned demands since not all institutions have all subspecialties in urology. Those institutions need to define new ways of residency training such as interdisciplinary programs within their own institution between disciplines like pediatric surgery, gynecology and medical oncology. Other options are combined training programs between regional urology departments with different main focuses or training programs between institutions and urologists in private practice. There is an unmet need to improve residency training as well as board examinations by new structures and a reliable curriculum. Based on the changed main focuses of the new version of urology training, we need to discuss the future of residency programs. It might be helpful to discuss two different types of urology training with a common trunk for the first three years followed by a more outpatient-based residency training for the general urologist and a more specialized training for the inpatient urologist to be educated in complex treatment modalities.

Among the 21 unicorns in urology, the majority operate in drug research, including artificial intelligence guided development; this is in line with the digital transformation of medicine. Yet, business models are diversified. The valuations range from $ bn 1.0 to 7.83, summing to a total value of $ bn 56.2.

In January 1992 the Health Care Financing Administration began implementing the new law, which replaces the existing Medicare system of physician payment with a fee schedule based on the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). We summarize the methods and data used to derive the RBRVS for urology. A national random sample of 115 practicing urologists completed structured telephone surveys to provide ratings of physician time and work required before, during and after most frequently performed urological services. Subsequent survey cycles with urologists provided further refinement. Urologists then participated in a cross-specialty physician panel to link services from all specialties onto a common scale. This common scale was adjusted for geographic differences in practice overhead costs and malpractice insurance premiums. A monetary conversion factor, determined by the Health Care Financing Administration, was then applied to convert the RBRVS into a Medicare fee schedule. The merits and demerits of the scientific process used to develop and maintain the relative value scale are extensive. While statistically valid and reproducible, the study results have been altered in the political arena. The results and impacts of the new Medicare payment system on urology will be significant, although it is not yet clear how urological practice will be affected. Although faring better than most surgical specialties, urologists stand to lose approximately 8% of their Medicare income when the new fee schedule is fully implemented. There will be relative gains for evaluation and management services and losses for most invasive procedures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8345626/"}

The management of the pathologies described is based on current French and European guidelines. The importance for urology nurses to know how to recognize a potentially lethal SSI is here to remind, especially with the need to master the use of the \"quick SOFA\" score. The SSI in urology were then grouped as follows: postoperative urinary tract infection, superficial wound infection, deep wound infection, organ infection and material's infection. While urinary tract infections are potentially the most serious and sometimes fatal, superficial or deep infections can be a source of prolonged hospitalization with repercussions on postoperative rehabilitation of patients. Nurses must therefore be fully trained to recognize them because they are often in the front line in case of occurrence of a SSI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082245/"}

Their usefulness for the clinician is discussed. The presence and role of heavy metals in urinary stones through data collected through μX-ray fluorescence is debated. If these data suggest a simple substitution process of calcium, recent data suggest that weddellite is associated to a Zn-rich environment, partly favoured by an inflammation process. Investigation on the chemistry and the structure of unusual deposits in kidney biopsies show a great chemical diversity of ectopic calcifications. Such diversity shows that staining procedures to characterize such deposits are obsolete. Finally, several diseases which can be assessed through techniques specific to large-scale instruments and defined by the clinician are presented.

However, the field has never been exclusively \"male medicine\"-neither in terms of patients nor medical staff. This article highlights the life and work of Dresden-based physician Dora Gerson (1884-1941), one of the first German female specialists in urology and dermatovenereology, and draws attention to the widespread invisibility of women in the culture of memory of the field. Gerson studied medicine in Munich and Leipzig at the beginning of the 20th century and worked in both clinical and social medicine in the following years. In her Dresden practice, she combined urology, dermatology, and venereology, while also running a public counseling center for women with sexually transmitted diseases. In 1933, Gerson's health insurance license was revoked, and she was forced to close her practice. From 1940 onward, she worked as a Jewish \"medical practitioner\" at the horticultural school in Ahlem, Hannover. In September 1941, under increasing pressure from repression, she took her own life. Her biography exemplifies a dual marginalization: as a member of a structurally disadvantaged gender and as a victim of Nazi persecution. The article connects Gerson's life story with issues of gender, memory culture, and recognition practices in medicine. It demonstrates how professional cultural memory functions selectively and explores how social background, gender, and political circumstances influence visibility and oblivion in medical history.

A detailed postal questionnaire was sent to all 416 consultant urologists listed as full members of the British Association of Urological Surgeons and resident in the UK. The range of information sought from each urologist included details of personal paediatric training, scope of personal practice, and information about facilities and provision of urological services for children in their base National Health Service hospital. The response rate was 69%; most consultant urologists (87%) in District General Hospitals (DGHs) undertake paediatric urology, mainly routine procedures of minor or intermediate complexity. Of urologists in teaching hospitals, 32% treat children but their involvement is largely collaborative. Consultants appointed within the last 10 years are less willing to undertake procedures such as ureteric reimplantation or pyeloplasty than those in post for > or = 10 years. Currently, 18% of DGH urologists hold dedicated children's outpatient clinics and 34% have dedicated paediatric day-case operating lists. Almost all urologists practise in National Health Service hospitals which meet existing national guidelines on the provision of inpatient surgical care for children. Urologists practising in DGHs will retain an important role as providers of routine urological services for children. However, the tendency for recently appointed consultants to limit their practice to the more routine aspects of children's urology is likely to increase. Training and intercollegiate assessment should focus on the practical management of the conditions most commonly encountered in DGH practice. The implementation of national guidelines may require greater paediatric subspecialization at DGH level to ensure that urologists treating children have a paediatric workload of sufficient volume to maintain a high degree of surgical competence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11446852/"}

The non-responder urologists received a reminder email every week. The questionnaire included 25 questions, divided into four subgroups. The response rate was 57.9% (33/57 urologists). Results showed that the 1-day surgery rate was 26.4%. It was higher in the private sector (33.07 ± 17.16 vs. 20.42 ± 13.54%, P=0.04). Surgeries were made mainly in non-dedicated operating theaters (75.0%) and in the conventional list (71.8%).

Here a non-invasive method to determine the isovolumetric bladder pressure to judge contractility is presented. This is based on interruption of urine flow by sudden occlusion of a specially fixed condom catheter. The pressure inside the condom is recorded and used to estimate the isovolumetric bladder pressure. Combined with, for example, home uroflowmetry, this non-invasive method may overcome some of the disadvantages (e.g., invasiveness, cost) of the conventional pressure flow test. To determine the isovolumetric bladder pressure reliably with this non-invasive method, two constraints have to be met. First, the bladder neck and urethra have to remain open after occlusion of the condom catheter. This was tested combining the non-invasive test with radiography in five patients. Second, a steady state has to be reached, i.e., the flow in the urethra, due to the elastic properties of the biological and the condom systems, should come to a stop when the bladder pressure and the condom pressure equilibrate. This was investigated by comparing the non-invasively recorded condom pressure with the simultaneously invasively recorded intravesical pressure in 52 patients. In these patients, three different methods of condom fixation were evaluated. The results show that the bladder neck and urethra remain open during the test. However, a steady state is often not reached. In more than 80% of the cases with the best condom fixation, the bladder pressure has not stabilized, although the condom pressure reached a plateau. Therefore, this method of sudden occlusion is not yet clinically applicable for determining the isovolumetric bladder pressure. Neurourol.

Despite great experimental interest, no specific devices are currently available for urological indications in humans and therefore several instruments, taken from different specialist fields, have been used to access through the different natural orifices (including transgastric, transcolonic, transvaginal and transvesical approaches). Furthermore, the accumulating experience with the transvesical approach to the peritoneum suggests it presents new challenges for urologists in terms of technical demands. For these reasons, given their competition with the success of laparoscopy and minimally invasive techniques, NOTES applications in urology risk being underevaluated. In our opinion, after the initial enthusiastic phase, NOTES will cover only specific indications for urological conditions. The transvesical approach to the peritoneum however seems to be one of the best approaches for NOTES overall and certainly the most promising for urologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19114301/"}

To address this concern, academic institutions have adopted COI policies. It is unclear whether the strength of COI policy correlates with industry payments in urology. 131 US academic urology programs were surveyed on their COI policies, and graded according to the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) criteria. Strength of COI policy was compared against industry payments in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments database. Fifty-seven programs responded to the survey, for a total response rate of 44%. There was no difference between COI policy groups on total hospital payments (P = .05), total department payments (P = .28), or dollars per payment (P = .57). On correlation analysis, there was a weak but statistically nonsignificant correlation between AMSA Industry Policy Survey Score and Open Payments payments (ρ = -0.14, P = .32).

In this review, we will provide an overview of recent successes within quality improvement collaboratives, as well as discuss future opportunities for such initiatives. Successful quality improvement collaboratives have coupled data registries with a collegial environment to achieve data-driven improvements in care across diverse practice settings. Such efforts have a track record for accomplishing specific patient safety gains, and have more recently addressed complex care scenarios where data and consensus building have been leveraged to clarify optimal care pathways. Collaboratives are currently exploring mechanisms to meaningfully impact increasingly complex elements of care delivery, such as individual surgeon performance. Quality improvement collaboratives are in a unique position to understand patterns in care across populations, lead evidence-based assessments of variation in quality, and to attempt to intervene to improve outcomes based on the data they accumulate. As healthcare increasingly shifts to emphasize quality of care, physician-led collaboratives represent an important mechanism to drive improvement.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29708948/"}

Urological problems are common in elderly people, and care of patients aged 65 and older represents a large proportion of many urologists' practices. However, this has also presented unique challenges to the development of the field of geriatric urology as an identified subspecialty. Until recently, formal educational requirements and opportunities in geriatric urology were limited. In addition, there is a paucity of basic science and clinical research related specifically to urological problems in older adults, despite the growing numbers of patients in this age group. This article reviews recent efforts to increase the activity, content, and visibility of the field of geriatric urology. Curriculum materials have been developed for urology training programs, research needs have been assessed and targeted, and a new professional organization (the Geriatric Urology Society) has been established. Current activities in the field of geriatric urology at the local, regional, and national levels, and goals for the future are reviewed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12823668/"}

In this paper we describe the start up of a Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) in a Urology Department. We assessed the current maturity and performance of the Unit by means of self-evaluation with a questionnaire adapted to the 2009 ISO 9004 standard by all the professionals in the unit (Physicians and Nurses). All the items in the questionnaire are based in attributes and evaluation lines gathered in the five chapters of the Standard. The areas of improvement were identified and specific objectives were established and collected in the QIP with indicators for their measurement, responsible individuals, chronogram and results evaluation. After implementation of the quality improvement actions, a second self-evaluation was performed to start a new cycle. After the first evaluation we observed a high global performance (61%). Analyzed by sections, the highest level was achieved in the human resources management chapter (73%) and the lowest in quality management (30%) due to the absence of a process management approach. After identification of improvement areas, we defined projects and activities to be developed, in the process management context. The second evaluation, after the implementation of process management in the unit, showed an improvement in the maturity level of the Unit, reaching an 83%. The management of a clinical department cannot be limited to continuous improvisation. A process management approach is necessary, finishing with the usual defects of the generated product (variability, errors, omissions, waiting lists). Excellence in the quality of health care is an essential objective in every healthcare organization and standardization models, such as 2009 ISO 9004 standard, are the right way for that purpose.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25688530/"}

It should also be clear who is liable in specific cases for persistent working time violations. When changing duty models, it is important to bear in mind that this can lead to a considerable deterioration in the opportunities for further training and education of physicians, meaning that in the long term the compatibility of further training in line with working hours can only be achieved with sufficient staffing of the hospitals.

PDD also reduces the number of residual tumors after TUR-B compared to white-light guided TUR-B and also the early recurrence rate although long-term outcome with hexylaminolaevulinic acid with regards to the general course of bladder cancer is still lacking. PDD has been used mainly for detection of bladder cancer and specifically carcinoma in situ in conjunction with diagnostic and therapeutic transurethral resection of the bladder. In 2006 hexylaminolaevulinic acid (HAL) was approved in the EU (EMEA) as a photosensitizer for the use in photodynamic diagnosis of the bladder. Several guidelines have incorporated PDD as optional form of diagnosis during endoscopy in proven or suspected bladder cancer, but no specific recommendations regarding indication and application of PDD exist.

The prospective survey studied: age, gender, urology training as a medical student and the intern's preferences in relation to 11 surgical specialties. Interns were recontacted annually to determine their choice of specialization. Population. 255 interns participated, including 145 females (56.9%) and 110 males (43.1%). The mean age was 24.6 +/- 5 years (range: 22-31). 173 interns were attached to a Parisian teaching hospital (67.8%) and 82 (32.2%) were attached to a provincial teaching hospital. 52 interns (21.2%) had completed at least one attachment in a urology department during their medical training. Surgical specialties. Orthopaedics was most frequently listed (n = 48 ; 28.9%). Urology was chosen by 32 interns (12.5%), 28 of whom had completed an urology attachment during their medical training. At the end of the introductory training sessions, 18 interns were tempted by urology. At one year, 31/34 interns (91.2%) confirmed their choice in favour of urology. A practical training sessions very early in the training of young surgeons is a good solution to introduce them to urology.

{"id": "25518103", "title": "History of education in medicine and surgery, first hospitals development of urology in danzig/Gdańsk.", "text": "The aim of the study is to present the development of hospital services and the teaching of medicine, and the development of urology in Danzig (Gdańisk). Well known Danzig surgeons who were interested in surgery of the genitourinary system are also presented. The beginning of urological surgery and its development within the framework of the department of surgery and as an independent facility at the Medical Academy of Gdafisk in the post-war period is also described. Extensive research was undertaken for the collection of literature and documents in German and Polish archives and libraries in order to prepare this study. The history of hospitals in Danzig goes back to the arrival of the Teutonic Knights in 1308. The earliest institution, according to historical sources, was the Hospital of the Holy Spirit, built in the years 1310-1311. It was run by the Hospitalet Order until 1382, and was intended for the sick, elderly and disabled people, orphans and needy pilgrim, and the poor. Later centuries saw the further development of hospital services in Danzig. In the 19th century, the city's increas ing population, the development of the sciences, and rapid advances in medicine subsequently led to the establishment of three more hospitals in Gdafisk: The Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynaecological Disease (1819), the Holy Virgin Hospital (1852), and the Evangelical Hospital of Deaconess Sisters (1857), in addition to the old Municipal Hospital. In 1911, new modern buildings of Municipal Hospital in Danzig were finished. On the basis of the Municipal Hospi- tal, the Academy of Practical Medicine was established in 1935. It was known under the name Staatliche Akademie fiir Praktische Medizin in the Free City of Danzig. Five years later (in 1940) the Academy was developed and changed to the Medical Academy of Danzig (Medizinische Akad- emie Danzig - MAD). The beginning of medical teaching at the middle level in Danzig (Gdafsk) dates back to the 16th century. It had its origins in the Chair of Anatomy and Medicine at Danzig Academic Gymnasium (GA; Sive Illustre), an establishment which lasted for 239 years, from 1584 to 1812. The history of surgery in Danzig has its roots in the centuries-old tradition of the medical practice of surgeons who were associated in the Surgeons Guild, teaching, as well medical and scientific research. The Surgeons Guild existed in Danzig from 1454 to 1820. Over the centuries manual intervention was also in the hands of academically uneducated persons such as bath house attendants, barbers, and wandering surgeons. Until the end of 1946 there was no separate urology department in Danzig. Urological surgery was in the hands of surgeons. Interventions and operations on genitourinary organs were carried out, more or less, in all surgical departments. The end of World War II created a new political situation in Europe. Danzig (now Gdafisk) and Pomerania became part of Poland. In 1945, on the basis of the former MAD, the Polish Government established the Polish Academy of Physicians, later renamed the Medical Academy in Gdafisk (Gdafiska Akademia Medyczna - GAM). In 2009, GAM was again renamed, as the Medical University of Gdafisk (Gdaiski Uniwersytet Medyczny). The political changes after World War II accelerated the process of the separation of urology from surgery. In May 1947, a 30-bed Urological Ward was opened in Gdanisk, in Debinki Street, forming part of the First Surgical Clinic of the Academy of Physicians (headed by Prof. Kornel Michejda, 1887-1960, later by Prof. Stanislaw Nowicki, 1893-1972, and lastly by Prof. Zdzislaw Kieturakis, 1904-1971). The first head doctor of the new urological ward was Dr. Tadeusz L$renz (1906-1986), a urologist from Lvov (Lemberg). After the departure of Professor Lorenz to Wrodclaw (Breslau) in 1958, Dr. Jan Renkielski was acting as Head of the Urological Ward until 1971. In 1971 the ward was transformed to the separate Department of Urology. Docent (\"lecturer\"), and later Professor, Kazimierz Adamkiewicz from Zabrze (Hindenburg) became its Head. Professor Adamkiewicz organized and equipped the Department, leading it quickly to the level of modern departments in the areas of research, teaching, and therapy. During Professor Adamkiewicz's ill- ness, and after his retirement in 1988, Docent Kazimierz Krajka, Later Professor) headed the urological department until his retirement in 2012. Since 1 October 2012, Associate Professor (Docent) Marcin Matuszewski (*1965) has been the head of the Department of Urology in Gdańisk.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25518103/"}

A questionnaire was sent to several generations of urologists concerning the criteria which influenced their choice of this surgical subspecialty. More than one half had chosen urology before their residency. Almost none of the urologists in this subgroup hesitated about another surgical subspecialty at the time of their final choice. Hospital medical training is therefore an essential factor in the choice of the future specialty. Almost all urologists who chose their specialty during their residency initially hesitated with another discipline, corresponding to gastrointestinal surgery in 59% of cases. The most attractive feature was the medical and surgical aspect of urology and possibility of group practice with several urologists, limiting the time on call. Hospital medical students therefore constitute a potential reserve for urologists and need to be motivated by means of good quality practical teaching. Residents in other specialties can also modify their initial choice in favour of urology, especially gastrointestinal surgeons.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16459685/"}

Patients clearly want an efficacious, safe, convenient medication with rapid onset. To meet these consumer demands, numerous new therapies are being developed. These include new oral medications, new intracavernosal pharmacotherapies, new delivery systems (such as novel intracorporal injectors and transdermal agents) and combination therapies. What is known about these new medications and delivery systems will be presented.

However, this procedure is not widely performed because it is technically difficult and associated with a high rate of bleeding complications, even for experienced teams. The authors studied the LPN learning curve for urology residents using a porcine model based on analysis of the following criteria: operating time, warm ischaemia time and intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Forty LPN were performed by the same operator. All operations were performed after arterial clamping and heparinisation of the animal. The renal section was always the same, removing 40% of the kidney and always comprised the excretory tract. A continuous running suture on the excretory tract and interrupted sutures on the parenchyma were performed. Operating time and warm ischaemia time were recorded. Animals were monitored for ten days. Intraoperative and postoperative bleeding via drains was recorded and retrograde urography was performed on the 10th day to confirm the absence of excretory tract leaks. Linear regression statistical tests investigated a correlation between these various criteria and the number of cases performed. The mean total operating time, warm ischaemia time and total bleeding (intraoperative and postoperative) were 108 minutes (70-140 minutes), 38 minutes (22-50 minutes) and 95 ml (10-300 ml), respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed a direct correlation between the number of cases performed and intraoperative bleeding (p<0.001) and warm ischaemia time (p<0.001). These parameters became stable after the 10th operated case. Two cases of urine leaks were observed on D10 out of a series of 40 operations, with no correlation with the number of cases performed. The operating time and warm ischaemia time are directly correlated with the number of cases performed. Training on a porcine model appears to be a good way to reduce the learning curve in man.

Comparisons were made with the χ(2) test. The response rate was 63%. Of the responding urologists, 93% reported that they used the guideline in the daily practice, while 95% considered the strong recommendations of the guideline as treatment standard. Urologists working in a hospital recommended the guideline less frequently to their patients as source of information (30 versus 58%, p = 0.0283), but more frequently to other physicians (95 versus 72%, p = 0.0294), than private practice urologists did. The interdisciplinary S3 guideline on diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer is used by the vast majority of urologists in their daily practice.

These recommendations are intended to affect change at the level of the AUA and Society of Academic Urology (SAU) that more effectively mitigates future violations, intentional or not. There is a paucity of specific guidelines published by the AUA on what constitutes a Match violation. Furthermore, in contrast to the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), the AUA is surprisingly lenient in their existing guidelines. The Match violations most frequently reported were programs asking applicants illegal and restricted questions as well as inappropriate post-interview communication between applicants and programs. Review of current Match policies and violations suggest several areas for improvement, particularly regarding the specificity of AUA guidelines to define Match violations, the asking of illegal interview questions, and post-interview communication.

For a multispecialty group, each specialty might have multiple question sets. As a result, question set governance can be challenging. Knowledge of the counts, variability and repetition of questions in a multispecialty practice can help institutions understand the challenges of question set proliferation. We analyzed patient-facing question sets that were subject to institutional governance and those that were not. We examined question variability and number of repetitious questions for a simulated episode of care. In addition to examining general patient question sets, we used specific examples of tobacco questions, questions from two specialty areas, and questions to menopausal women. In our analysis, there were approximately 269 institutionally governed patient question sets with a mean of 74 questions per set accounting for an estimated 20,000 governed questions. Sampling from selected specialties revealed that 50 % of patient question sets were not institutionally governed. We found over 650 tobacco-related questions in use, many with only slight variations. A simulated use case for a menopausal woman revealed potentially over 200 repeated questions. A group practice with multiple specialties can have a large volume of patient questions that are not centrally developed, stored or governed. This results in a lack of standardization and coordination. Patients may be given multiple repeated questions throughout the course of their care, and providers lack standardized question sets to help construct valid patient phenotypes.

We have chosen and studied in depth the results Dr. Virseda presents in his thesis of one of the experiments performed in relation to the viscoelastic model. After applying analytical methods we reach a differential equation we suppose defines detrusor behaviour, as it has been explained by the viscoelastic model. The solution of this equation by means of the Laplace's transform enables to obtain the values of the incognitas set by urodynamics. Besides, we analyzed the behaviour of solutions' stability using a matricial method following the Lyapunov theory. The former may solve the incognitas for the voiding phase. We used urethral Doppler with simultaneous uroflowmetry to obtain the data equations demanded; this is what we named \"Doppler uroflowmetry\". The filling phase was studied by superficial electromiography. We named it \"electrovesicogram\". We attach images for both Doppler wave and electrovesicogram. They both are the projects we are working on. Currently we can only explain the methodology we are following. Indeed, this article is the first of a series in which we aim to explain the methodology we are following in detail: Doppler wave capture; mounting process photogram by photogram, and vectorization and cleaning of the wave, either Doppler or flow waves; treatment in autocad to obtain the vector; and management of the vector with the matalab software, which gives us the results we are looking for.

We investigated whether patient complaint experience differs among urologists, and whether urological subspecialists generate distinct quantities and types of complaints. This retrospective study examined 1,516 unsolicited patient complaints filed against 268 urologists. Patient complaint and urological subspecialty data were collected from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007 for 15 geographically diverse health systems. The cohort urologists were assigned medical malpractice claims risk scores and complaint type profiles. A weighted sum algorithm produced risk scores from 4 consecutive years of complaint data and complaint type profiles were generated using a standardized coding system. Statistical analyses tested the associations among risk score, complaint type profile and urological subspecialty. Complaint type profile and subspecialty distribution were assessed for urologists in the cohort top decile for risk scores. Overall 125 (47%) urologists were associated with 0 patient complaints, while 30 (11%) urologists were associated with 758 (50%) of the patient complaints. Subspecialty and distribution of risk scores were significantly associated (p <0.001). Calculi and oncology subspecialist distributions suggest greater overall risk. Complaint types also varied among subspecialists (p = 0.02). There was no association between top decile urologists and complaint type profile (p = 0.19). Unsolicited patient complaints were nonrandomly distributed among urologists and urological subspecialties. Monitoring patient complaints may allow for early identification of and intervention with high risk urologists before malpractice claims accumulate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20303531/"}

The historical literature including personal writings of Pickett and her mentors were reviewed. The factors which determine female medical student career choice as well as a summary of the current status of women in urology were also examined. The groundwork for women in the modern era of urology was forged by Mary E. Childs MacGregor, who also supported and encouraged fellowship training. Inspired by Doctor MacGregor's example, Elisabeth Pickett became the first female general surgeon to complete a fellowship in urological oncology in 1955 under Dr. Willet Whitmore at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and to be board certified in urology in 1962. Despite the benchmark set by these early pioneers the American Board of Urology currently lists only 324 female board certified urologists, 86 female candidates and 20 board eligible individuals as of the year 2006. Although the number of female graduating medical students in modern times is equivalent to males, there still exists a large discrepancy in the number of women choosing urology and other surgical subspecialties as a career. Elisabeth Pickett demonstrated that it could be done at a time when few thought it possible. However, only a minority of women today continue to pursue fellowship training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17868734/"}

The objective of the present study was to evaluate changes in practice patterns of all pediatric medical and surgical specialists over time, to facilitate advocacy work by the Academy at federal and state levels. The survey was sent to members of the AAP Section on Urology and the Society for Pediatric Urology between June and November 2014. The survey included general and sub-specialty-specific questions. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0. Descriptive statistics, including frequency distributions and measures of central tendency, were used to summarize all responses. A total of 255 pediatric urologists returned the survey, giving a response rate of 56.4%. The specialty remained vibrant, and members remained content in their career choice. About two-thirds practiced in a full-time clinical setting, and had research, teaching, and/or administrative duties. About 75% reported no change in clinical volume or case complexity, although 50% reported an increase in their referral base. A 50% increase in minor cases and a 43.3% decrease in open cases were reported. Only 13% planned to retire within the next 3-6 years. The current job market for fellows was unrestricted for 51.3%, significantly restricted for location for 23.1%, and restricted with regard to practice type for 25.6%. Overall, 51%, 37%, and 13% of the respondents expressed the opinions that over the next 5 years, too many specialists in pediatric urology were currently being trained, just the right number, and too few, respectively. Medical student interest remained encouraging. One of the primary objectives of the survey was to gain insights into whether there was concordance between the number of trainees and the current and future job opportunities. Unfortunately, the main limitations of the survey were the questions on retirement and adding a partner. Since the survey was anonymous, there was a missed opportunity to direct fellows to specific job openings. In addition, every member of a large group may have individually responded, inflating the responses or, in some cases, negating the responses if the partners did not agree. Pediatric urologists have an overall sense of contentment of career choice, despite shifts in complex open surgical volume and increasing competition.

Data were evaluated and the results from the survey were compared to the one performed 15 years earlier to determine changes in the learning environment and effectiveness of training urology residents. The current survey response rate was 89% which was similar to the 2005 response rate of 88%. Most program directors (61%) agreed that 20% protected time for program directors helped with administrative work and 31% felt this time needs to increase for larger residency programs. Seventy percent (70%) agreed that dedicated program administrator time has helped their program. More than half of the respondents agree that the ACGME is training the current workforce effectively.

We here use first the first time the previously established Brüggmann Groneberg (BG) index to assess if female academic career options advance in urology. Different operating parameters (student population, urology specialist population, urology chair female:male (f:m) ratio) were collected from the Federal Office of Statistics, the Federal Chamber of Physicians and the medical faculties of 36 German universities. Four time points were monitored (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015). From these data, female to male (f:m) ratios and the recently established career advancement (BG) index have been calculated. The German hospital urology specialists' f:m ratios were 0.257 (499 female vs. 1944 male) for 2015, 0.195 for 2010, 0.133 for 2005 and 0.12 for 2000.

Data were anonymized and extracted for the period 2003 to 2009 by measuring a set of 11 predefined index cases that could be performed in both an open and MIS fashion. 16,687 index cases were recorded by a total of 198 residents. As a proportion, there was a significant increase in MIS from 12% in 2003 to 2004 to 32% in 2008 to 2009 (P=0.01). A significant decrease in the proportion of index cases performed with an open approach was also observed from 88% in 2003 to 2004 to 68% in 2008 to 2009 (P=0.01). The majority of these shifts were secondary to the increased application of MIS for nephrectomies of all type (29%-45%), nephroureterectomy (27%-76%), adrenalectomy (15%-71%), and pyeloplasty (17%-54%) (P<0.0001 for all). While there was a significant increase in MIS experience with radical prostatectomy (2%-18%, P<0.0001), the majority of these were still taught in an open fashion during the study period.

Charles-Pierre Denonvilliers (1808-1872) introduced this \"Aponévrose prostato-péritonéale\" for the first time in 1836 in Paris, without discussing its surgical importance. Already in 1820 the Scotsman Granville Sharp Pattison (1791-1851) had described this \"Fascia of the prostate gland\" as a structure to be preserved during perineal lithotomy, a frequently performed procedure in those days. According to Pattison the intraoperative damage of this fascia and subsequent urine extravasation with infection of the anterior rectum was the main reason for the high mortality of this operation at that time. Therefore, it is surprising that the eponym of this fascia is not related with the name of Pattison today.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19222136/"}

Quality of life and survivorship have driven risk stratification for localized prostate cancer, facilitated by molecular signatures and leading to increased acceptance of active surveillance as a mainstream treatment option. Advances in technology have improved efficacy and reduced toxicity in both radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. Improved understanding of the androgen receptor has yielded substantially more effective therapies. Future growth areas include personalized treatment based on genomic and genetic information, theranostics radiopharmaceuticals, and more aggressive treatment of metastatic disease to include focal therapy.

A total of 136 urology residency programs with available faculty information on their websites were evaluated. The academic rank, academic degrees, and gender were recorded for each clinical and research faculty member. Each author's h-index was determined using the Scopus database. The m-indices for each author were then calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This study demonstrated that the h- and m-indices positively correlate with an author's academic rank. Among the 2253 academic urologists evaluated, chairs/chiefs and professors had the highest median h- and m-indices (h-index 26, m-index 1.046 for chairs/chiefs; h-index 30, m-index 1.094 for professors). This was followed by associate professors (h-index 14, m-index 0.750), assistant professors (h-index 6, m-index 0.667), and clinical instructors (h-index 6, m-index 0.511). The median h- and m-indices were overall statistically higher for males than females. Faculty members with only a PhD were found to have the highest h- and m-indices followed by MD PhD, MD MBA, MD MPH, MD only, and DO only in descending order of index value.

Since he was young he went with his father to the international urology meetings where he met a great number of personalities in the World of Urology; he extended his training with them, and later on they got to have a great relationship. He travelled around Europe and United States before and after Second World War, respectively, with stays in the most prestigious centers, which he described meticulously. He also reported his activity during the first two years he directed the Department of Urology at the Hospital La Princesa in Madrid and cited the series of collaborators he had. In his research works he made an ample description of historical development as introduction to the various pathologies he analyzed in depth. The reading of the narration of his trips, that he did in the convulse International time he lived, offers details which enable us to know firsthand the situation of urology and the human side of the actors he had relation with, and the social life they had, in addition to data about their families and daily life.

These suits are generated through any number of acts or failures to act during innumerable circumstances. We reviewed all urological claims presented to 1 representative insurance company and delineated the types of acts, settings, expenses and disposition of these claims. This review was performed to understand better the claims confronting urologists and provide future guidance to urologists in the medical malpractice setting. Working with The St. Paul Companies 259 medical malpractice claims against urologists consecutively closed from 1995 to 1999 were reviewed. Claims were defined as urological malpractice when the insured-defendant in a malpractice claim was a urologist. Each claim was reviewed in terms of disposition, patient age, geographic location, office-hospital setting, purported negligent act, procedure if applicable, litigation status and expenses incurred. Data ascertained were then compared to national practice statistics provided by the American Urological Association (AUA) and American Medical Association. In addition, a literature search with the key words urology and malpractice was performed. Related pertinent documents were reviewed and incorporated into this analysis. We reviewed 259 urological medical malpractice claims closed between 1995 and 1999. During this period The St. Paul Companies insured various numbers of private practice urologists. In the years ending 1995 to 1999, 489, 492, 438, 377 and 426 individual urologists, respectively, were insured with respective premiums paid in the amounts of $6.27, $6.23, $5.80, $5.15 and $3.87 million. Claims were analyzed by AUA section. The greatest incidence of claims occurred in the Southeastern section, followed by the North Central, South Central, Mid-Atlantic, New England, Western and New York sections. According to AUA statistics the greatest number of practicing urologists are in the Southeastern section, followed by the Western, North Central, South Central, Mid-Atlantic, New York, New England and Northeastern sections. When analyzing average expenses, the New England section had the most costly claims, followed by the Mid-Atlantic, North Central, Southeastern, South Central, Western and New York sections with respective mean expenses of $266,887, $145,031, $47,667, $41,843, $38,365, $30,037 and $1,065 per claim, respectively. The greatest percent of claims arose from the categories of inpatient, adult and surgical procedures. Endourological procedures resulted in the greatest incidence of surgical claims. However, claims related to prostatectomy involved the most expensive claims with a mean cost of $185,345. Of the surgical procedures incidents defined as postoperative complications were the most common acts of negligence generating a malpractice claim. The majority of malpractice claims were filed in court but subsequently voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. Medical malpractice persists as an issue confronting urologists. Urologists must strive to maintain open, honest, in-depth communications with their patients when occurrences with potential malpractice overtones arise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11342944/"}

A 19-question anonymous survey was sent to urologists who performed and/or moderated LCDs at the World Congress of Endourology meetings from 2008 to 2012. E-survey was distributed via e-mail, and automatic reminders were sent 2 weeks after original distribution if no response was obtained. Eighty-one percent (92/113) of the urologists responded to the survey of whom 75% practice full time in an academic setting. Only 48.0% were fellowship trained, however. More than 60% had performed more than five LCDs at their home and/or away institutions. Performing LCD at an away institution was associated with a higher level of anxiety when compared with performing LCDs at a home institution (79.8% vs 34.6%; P<0.01). Respondents considered film equipment and crew; audience and moderator discussions; unfamiliar team, instruments and tools; language barrier; and having to narrate the procedure, as distractors. Seventy-nine percent considered LCD as an ethical practice, and 90.5% regarded LCDs as a \"beneficial\" and a \"great way\" to educate. Similarly, considering the various factors and conditions associated with LCDs, 95% would agree to participate in another LCD. LCDs are perceived to be an effective mode of education by performers and moderators of LCDs. Standard guidelines and policies are needed, however, for the selection of patient, surgeon and team, equipment, and facility.

We read his books and articles from Spanish urological journals from 1930, from which we selected the references we found about him. We also used as a source our personal relationship with him. He had an important clinical and research education, a great working capacity; he was a judicious and acute observer, also obiective and rigorous checking results; the analysis of urine sediment, urinary tract infection with stone formation, and the study of bladder, neurogenic and tumoral pathologies, as well as a cystopathies, were the main topics he dedicated to; he also was outstanding in transurethral surgery. Valuable publicist, he is outstanding due to the transcendence of his written works, and especially for being the Master of an ample generation of Spanish and South American urologists, and for his love of study and urology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19166113/"}

As artificial intelligence driven tools become more prevalent in diagnostics, robotic-assisted surgeries, and patient monitoring, it is crucial for urologists to understand the ethical implications of these technologies. This review examines key ethical concerns surrounding artificial intelligence in urology, including bias, transparency, accountability, and data privacy. Recent literature highlights algorithmic bias as a significant challenge, where artificial intelligence models trained on nondiverse datasets may produce inequitable outcomes. The \"black-box\" nature of artificial intelligence systems complicates transparency and interpretability, raising concerns about clinician and patient trust. Emerging reporting standards, such as STREAM-URO and IDEAL frameworks, and WHO Guidelines provide structured approaches for ethical artificial intelligence integration in urology. The ethical deployment of artificial intelligence in urology requires a balanced approach that prioritizes fairness, accountability, and patient autonomy. Clinicians must advocate for explainable artificial intelligence, ensure equitable access, and integrate human oversight into artificial intelligence assisted decision-making. Future research should focus on improving dataset diversity, enhancing artificial intelligence interpretability, and establishing robust ethical guidelines to ensure that artificial intelligence advances align with medical ethics and patient-centered care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40114646/"}

The diagnostic process varied considerably due to a varying choice of diagnostic tests and the large differences in interpreting the qualities described by the tests. The probability that a patient would be offered a treatment within the region was analysed. For many patients the probability that a treatment was chosen was in the vicinity of 50%. No treatment probability was correlated to the symptom score of the patients. While the probability that a transurethral prostatic resection would be offered to the patients within the region was correlated significantly to urodynamic variables, residual urine and to cystoscopy findings, the probability that transurethral microwave or finasteride therapy would be offered was not correlated to any of the described qualities. The costs of the diagnostic process in all the patients incurred by each of the urologists varied by up to 500%. It was estimated that approximately 40% of the costs involved diagnostic tests that did not influence the decision to offer or not to offer treatment. In conclusion, the enormous variations in the handling of the cases recorded in the study stress the need that a management formula should be used in the handling of patients with LUTS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9561572/"}

It does, however, have considerable drawbacks. These include high levels of time expenditure and intense psychological stress, lower degree of life satisfaction, limited leisure time and private life, and immense physical stress in connection with increased health risk behavior. Between January 2004 and March 2006, a survey was conducted among urologists in private practice in the German states of Hesse, Lower Saxony, Saxony, and Thuringia concerning their life satisfaction, health status, and professional satisfaction. Of the 599 physicians contacted by mail, 194 returned the completed 14-page questionnaire. The rate of return was 30.8%. The questionnaire contained items on professional situation, wishes and plans, health, personal data, life situation, and attitude towards various aspects of life. The following questionnaires were employed: questions on professional self-efficacy according to Abele et al. (2000), on professional stress and life satisfaction according to Fahrenberg et al. (2000), and on professional gratification according to de Jonge et al. (2000). Physical complaints were assessed by the short form of the Giessen Complaint Questionnaire. When possible, the data were compared with those of a representative population sample. Analysis revealed that registered urologists considered bureaucratic administrative chores to cause the greatest strain, followed by an uncertain future and lack of a private life. Although >74.8% believed that their physical condition was good or very good, urologists suffer more frequently from cardiac and abdominal complaints than the average population and are exhausted to a considerably higher extent. With their above average willingness to overtax themselves, the imbalance between exhaustion and benefit is far greater than in the population sample.

{"id": "33016052", "title": "A global snapshot of endourology residency training.", "text": "Urology has become more complex over the last decades with surgical sophisticated technologies such as endoscopy, laparoscopy and robotic surgery. As these minimally invasive methods gain popularity throughout the world, this has led in some countries to a serious training gap as compared to other countries, and between generations of surgeons within national training systems. There is a huge heterogeneity in urological training between countries, whether developed or developing. This paper attempts to shed some light onto global urological training, comparing a significant number of various national systems, and to outline global tendencies in urological training. It will enable interested readers to see where their own system stands in international comparison, and hopefully enable them to identify training needs to achieve global quality standards. This is a questionnaire-based assessment which was sent to 240 members of U-merge from 62 countries. In addition, there is ample literature on the requirements of structured training programs and assessments, and we have tried to briefly outline the key points in this paper. We received responses from 32 countries Urology residency training is hugely heterogenous between countries. Only 44% of nations use a structured training program with assessments. Others use the Halstedian apprenticeship approach. Notably, some developing countries do use modern teaching and assessment methods, whereas some developed countries still use the outmoded apprenticeship model. For the interested reader, results have been tabled in detail, and training systems described country by country. Our results have shown a huge heterogeneity in quality urology training between countries and within continents. In systems without national structure of training, it can be assumed that such differences exist even between hospitals/ training institutions. There is no doubt in times of globalization with resident and doctor migration and exchanges that training needs structure and standardization. The still huge gap in developing countries to catch up and be able to afford latest surgical and learning technologies need to be addressed with the help of responsible outreach programs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33016052/"}

We identified the top 10 most-cited articles for the 15 urology journals with the highest impact factor in 2013 and 2016. Citation count and Altmetric scores were recorded for each of the articles. The journal impact factor and date of Twitter account development were recorded for each of the journals. The variables were analyzed in Microsoft excel using Pearson's correlation testing. A total of 300 articles were analyzed. In 2013, Altmetric scores and citation number showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.164, P = .045), although Altmetric scores did not correlate with journal impact factor (r = 0.005, P = .957). In 2016, there was significant positive correlation between Altmetric scores and citation number (r = 0.268, P = .0009), as well as between Altmetric scores and journal impact factor (r = 0.201, P = .014). The total citation count decreased from 15,235 in 2013 to 8622 in 2016 while the total Altmetric score increased from 1135 in 2013 to 2563 in 2016. Older Twitter accounts were not associated with increasing correlations between Altmetric score and bibliometrics in either 2013 (r = 0.221, P = .54) or 2016 (r = 0.083, P = .819). At this point in time, Altmetric score is only weakly correlated with citation counts in the urology literature.

A two part 24-question survey was disseminated to 1000 urology residents, fellows and attending physicians. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the respondents' demographics and education about ESI; the second part evaluated the respondent's knowledge of surgical energy methods and ESI, and was stratified into nine basic- and six advanced-knowledge questions. In all, 136 people (13.6%) viewed the survey and it was completed by 63 (6.3%). Respondents comprised 27 (43%) attending physicians, 14 (22%) minimally-invasive urology fellows and 22 (35%) urology residents. Among participants, 41 (64%) had received no formal didactic training on ESI, and a further 14% of respondents' didactic experience was limited to one lecture. Of the respondents, 70% said that monopolar energy was the mode most often used in surgery. Overall, the participants correctly answered 41% of the questions. Of the nine questions classified as 'basic' knowledge, respondents correctly answered 49%. Of the six questions classified as 'advanced' knowledge, 29% were answered correctly. The highest percentage score was obtained by the attending urologists, with a mean (range) score of 41 (29-86)%, followed by the fellows, with a mean score of 39.5 (29-57)%, and then the residents, at 34 (14-64)%. Despite widespread and growing use of ESI, there is currently minimal formal training on energy modes and current energy devices being provided to urological surgeons.

A total of 36 urology trainees participated in this prospective study. Initially, they were taken through the exercise of gaining access to the lower pole calyceal system and introducing a guidewire down the ureter. Trainees' performance was then assessed by virtual reality-derived parameters of the simulator at baseline and after 2 h of training. Participants who underwent training with the simulator demonstrated significant improvement in several parameters compared to their baseline performance. There was a statistically significant correlation between total time to perform the procedure and time of radiation exposure, radiation dose and correct calyx puncture (p < 0.01). Trainees needed a mean of 15.8 min from skin puncture to correct guidewire placement into the pelvicalyceal system before and 6.49 min following training. We found percutaneous renal access skills of trainees improve significantly on a number of parameters as a result of training on the PERC Mentor TM VR simulator. Such simulated training has the potential to decrease the risks and complications associated with the early stages of the learning curve when training for percutaneous renal access in patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22777170/"}

The goal of this process is to ensure that urologists are well trained, have an extensive fund of knowledge, demonstrate professionalism and competence in practice, and are safe to practice urology. Board certification in urology serves to both establish and confirm physician competence and ultimately protect the public. We sought to examine the relationship between board certification in urology and adverse medical license actions. We retrospectively studied deidentified physicians who attempted initial American Board of Urology certification between 1980 and 2022. The primary outcome was adverse state medical license action, defined as severe (surrendered, suspended, or denied licenses) or moderate (required continuing medical education, imposed conditions, fines, reprimands, and probations). Statistical analyses were conducted using χ<sup>2</sup> and Fisher exact tests. Five thousand five physicians were included in analyses. One hundred nineteen physicians did not obtain board certification. Only 1.4% of physicians who certified on initial attempt received disciplinary action compared with 3.0% who obtained certification on repeated attempts (Fisher exact test 0.013, <i>P</i> < .05) and 5.9% who never obtained certification (Fisher exact test 0.0018, <i>P</i> < .05). Failure to complete or repeated attempts at board certification was associated with increased rates of disciplinary actions.

His professional training was linked to the department of urology in the \"La Princesa\" Hospital chaired by Dr. Pedro Cifuentes Díaz first and Luis Cifuentes Delatte posteriorly. The important influence of French urology led Carlos Younger to complete his studies in the departments of urology chaired by professors J. Cibert (Lyon), Truc (Montpellier) and Couvelaire (Paris). When he returned from France he completed his doctoral thesis with the title \"Experimental study on the ureterosigmoidostomy type Coffey I\" directed by Prof. J. Garcia Orcoyen in 1957. His first publications started in 1946 and he ended with almost 100, including communications to various speciality congresses and meetings. Established in his private clinic in the Ferraz Street in Madrid he alternated his professional practice between Social Security patients and the Red Cross Central Hospital. At the end of his life he had collected near to 10.000 patients' clinical records. He was member of various scientific societies (among them the International Society Of Nephrology) and received various awards such as the one from the Pediatric Surgeons Association for his work on \"bladder exstrophy \"and the one from the Medical Academy of Valladolid for his study \"Vascular renal hypertension\". In 1961 he performed the second renal transplant in Spain. His professional interest was preferentially focused on uro-oncology, pediatric urology, gynecologic urology, and endoscopic surgery. He left many disciples with the same interests. The professional life of Carlos Younger de la Peña, in the period of time under analysis, is much significant as a reflex of the evolution of urology and urologists over half a century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18050769/"}

Only articles in French or English were selected. The URSr and URSuu have similar technical characteristics and are suitable for the exploration of the upper urinary excretory tract: treatment of stones of the kidney <2cm or of the ureter. The URSr is the most common type of ureteroscope. URSuu are newer and associated with many advantages: no sterilization procedure, immediate availability of equipment in the operating room, reduced waste production at the institutional level. A hybrid use of URSr and URSuu currently seems to be the best compromise from a medico-economic point of view for high volume centers. In the case of a smaller activity or a secondary site, URSuu are more advantageous and the reduction in purchasing costs should accentuate this benefit. URSr and URSuu are technically similar and allow identical treatment of upper urinary tract pathologies. Their complementary use optimizes the care of urology patients. The barrier to the exclusive use of URSuu remains their cost.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34456138/"}

In this context, urology represents an area of rapid development, particularly in uro-oncology, where a wide range of applications has focused on prostate cancer diagnosis. Other urological branches are also starting to explore the potential advantages of AI in the diagnostic and therapeutic process, and functional urology and neurourology are among them. Although the experiences in this sense have been quite limited so far, some AI applications have already started to show potential benefits, especially for urodynamic and imaging interpretation, as well as for the development of AI-based predictive models for treatment response. A few experiences on the use of ChatGPT to answer questions on functional urology and neurourology topics have also been reported. Conversely, AI applications in functional urology surgery remain largely unexplored.

Recent surveys have shown that urology training in Germany is subject to relatively few regulations on content, time and space when compared to other countries. A lack of a structured curriculum is considered as the main factor leading to dissatisfaction of the residents. Increasing work load, lack of surgical training and limited flexibility in family or research planning have been mentioned as barriers for successful training.

So we think that Urology should be understood with its historical references, because, as Aristotle said \"... thinks are better understood when one has got to clearly see how they were formed...\" Numerous specialists contributed to this; among them we can cite Prof. Rafael Alcala Santaella, the object of this bibliographic and scientific works compilation paper. We reviewed all his scientific works. Original articles have been obtained from Medicina Ibera, Revista Española de Cirugía y Urología, and Cirugía, Urología y Ginecología. His most important urologic work is Clinic Urology (1942), divided in 3 volumes. For his biography we used the biographic and bibliographic historical source of Spanish urology over the 20th-century and direct family members interviews. He analyzed topics as important as voiding disorders and the study of urine pyuria. He gave special importance to the study of prostatic pathology, its diagnosis by means of cystourethrography, and the modification of surgical techniques, as well as the results of urinary diversions performed in his department. Due to his extensive scientific and technical contributions he is one of the most outstanding figures of Valencia's Urology over the first half of the 20th century, together with Rafael Molla Rodrigo and Nicasio Benlloch Giner.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15560267/"}

The following data were collected: conference year, gender, and academic rank of \"introducer\" and of \"speaker,\" and use of PT (ie, doctor) during speaker introduction. Variations in use of PT for introductions of speakers based on gender of introducer and of speaker were analyzed by chi-square tests. Four hundred and fourteen videos were reviewed; 195 (47%) with a composite 622 introducer/speaker pairs were reviewed and analyzed. Only 8.7% of introducers and 14.6% of speakers were female (Table 1). Overall, there was no difference in the use of PT for introductions of female vs male speakers (61.5% vs 60.8%, P = 0.90). However, male speakers were more likely to be introduced as doctor when introduced by a female vs a male (75.60% vs 59.60%, P = 0.04).

Results are published in 2 parts. Part 1 covers methods, the definition of patient groups, and diagnostics. This second publication focuses on treatment of acute episodes of cystitis and pyelonephritis as well as on prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. An interdisciplinary group consisting of 17 representatives of 12 medical societies and a patient representative was formed. Systematic literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify literature published in 2010-2015. For the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC), fosfomycin-trometamol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline, pivmecillinam, and trimethoprim (depending on the local rate of resistance) are all equally recommended. Cotrimoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins are not recommended as antibiotics of first choice, for concern of an unfavorable impact on the microbiome. Mild to moderate uncomplicated pyelonephritis should be treated with oral cefpodoxime, ceftibuten, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin. For AUC with mild to moderate symptoms, instead of antibiotics symptomatic treatment alone may be considered depending on patient preference after discussing adverse events and outcomes. Primarily non-antibiotic options are recommended for prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection. In accordance with the global antibiotic stewardship initiative and considering new insights in scientific research, we updated our German clinical UTI guideline to promote a responsible antibiotic use and to give clear hands-on recommendations for the diagnosis and management of UTIs in adults in Germany for healthcare providers and patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29539622/"}

These patients exhibit a particular vulnerability, which, in the incidence of side effects or complications, leads to a loss of autonomy. Treatment sequalae, once they have arisen, can no longer be compensated. It is important to recognize and document treatment requirements among geriatric patients with the help of screening instruments such as the Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR) and Geriatric 8 (G8) scores. If a treatment requirement is identified, oncologic treatment should not be commenced uncritically but rather a focus placed on identification of functional deficits relevant to treatment, ideally using a geriatric assessment but at least based on a detailed medical history. These deficits can then be presented in a structured, examiner-independent, and forensically validated manner using special assessments. A planned treatment requires not only consideration of survival gains, but also knowledge of specific side effects and, in geriatric patients in particular, their impact on everyday life. These considerations should be compared with the patient's individual risk profile in order to prevent side effects from negating the effect of the treatment, for example by worsening the patient's self-help status. With regard to androgen deprivation in prostate cancer-which often is used uncritically-it is important to consider possible side effects such as osteoporosis, sarcopenia, anemia, and cognitive impairment in terms of a possible fall risk; an increase in cardiovascular mortality and the triggering of a metabolic syndrome on the basis of preexisting cardiac diseases or risk constellations; and to carry out a careful risk-benefit analysis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39110185/"}

However, there are no such studies in Urology. We reviewed Urology apps with the aim of assessing the level of participation of healthcare professionals (HCP) and scientific Urology associations in their development. A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, for Urology apps, available in English. Apps were reviewed by three graders to determine the app's platform, target customer, developer, app type, app category, price and the participation of a HCP or a scientific Urology association in the development. The search yielded 372 apps, of which 150 were specific for Urology. A fifth of all apps had no HCP involvement (20.7%) and only a third had been developed with a scientific Urology association (34.7%). The lowest percentage of HCP (13.4%) and urological association (1.9%) involvement was in apps designed for the general population. Furthermore, there was no contribution from an Urology society in \"Electronic Medical Record\" nor in \"Patient Information\" apps. A limitation of the study is that only Android and iOS apps were reviewed. Despite the increasing Mobile Health (mHealth) market, this is the first study that demonstrates the lack of expert participation in the design of Urology apps, particularly in apps designed for the general public. Until clear regulation is enforced, the urological community should help regulate app development. Maintaining a register of certified apps or issuing an official scientific seal of approval could improve overall app quality. We propose that urologists become stakeholders in mHealth, shaping future app design and promoting peer-review app validation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25984916/"}

However, there are many differences between the two systems. Medical training is not organized in the same way. Americans must obtain a University Master's degree before entering medical school and selection by entrance examinations at the end of the first year and at internship is specific to France. In the U.S.A., admission to a urology training programme is based on national matching, in which the candidate's personality and career are at least as important as his or her examination results. Residency lasts for about the same duration as in France. General surgical training is more succinct. Residency ends with a year of Chief Resident, which validates the practical training. A registrar position is not systematic. Residents can complete their training by a specialized fellowship (endourology, oncology, urogynaecology...) when they are planning a university career. Residents receive a very good intellectual education throughout their training, designed to prepare them for the Board certification which validates their training and authorizes them to practice. Finally, the possibility to conduct research in parallel with clinical practice is probably one of the greatest advantages of the American system which benefits from greater resources and a particularly effective organization. French and American training programmes are not organized in the same way for cultural, social and economic reasons. It would no doubt be beneficial to consider the positive aspects of transatlantic training to improve and maintain the excellence of French urology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18271424/"}

Doximity Residency Navigator was used to generate the top 50 residency programs when sorted by reputation. Residents were then found using program websites. PubMed was queried for peer-reviewed publications of incoming interns through post graduate year 3 residents as of February 2020. All PubMed-indexed research was recorded before September 15th of the residents' fourth year of medical school. We recorded the number of publications, first/last author publications, and urology-specific publications. The average number of publications across all 4 years was 2.38 ± 4.19. The average for urology-specific publications was 1.05 ± 3.19 and for first/last author publications was 0.80 ± 1.77. Most matched applicants had at least one PubMed-indexed publication (61.2%) and having over 3 placed them in the 75th percentile. It is uncommon for students to have urology specific or first/last author publications (34.0%, 36.5%). Top 10 programs matched applicants with significantly more research in each of the aforementioned categories and as program reputation declined, so did the publications of the applicants they matched. Most research that matched urology applicant's report in ERAS is not PubMed Indexed. Most had at least one PubMed-indexed publication by the time they submitted ERAS and those at top programs had more. It would be helpful to students and faculty advisors if ERAS published research metrics for matched and unmatched applicants separating PubMed-indexed work from posters and presentations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32652089/"}

The first generation of specialists (Martra, Suender and Rodríguez Viforcos, among others) are mainly professionals who studied in Paris or other European clinics and who preferentially use the techniques of transurethral surgery: lithotrity and litholapaxy, catheterism, dilations, uretrotomy, etc. as well as minor operations on the genitalia, occasionally performing some major procedures such as perineal dissection. Many of them also become experts in Dermatology and Syphiliography. Until progress of anaesthetics and surgical techniques in the last decade of the century, do not allow to conduct more risked procedures, urology surgery of greater substance will continue in the hands of general surgeons who retain a certain degree of specialization in the urinary tract. Only after the arrival to Spain of the second generation of specialists (Azcarreta, Lluria y Despau, Suarez de Mendoza, Mollá y Rodrigo, etc.), equipped with greater preparation and more advanced surgical training, the Spanish Urology will accomplish the desired position required for its ultimate segregation from General Surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8928677/"}

We analysed the written works of Julián Guimón Rezola and a collection of documents, letters, photographs, illustrations and objects from his personal and professional life, accessed through his family. We analysed the content of the author's main publications and related the documents to historic facts. Julián Guimón Rezola was an upstanding individual, a father, a family man and a nationalist before the struggle, who was dedicated to his work and particularly to teaching and health management. He started his urological career under the direction of Francisco Pérez Andrés in the Santo Civil Hospital of Bilbao. He endured unjust repression for participating in the creation of the Basque University in 1936. Sentenced to life imprisonment, he stated a new life as a reclusive surgeon in the prison of Puerto de Santa María. He was pardoned three years later but was deprived of all his offices and disqualified from civil service. He founded his clinic and maintained his training in the United States. He presided over the Medical-Surgical Insurance Group of Bilbao (Igualatorio Médico-Quirúrgico) and, on 2 occasions, the Bilbao Academy of Medical Sciences. He was considerably active professionally and focused on social medicine and modern urology. He wrote 104 scientific articles, a number of which were of considerable quality and impact. We observed an evolution in the subject matter of these articles, all with exquisite professionalism and humanity. He corresponded with renowned practitioners and was admitted to the Spanish Royal National Academy of Medicine in 1970. He ended his career with an appointment as honorary professor at the University of the Basque Country 2 years before his death. Surgeon urologist Julián Guimón Rezola was a fundamental figure in Basque and Spanish medicine in the 20th century. He was the victim of a severe reprisal, not so much for political issues but rather for his institutional loyalty. However, he regained his professional and academic prestige.

Faced with this challenge, the EAU, through its Strategy Planning Office (SPO), has prepared a document which is offered, here, in abbreviated form, to the European and international urological communities for general consideration. A group of subjects, related to the domains and internal consistency of urology as a speciality, were selected and discussed among the members of the SPO and later submitted to open consultation among distinguished members of the urological community. The topics selected for discussion included: what is urology; urology in the university; sub-specialization in urology; training in urology; does kidney transplantation belong to urology, and others. It is shown that urology is going through an exciting and hazardous transition period. Urology has conflicting problems in its traditional domains due to changes in health care policy, and internal identification problems due to its permanent expansion and sub-specialization options. Weaker points are its relation with primary care medicine (shared care options), the presence and role of urology in institutions such as the university, department of surgery, children's hospitals, administration, etc.; the desegregating effect of the sub-specialities; the increasing encroachment of other specialities, and the increasing outpatient effect of technological progress. An action plan is proposed to confront these changes without loosing manpower, internal consistency or social image and improving patient care quality, excellence of training and scientific progress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11306872/"}

The authors analysed repair figures and possible causes of damage to 35 instruments sent for repair to a leading UK supplier over a 1-year period, and calculated cost figures for maintenance of the instruments as opposed to repair and replacement costs. All damages were handling-induced and therefore did not fall under the manufacturer's warranty: 28 % were damaged by misfiring of the laser inside the instrument; 72 %, mainly crushing and stripping of the ureteroscope shaft tube, were likely to have occurred during out-of-surgery handling, washing and disinfection. Seventeen (4 %) instruments were not repaired and consequently taken out of service due to the extensive costs involved. Eighteen (51 %) ureteroscopes were repaired at an average cost of 10 833 USD. Damages to flexible ureteroscopes bear considerable costs. Most damages occur during handling between surgical procedures. Thorough adherence to handling procedures, and courses for theater staff and surgeons on handling flexible instruments may help to reduce these damages and prove a cost-saving investment. The authors provide a list of recommended procedural measures that may help to prevent such damages.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16281093/"}

We evaluated all applications submitted to our residency program for the 2020-2021 urology match. Two main formats of SLOR were identified. We extracted application characteristics and SLOR domain ratings. Ninety SLORs from 82 applicants were reviewed. Applicants were highly rated among top tiers in both formats. Some correlations were observed between domain ratings and application metrics such as Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores, and percentage of Honors in core clinical clerkships. No statistically significant differences were found between female and male applicants in terms of domain ratings. Alpha Omega Alpha members received higher ratings in \"urology resident potential,\" \"academic urologist potential,\" and \"performance as a sub-intern\" domains. Applicants from top 40 US medical schools performed better as sub-interns, and were more likely to be ranked higher. Letters from home institutions were associated with higher ratings in several domains. In-person vs virtual interactions received similar ratings except for \"communication\". While it is promising to observe such number of SLORs submitted for the first time in urology, the current formats could benefit from further refinement in their structures and domains to distinguish between highly qualified urology applicants more efficiently.

The aim of this study is to clarify how urological chief physicians assess the current situation and to present liability risks versus health risks. From July to October 2019, an anonymous online questionnaire was sent to 340 chief physicians by the Working Group Young Urologists of the German Society of Urology (DGU). The questionnaire asked about the risk assessment of the workplace, the timing of a pregnancy announcement, and the employment possibilities of pregnant employees in urology. In addition, a law firm was commissioned to prepare a brief legal opinion on the topic of medical work and surgery during pregnancy with specific reference to the field of urology, including any liability risks. In all, 62 chief physicians participated in the survey (18.2%): 93.5% of the respondents considered an anticipatory risk assessment of the workplace for pregnant women to be useful; 82.3% would appreciate an overlapping recruitment by the employer. Respondents (62.9%) were skeptical of pregnant employees operating. Taking into account the regulations of the Maternity Protection Act, the liability risk does not exceed that which the employer generally has to bear. The amendment of the Maternity Protection Act has not fundamentally changed the reality for female urologists. However, the individual risk assessment provides an opportunity to develop concrete protective measures-also for the operating room-with the employer.

We requested data from NHS Resolutions to investigate current litigation numbers, costs and causes for claims. Data collected included the number of claims dating from 1996 to 2019, the total sum of damages paid out each year for urology and the causes for the claims dating from 2009 to 2019. Data from NHS Resolutions were analysed, stratified and categorized by the authors from this information, which was provided as two separate documents. The total cost of damages between 1997 and 2017 was £74.5m (range: £241 325-£7.8m per year). While the number of successful claims was 1653 (range 7-168 per year), the total number of claims was 3341 (range 31-347 per year) and, over time, this has increased almost sevenfold. The cost of damages has increased roughly in line with the number of claims. Over the last 10 years, non-operative-related claims accounted for 984 claims, of which the largest subset was for 'the failure to diagnose and/or treat' (n = 639, 65%), with 88 (9%) successful consent-related claims. There were 226 intra-operative-related claims. Of these, wrong-site surgery, a never-event, accounted for eight claims and there were six successful claims for failing to supervise juniors. A total of 1129 claims were postoperative claims, with retained foreign body or instrument accounting for 71 (6%) of these. The number and cost of litigation claims have increased year on year. There is a need for continual improvement in patient care, surgical training, counselling, informed consent and early management of complications. The evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that the best approach to this is the combination of rigid adherence to and re-enforcement of common surgical guidelines and implementation of the national 'Getting it right first time' initiative.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33773003/"}

Respondents were questioned on empirical medical therapy use, patient evaluation and selection, and preferred medications. A total of 387 urologists (5%) participated in the survey, of whom 16% had infertility fellowship training, two-thirds used empirical medical therapy and 78% treated with empirical medical therapy and surgery. Laboratory values important for identifying ideal candidates include sperm concentration, serum follicle-stimulating hormone and serum testosterone. The most common medications used were clomiphene citrate, human chorionic gonadotropin and anastrozole. Of respondents 25% would treat infertile males with testosterone while the patient actively pursued pregnancy. Overall 60.5% of respondents would treat with empirical therapy for 3 to 6 months. Of fellowship trained and general urologist respondents 70% and 47%, respectively, counseled patients that empirical medical therapy has unknown effects on pregnancy and sperm count. Empirical medical therapy is used by two-thirds of survey respondents for idiopathic male infertility. There is no clear, universal pattern to the evaluation or identification of the ideal patient for such therapy among those surveyed. There is no consensus on the optimal medication and considerable ambiguity exists as to perceived effects on fertility. Of concern is that 25% of respondents use exogenous testosterone, a medication known for its contraceptive potential, for male infertility treatment.

Of the female urologists satisfied (vs. not satisfied) with their professional situation, 95% (vs. 87%) were also satisfied with their choice of urology as their specialty. Satisfaction with the working time model (odds ratio [OR] 9.61) and feeling unequal treatment (OR: 0.18) were independent predictors of satisfaction with the professional situation. Considering the increasing proportion of women in the health sector, it is important to identify factors influencing decisions on career and choice of specialty as well as career progression.

We reviewed the literature for robust evidence that surgeon and hospital volumes are markers of improved outcome of radical cystectomy. Outcome can be measured by postoperative mortality, as well as complication rate, recurrence rate, and several other factors. Evidence suggests that outcome is improved after cystectomy performed at high-volume centers and by high-volume surgeons. The limitations of volume-based referral policies are discussed, and the use of alternative strategies is reviewed. A significant regionalization of cystectomy has already been established. Owing to their limitations, however, volume-based referral systems have not been embraced by all parties.

In 2014, the urology residency program directors were surveyed using an email questionnaire. The generated questionnaire included the following 3 components: (1) assessing the factors used in selecting applicants for interviewing and matching, (2) rating the factors resulting in a negative decision for applicants for interviewing and matching, and (3) investigating the factors that gave applicants special attention or consideration from program directors. Analysis of variance testing and post hoc Student t tests were used to assess for differences in the mean importance score of the factors. Urology reference letters and United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores were ranked as the most important factors for applicant selection. A USMLE Step 1 score ≤220 and a USMLE Step 2 score ≤220 were the most deleterious factors to applicants, with a previous match failure being no less deleterious to an applicant than a USMLE Step 1 or 2 score ≤220. Program directors gave special attention or consideration to gender (25%), minority status (36.8%), being from the same medical school as the program director (61.8%), completing an away rotation at the program director's institution (86.8%), being a child of an academic urologist (47.4%), and being a child of an academic nonurologic physician (15.8%). Although program directors consider a variety of factors during the residency selection process, USMLE performance, urology references, and completing an away rotation at the program directors' institution appear to be the most important factors to program directors during the residency selection process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25817098/"}

The survey instrument sought to understand QI curricular methods and experiences of urology residents as well as their knowledge of QI fundamentals. Of 465 invited residents, 159 (34%) responded. Respondents represented all 8 AUA sections. The majority of respondents self-identified as white (66%). Females made up 30% of respondents. Less than 1/3 of residents (32%) report use of online modules, whereas nearly 2/3 (63%) report lecture-based didactics. Fifteen percent of residents report no QI curriculum. While nearly 2/3 of residents report receiving training in QI principles (64%), far less report receiving training in how to apply QI methodology (44%). Only 29% of residents report being required to lead a QI project. No differences were seen by training level. Only 3 respondents had heard of the Institute of Medicine's aims for quality improvement. Respondents had better knowledge of process, balancing and outcome measures, but less than half of respondents (49%) were able to correctly identify all 3. Having any QI curriculum is associated with correctly answering knowledge questions (P = .03). From a resident perspective, urology residency programs currently provide QI curricula that are inadequate to ensure residents achieve Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education milestones.

A self-administrated questionnaire enquired about their experience in laparoscopy and they were divided to 4 categories: no experience, minimal experience, basic and advanced laparoscopists. Tests consisted of 4 tasks: passage of a ligature, intracorporeal knotting, intracorporeal suturing, and cutting a carton circle out of a square. All tests were supervised and time was recorded for each of the tasks. Histograms were plotted showing the mean time for performance of each task in each experience group. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used to assess statistical significance. Seven participants had no previous experience in laparoscopy and 14 had minimal experience. 15 had basic experience and 8 were advanced laparoscopists. No difference in performance was found between the no experience and minimal experience group and they were united and defined as beginners. A significant difference in performance was noted between the beginners, basic and advanced groups, especially when comparing beginners to advanced. Criterion level values of surgical performance drawn from this data were highly discriminative with sensitivity of 71-85% and specificity of 74.2%-88%. We were able to differentiate between various levels of laparoscopic skills among the participating urologists. Values drawn from such studies could be the basis of criterion level values for technical laparoscopic performance during training programs and before granting laparoscopic privileges to urologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15774246/"}

An anonymous survey was given to urology residents attending the American Urological Association Basic Sciences Course in 2008 and 2009. We evaluated laparoscopic simulator use within a curriculum and use of simulators outside of a curriculum. Face and content validity of simulators were analyzed on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. Responses were compared using the unpaired Student t test and chi-square with P<0.05 considered significant. There were 114 surveys (81.4% response rate) and 76 surveys (43% response rate) evaluated from 2008 and 2009, respectively. Access to a surgical simulator increased from 74.6% to 78%. The percentage of programs with a laparoscopic curriculum expanded from 16.9% to 44%. In 2009, simulators were used more frequently by residents in programs with curricula compared with residents without curricula (P=0.03). In 2008, 48% of residents and in 2009 72% of residents reported using simulators as \"never\" or \"once or twice a year.\" Of residents, 93% stated that urology programs should use laparoscopic curricula and 82% think simulators should be involved in the curricula. One third of residents agreed that simulators are helpful for skill acquisition, and 80% described their current laparoscopic curriculum as inadequate. The number of urology programs that have invested in simulators continues to expand. Despite access to laparoscopic simulators, residents rarely use them. Residents in programs with laparoscopic curricula report using surgical simulators more often than residents without curricula. Laparoscopic curricula are important, and the incorporation of simulators enhances surgical education.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22017283/"}

Aside political support, certain writings published astride the last century and this one, will prove to be decisive to consolidate the urological specialty in our country.

The Academies of Medicine and Surgery, in Madrid, also played a significant role in this task of promotion and diffusion of these specialties, in particular Urology; it is quite likely that the seed of new vocations would have germinated during their institutional meetings. At any rate, it is easy to demonstrate documentally how, since mid 19th Century, the nation's capital was witness of the attention given to the urinary tract which began to occupy a preferential position in the work of the most renowned general surgeons from the School of Madrid, such as Diego de Argumosa, Alejandro San Martin, Federico Rubio y Gali and Jesus Creus y Mansó.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8928676/"}

Since andrology is a clinical discipline, only well-trained physicians are allowed to investigate and treat patients. The term 'andrology', which was first introduced in the USA more than 100 years ago, was independently reborn in Germany and thereafter used in other European countries. Since then, an increasing number of physicians all over the world have applied the term 'andrology' for their professional work. Many local societies and groups of andrologists were established. In 1969, Andrologia was founded as the first international journal of andrology in Germany. In the meantime, further andrological journals have been established. Concerning the future development of andrology, the following should be considered: (i) the organizational structure of andrology must include the basic training of physicians working in this field; (ii) the necessity of andrology as a medical specialty with regard to modern technologies of assisted reproduction etc., must be emphasized; (iii) internationally accepted recommendations for the training of andrologists with special reference to both clinical andrology and laboratory techniques should be established; (iv) andrology should be established as a separate specialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8738075/"}

Results are presented as the median (interquartile range). Sixty answers out of 115 research fellows (response rate 52%) were computed. Median age was 29 years (28-30) during the research year and male proportion 75%. The AFU grant was obtained by 57.4% of applicants, 56.4% for various grants and 47.6% for the research fellowship university grant. The annual gross amount was 29,870€ (22,710-30,195), without any significant difference between residency subdivisions. Financial supplements were obtained by being on-duty (26.2%), on-call (28.6%) and replacements (25%). The research fellowship year was done between 4th and 5th years of residency (53%), for a one-year length (96.7%) and in France (86.6%). Urologic cancerology was the thematic the most studied (60%). The research fellowship was done in view of an academic career (31.7%) or was done to wait for a post-residency position (20.8%). About a quarter was being proposed a chief-residency position before the beginning of the research year. During this year, 76.7% published. About 63% were interested in pursuing with a PhD. This study confirmed the interest for a research fellowship by French urologists-in-training.

We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience with 49 urology residents who matriculated between 2000 and 2011 and graduated between 2006 and 2016. In 2005, the duration of residency was changed from 6 to 5 years. The number of peer-reviewed original publications before and during residency was obtained via Scopus. Associations of features from the medical student application with number of publications, pursuit of fellowship, and an academic career were evaluated with logistic regression. Among the 49 graduates, 19 (39%) had a peer-reviewed publication before residency. The mean (standard deviation) and median (range) number of publications during residency was 9.0 (9.4) and 6 (1-41), respectively. In a multivariable analysis, the only feature significantly associated with ≥6 publications during residency was a 6 vs 5 year residency program (odds ratio 5.71; P = .018). Twenty five (51%) residents pursued a fellowship, and the only feature significantly associated with this was female gender (odds ratio 7.33, P = .018). Seventeen (35%) residents pursued an academic career, and the only feature from the medical school record that was significantly associated with an academic career was ≥1 publication before residency (odds ratio 3.65; P = .040). A research year during urology residency is significantly associated with scholarly productivity.

Comparative audits using overall mortality and morbidity figures can be misleading as they do not take into account variations in urological procedure and patient fitness. The purpose of our study was to compare the crude operative morbidity and mortality rates with the predicted rates using an established scoring system (POSSUM). To examine these effects, we compared 5 urological operations (transurethral resection of the prostate, transurethral resection of the bladder, radical nephrectomy, suprapubic enucleation of the prostate and radical prostatovesiculectomy) performed by 2 urologists in a prospective study during a 12-month period. POSSUM consists of a simple preoperative physiological score, a postoperative score and defined kinds of complications. One urologist operated on 160 patients, with an operative mortality of 2.5% and morbidity of 31.3%. The other urologist operated on 144 patients, with an operative mortality of 0.7% and morbidity of 9%. At first sight, there appear to be significant differences in operative outcome between the 2 urologists. However, analysis using the POSSUM system predicts a mortality rate of 3.1% for the first urologist and 0.7% for the second urologist (morbidity rates of 35% for the first urologist and 10.4% for the second urologist). Receiver operating curve analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the 2 urologists. The present study demonstrates how misleading crude mortality and morbidity figures can be when comparing different urologists. By producing a single assessment of physiological status at the time of operation and of operative severity, POSSUM analysis allows a more realistic comparison between different urologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11306873/"}

Albeit the influence of the French School and French publications on the first specialists is manifest, since most of them were training in Paris, it is obvious that the genesis and progress of specialization on genitourinary organs disorders, as well as other areas, in Spain would have not been possible without the concourse and political support received from relevant personalities such as Dr. Federico Rubio y Gali and Dr. Angel Pulido Fernández, both with partial dedication to the urinary tract and to whom the Spanish Association of Urology still owns further recognition for the role they played in the promotion of these earlier specialists and the establishment of centres and hospital services where their work could be carried out. Since, during the final third of last century, the number of Spanish publications, journals and monographs devoted to urological topics, a extensive revision of which is covered in this paper, is increasingly profuse, the boom of the specialty in genitourinary tract disorders will determine its ultimate consolidation at the beginning of the 20th Century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8928675/"}

Applicants were divided into top (16%), middle (68%), and bottom (16%) strata based on a normal distribution. Programs were divided into 3 equally sized strata (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) based on Doximity rankings. Outcomes include results of a simulated AUA Match: percentage of training positions filled, percentage of interview spots filled, percentage of applicants matching from each stratum, applicant preference distribution (the percentage breakdown of applicants matching at their first, second, third, fourth, or >fourth choice), and cost/time savings of a capped application process. Based on the results of our simulated model, match parameters were optimized with caps of 50 applications and 20 interviews per applicant. Programs filled all training positions and nearly all interview spots. Top applicants matched more frequently than middle applicants who matched more frequently than bottom applicants. Applicant preference distribution remained stable with these caps compared to the true match results.

Between July 2009 and June 2010, 51 students followed the core learning objectives curriculum. We compared the curriculum outcomes using objective and subjective measures. Overall student participation was 90%, with 95 of 106 students completing both assessment tools. The objective scores of the students following the core learning objectives were higher than those of the students following the traditional curriculum. The t test to evaluate the difference between the 2 curricula was statistically significant (t = 2.845, df = 93, p <0.05). Subjective scores for the core learning objectives group were lower in all but 1 category. Student perception of knowledge attainment for the core learning objectives cohort was higher than that of the traditional cohort, but none of the subjective scores was statistically significant. This study demonstrated that a core learning objectives curriculum was associated with higher objective test scores compared to a traditional model, suggesting that the core learning objectives curriculum increased student learning compared to the traditional curriculum.

The traditional method of training is based on the imitation of the skills and behaviors of the tutors, creating variability in the training between different centers and giving a passive role to resident internal physicians (MIR). The 2006 BOE establishes the specific formative content in its theoretical, practical and scientific facets. At the beginning of the MIR training period, the first year focuses on general surgical training and the remaining four on specific urological training. The current legislative framework that regulates our specialty is one of the oldest, with no prospect of renewal, since this would be carried out with the development of the trunk project, currently paralyzed after the judgment of the Supreme Court. Therefore, we are in a situation of uncertainty with a legal framework in renewal plans. CURRENT STATE OF TRAINING: a National survey shows the degree of surgical participation of the MIR is low, as well as training on models and course attendance. In addition, the self-confidence they feel for interventions that could be considered of low complexity is high, for activities such as consultation is moderate and for interventions of moderate-high complexity is low. The current training program is upgradeable. New studies and efforts should aim to standardize the acquisition of surgical and non-surgical skills, guarantee access to surgical training courses, establish a minimum of required interventions per year and at the end of residency, foster academic training, participation in research of residents and achieve an objective assessment of the specialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29336326/"}

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71%, respectively). Approximatively, 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period.

To define methodological aspects related to therapeutic trials in urology. To exhaustively study three urology journals in order to analyse the methodological quality of the articles published. The basic principles of therapeutic trials are described: the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is the most valid trial to demonstrate the efficacy of a treatment. In surgery, and especially in urology, these therapeutic trials comparing two surgical techniques must be conducted by teams accepting the ambivalence of comparison after randomization. Ideally, treatment is evaluated by observers blinded to the technique used. The assessment criteria must be as clinical as possible and must be based on universally accepted standardized measurements. The quality of a therapeutic trial is assessed in terms of its protocol, but also on the quality of practical conduct of the trial, the precision and accuracy of its statistical analysis and the presentation of the results. The first 1995 issue of the \"Journal of Urology\", the \"British Journal of Urology\" and \"Progrès en Urologie\" were studied exhaustively, looking for articles dealing with a therapeutic evaluation. The comparative or non-comparative nature of the study, the presence or absence of randomization, double-blind, and a predetermined sample size were noted for each study. Ten non-comparative retrospective studies, one non-comparative prospective study and five trials with a control group, including two open randomized trials were reported in the \"Journal of Urology\". Nine retrospective non-controlled studies were reported in the \"British Journal of Urology\". Seven retrospective studies, including one open, non-randomized study with a control group, were reported in \"Progrès en Urologie\". The principles of the methodology of therapeutic trials can be applied to the evaluation of a treatment or a surgical technique, especially in urology.

Although the quality of urology education was valued from moderate to high, urology as a speciality did not influence their future training decision making. Decision making in relation to residency training correlated with the number of hours spent on practical training, duration of urology rotation, and year of medical school in which urological exposure was introduced. The current European exposure to urology at undergraduate level is heterogeneous, with various factors influencing future decisions regarding training and specialisation.

The itinerant surgeon was known to go from town to town to remove bladder stones in the early middle ages. In this century, urologists had been at the forefront in pioneering minimally invasive surgery with the introduction of transurethral resection of the prostate more than 50 years ago in the United States. This could be considered the first revolution in urology and this has influenced the evolution of urology in Singapore. Transurethral surgery had proved to be far superior to open surgery for most lesions of the lower urinary tract. This technique was introduced to Singapore in the early 1970s by Dr N E Wong. Because of the need for special instruments, skill and training, there was a need for a Department of Urology. This was not to be until after the second revolution in urology. The second revolution saw the introduction of endoscopic surgery of the upper urinary tract and Extra-corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy in the early 1980s. This had truly revolutionised the treatment of urinary stones and today almost 95% of patients can be treated with these non to minimally invasive techniques. These new modalities of treatment were rapidly introduced in Singapore in the mid 1980s. The need for the establishment of urology as a specialty was more urgently felt. The Singapore Urological Association was formed in February 1986 and in March 1987, a Division of Urology was formed at the Singapore General Hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8363345/"}

TRUS, percutaneous renal access and adrenal surgery were perceived as useful by the majority of those practicing in rural and non-academic urban centers compared to those in academic centers where the majority rated these skills as \"not useful\". Virtually all non-clinical components of training were rated as \"useful\". The majority of respondents felt that residency training prepared them for the following challenges: accepting responsibility for patient care, assessing scientific literature, ethical decision-making and communication. The majority of respondents felt that residency did not prepare them for the following challenges: time and office management, hospital administration and providing care within a constrained system. Specific clinical and non-clinical areas of training have high perceived utility in all settings of practice. Certain clinical components of training have high perceived utility only in specific settings of practice. There are many non-clinical components of practice, which are perceived to be important, but for which BC urologists feel inadequately prepared for by their residency training programs. If consistent across Canada, these findings may facilitate a rational approach to the modification of the objectives for urology residency training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14503937/"}

An anonymous electronic survey was sent to all members of the Society of Women in Urology and all female non-Society of Women in Urology members of the American Urologic Association. The survey was distributed in January of 2015. Demographic, work, and personal life data were collected. Of 1563 e-mails with a link to our survey sent to women urologists in the United States, 365 surveys were completed for a 23% response rate. The average age of all participants was 39 years (range 25-73 years). Practicing women urologists had an average age of 44 years (range 32-65 years) compared to the average age (53 years) of all practicing urologists reported in the 2014 American Urologic Association Census. The majority of practicing female urologists live and work in a population of >1 million whereas a few live and work in rural areas. Practicing women urologists are most likely to work academic or group practice. Twenty percent of practicing women urologists reported working part-time, but almost 70% report working >50 hours/week. Women urologists in the United States are younger than their male counterparts and most work full-time in urban academic centers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26952567/"}

Data collected through surveys distributed to all urology program directors (PD) consisting of questions covering program demographics, applicant selection criteria, preference signals (PS), virtual interviews (VI), and other relevant topics. 89, 90, and 89 PD participated in the surveys for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The analysis revealed shifts in application review criteria, with increased emphasis on subinternship performance, letters of recommendation, and USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores. PS were widely adopted and viewed positively by PD, with a majority supporting the continuation in a large-volume format. VI were met with mixed sentiments, with concerns raised about their effectiveness in assessing candidates and replicating in-person experiences. However, they were recognized for their potential to level the playing field. This study underscores the evolving landscape of urology resident match. The adoption of VI, PS, and other changes co-occurring in medical education have altered the means through which applicants have been historically assessed. The findings highlight the need for ongoing feedback and transparency to ensure equitable practices for both applicants and residency programs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39701188/"}

An originality of the test is that answer keys use an aggregate scoring method based on answers given by a panel of experts. Previous studies have shown that the SC test has good construct validity. This study, done in urology, explores (1) the stability of the construct validity of the test across two different linguistic and learning environments and (2) the effect of the use of experts who belong to different environments. An 80-item SC test was administered to participants from a French and a Canadian university. Two levels of experience were tested: 25 residents in urology (11 from the French university and 14 from the Canadian university) and 23 students (15 from the French faculty, eight from the Canadian faculty). Reliability analysis was studied with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Scores between groups were compared by analysis of variance. Reliability coefficient of the 80 items test was 0.794 for the French participants and 0.795 for the Canadian participants. Scores increased with clinical experience in urology in the two sites. Candidates obtained higher scores when correction was done using the answer key provided by the experts from the same country. These data support the stability of the construct validity of the tool across different learning environments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12450473/"}

All 2016 Urology Residency Match applicants to the study-participating institutions were provided a survey via email inquiring about their paths to urology, their career aspirations, how they evaluate a training program, and how they perceive residency programs evaluate them. Of a possible 468 applicants registered for the match, 346 applicants completed the survey. Only 8.7% had a mandatory urology rotation, yet 58.4% believed that a mandatory urology rotation would influence their career decision. Most applicants (62.1%) spent more than 8 weeks on urology rotations, and 79.2% completed 2 or more away rotations. Applicants were attracted to urology by the diversity of procedures, prior exposure to the field, and the mix of medicine and surgery, with mean importance scores of 4.70, 4.52, and 4.45 of 5, respectively. Female applicants were more likely to be interested in pediatric urology, trauma or reconstructive urology, and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. Significant differences in survey results were noted when applicants were separated by gender. Three-fourths of respondents (75.7%) applied to more than 50 residency programs. Applicants ranked operative experience, interactions with current residents, and relationships between faculty and residents as the most important criteria when evaluating training programs. Of the subspecialties, 62.1% of applicants expressed most interest in urologic oncology. At this stage in their career, a significant majority (83.5%) expressed interest in becoming academic faculty.
