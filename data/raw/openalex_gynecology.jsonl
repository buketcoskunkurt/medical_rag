Yet it is poorly documented in the literature. METHODS Three hundred seventy patients with PC from non-gynecologic malignancies were followed prospectively: the PC was of gastric origin in 125 cases, of colorectal origin in 118 cases, of pancreatic origin in 58 cases, of unknown origin in 43 cases, and of miscellaneous origins in 26 cases. A previously reported PC staging system was used to classify these 370 patients. RESULTS Mean and median overall survival periods were 6.0 and 3.1 months, respectively. Survival rates were mainly affected by the initial PC stage (9.8 months for Stage I with malignant peritoneal granulations less than 5 mm in greatest dimension, versus 3.7 months for Stage IV with large, malignant peritoneal masses more than 2 cm in greatest dimension). The presence of ascites was associated with poor survival of patients with gastric or pancreatic carcinoma. Differentiation of the primary tumor did not influence the prognoses of patients with PC. CONCLUSIONS A better knowledge of the natural history of PC is needed, in view of the many Phase I, II, and III trials currently being conducted to evaluate aggressive multimodal therapeutic approaches to treating patients with PC from non-gynecologic malignancies.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2095543034", "title": "Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Neoplasms of Soft Tissue and Gynecologic Origin", "text": "PEComas, occasionally associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex, are defined by the presence of perivascular epithelioid cells that coexpress muscle and melanocytic markers. This family of tumors includes angiomyolipoma (AML), clear cell sugar tumor of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and very rare tumors in other locations. Because non-AML/non-LAM PEComas are extremely rare and their natural history and prognostic features undefined, we present our experience with 26 PEComas of soft tissue and the gynecologic tract, the largest series to date. We also performed a detailed review of the literature, with special attention to features predictive of clinical behavior. All PEComas exclusive of AML and LAM were retrieved from our consultation files. Immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (CK), S-100 protein, smooth muscle actins (SMA), desmin, vimentin, HMB45, Melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), TFE3, CD117, and CD34 was performed. Clinical follow-up information was obtained. Fisher's exact test was performed. The median patient age was 46 years (range, 15-97 years); there was a marked female predominance (22 females, 4 males). Sites of involvement included the omentum or mesentery (6 cases), uterus (4 cases), pelvic soft tissues (3 cases), abdominal wall (2 cases), uterine cervix (2 cases), and vagina, retroperitoneum, thigh, falciform ligament, scalp, broad ligament, forearm, shoulder, and neck (1 case each). The tumors ranged from 1.6 to 29 cm in size (median, 7.8 cm). Tumors were epithelioid (N = 9), spindled (N = 7), or mixed (N = 10). Multinucleated giant cells were present in 18 cases. High nuclear grade was noted in 10 cases, high cellularity in 7 cases, necrosis in 8 cases, and vascular invasion in 3 cases. Mitotic activity was 0 to 50 mitotic figures (MF)/50 high power fields (HPF) (median, 0 MF/50 HPF) with atypical MF in 6 cases. IHC results were: SMA (20/25), desmin (8/22), HMB45 (22/24), Melan-A (13/18), MITF (9/18), S-100 protein (8/24), CK (3/23), vimentin (12/14), TFE3 (5/17), c-kit (1/20), and CD34 (0/7). Clinical follow-up (24 of 26 patients, 92%; median, 30 months; range, 10-84 months) showed 3 local recurrences and 5 distant metastases. At last available clinical follow-up, 2 patients (8%) were dead of disease, 4 patients (17%) were alive with metastatic or unresectable local disease, and 18 patients (75%) were alive with no evidence of disease. No patient in our series had a history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Recurrence and/or metastasis was strongly associated tumor size > median size (8 cm), mitotic activity greater than 1/50 HPF, and necrosis. We conclude that PEComas of soft tissue and gynecologic origin may be classified as \"benign,\" \"of uncertain malignant potential,\" or \"malignant.\" Small PEComas without any worrisome histologic features are most likely benign. PEComas with nuclear pleomorphism alone (\"symplastic\") and large PEComas without other worrisome features have uncertain malignant potential. PEComas with two or more worrisome histologic features should be considered malignant. Occasional PEComas express unusual markers, such as S-100 protein, desmin, and rarely CK. The role of TFE3 in PEComas should be further studied.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.pas.0000173232.22117.37", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2095543034", "source": "openalex"}

The benefit of prophylactic gynecologic surgery for women with this syndrome has been uncertain. We designed this study to determine the reduction in the risk of gynecologic cancers associated with prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with the Lynch syndrome.Three hundred fifteen women with documented germ-line mutations associated with the Lynch syndrome were identified. Women who had undergone prophylactic hysterectomy (61 women) and women who had undergone prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (47 women) were matched with mutation-positive women who had not undergone the procedure in question (210 women for the analysis of endometrial cancer and 223 for the analysis of ovarian cancer). Women who had undergone prophylactic surgery and their matched controls were followed from the date of the surgery until the occurrence of cancer or until the data were censored at the time of the last follow-up visit.There were no occurrences of endometrial, ovarian, or primary peritoneal cancer among the women who had undergone prophylactic surgery. Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 69 women in the control group (33 percent), for an incidence density of 0.045 per woman-year, yielding a prevented fraction (the proportion of potential new cancers prevented) of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 90 to 100 percent). Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 12 women in the control group (5 percent), for an incidence density of 0.005 per woman-year, yielding a prevented fraction of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -62 to 100 percent).These findings suggest that prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is an effective strategy for preventing endometrial and ovarian cancer in women with the Lynch syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa052627", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035624229", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to identify factors predictive of poor prognosis in a similarly treated population of women with advanced EOC. Patients and Methods A retrospective review of demographic, pathologic, treatment, and outcome data from 1,895 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III EOC who had undergone primary surgery followed by six cycles of intravenous platinum/paclitaxel was conducted. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of prognostic factors with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Increasing age was associated with increased risks for disease progression (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11 for an increase every 10 years) and death (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.18). Mucinous or clear-cell histology was associated with a worse PFS and OS compared with serous carcinomas. Patients with performance status (PS) 1 or 2 were at an increased risk for recurrence compared with PS 0 (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.24). Compared with patients with microscopic residual disease, patients with 0.1 to 1.0 cm and &gt; 1.0 cm residual disease had an increased risk of recurrence (HR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.70 to 2.26; and HR = 2.36; 95% CI, 2.04 to 2.73, respectively) and death (HR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.78 to 2.49; P &lt; .001; and HR = 2.47; 95% CI, 2.09 to 2.92, respectively).

Therefore, the authors evaluated these phenomena in a dose-response study. Methods Two groups of 12 patients each who were undergoing major intraabdominal gynecologic surgery were assigned randomly to receive 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer's solution in a dosage of 30 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1). The pH, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, and total protein were measured in 30-min intervals. The serum bicarbonate concentration was calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and also using the Stewart approach from the strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid. The strong ion difference was calculated as serum sodium + serum potassium - serum chloride - serum lactate. The amount of weak plasma acid was calculated as the serum total protein concentration in g/dl x 2.43. Results Infusion of 0.9% saline, but not lactated Ringer's solution, caused a metabolic acidosis with hyperchloremia and a concomitant decrease in the strong ion difference. Calculating the serum bicarbonate concentration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Stewart approach produced equivalent results. Conclusions Infusion of approximately 30 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1) saline during anesthesia and surgery inevitably leads to metabolic acidosis, which is not observed after administration of lactated Ringer's solution.

The questionnaire included demographic questions, a validated, generic supportive care needs measure, and a supplementary, newly developed, lymphedema needs module.Ten percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-12%) of participants reported being diagnosed with lymphedema, and a further 15% (95% CI, 13%-17%) reported undiagnosed \"symptomatic\" lower limb swelling. Diagnosed lymphedema was more prevalent (36%) amongst vulvar cancer survivors. For cervical cancer survivors, those who had radiotherapy or who had lymph nodes removed had higher odds of developing swelling. For uterine and ovarian cancer survivors, those who had lymph nodes removed or who were overweight or obese had higher odds of developing swelling. Gynecological cancer survivors with lymphedema had higher supportive care needs in the information and symptom management domains compared with those who had no swelling.This population-based study provided evidence that lymphedema is a morbidity experienced by a significant proportion of gynecological cancer survivors and that there are considerable levels of associated unmet needs.

The goals were to determine the superior chemoradiation regimen and to quantitate the relative toxicities. METHODS: All patients had biopsy-proven invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Patients underwent standard clinical staging studies and their tumors were found to be International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stages IIB, III, or IVA. Negative cytologic washings and para-aortic lymph nodes were required for entry. Patients were randomized to receive either standard whole pelvic RT with concurrent 5-FU infusion and bolus CF or the same RT plus oral HU. RESULTS: Of 388 randomized patients, 368 were eligible; 177 were randomized to CF and 191 to HU. Adverse effects were predominantly hematologic or gastrointestinal in both regimens. Severe or life-threatening leukopenia was more common in the HU group (24%) than in the CF group (4%). The difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically significant in favor of the CF group (P = .033). The sites of progression in the two treatment groups were not substantially different. Survival was significantly better for the patients randomized to CF (P = .018). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that for patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix, the combination of 5-FU and CF with RT offers patients better PFS and overall survival than HU, and with manageable toxicity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1999.17.5.1339", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1935824237", "source": "openalex"}

However, its presence in situ in solid human tumors has not been reported. In this study, we have investigated NO synthase activity and its cellular localization in malignant and nonmalignant human gynecological tissue. Nitric oxide synthase activity was observed in malignant tissue, was highest (> or = 250 pmol/min/g tissue) in poorly differentiated tumors, and was below detectable levels in normal gynecological tissue. Furthermore, investigations with a polyclonal NO synthase antibody revealed immunoreactivity only in malignant tissue. This was associated with NO synthase activity and localized to tumor cells.

New insights and more experience were gained since the first consensus meeting 5 years ago. METHODS: Members of the European Society of Gynecological Oncology task force \"Cancer in Pregnancy\" in concert with other international experts reviewed the existing literature on their respective areas of expertise. The summaries were subsequently merged into a complete article that served as a basis for discussion during the consensus meeting. All participants approved the final article. RESULTS: In the experts' view, cancer can be successfully treated during pregnancy in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, optimizing maternal treatment while considering fetal safety. To maximize the maternal outcome, cancer treatment should follow a standard treatment protocol as for nonpregnant patients. Iatrogenic prematurity should be avoided. Individualization of treatment and effective psychologic support is imperative to provide throughout the pregnancy period. Diagnostic procedures, including staging examinations and imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging and sonography, are preferable. Pelvic surgery, either open or laparoscopic, as part of a treatment protocol, may reveal beneficial outcomes and is preferably performed by experts. Most standard regimens of chemotherapy can be administered from 14 weeks gestational age onward. Apart from cervical and vulvar cancer, as well as important vulvar scarring, the mode of delivery is determined by the obstetrician. Term delivery is aimed for. Breast-feeding should be considered based on individual drug safety and neonatologist-breast-feeding expert's consult. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited evidence-based information, cancer treatment during pregnancy can succeed. State-of-the-art treatment should be provided for this vulnerable population to preserve maternal and fetal prognosis.

PTEN, a candidate tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 10q23.3, was recently identified and found to be homozygously deleted or mutated in several different types of human tumors. To determine if PTEN is a target of 10q loss of heterozygosity in carcinomas of the endometrium, we examined 32 primary endometrial carcinomas for mutations in PTEN. The tumors included the two major histopathological types of endometrial carcinoma: endometrioid (n = 26; 14 microsatellite instability (MI)-positive and 12 MI-negative) and serous (n = 6). Overall, mutations were detected in 50% of the endometrial carcinomas we analyzed. Mutations were present in 12 of 14 (86%) MI-positive and 4 of 12 (33%) MI-negative endometrioid tumors. Furthermore, mutations were found in all three histological grades of MI-positive endometrioid carcinoma. All six serous endometrial carcinomas lacked detectable mutations. To evaluate the role of PTEN in other common malignancies of the female genital tract, 12 serous ovarian carcinomas and 10 squamous cervical carcinomas were analyzed and were negative for mutations. Our results support PTEN as a tumor suppressor gene and suggest that mutations in PTEN play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1565532031", "source": "openalex"}

For this report, the authors evaluated the effects of primary surgery by a gynecologic oncologist on treatment outcome. METHODS The hospital files from 680 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who were diagnosed between 1994 and 1997 in the northern part of the Netherlands were abstracted. Treatment results were analyzed according to the operating physician's education by using survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS Primary surgery was performed on 184 patients by gynecologic oncologists, and on 328 patients by general gynecologists. Gynecologic oncologists followed surgical guidelines more strictly compared with general gynecologists (patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stage I–II disease, 55% vs. 33% [ P = 0.01]; patients with FIGO Stage III disease, 60% vs. 40% [ P = 0.003]) and more often removed all macroscopic tumor in patients with FIGO Stage III disease (24% vs. 12%; P = 0.02). When patients were stratified according to FIGO stage, the 5‐year overall survival rate was 86% versus 70% ( P = 0.03) for patients with Stage I–II disease and 21% versus 13% ( P = 0.02) for patients with Stage III–IV disease who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists and general gynecologists, respectively. The hazards ratio for patients who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.61–1.03; adjusted for patient age, disease stage, type of hospital, and chemotherapy); when patients age 75 years and older were excluded, the hazards ratio fell to 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54–0.94) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The surgical treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma by gynecologic oncologists occurred more often according to surgical guidelines, tumor removal more often was complete, and survival was improved.

Cochrane Collaboration's tool and ROBINS-I tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Summary of evidence tables were created using the United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table for Evidence Reviews.Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms.Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics. Further well-designed studies are needed to examine these interventions and others to generate evidence that can inform decisions about implementation of newer telehealth technologies into obstetrics and gynecology practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003646", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3002030059", "source": "openalex"}

The use of robotics in gynecologic surgery is increasing in the United States. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries in gynecology include benign hysterectomy, myomectomy, tubal reanastomoses, radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissections, and sacrocolpopexies. The majority of the current literature includes case series of various robotic surgeries. Recently, comparative retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this particular type of surgery. Although individual studies vary, robot-assisted gynecologic surgery is often associated with longer operating room time but generally similar clinical outcomes, decreased blood loss, and shorter hospital stay. Robot-assisted gynecologic surgery will likely continue to develop as more gynecologic surgeons are trained and more patients seek minimally invasive surgical options. Well-designed, prospective studies with well-defined clinical, long-term outcomes, including complications, cost, pain, return to normal activity, and quality of life, are needed to fully assess the value of this new technology. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has several applications in gynecologic surgery, including simple and radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissection, tubal reanastomosis, myomectomy, and sacrocolpopexy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e31818f3c17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054088885", "source": "openalex"}

However, the publications did not include detailed definitions, nor were they written to accommodate the new version of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1) now available. Thus, we recommend that the definitions described later in detail are incorporated into clinical trial protocols to maintain consistency. The criteria for defining progression are now acceptable in clinical trials of recurrent disease as they have since been validated (Pujade-Lauraine, personal communication, 2010). The GCIG requests that data from all clinical trials using these definitions are made available to GCIG trial centers so that continual validation and improvement can be accomplished. These definitions were developed from analyzing patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and have not yet been validated in patients receiving molecular targeting agents.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e3182070f17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2002710053", "source": "openalex"}

Current applications in gynecology and their associated outcomes will be analyzed.Since the late 1990s, the use of computer-assisted or robotic technology in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery has increased. Much of this experience revolves around the da Vinci surgical system, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for gynecologic applications in April 2005. The largest body of experience exists with robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, particularly those classified as American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists type IVE or Laparoscopic Supracervical Hysterectomy III. Other notable applications are in the areas of myomectomy, tubal reanastomosis, sacrocolpopexy, and cancer staging. Advantages of the robotic approach are the improved dexterity and precision of the instruments coupled with three-dimensional imaging. Limitations include the absence of haptic (tactile) feedback, bulkiness of the system, lack of vaginal access, and cost.Current evidence demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the robotic approach for gynecologic surgery. Experience is still in its infancy, however, and prospective trials are needed to compare the efficacy against conventional laparoscopy and to help determine not only who should be doing robotic-assisted surgery but also for which applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0b013e328216f90b", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036223919", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Four hundred twenty-two patients were entered onto this trial. Of 396 assessable patients, 202 were randomly allocated to receive WAI, and 194 were allocated to receive AP. Irradiation dosage was 30 Gy in 20 fractions, with a 15-Gy boost. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for seven cycles, followed by one cycle of cisplatin. Results Most patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced. The median patient age was 63 years; 50% had endometrioid tumors. Median follow-up time was 74 months. The hazard ratio for progression adjusted for stage was 0.71 favoring AP (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91; P &lt; .01). At 60 months, 50% of patients receiving AP were predicted to be alive and disease free when adjusting for stage compared with 38% of patients receiving WAI. The stage-adjusted death hazard ratio was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89; P &lt; .01) favoring AP. Moreover, at 60 months and adjusting for stage, 55% of AP patients were predicted to be alive compared with 42% of WAI patients. Greater acute toxicity was seen with AP. Treatment probably contributed to the deaths of eight patients (4%) on the AP arm and five patients (2%) on the WAI arm. Conclusion Chemotherapy with AP significantly improved progression-free and overall survival compared with WAI.

Patients completed QoL assessments at baseline; at 1, 3, and 6 weeks; and at 6 months postsurgery.In an intent-to-treat analysis, laparoscopy patients reported significantly higher Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scores (P = .001), better physical functioning (P = .006), better body image (BI; P < .001), less pain (P < .001) and its interference with QoL (P < .001), and an earlier resumption of normal activities (P = .003) and return to work (P = .04) over the 6-week postsurgery period, as compared with laparotomy patients. However, the differences in BI and return to work between groups were modest, and the adjusted FACT-G scores did not meet the minimally important difference (MID) between the two surgical arms over 6 weeks. By 6 months, except for better BI in laparoscopy patients (P < .001), the difference in QoL between the two surgical techniques was not statistically significant.Although the FACT-G did not show a MID between the two surgical groups, and only modest differences in return to work and BI were found between the two groups, statistically significantly better QoL across many parameters in the laparoscopy arm at 6 weeks provides modest support for the QoL advantage of using laparoscopy to stage patients with early endometrial cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.22.3529", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2117934623", "source": "openalex"}

The incidence of other gynecologic cancers was low and did not differ by randomization assignment. More women taking estrogen plus progestin required endometrial biopsies (33% vs 6%; P<.001).This randomized trial suggests that continuous combined estrogen plus progestin therapy may increase the risk of ovarian cancer while producing endometrial cancer rates similar to placebo. The increased burden of endometrial biopsies required to assess vaginal bleeding further limits the acceptability of this regimen.

Patients and Methods Study patients were 472 women receiving cancer care in an urban public medical center. Women had a primary diagnosis of breast (stage 0 to III) or gynecologic cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 0 to IIIB). A diagnostic depression screen and baseline questionnaire were administered before or during active treatment or during active follow-up. Self-report data were collected on receipt of depression treatment, use of supportive counseling, pain and receipt of pain medication, functional status and well-being, and perceived barriers to cancer care. Results Twenty-four percent of women reported moderate to severe levels of depressive disorder (30% of breast cancer patients and 17% of gynecologic cancer patients). Only 12% of women meeting criteria for major depression reported currently receiving medications for depression, and only 5% of women reported seeing a counselor or participating in a cancer support group. Neither cancer stage nor treatment status was correlated with depression. Primary diagnosis of breast cancer, younger age, greater functional impairment, poorer social and family well-being, anxiety, comorbid arthritis, and fears about treatment side effects were correlated with depression. Conclusion Findings indicate that depressive disorder among ethnic minority, low-income women with breast or gynecologic cancer is prevalent and is correlated with pain, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Because these women are unlikely to receive depression treatment or supportive counseling, there is a need for routine screening, evaluation, and treatment in this population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2005.08.041", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2136833425", "source": "openalex"}

All 626 patients had primary carcinoma of the cervix and underwent operative assessment of the para-aortic (PA) lymph nodes. Patients received standardized external radiation therapy to the pelvis or to the pelvis and PA lymph nodes followed by one or two brachytherapy applications. To date, no statistically significant differences in progression-free interval (PFI) or survival time have been identified between the randomization treatment arms on any of these studies. Basic similarities among these studies led us to pool these data to identify patient characterisitcs and tumor characteristics associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. Multi-variate analysis showed patient age, performance status (PS), PA lymph node status, tumor size, and pelvic node status to be significantly associated with PFI.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays an important role in the patient journey from the initial evaluation of the extent of the disease to appropriate treatment selection and follow-up. The purpose of this review is to highlight the added role of MR imaging in the treatment stratification and overall care of patients with endometrial, cervical, or ovarian cancer. Several MR imaging techniques used in evaluation of patients with gynecologic malignancies are described, including both anatomic MR imaging sequences (T1- and T2-weighted sequences) and pulse sequences that characterize tissue on the basis of physiologic features (diffusion-weighted MR imaging), dynamic contrast agent-enhanced MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy. MR imaging findings corresponding to the 2009 revised International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging of gynecologic malignancies are also described in detail, highlighting possible pearls and pitfalls of staging. With the growing role of the radiologist as a core member of the multidisciplinary treatment planning team, it is crucial for imagers to recognize that MR imaging has become central in tailoring treatment options and therapy in patients with gynecologic malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.12120315", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146862777", "source": "openalex"}

The primary study end point was noninferiority of recurrence-free interval defined as no more than a 40% increase in the risk of recurrence with laparoscopy compared with laparotomy.With a median follow-up time of 59 months for 2,181 patients still alive, there were 309 recurrences (210 laparoscopy; 99 laparotomy) and 350 deaths (229 laparoscopy; 121 laparotomy). The estimated hazard ratio for laparoscopy relative to laparotomy was 1.14 (90% lower bound, 0.92; 95% upper bound, 1.46), falling short of the protocol-specified definition of noninferiority. However, the actual recurrence rates were substantially lower than anticipated, resulting in an estimated 3-year recurrence rate of 11.4% with laparoscopy and 10.2% with laparotomy, or a difference of 1.14% (90% lower bound, -1.28; 95% upper bound, 4.0).

It has emerged as a candidate tumor suppressor based on its frequent mutations in ovarian clear cell and endometrioid cancers and in uterine endometrioid carcinomas. Here, we report that restoring wild-type ARID1A expression in ovarian cancer cells that harbor ARID1A mutations is sufficient to suppress cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice, whereas RNA interference-mediated silencing of ARID1A in nontransformed epithelial cells is sufficient to enhance cellular proliferation and tumorigenicity. Gene expression analysis identified several downstream targets of ARID1A including CDKN1A and SMAD3, which are well-known p53 target genes. In support of the likelihood that p53 mediates the effects of ARID1A on these genes, we showed that p53 was required and sufficient for their regulation by ARID1A. Furthermore, we showed that CDKN1A (encoding p21) acted in part to mediate growth suppression by ARID1A. Finally, we obtained evidence that the ARID1A/BRG1 complex interacted directly with p53 and that mutations in the ARID1A and TP53 genes were mutually exclusive in tumor specimens examined. Our results provide functional evidence in support of the hypothesis that ARID1A is a bona fide tumor suppressor that collaborates with p53 to regulate CDKN1A and SMAD3 transcription and tumor growth in gynecologic cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-11-1562", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039189450", "source": "openalex"}

New insights and more experience have been gained since the previous guidelines were published in 2014. Members of the International Network on Cancer, Infertility and Pregnancy (INCIP), in collaboration with other international experts, reviewed existing literature on their respective areas of expertise. Summaries were subsequently merged into a manuscript that served as a basis for discussion during the consensus meeting. Treatment of gynecological cancers during pregnancy is attainable if management is achieved by collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of health care providers. This allows further optimization of maternal treatment, while considering fetal development and providing psychological support and long-term follow-up of the infants. Nonionizing imaging procedures are preferred diagnostic procedures, but limited ionizing imaging methods can be allowed if indispensable for treatment plans. In contrast to other cancers, standard surgery for gynecological cancers often needs to be adapted according to cancer type and gestational age. Most standard regimens of chemotherapy can be administered after 14 weeks gestational age but are not recommended beyond 35 weeks. C-section is recommended for most cervical and vulvar cancers, whereas vaginal delivery is allowed in most ovarian cancers. Breast-feeding should be avoided with ongoing chemotherapeutic, endocrine or targeted treatment. More studies that focus on the long-term toxic effects of gynecologic cancer treatments are needed to provide a full understanding of their fetal impact. In particular, data on targeted therapies that are becoming standard of care in certain gynecological malignancies is still limited. Furthermore, more studies aimed at the definition of the exact prognosis of patients after antenatal cancer treatment are warranted.

The purpose of this study is to describe the quality of life (QOL) concerns and survivorship sequelae of long‐term (&gt;5 yr) early‐stage ovarian cancer survivors accrued through the clinical cooperative Gynecologic Oncology Group. Forty‐nine ovarian cancer survivors with a mean age at diagnosis of 55.9 yr (range 30–76) completed a telephone interview assessing QOL, psychosocial status, sexual functioning and late‐effects of treatment. Results indicate that this disease‐free early‐stage sample enjoys a good QOL, with physical, emotional, and social well‐being comparable to other survivors and same‐aged noncancer cohorts. However, 20% of survivors indicated the presence of long‐term treatment side effects, with a subset reporting problems related to abdominal and gynecologic symptoms, and neurotoxicity. Spiritual well‐being was significantly positively associated with personal growth and mental health, and negatively associated with a declining health status. Lingering psychological survivorship sequelae included fear of follow‐up diagnostic tests and fear of recurrence. Forty‐three percent of respondents expressed that they would likely participate in a counseling program today to discuss psychosocial issues raised by having had ovarian cancer, and 56% stated that they would have attended a support program during the initial treatment if it had been offered. This information provides some insight into the complex survivorship relationships between quality of life, long‐term physical and sexual sequelae, and factors of resilience and growth which appear to promote a sense of well‐being as a result of the cancer experience.

Data were analyzed in March 2019. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The articles were characterized by citation number, publication year, topic, study design, and authorship. After excluding articles that featured on both lists, top-cited articles were compared. <h3>Results</h3> The query identified 3 767 874 articles, of which 278 846 (7.4%) were published in OBGYN journals. The top-cited article was published by Rossouw and colleagues in<i>JAMA</i>(2002). Top-cited articles published in nonspecialty journals were more frequently cited than those in OBGYN journals (median [interquartile range], 1738 [1490-2077] citations vs 666 [580-843] citations, respectively;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and were more likely to be randomized trials (25.0% vs 2.2%, respectively; difference, 22.8%; 95% CI, 13.5%-32.2%;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Whereas articles from nonspecialty journals focused on broad topics like osteoporosis, articles from OBGYN journal focused on topics like preeclampsia and endometriosis. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study found substantial differences between top-cited OBGYN articles published in nonspecialty vs OBGYN journals. These differences may reflect the different goals of the journals, which work together to ensure optimal dissemination of impactful articles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.18007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2996003298", "source": "openalex"}

Observational studies show associations between being overweight or obese and weight gain with several measures of reduced prognosis in women with breast cancer and some suggestion of poor prognosis in underweight women. Observational studies have shown an association between higher levels of physical activity and improved breast cancer–specific and all-cause mortality, although a dose-response relationship has not been established. One large randomized controlled trial reported increased disease-free survival after a mean of 5 years in patients with breast cancer randomly assigned to a low-fat diet versus control. However, another trial of similar size found no effect from a high vegetable/fruit, low-fat diet on breast cancer prognosis. The few reported studies suggest that obesity negatively affects endometrial cancer survival, while the limited data are mixed for associations of weight with ovarian cancer prognosis. Insufficient data exist for assessing associations of weight, physical activity, or diet with prognosis in other gynecologic cancers. Associations of particular micronutrient intake and alcohol use with prognosis are not defined for any of these cancers. The effects of dietary weight loss and increase in physical activity on survival or recurrence in breast and gynecologic cancers are not yet established, and randomized controlled trials are needed for definitive data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2010.27.9752", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023682431", "source": "openalex"}

Enhanced recovery after surgery pathways included extensive preoperative counseling, carbohydrate loading and oral fluids before surgery, multimodal analgesia with avoidance of intravenous opioids, intraoperative goal-directed fluid resuscitation, and immediate postoperative feeding and ambulation. A before-and-after study design was used to compare clinical outcomes, costs, and patient satisfaction. Complications and risk-adjusted length of stay were drawn from the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database.On the ERAS full protocol, 136 patients were compared with 211 historical controls and the median length of stay was reduced (2.0 compared with 3.0 days; P=.007) despite an increase in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-predicted length of stay (2.5 compared with 2.0 days; P=.009). Reductions were seen in median intraoperative morphine equivalents (0.3 compared with 12.7 mg; P<.001), intraoperative (285 compared with 1,250 mL; P<.001) and total intravenous fluids (-917.5 compared with 1,410 mL; P<.001), immediate postoperative pain scores (3.7 compared with 5.0; P<.001), and total complications (21.3% compared with 40.2%; P=.004).

Patient satisfaction scores showed a marked and significant improvement on focus questions regarding pain control, nurses keeping patients informed, and staff teamwork; 30-day total hospital costs were significantly decreased in both ERAS groups.Implementation of ERAS protocols in gynecologic surgery was associated with a substantial decrease in intravenous fluids and morphine administration coupled with reduction in length of stay for open procedures combined with improved patient satisfaction and decreased hospital costs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001555", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2512047538", "source": "openalex"}

Both parenteral and oral progestins yield similar serum levels and response rates, which range from 18% to 34%. The one major study that used oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) noted a response rate at the lower end of the range (18%) and much poorer progression-free and overall survival times (4 and 10.5 months, respectively) than previously reported. The present study sought to confirm this earlier study of oral MPA, to assess the importance of prognostic factors such as histologic grade and receptor levels, and to determine whether a higher dose of MPA would yield a higher response rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-nine eligible women with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma were randomized to receive oral MPA either 200 mg/d or 1,000 mg/d until unacceptable toxicity intervened or their disease progressed. RESULTS: Among 145 patients receiving the low-dose regimen, there were 25 complete (17%) and 11 partial (8%) responses for an overall response rate of 25%. The 154 patients receiving the high-dose regimen experienced 14 (9%) complete and 10 (6%) partial responses for an overall response rate of 15%. Median durations of progression-free survival were 3.2 months and 2.5 months for the low-dose and high-dose regimens, respectively. Median survival durations were 11.1 months and 7.0 months, respectively. The adjusted relative odds of responding to the high-dose regimen compared with the low-dose regimen was 0.61 (90% confidence interval, 0.36 to 1.04). Prognostic factors having a significant impact on the probability of response included initial performance status, age, histologic grade, and progesterone receptor concentration. Compliance with oral therapy was documented with serum levels 1 month after starting therapy, when possible. MPA levels were commensurate with the assigned dose and schedule. CONCLUSION: Oral MPA is active against endometrial carcinoma. Response to progestin therapy is more frequent among patients with a well-differentiated histology and positive progesterone receptor status. This study provides no evidence to support the use of MPA 1,000 mg/d orally instead of MPA 200 mg/d orally. In fact, the trends suggest the opposite. The use of oral MPA 200 mg/d is a reasonable initial approach to the treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, particularly those lesions that are well-differentiated and/or progesterone receptor-positive (&gt; 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein). Patients with poorly differentiated and/or progesterone receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein had only an 8% to 9% response rate.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1999.17.6.1736", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1933506009", "source": "openalex"}

Hand-crafted image descriptors lack the capabilities of a semantic classification of surgical actions and video shots of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate how well single-frame convolutional neural networks (CNN) for semantic shot classification in gynecologic surgery work. Together with medical experts, we manually annotate hours of raw endoscopic gynecologic surgery videos showing endometriosis treatment and myoma resection of over 100 patients. The cleaned ground truth dataset comprises 9 h of annotated video material (from 111 different recordings). We use the well-known CNN architectures AlexNet and GoogLeNet and train these architectures for both, surgical actions and anatomy, from scratch. Furthermore, we extract high-level features from AlexNet with weights from a pre-trained model from the Caffe model zoo and feed them to an SVM classifier. Our evaluation shows that we reach an average recall of .697 and .515 for classification of anatomical structures and surgical actions respectively using off-the-shelf CNN features. Using GoogLeNet, we achieve a mean recall of .782 and .617 for classification of anatomical structures and surgical actions respectively. With AlexNet the achieved recall is .615 for anatomical structures and .469 for surgical action classification respectively. The main conclusion of our work is that advances in general image classification methods transfer to the domain of endoscopic surgery videos in gynecology.

CD10 was always expressed in mesonephric remnants (mesonephric remnants of the uterine cervix, epoophoron, rete ovarii) and tumors (mesonephric adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, tumors of wolffian origin of the broad ligament and ovary). CD10 was also positive in the syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and intermediate trophoblast of normal gestations, partial and complete moles, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumors. Finally, CD10 was positive in several metastatic neoplasms to the gynecologic tract (100% in metastatic renal clear cell and intestinal carcinomas and melanomas). In contrast, CD10 was almost invariably negative in müllerian epithelia of the female genital tract and in their corresponding tumors, with the exception of focal expression found in squamous epithelia and tumors with squamous differentiation.

Tumor measurements and quality-of-life (QOL) assessments were obtained before each treatment cycle.Of 280 patients entered, 6% were ineligible. Among 264 eligible patients, 134 received cisplatin and 130 received C+P. Groups were well matched with respect to age, ethnicity, PS, tumor grade, disease site, and number of cycles received. The majority of all patients had prior radiation therapy (cisplatin, 92%; C+P, 91%). Objective responses occurred in 19% (6% complete plus 13% partial) of patients receiving cisplatin versus 36% (15% complete plus 21% partial) receiving C+P (P = .002). The median PFS was 2.8 and 4.8 months, respectively, for cisplatin versus C+P (P < .001). There was no difference in median survival (8.8 months v 9.7 months). Grade 3 to 4 anemia and neutropenia were more common in the combination arm. There was no significant difference in QOL scores, although a disproportionate number of patients (cisplatin, n = 50; C+P, n = 33) dropped out of the QOL component, presumably because of increasing disease, deteriorating health status, or early death.

Although the clinical phenotypes of the three types of gynecological cancers are discrete, the fact they originate from a common embryological origin, has led to the hypothesis that they might share common features reflecting regression to early embryogenesis. To address this question, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of their profiles. Our data identified both common features (pathways and networks) and novel distinct modules controlling the same deregulated biological processes in all three types. Specifically, four novel transcriptional modules were discovered regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. Integration and comparison of our data with other databases, led to the identification of common features among cancer types, embryonic stem (ES) cells and the newly discovered cell population of squamocolumnar (SC) junction of the cervix, considered to host the early cancer events. Conclusively, these data lead us to propose the presence of common features among gynecological cancers, other types of cancers, ES cells and the pre-malignant SC junction cells, where the novel E2F/NFY and MAX/CEBP modules play an important role for the pathogenesis of gynecological carcinomas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142229", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2261971875", "source": "openalex"}

Women were classified based on 1988 and 2009 FIGO staging systems. Major changes in the 2009 system include: 1) classification of patients with stage IA and IB tumors as stage IA; 2) elimination of stage IIA; and 3) stratification of stage IIIC into pelvic nodes only (IIIC1) or paraaortic nodal (IIIC2) involvement. Survival and use of adjuvant therapy were analyzed.A total of 81,902 women were identified.

The da Vinci® robotic surgical system was cleared for use in gynecologic surgery in the U.S in 2005. Many surgeons have embraced da Vinci® technology over conventional laparoscopy because of its technologic advantages of wristed instrumentation, high definition 3-D optics, ergonomics, and autonomy of camera control. Furthermore, many surgeons with limited advanced laparoscopic skills have successfully converted their practice from primarily laparotomy to minimally invasive surgery using the da Vinci® System. The purpose of this article is to review the development of robotic procedures in gynecology through the current literature. This article reviews recent peer-reviewed literature concerning robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedures including hysterectomy, myomectomy, radical hysterectomy, pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy, trachelectomy, parametrectomy, tubal anastamosis, sacrocolpopexy, and others. The majority of this literature consists of descriptive retrospective case series from the investigator's early experience; in fact these early reports represent innovation of a new operative technique. Some reports compare outcomes to open and standard laparoscopic procedures.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1994557942", "title": "Self-Reported Symptoms of Gynecological Morbidity and their Treatment in South India", "text": "This article presents an analysis of self-reported symptoms of gynecological problems among 3,600 recent mothers in Karnataka State, India. Approximately one-third of all women reported at least one current symptom; the most common were a feeling of weakness and tiredness (suggestive of anemia); menstrual disorders; white or colored vaginal discharge (suggestive of lower reproductive tract infection); and lower abdominal pain and discharge with fever (suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease). Obstetric morbidity, associated with the last live birth, was strongly predictive of current gynecological symptoms. Women who delivered their last child in a private institution were significantly less likely to report symptoms than were those who delivered at home or in a government hospital. Nonusers or users of reversible contraceptive methods were also less likely to report symptoms of morbid conditions than were sterilized women. These associations persisted in analyses controlling for potentially confounding economic and demographic characteristics, and have far-reaching policy implications.Health planners and policymakers in India had virtually no information about reproductive morbidity and its determinants on which to base efforts to improve the reproductive health of women and the acceptance of family planning programs. Thus, a study of self-reported symptoms of reproductive morbidity was undertaken in 1993 in the state of Karnataka as part of a larger research project investigating the pathways through which maternal education affects child survival. Data were gathered through a cross-sectional survey of women living in one subdistrict who were younger than 35 and had at least one child younger than five. Eligibility was limited to 3600 women living in the town and 48 villages with a population over 500. Experienced female interviewers achieved a more than 95% response rate. Disorders associated with the reported symptoms included: menstrual disorders, dyspareunia, hemorrhoids, prolapse, fistula, lower reproductive tract infection (RTI), urinary tract infection, acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and anemia. Bivariate analysis revealed the significant variations in reports made by women of different socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic backgrounds; a parallel analysis was performed on the proportions seeking treatment for each condition; and logistic regression analysis estimated the net effect of each factor on the likelihood of reporting specific symptoms and the probability of seeking treatment. Independent variables were composed of socioeconomic background, demographic, last live birth and contraceptive usage, and cognitive and behavioral factors. A third of the women reported symptoms of at least one gynecological morbidity, and about half of these sought treatment. A tenth of menstruating women reported menstrual problems, a sixth reported symptoms of lower RTI, 5% reported symptoms indicative of acute PID, and 23% reported symptoms of anemia. Morbidity was influenced by the presence of complications during the pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum period of the last live birth; the location of the last delivery, with less problems reported by those who delivered in a private institution; and whether or not a woman had undergone tubectomy, which increased reporting of all symptom categories except menstrual problems. This points to the urgent need for longterm follow-up studies of sterilized women. Since most women sought private medical treatment, the primary health care facilities should be subject to a radical review and the private sector should undergo systematic evaluation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/2137846", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994557942", "source": "openalex"}

Recent studies have shown that sporadic and tuberous sclerosis complex-associated PEComa may respond to mTOR inhibitors underscoring the importance of recognizing this tumor. However, its occurrence in the gynecologic tract continues to be disputed owing to its common misclassification as other types of uterine sarcoma and its controversial relationship with epithelioid smooth muscle tumors. To more fully characterize PEComa of the female genital tract, 16 cases of gynecologic PEComa were identified (1990 to 2012) and formed the basis of this study. Each case was analyzed for conventional morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics established for PEComa of extrauterine sites; clinical outcome data were obtained for all cases. The 16 patients were aged 28 to 60 (mean 49; median 50) years, and 1 had a history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Thirteen cases were primary of the uterus, 2 of the adnexa, and 1 of the vagina. Tumor size ranged from 0.3 to 25.0 (mean 8.7) cm. Three patients died of disease, 6 were alive with disease, and 7 were alive without evidence of disease at last follow-up (1 mo to 13 y follow-up; mean 26 mo). All patients with an adverse outcome met established criteria for malignancy as proposed for extrauterine sites (ie, 2 or more features present: size ≥5 cm, high-grade nuclear features, infiltration, necrosis, lymphovascular invasion, or a mitotic rate ≥1/50 high-power fields). Of the melanocytic markers, HMB45 was most commonly expressed (16/16 positive, 100%), followed by microphthalmia transcription factor (11/12 positive, 92%), MelanA (14/16 positive, 88%), and S100 protein (2/10 positive, 20%). Of the smooth muscle markers, desmin was most commonly expressed (15/15 cases, 100%), followed by SMA (14/15 cases, 93%) and h-caldesmon (11/12 cases, 92%). TFE3 immunopositivity was identified in 5 of 13 cases; however, 3 tested cases were negative for a TFE3 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Current criteria for malignancy appear to be valid in the female genital tract, although modified criteria, as described herein, may be more specific.

There are tens of thousands of chemicals in global commerce, and even small exposures to toxic chemicals during pregnancy can trigger adverse health consequences. Exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and related health outcomes are inequitably distributed within and between countries; universally, the consequences of exposure are disproportionately borne by people with low incomes. Discrimination, other social factors, economic factors, and occupation impact risk of exposure and harm. Documented links between prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals and adverse health outcomes span the life course and include impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and cancer. The global health and economic burden related to toxic environmental chemicals is in excess of millions of deaths and billions of dollars every year. On the basis of accumulating robust evidence of exposures and adverse health impacts related to toxic environmental chemicals, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) joins other leading reproductive health professional societies in calling for timely action to prevent harm.

Robotic-assisted surgery is one of the latest innovations in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Already, many procedures have been performed in urology, cardiac surgery, and general surgery. In this article, we attempt to report our preliminary experience with robotic-assisted laparoscopy in a variety of gynecological surgeries. We sought to evaluate the role of robotic-assisted laparoscopy in gynecological surgeries.The study was a case series of 15 patients who underwent various gynecologic surgeries for combined laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The da Vinci robot was used in each case at a tertiary referral center for laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. An umbilicus, suprapubic, and 2 lateral ports were inserted. These surgeries were performed both using laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic techniques. The assembly and disassembly time to switch from laparoscopy to robotic-assisted surgery was measured. Subjective advantages and disadvantages of using robotic-assisted laparoscopy in gynecological surgeries were evaluated.Fifteen patients underwent a variety of gynecologic surgeries, such as myomectomies, treatment of endometriosis, total and supracervical hysterectomy, ovarian cystectomy, sacral colpopexy, and Moskowitz procedure. The assembly time to switch from laparoscopy to robotic-assisted surgery was 18.9 minutes (range, 14 to 27), and the disassembly time was 2.1 minutes (range, 1 to 3). Robotic-assisted laparoscopy acts as a bridge between laparoscopy and laparotomy but has the disadvantage of being costly and bulky.Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries have advantages in providing a 3-dimensional visualization of the operative field, decreasing fatigue and tension tremor of the surgeon, and added wrist motion for improved dexterity and greater surgical precision. The disadvantages include enormous cost and added operating time for assembly and disassembly and the bulkiness of the equipment.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2424677985", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods A retrospective review of 360 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV EOC who underwent primary surgery followed by six cycles of intravenous platinum/paclitaxel was performed. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of potential prognostic factors with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results The median PFS and OS for this group of stage IV ovarian cancer patients was 12 and 29 months, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that histology, malignant pleural effusion, intraparenchymal liver metastasis, and residual tumor size were significant prognostic variables. Whereas patients with microscopic residual disease had the best outcome, patients with 0.1 to 1.0 cm residual disease and patients with 1.1 to 5.0 cm residual disease had similar PFS and OS. Patients with a residual size more than 5 cm had a diminished PFS and OS when compared with all other groups. Median OS for microscopic, 0.1 to 5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm residual disease was 64, 30, and 19 months, respectively. Conclusion Patients with more than 5 cm residual disease have the shortest PFS and OS, whereas patients with 0.1 to 1.0 and 1.1 to 5.0 cm have similar outcome. These findings suggest that ultraradical cytoreductive procedures might be targeted for selected patients in whom microscopic residual disease is achievable. Patients with less than 5.0 cm of disease initially and significant disease and/or comorbidities precluding microscopic cytoreduction may be considered for alternative therapeutic options other than primary cytoreduction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2007.13.1953", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167610363", "source": "openalex"}

Although chronic pelvic pain can be produced by many conditions, some gynecologic causes are frequently overlooked and underdiagnosed, resulting in inappropriate referral and inadequate treatment. The gynecologic conditions most often unrecognized are endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion, and less common congenital and acquired abnormalities. Transvaginal ultrasonography (US) is helpful for assessing endometriotic cysts but has a limited role in the diagnosis of adhesions or peritoneal implants. The classic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features diagnostic of endometrioma are a cystic mass with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and loss of signal intensity on T2-weighted images. When transvaginal US findings are suggestive of adenomyosis, MR imaging is used as the definitive imaging modality for diagnosis. High-resolution transvaginal US and MR imaging can help establish the diagnosis of adenomyosis with a high degree of accuracy, since the imaging appearance closely correlates with the histopathologic characteristics. Pelvic varices can be identified by using transvaginal US with color Doppler and Doppler spectral analysis. Three-dimensional T1 gradient-echo sequences performed after the intravenous administration of gadolinium are the most effective MR imaging sequence for demonstrating pelvic varices. Blood flow in pelvic varices appears with high signal intensity. Recent advances in radiologic imaging and therapeutic procedures make it possible to diagnose accurately the conditions producing chronic pelvic pain in most women and to guide effective treatment. © RSNA, 2005", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.251045511", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103586040", "source": "openalex"}

The current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grading scheme provides prognostic information that can be used to guide the extent of surgery and use of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. We recommend moving toward a binary scheme to grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas by considering International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics defined grades 1 and 2 tumors as “low grade” and grade 3 tumors as “high grade.” The current evidence base does not support the use of a 3-tiered grading system, although this is considered standard by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the College of American Pathologists. As for the 4 genomic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma (copy number low/p53 wild-type, copy number high/p53 abnormal, polymerase E mutant, and mismatch repair deficient), which only recently have been identified, there is accumulating evidence showing these categories can be reproducibly diagnosed and accurately assessed based on biopsy/curettage specimens as well as hysterectomy specimens. Furthermore, this subclassification system can be adapted for current clinical practice and is of prognostic significance independent of conventional variables used for risk assessment in patients with endometrial carcinoma (eg, stage). It is too soon to recommend the routine use of genomic classification in this setting; however, with further evidence, this system may become the basis for the subclassification of all endometrial carcinomas, supplanting (partially or completely) histotype, and grade.

There is mounting evidence that obesity is a risk factor for gynecologic cancers and may also adversely impact survival. The objectives of this review were to systematically evaluate and discuss the impact of overweight and obesity on endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer incidence and to review the data on the impact of obesity on treatment of these same gynecologic cancers. A PUBMED literature search was performed to identify articles in the English language that focused on the impact of obesity on cancer incidence and treatment. References of identified articles were also used to find additional related articles. Obesity profoundly increases the incidence of endometrial cancer, predominantly through the effects of unopposed estrogen. Although the data are less compelling in ovarian and cervical cancer, obesity may modestly increase the incidence of premenopausal ovarian cancer and might potentially increase cervical cancer incidence, perhaps as a result of the impact on glandular cancers or decreased screening compliance. Obese women with cancer have decreased survival; this may be disease-specific, the result of comorbid illnesses, or response to treatment. Obese women have increased surgical complications, may also have increased radiation complications, and there is no current consensus regarding appropriate chemotherapy dosing in the obese patient. Obesity is a serious health problem with significant effects on the incidence and treatment of the gynecologic malignancies. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians.

Systematic analysis of obstetrics and gynecology-related risk management files allows a more complete examination of ways that human and systems factors may contribute to adverse events. OBJECTIVE: To learn the medical complaints of patients who experienced apparent adverse events, the general causes of those adverse events, and the significant specific causal factors involved in obstetrics and gynecology-related risk management cases. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 90 consecutive obstetrics and gynecology-related internal review files opened by a medical center's risk managers between 1995 and 2001. Each file was analyzed to identify factors that may have contributed to or caused unanticipated adverse events. The main outcome was the pattern of contributing factors when they were aggregated into categories. RESULTS: Fifty percent of cases were associated with inpatient obstetrics. Factors that may have contributed to adverse events were identified in 78% of cases, and most had more than one contributing factor. Thirty-one percent of adverse events were associated with apparent communication problems. Clinical performance issues were identified in 31% of cases, diagnostic issues in 18% of cases, and patient behavior contributed to 14% of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic, therapeutic, and communication issues were the most common factors identified. Although the generalizability of these data are unknown, all obstetrics and gynecology departments face multiple challenges in assuring consistent quality care. Analysis of claims files may help identify opportunities for improvement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-3 A cause-and-effect analysis shows that significant proportions of adverse outcomes in an obstetrics-gynecology department seem to be related to issues of diagnosis, communication, and surgical care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000158864.09443.77", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061691229", "source": "openalex"}

A gynecologic oncology group study", "text": "Background. The histologic grade of endometrial adenocarcinoma is related to the aggressiveness of the tumor and probability of death from disease. However, the ideal system for assignment of histologic grade remains controversial. In 1988, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) revised its recommendations for grading typical endometrial adenocarcinoma, such that grade is determined primarily by the architecture of the tumor and secondarily modified in the presence of \"notable nuclear atypia\"; this phrase, however, has never been defined, and therefore the prognostic validity of this system is unknown. Methods. Seven hundred and fifteen women with clinical Stage I and occult Stage II endometrial adenocarcinomas (excluding serous or clear cell type) entered on a Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol, and those treated by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oo-phorectomy, and selective pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling formed the study population. All cases were centrally reviewed and assigned an architectural grade and a nuclear grade using specific criteria. The FIGO grade was then determined. The various grading methods were examined based on ability to stratify patients into groups with differing rates of disease progression and relative survival at five years. Results. The architectural grade, nuclear grade, and FIGO grade of tumors each were used to separate patients into groups with statistically significant different rates of progression of disease and relative survival. The FIGO modification of architectural grade resulted in the reassignment of 44 patients into a higher grade. The outcome for these 44 was worse than for the remaining patients in the initial grade but was similar to the group into which they were moved. Conclusions. If clearly specified criteria for architectural and nuclear grading are used and \"notable nuclearatypia\" is defined as grade 3 nuclei, the 1988 FIGO grading system has prognostic utility. The authors recommend this system as the standard method for the grading of typical endometrial adenocarcinoma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1<81::aid-cncr2820750114>3.0.co;2-f", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980688154", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Data were obtained from California Cancer Registry from 1994 to 1996. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods were used for analyses. RESULTS: Of 1,491 patients, the median age was 65 years (range: 13–100). Only 34.1% received care by gynecologic oncologists (group A) while 65.9% were treated by others (group B). Women in group A were more affluent (P<.001), were more educated (P=.036), were classified as white-collar employees (P=.128), and lived in urban regions (P<.001) compared with group B. Patients who saw gynecologic oncologists were more likely to have surgery as their initial treatment (91.9% versus 69.1%; P<.001), present with advanced (stage III-IV) cancers (78.2% versus 70.5%; P<.001), have more grade 3 tumors (61.7% versus 39.9%; P=.048), and receive chemotherapy (90.0% versus 70.1%; P<.001). Women in group B had a fourfold higher risk of having unstaged cancers (8.0% versus 2.1%; P<.001). The 5-year disease-specific survival of group A patients was 38.6% compared with 30.3% in group B (P<.001). On multivariable analysis, early stage, lower grade, and treatment by gynecologic oncologists were independent prognostic factors for improved survival. After adjusting for surgery and chemotherapy, there was no improvement in survival associated with care by gynecologic oncologists (hazard ratio=0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.78–1.03; P=.133). CONCLUSION: In this study of 1,491 women, those who were treated by gynecologic oncologists were more likely to undergo primary staging surgery and receive chemotherapy.

AI is already part of our daily life; it is behind face recognition technology, speech recognition in virtual assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) and self‐driving cars. AI software has been able to beat world champions in chess, Go and recently even Poker. Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology. The list of medical image‐analysis AI applications with USA Food and Drug Administration or European Union (soon to fall under European Union Medical Device Regulation) approval is growing rapidly and covers diverse clinical needs, such as detection of arrhythmia using a smartwatch or automatic triage of critical imaging studies to the top of the radiologist's worklist. Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good‐quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary. In this article, we explore the fundamentals of medical imaging AI, from theory to applicability, and introduce some key terms to medical professionals in the field of ultrasound. We believe that wider knowledge of AI will help accelerate its integration into healthcare. © 2020 The Authors.

Currently, there are no guidelines on how to deal with this special coincidence. <h3>Methods:</h3> An international consensus meeting on staging and treatment of gynecological malignancies during pregnancy was organised including a systematic literature search, and interpretation followed by a physical meeting of all participants with intensive discussion. In the absence of large trials and randomized studies, recommendations were based on available literature data and personal experience thus representing a low but best achievable level of evidence. <h3>Findings:</h3> Randomized trials and prospective studies on cancer treatment during pregnancy are lacking. Gynecological cancer during pregnancy is a demanding problem, and multidisciplinary expertise should be available. Counseling both parents on the maternal prognosis and fetal risk is needed. When there is a firm desire to continue the pregnancy, gynecological cancer can be treated in selected cases. The staging and treatment should follow the standard approach as much as possible. Guidelines for safe pelvic surgery during pregnancy are presented. Mainly in cervical and ovarian cancer, chemotherapy and an alternative surgical approach need to be considered. Administration of chemotherapy during the second or third trimester may probably not increase the incidence of congenital malformations. Until now, the long-term outcome of children in utero exposed to oncological treatment modalities is poorly documented, but preterm birth on its own is associated with cognitive impairment. Delivery should be postponed preferably until after a gestational age of 35 weeks. <h3>Interpretation:</h3> Further research including international registries for gynecologic cancer in pregnancy is urgently needed. The gathering of both available literature and personal experience allowed only suggesting models for treatment of gynecologic cancer in pregnancy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/igc.0b013e3181a1d0ec", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4211228289", "source": "openalex"}

Endometrial receptivity is established during the mid-secretory phase, between cycle day (CD) 20 to 24, or 6 to 10 days after ovulation. In some cases of infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss, implantation failure is due to a lack of expression of specific critical participating proteins such as cell adhesion molecules. Numerous cell adhesion molecules (including integrins, selectins, and cadherins) are expressed by the endometrium and appear to be necessary for the successful interaction of the embryo with the endometrium. One of the best-characterized cell adhesion molecules are the integrins. Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins that belong to a large family comprising alpha and beta subunits, and are present on virtually all cells in the body. Women with various benign gynecologic disorders, including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hydrosalpinges, and luteal phase defect, appear to exhibit decreased uterine receptivity and abnormal expression of endometrial biomarkers. This review addresses proposed mechanisms of implantation and endocrine and paracrine signals responsible for the establishment of endometrial receptivity as well has the possible mechanisms of dysfunction in certain types of infertility in women with benign gynecologic disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-991044", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043329764", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods This study included 250 female patients from the Multidisciplinary Breast Center and 250 patients from the Gynecologic Oncology Center of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Patients were selected by having an odd-numbered medical record number, and they were contacted before their clinic visit. The goals of the study were explained, and verbal consent was obtained. Patients who agreed to participate were asked to bring a written list and the medication bottles of all over-the-counter prescriptions and CAMs with them to clinic. In clinic, the investigator obtained a written informed consent and administered the survey. All patients and surveys were assessable. Results The most frequently used herbal products and megavitamins/minerals were identified from the patient medication histories. Overall, we found the proportion of patients using CAM to be 48% (95% CI, 44% to 53%; 241 of 500 patients). CAM use was related to patients' educational status: 62% had postgraduate degrees, 50% had college degrees, 56% had some college, and 33% had a high school education or less. Also, among patients using CAMs, only 53.5% had spoken to a healthcare provider regarding CAM therapy. Conclusion The use of CAM is common among women with cancer.

This trial of stage III, IV, or recurrent disease evaluated whether combining these agents increases response rate (RR) and prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over doxorubicin alone. Patients and Methods Of 299 patients registered, 281 (94%) were eligible. Regimens were doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 intravenously or doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 plus cisplatin 50 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a total of 500 mg/m 2 doxorubicin. Results There were 12 (8%) complete (CR) and 26 (17%) partial responses (PR) among 150 patients receiving doxorubicin versus 25 (19%) CRs and 30 (23%) PRs among patients receiving the combination. The overall response rate was higher among patients receiving the combination (42%) compared with patients receiving doxorubicin (25%; P = .004). Median PFS was 5.7 and 3.8 months, respectively, for the combination and single agent. The PFS hazard ratio was 0.736 (95% CI, 0.577 to 0.939; P = .014). Median OS was 9.0 and 9.2 months, respectively, for the combination and single agent. Overall death rates were similar in the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.928; 95% CI, 0.727 to 1.185).

A medical examination was conducted on a sample of 509 ever-married, nonpregnant women. For gynecological morbidities, genital prolapse was diagnosed in 56 percent, reproductive tract infections in 52 percent, and abnormal cervical cell changes in 11 percent of the women. For related morbidities, anemia was present in 63 percent of the women, followed by obesity (43 percent), hypertension (18 percent), and urinary tract infection (14 percent). Regression analysis of risk factors demonstrated the contribution of social conditions and medical factors to these diseases. Reproductive tract infections were shown to occur more frequently with uterovaginal prolapse, IUD use, presence of husband (regular sexual activity), and unhygienic behavior. Genital prolapse increased with age and number of deliveries. Age, recent pregnancy, education, socioeconomic class, and workload showed significant associations with related morbidity conditions. This evidence challenges national health programs to go beyond safe motherhood, child survival, and family planning in its services to women, and to consider the social context of health as well.The prevalence of gynecological and related morbidity in a rural Egyptian community was assessed as part of the Program of Research and Technical Consultation in Family Resources. Child Survival, and Reproductive Health. A medical examination was conducted on a sample of 509 ever-married, nonpregnant women from November 1989 to July 1990. A logistic regression using Generalized Linear Interactive Modeling was performed for each type of morbidity. For gynecological morbidities, genital prolapse was diagnosed in 56%, reproductive tract infections in 52%, and abnormal cervical cell changes in 11% of the women. For related morbidities, anemia was present in 63% of the women, followed by obesity (43%), hypertension (19%), and urinary tract infection (14%). Most of the women were suffering from at least 1 morbidity, with only 3% free of all the morbidity conditions considered. Gynecological morbidity, together with urinary tract infection and syphilis, showed that 35% of the women had 1 morbidity, 34% had 2, and 17% had 3 or more morbidities. Regression analysis of risk factors demonstrated that social conditions and medical factors contributed to these diseases. Reproductive tract infections occurred more frequently with uterovaginal prolapse, IUD use, presence of husband (regular sexual activity), and unhygienic behavior. Genital prolapse increased with age and number of deliveries. Age, recent pregnancy, education, socioeconomic class, and workload revealed significant associations with related morbidity conditions. The risk of anemia was significantly related to age and to a pregnancy within the previous 2 years. With every increase of 1 year of age, the risk of hypertension increased by 9%. For every increase of 1 year of age, the risk of obesity increased by 7%. Women with the highest level of education had a 3 times greater risk of urinary tract infection than did uneducated women, while women of low-middle socioeconomic status had almost 4 times the risk of women in the lowest class.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/2939232", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979801890", "source": "openalex"}

CT may be performed if a gynecologic disorder is not initially suspected, if US findings are equivocal, or if the abnormality extends beyond the field of view achievable with the endovaginal probe and further characterization of pelvic disease is required. Many gynecologic disorders that cause acute pelvic pain (eg, uterine disorders, ovarian disorders, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative or postpartum complications) demonstrate characteristic CT findings. Familiarity with these CT appearances is important: It will allow the radiologist to guide appropriate treatment of affected patients and may eliminate the need for further imaging evaluation. © RSNA, 2002", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/radiographics.22.4.g02jl18785", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2045613291", "source": "openalex"}

Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of age and months since treatment on interest in receiving sexual healthcare.The mean participant age was 55 years (range, 21-88 years). Only 7% of women had recently sought medical help for sexual issues, yet 41.6% were interested in receiving care. Greater than 30% responded that they would be likely to see a physician to address sexual matters, and 35% of all women were willing to be contacted if a formal program was offered. Compared with older women (aged >65 years), younger women (ages 18-47 years) were significantly more likely to report interest in receiving care to address sexual issues (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-7.54) and to see a physician to address sexual matters (OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.51-13.43), and they were more willing to be contacted for a formal program (adjusted OR [AOR], 5.00; 95% CI, 1.63-15.28). Compared with women who were currently in treatment, women who last received treatment >12 months previously were significantly more interested in receiving care (AOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02-4.01) and were more willing to be contacted (AOR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.18-5.26).Greater than 40% of survivors expressed interest in receiving sexual healthcare, but few had ever sought such care.

Medical simulations may address scenarios in clinical practice that are considered important to know or understand. Simulations can take many forms, including computer programs, models or mannequins, virtual reality data immersion caves, and a combination of formats. The purpose of this commentary is to call attention to a potential role for medical simulation in obstetrics and gynecology. We briefly describe an example of how simulation may be incorporated into obstetric and gynecologic residency training. It is our contention that educators in obstetrics and gynecology should be aware of the potential for simulation in education.

The diagnostic approaches and therapies for incisional endometriosis are also evaluated. Methods: Eleven patients who presented with a painful nodule that was increasing in size during menstruation on the scar of a previous gynecologic procedure were examined retrospectively. Results: All patients presented with a palpable painful lesion, located on the cesarean section incision, perineal episiotomy incision or the vaginal cuff after hysterectomy. All masses were increasing during menstruation and all patients had been having cyclical pain that worsened during menstrual periods. The mean age of the patients was 28.2 years. The onset of symptoms was referred at variable intervals after surgery ranging between 2 and 11 years (mean: 5.72 years). Ultrasound examination confirmed hypoechoic mass septated with cystic and solid components in the abdomin without intra‐abdominal communications. All endometriotic masses were completely excised under general anesthesia. The excised masses were sent for microscopic examination which confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. Conclusion: Incisional endometriosis seems to be common in women who have had a cesarean section, although it does occur after other procedures and de novo. It is suggested that caution is exercised during gynecologic procedures to avoid transplantation of endometrium to the anterior abdominal wall. The preferred management is to excise the lesion completely even if this necessitates fascial excision.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2005.00322.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071700883", "source": "openalex"}

Relationships of coping styles to QOL and mood were examined. METHODS Ninety‐eight patients with early stage or regionally advanced gynecologic cancers were recruited. Mood and QOL were assessed at initial clinic visit and at one year, and medical information was abstracted from charts at both time‐points. RESULTS Although decrements in physical, functional, and total well‐being were reported at baseline by regionally advanced patients, by one year, all patients reported significant improvements in QOL and mood. There were no differences between early stage and regionally advanced patients in their improvement for these measures. Controlling for medical variables and age, patients who coped using greater acceptance and positive reframing at their initial visits reported better one year QOL; those with continued higher levels of these adaptive coping strategies at one year reported better concurrent functional and emotional well‐being. Greater seeking of social support at one year was associated with better concurrent social well‐being and doctor‐patient relationships. In contrast, disengaged coping at study entry was associated with poorer doctor‐patient relationships at one year; continued disengagement at one year was associated with poorer concurrent QOL and greater distress. CONCLUSIONS During the first year following treatment, QOL and mood improved among both early stage and regionally advanced gynecologic oncology patients. Patients using disengaged coping are particularly at risk for poor QOL and distress.

This study was performed to compare the incidence of nausea and emesis during the 24-h postoperative period in ondansetron-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients.Using a randomized prospective double-blind study design, women between the ages of 18 and 70 yr undergoing gynecologic surgical procedures with general opioid anesthesia on an outpatient basis were enrolled. Ondansetron or placebo was administered prior to induction of anesthesia. Patients were stratified according to history of nausea and emesis during previous exposure to general anesthesia and randomized to dose received.Data from the 544 women showed that all doses of intravenous ondansetron tested (1, 4, and 8 mg) were significantly more effective (62%, 76%, and 77%, respectively) than placebo (46%) in reducing the incidence of emesis following surgery until 24 h after recovery room entry. All these doses were more effective than placebo in patients with no prior history of emesis following surgery and the 4- and 8-mg doses were more effective than placebo in patients with a prior history of emesis following surgery. All doses of ondansetron tested were generally well tolerated with adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and recovery room vital signs similar to those of placebo. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) was increased in five patients (1 mg, 2 patients; 4 mg, 1 patient; 8 mg, 2 patients). In the three patients in whom subsequent analysis were performed, the serum AST had decreased to preoperative levels.Ondansetron given intravenously to prevent postoperative nausea and emesis was highly effective in the 4- and 8-mg doses in women having ambulatory gynecologic surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-199301000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009548189", "source": "openalex"}

The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has completed six major randomized trials in advanced ovarian carcinoma over the 15-year period between 1976 and 1990. This large database of 2123 patients provides a well-studied patient population with which to examine the importance of age as a prognostic factor. Methods. The 2123 patients studied in the six GOG trials were analyzed as a group to determine important prognostic factors. Further analyses were then conducted to examine outcome by decade of life from younger than 40 years old to 70 years old and older and to evaluate the interaction of age with other significant prognostic variables. Results. Three major prognostic factors were identified as exerting an influence on patient outcome in the overall patient population: age, volume of residual disease, and performance status. With regard to the effect of age, patients older than 69 years of age exhibited significantly poorer survival than those younger, even after correction for stage, residual disease, and performance status. This was not altered by variations in drugs, doses, and schedules; but there was no evidence that older patients tolerated intensive schedules less well than younger patients. Conclusions. Two practical conclusions result from this analysis. First, there is no evidence that modification of the drugs and schedules that make up the regimens used can overcome the adverse effect of older age. Second, age does not adversely affect the dose intensity that can be achieved; hence, age in itself is not reason to withhold or attenuate intensive chemotherapy, particularly in light of the fact that older patients have a poorer prognosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.2820710218", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987437069", "source": "openalex"}

The two FDA‐approved LBP currently in use include ThinPrep (TP), (Cytyc Corp, Marlborough, MA) and SurePath (SP), (TriPath Imaging Inc., Burlington, NC). TP was approved for cervico‐vaginal (Pap test) cytology in 1996 and SP in 1999 and both have since also been used for non‐gyn cytology. In the LBP, instead of being smeared, cells are rinsed into a liquid preservative collection medium and processed on automated devices. Even after a decade of use, the morphological interpretation of LBP remains a diagnostic challenge because of somewhat altered morphology and artifacts or facts resulting from the fixation and processing techniques. These changes include cleaner background with altered or reduced background and extracellular elements; architectural changes such as smaller cell clusters and sheets, breakage of papillae; altered cell distribution with more dyscohesion and changes in cellular morphology with enhanced nuclear features, smaller cell size and slightly more three‐dimensional (3‐D) clusters.

Results Common obstetric and gynecologic complications for women with eating disorders include infertility, unplanned pregnancy, miscarriage, poor nutrition during pregnancy, having a baby with small head circumference, postpartum depression and anxiety, sexual dysfunction and complications in the treatment for gynecologic cancers. There are also unique associations by eating disorder diagnosis, such as earlier cessation of breastfeeding in anorexia nervosa; increased polycystic ovarian syndrome in bulimia nervosa; and complications of obesity as a result of binge eating disorder. Discussion We focus on possible biological and psychosocial factors underpinning risk for poor obstetric and gynecological outcomes in eating disorders.

METHODS: A validated survey by the American College of Surgeons was modified and distributed to all fellowship program directors in four subspecialties within obstetrics and gynecology: female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, gynecologic oncology, maternal–fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology–infertility. The 59-item survey explored five domains concerning preparedness for fellowship: professionalism, independent practice, psychomotor ability, clinical evaluation, and academic scholarship. A Likert scale with five responses was used and tailored to each subspecialty. Standard statistical methods were used to compare responses between subspecialties and to analyze data within each subspecialty individually. RESULTS: One hundred thirty directors completed the survey, for a response rate of 60%. In the domain of professionalism, more than 88% of participants stated that incoming fellows had appropriate interactions with faculty and staff. Scores in this domain were lower for gynecologic oncology respondents (P=.046). Responses concerning independent practice of surgical procedures (hysterectomy, pelvic reconstruction, and minimally invasive) were overwhelmingly negative. Only 20% of first-year fellows were able to independently perform a vaginal hysterectomy, 46% an abdominal hysterectomy, and 34% basic hysteroscopic procedures. Appropriate postoperative care (63%) and management of the critically ill patient (71%) were rated adequate for all subspecialties.

If positive, the trial was to serve as a basis for phase III trials of Taxol in combination with platinum compounds in first-line therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with recurrent, persistent, or progressive ovarian carcinoma during or after platinum-based chemotherapy received Taxol 170 mg/m2 intravenously once over 24 hours every 3 weeks. All patients had measurable disease and received premedication (dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and ranitidine) followed by Taxol. RESULTS Of 49 patients, 45 were eligible and assessable. Among 43 patients who were assessable for response, there were eight complete and eight partial responses (37%). The median progression-free interval was 4.2 months, and median survival 16 months. Among 27 resistant patients who progressed during or within 6 months of prior platinum-based therapy or had stable disease as the best response, five complete (18%) and four partial (15%) responses were observed (33%). The median progression-free interval was 4 months. Among 16 sensitive patients who responded and progressed more than 6 months after prior platinum-based treatment, three complete (19%) and four partial (25%) responses were observed (44%). The median progression-free interval was 4.9 months. Grade 4 neutropenia (&lt; 500/microL), the most frequent and severe toxicity, occurred in 73% of patients. Other hematologic effects were less frequent and less severe. Cardiac problems and hypersensitivity reactions were observed in one patient each. CONCLUSION Taxol is a highly active agent in ovarian carcinoma, even in patients who are clinically resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, and produces frequent and severe, albeit manageable, myelosuppression. It is clearly active as salvage therapy for ovarian carcinoma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1994.12.9.1748", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141258764", "source": "openalex"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After stratification for disease measurability, patients were randomized to receive six cycles of one of the treatments every 3 weeks. If measurable, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was determined. RESULTS: Six hundred fourteen of 648 patients who entered onto the trial were eligible. Monotherapies were discontinued more frequently (cisplatin because of toxicity or patient refusal [17%], and paclitaxel because of progression [20%]) compared with the combination therapy (7% and 6%, respectively). Neutropenia, fever, and alopecia were more severe with paclitaxel-containing regimens; whereas anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity were more severe with cisplatin-containing regimens. The CR/PR rates on paclitaxel monotherapy were significantly lower compared with the cisplatin regimens (42% v 67%, respectively; P &lt; .001). The relative hazard (RH) of first progression or death was significantly greater among those randomized to paclitaxel (RH = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.73; P &lt; .001) when compared with cisplatin; however, RH did not differ significantly between the two cisplatin regimens (RH = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.895 to 1.30). Relative to cisplatin, the death rate on paclitaxel was 15% greater (RH = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.929 to 1.42), and the death rate on the combination treatment was 1% less (RH = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.795 to 1.23). These differences among treatment groups were not statistically significant (P = .31). CONCLUSION: Cisplatin alone or in combination yielded superior response rates and PFS relative to paclitaxel. However, OS was similar in all three arms, and the combination therapy had a better toxicity profile.

The sequelae of such injuries are usually transient and resolve with minimal intervention, although long-term disability can and does occasionally occur. The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanisms by which these injuries occur in order to reduce the risk of their occurrence. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed cross-referencing the index terms \"neurological injury\" and \"gynecological surgery,\" from January 1, 1960 to December 31, 2002. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: This article, based on the data and results (Level I–III) obtained from the MEDLINE search, examined the most common neurologic injuries that occur in association with abdominal and vaginal surgical procedures routinely performed by gynecologists. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Neurologic injuries after pelvic surgery all generally share a common etiology, specifically injury to one or more components of the lumbosacral nerve plexus. Three major factors that predispose to neurologic injury at the time of gynecological surgery are 1) the improper placement or positioning of self-retaining or fixed retractors, particularly those with deep lateral retractor blades; 2) improper positioning of patients in lithotomy position preoperatively; and 3) radical surgical dissection resulting in autonomic nerve disruption. Level I data strongly implicate the improper placement of self-retaining or fixed retractors as the most common cause of femoral nerve injury arising in association with abdominal surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the lumbosacral nerve plexus and the mechanisms by which operative injuries to this plexus occur will enable the gynecologic surgeon to reduce the subsequent risk of their occurrence in his or her own surgical practice. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the lumbosacral nerve plexus is essential to reduce the risk of intraoperative injuries to this plexus during gynecologic surgical procedures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000110542.53489.c6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2323268659", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: We used the National Cancer Database to identify women with cervical cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2015. Using clinical and pathologic data, each patient's stage was classified using three staging schemas: American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition, FIGO 2009 and FIGO 2018. The FIGO 2018 revised staging classifies stage IB tumors into three substages based on tumor size (IB1–IB3) and classifies patients with positive lymph nodes (pathologically or clinically detected) as stage IIIC1 (positive pelvic nodes) or IIIC2 (positive para-aortic nodes). Five-year survival rates were estimated for each stage grouping. We sought to determine whether the 2018 FIGO staging system was able to offer improved 5-year survival rate differentiation compared with older staging schemas. RESULTS: A total of 62,212 women were identified. The classification of stage IB tumors into three substages improved discriminatory ability. Five-year survival in the FIGO 2018 schema was 91.6% (95% CI 90.4–92.6%) for stage IB1 tumors, 83.3% (95% CI 81.8–84.8%) for stage IB2 neoplasms, and 76.1% (95% CI 74.3–77.8%) for IB3 lesions. In contrast, for women with stage III tumors, higher FIGO staging was not consistently associated with worse 5-year survival rates: stage IIIA (40.7%, 95 CI 37.1–44.3%), stage IIIB (41.4%; 95% CI 39.9–42.9%), stage IIIC1 (positive pelvic nodes) was 60.8% (95% CI 58.7–62.8%) and stage IIIC2 37.5% (95% CI 33.3–41.7%).

Since the lockdown, screening examinations and routine checkups have been restricted to prevent the spread of the virus and to increase the hospitals' bed capacity across the country. This resulted in a severe decline of patient referrals to the hospitals. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers in Austria. <h3>Methods</h3> Data of 2077 patients from 18 centers in Austria with newly diagnosed gynecological or breast cancer between January and May 2019 and January and May 2020 were collected. Clinical parameters, including symptoms, performance status, co-morbidities, and referral status, were compared between the time before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. <h3>Results</h3> Our results showed a slight increase of newly diagnosed cancers in January and February 2020 as compared with 2019 (+2 and +35%, respectively) and a strong decline in newly diagnosed tumors since the lockdown: −24% in March 2020 versus March 2019, −49% in April 2020 versus April 2019, −49% in May 2020 versus May 2019. Two-thirds of patients diagnosed during the pandemic presented with tumor-specific symptoms compared with less than 50% before the pandemic (p&lt;0.001). Moreover, almost 50% of patients in 2020 had no co-morbidities compared with 35% in 2019 (p&lt;0.001). Patients, who already had a malignant disease, were rarely diagnosed with a new cancer in 2020 as compared with 2019 (11% vs 6%; p&lt;0.001). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The lockdown led to a decreased number of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers. The decreased accessibility of the medical services and postponed diagnosis of potentially curable cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic may be a step backwards in our healthcare system and might impair cancer treatment outcomes. Therefore, new strategies to manage early cancer detection are needed to optimize cancer care in a time of pandemic in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001975", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3091970799", "source": "openalex"}

The methodology of gynecological cancer staging, including assessment of local tumor extent, lymph nodes and distant metastases, is described. With increased technical quality, sonography has become an accurate staging method for early and advanced gynecological tumors. Other complementary imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, can be used as an adjunct to ultrasound in specific cases, but are not essential to tumor staging if sonography is performed by a specialist in gynecological oncology. Ultrasound is established as the method of choice for evaluating local extent of endometrial cancer and is the most important imaging method for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Ultrasound can be used to detect early as well as locally advanced cancers that extend from the vagina, cervix or other locations to the paracolpium, parametria, rectum and sigmoid colon, urinary bladder and other adjacent organs or structures. In cases of ureteric involvement, ultrasound is also helpful in locating the site of obstruction. Furthermore, it is specific for the detection of extrapelvic tumor spread to the abdominal cavity in the form of parietal or visceral carcinomatosis, omental and/or mesenteric infiltration. Ultrasound can be used to assess changes in infiltrated lymph nodes, including demonstration of characteristic sonomorphologic and vascular patterns. Vascular patterns are particularly well visualized in peripheral nodes using high resolution linear array probes or in the pelvis using high-frequency probes. The presence of peripheral or mixed vascularity or displacement of vessels seems to be the sole criterion in the diagnosis of metastatic or lymphomatous nodes. In the investigation of distant metastases, if a normal visceral organ or characteristic diffuse or focal lesions (such as a simple cyst, hepatic hemangioma, renal angiomyolipoma, fatty liver (steatosis)) are identified on ultrasound, additional examinations using complementary imaging methods are not required. If, however, less characteristic findings are encountered, especially when the examination result radically affects subsequent therapeutic management, an additional examination using a complementary imaging method (e.g. contrast-enhanced ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) is indicated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.10054", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103778658", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2020685660", "title": "The Race of Hysteria: \"Overcivilization\" and the \"Savage\" Woman in Late Nineteenth-Century Obstetrics and Gynecology", "text": "Hysteria, we learned from feminist historical scholarship in the 1970s, was never just a disease. It was also the way nineteenth-century U.S. and European cultures made sense of women's changing roles. Industrialization and urbanization wrought one set of changes, while the women's rights movement brought another. Together, these included higher education for women, their increasing participation in a (rapidly changing) public sphere, paid employment, and declining fertility. These cultural changes were accompanied by a virtual epidemic of \"nervous weakness\" largely among women, causing feminist historians to begin asking whether the diagnostic category of hysteria was simply a way of keeping women in the home. 1 In light of recent work in race theory, it is worth examining these scholarly insights to ask: could hysteria equally be said to be about race? I will argue that it was, centrally, in two senses. First, nervousness was often characterized as an illness caused by \"overcivilization,\" 2 which located it in a scientific and popular discourse that defined cultural evolution as beginning with the \"savage,\" culminating in the \"civilized,\" but also containing the possibility of degeneration--\"overcivilization.\" In this literature, \"savage\" or \"barbarian\" was applied to indigenous peoples, Africans, Asians, Latin Americans, and sometimes poor people generally. As a disease of \"overcivilization,\" hysterical illness was the provenance almost exclusively of Anglo-American, native-born whites, specifically, white women of a certain class. Second, the primary symptoms of [End Page 246] hysteria in women were gynecologic and reproductive--prolapsed uterus, diseased ovaries, long and difficult childbirths--maladies that made it difficult for these hysterical (white) women to have children. As such, hysteria also implicitly participated in a discourse of race and reproduction, one which identified white women of the middle and upper classes as endangering the race through their low fertility, while non-white women, immigrants, and poor people had many children. A reading of the American Journal of Obstetrics suggests that its physician-contributors understood and deployed these distinctions extensively, characterizing white women as weak, frail, and nervous while non-white women and poor people were described as strong, hardy, and prolifically fertile. Ultimately, this doubled discourse of women had profound consequences for medicine and science: the frailty and nervousness of one group provided the raison d'être of obstetrics and gynecology, while the insensate hardiness of the other offered the grounds on which they became the experimental \"material\" that defined its progress. Hysteria in the nineteenth century was not a single disease or entity but entailed a profusion of symptoms. As a description, \"nervousness\" did heroic labor, and accounted for the most various distresses of body and mind. \"Hysteria\" and its variants neurasthenia and nervousness were part of the lexicon of psychiatry, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology and also of reformers cautioning about the dangers of cities or of women's education or labor. 3 One physician, George Beard, wrote a catalogue of symptoms that ran to seventy-five pages, and he counted it incomplete. 4 Both women and men suffered from neurasthenia, but the overwhelming majority of its victims were women. The treatments were drastic: bleeding, extended bed rest and for women, surgery to remove the ovaries. Scholars of women and gender have long argued that hysteria participated in powerful narratives of cultural crisis, which goes a long way toward explaining the logical glue that held together an apparently endless catalogue of symptoms as a singular syndrome. The hysterical woman, women's historians suggest, is both sign and symptom of conflict over the cultural meaning of gender. In this scholarship, hysteria is at once a diagnostic gesture of dismissal of women as competent participants in public life, a social role uncomfortably inhabited by suffering women, and a warning about the dangerous consequences for women of engaging in \"unfeminine\" behavior. 5 Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, for example, [End Page 247] consider hysteria virtually a diagnostic fiction, arguing that nineteenth...", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1353/aq.2000.0013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020685660", "source": "openalex"}

The emergence of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are believed to play a crucial role in several different biological processes, has made the regulation of gene expression more complex. Although the function of lncRNAs is still rather elusive, their broad involvement in the initiation and progression of various cancers is clear. They are also involved in the pathogenesis of cancers of the female reproductive system. LncRNAs play a critical physiological role in apoptosis, metastasis, invasion, migration and cell proliferation in these cancers. Different expression profiles of lncRNAs have been observed in various types of tumors compared with normal tissues and between malignant and benign tumors. These differential expression patterns may lead to the promotion or suppression of cancer development and tumorigenesis. In the current review, we present the lncRNAs that show a differential expression between cancerous and normal tissues in ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers, and highlight the associations between lncRNAs and some of the molecular pathways involved in these cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-017-0671-2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2630392885", "source": "openalex"}

We determined the ureteric and bladder injury rates for each surgery type from studies in which routine intraoperative cystoscopy was performed and separately from studies in which it was not performed. Intraoperatively detected rates of ureteric and bladder injury were markedly higher with routine intraoperative cystoscopy. We obtained an adjusted ureteric injury rate of 0.3% and a bladder injury rate of 0.8%. The estimated postoperative ureteric injury detection rates per 1,000 surgeries were 1.6 without routine cystoscopy and 0.7 with routine cystoscopy. Postoperative bladder injury detection rates per 1,000 surgeries were 0.8 without routine cystoscopy and 1.0 with routine cystoscopy.Although routine cystoscopy clearly increases the intraoperative detection rate of urinary tract injuries, this systematic review of 79 mostly retrospective studies shows that it does not appear to have much effect on the postoperative injury detection rate.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001096", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2314436938", "source": "openalex"}

The beginning laparoscopist will find the chapter on basic techniques useful, and the experienced laparoscopist will be interested in the chapters on new techniques pioneered by Dr. Nezhat and his coauthors. The first part of the book discusses patient education and informed consent, topics usually found in the back of surgical texts. This position rightfully underscores the importance of communication between surgeon and patient. It also speaks of the litigious environment in which we surgeons find ourselves today. A commendable feature of the publication is the line drawings that illustrate the text. The artist's work is effectively and abundantly used and contributes significantly to the reader's understanding. The text is concise and thorough, with good references for additional reading. The cover is eye-catching red with gold letters on a black background. The layout is also attractive throughout with a good use of white space. A departure from the typography tradition of textbooks is this book's use of type fonts. The front matter appears in one font, and the chapter text is in another. The book is comprehensive, with 21 chapters. The authorship of each chapter is not given, but some contributors' work can be recognized if one knows their prior publications. The topics include all of the current major applications of laparoscopy and several in the development stage. The chapter on equipment includes a broad array of insmmaentation. As I would expect from these authors, it also contains an excellent discussion of video in laparoscopy. The use of electronic images in laparoscopy, which the authors have championed, has rapidly moved from academic to essential in today's visual era. Laser, another modem tool, is discussed together with electrosurgery energy. The main section of the book is devoted to specific laparoscopic procedures. Adhesiolysis, ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, tubal and uterine surgery, appendectomy, presacral neurectomy, uterosacral nerve transection, pelvic reconstruction, and oncology are effectively discussed. These chapters describe the authors' operative techniques and outcomes, and review other clinical series. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations and laboratory tests are included. The closing chapters review complications, their prevention, and management. The book also has a question-and-answer section, the format of which is usually seen in periodicals. Its paragraph indention style I found distracting. However, it provides helpful information. An unnumbered six-page color atlas appears at the end of the book. My overall opinion of this addition to printed laparoscopy resources is that it is very valuable. It belongs in our libraries.

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had measurable persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma with 2+ or 3+ HER2 overexpression documented by immunohistochemistry. Intravenous trastuzumab was administered initially at a dose of 4 mg/kg, then weekly at 2 mg/kg. Patients without progressive disease or excessive toxicity could continue treatment indefinitely. Those with stable or responding disease at 8 weeks were offered treatment at a higher weekly dose (4 mg/kg) at time of progression. Patient sera were analyzed for the presence of the soluble extracellular domain of HER2, host antibodies against trastuzumab, and trastuzumab pharmacokinetics. Results: A total of 837 tumor samples were screened for HER2 expression, and 95 patients (11.4%) exhibited the requisite 2+/3+ expression level. Forty-five patients, all of whom received prior chemotherapy, were entered, and 41 were deemed eligible and assessable. There were only mild expected toxicities and no treatment-related deaths. Although an elevated level of the soluble extracellular domain of HER2 was detected in eight of 24 patients, serum HER2 was not associated with clinical outcome. There was no evidence of host antitrastuzumab antibody formation. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab gradually increased with continued therapy. An overall response rate of 7.3% included one complete and two partial responses. Median treatment duration was 8 weeks (range, 2 to 104 weeks), and median progression-free interval was 2.0 months. Conclusion: The clinical value of single-agent trastuzumab in recurrent ovarian cancer is limited by the low frequency of HER2 overexpression and low rate of objective response among patients with HER2 overexpression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2003.10.104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006621710", "source": "openalex"}

Gut microbial dysbiosis was hypothesized to be related to the occurrence of radiation-induced complications in cancer patients. Given the lack of clinical or experimental data on the impact of radiation on gut microbiota, a prospective observational study of gut microbiota was performed in gynecological cancer patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. In the current study, the overall composition and alteration of gut microbiota in cancer patients receiving radiation were investigated by 454 pyrosequencing. Gut microbial composition showed significant differences (P < 0.001) between cancer patients and healthy individuals. The numbers of species-level taxa were severely reduced after radiotherapy (P < 0.045), and the abundance of each community largely changed. In particular, the phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacterium were significantly decreased by 10% and increased by 3% after radiation therapy, respectively. In addition, overall gut microbial composition was gradually remolded after the full treatment course of pelvic radiotherapy. In this set of cancer patients, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was linked to health status, and the gut microbiota was influenced by pelvic radiotherapy. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between dysbiosis and complications induced by pelvic radiotherapy, the current study may offer insights into the treatment of cancer patients suffering from complications after radiation therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082659", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066853142", "source": "openalex"}

RESULTS Of 99 patients entered, 97 were assessable for toxicity and 82 were assessable for response. Among 41 platinum-resistant patients a 26.8% response rate (7.3% complete response [CR] and 19.5% partial response [PR] rate) occurred. The median response duration was 4.3 months (range, 1.3 to 8.7), median progression-free interval (PFI) was 5.7 months (range, 0.8 to 30.8+), and median survival time was 10.8 months (range, 1.9 to 45.8). Twenty-five of 41 platinum-resistant patients had also previously received paclitaxel; of which eight (32%) responded. Among 41 platinum-sensitive patients, a 34.1% response rate (14.6% CR and 19.5% PR rate) occurred. The median response duration was 7.5 months (range, 1.9 to 15.2+), median PFI was 6.3+ months (range, 0.9 to 20.4), and median survival time was 16.5+ months (range, 0.9 to 34.8).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2147526306", "title": "Role of microRNAs in Gynecological Pathology", "text": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play fundamental roles in biological processes. These small molecules bind to target mRNAs, leading to translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. Aberrant miRNA expression is associated with several human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, inflammatory diseases and gynecological pathology. The present article reviews the role of miRNAs in four gynecological disorders that affect the ovary or the uterus, one benign and frequent disease (endometriosis) that is classified as a tumor-like lesion and three malignant gynecological diseases (endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancers). Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrium outside the uterus, is one of the most frequent benign gynecological diseases. Similarly to tumor metastasis, endometriotic implants require neovascularization to proliferate, invade the extracellular matrix and establish an endometriotic lesion. Despite its high prevalence and incapacitating symptoms, the exact pathogenic mechanism of endometriosis remains unsolved. A relationship between endometriosis and gynecological cancer, especially ovarian cancer, has been reported. Endometriosis is a multifactorial and polygenic disease, and emerging data provide evidence that a dysregulation of miRNA expression may be involved. miRNAs appear to be potent regulators of gene expression in endometriosis, raising the prospect of using miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic tools in this disease. In cancer, miRNAs have an important role as regulatory molecules, acting as oncogenes (oncomiRs) or tumor suppressors. Endometrial cancer is one of the most frequent gynecological malignancies in the developed countries. Cervical cancer, also one of the most common cancers in women, is associated with high-risk human papillomaviruses although this infection alone may not be enough to induce the malignant transformation. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths among women. Over 80% of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, with a reduced five-year survival rate. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in different human cancer types, including endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancer, and that specific dysregulated miRNAs may act as biomarkers of patients' outcome. Recently, miRNAs have been detected in serum and plasma, and circulating miRNA expression profiles have now been associated with a range of different tumor types. Their accessibility in peripheral blood and stability given the fact that miRNAs circulate confined within exosomes, make researchers foster hope in their role as emerging biomarkers of cancer and other disorders. The development of therapies that might block the expression or mimic the functions of miRNAs could represent new therapeutic strategies for any of the aforementioned gynecological disorders.

Loss of olfactory/gustatory function can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, and possibly a prolonged morbidity of chemotherapy-induced adverse effects, decreased quality of life, poor compliance, and even decreased therapy response. This prospective study comprehensively investigated, to our knowledge for the first time, smell and taste changes in a cohort of 87 patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer or gynecologic malignancies. Patients and Methods Olfactory function was tested using Sniffin' Sticks (Burghart; Wedel, Germany) and gustatory function was tested using taste strips before, during, and immediately and 3 months after chemotherapy. Results Olfactory and gustatory function significantly decreased during chemotherapy and recovered almost completely 3 months after chemotherapy. Scores of odor thresholds were affected more than those of discrimination or identification. The olfactory function of older patients was affected more than that of younger patients. There was no difference in the olfactory function during chemotherapy with respect to the chemotherapeutic agent or initial diagnosis (breast or ovarian cancer). Regarding taste, scores of salty taste were affected more than scores of sweet, sour, or bitter taste. The gustatory function did not differ significantly during chemotherapy with respect to age or diagnosis but did differ with respect to the chemotherapeutic agent. Taxane-based chemotherapy caused the most severe disorders. Conclusion Chemotherapy has a significant but transient effect on olfactory and gustatory function, possibly causing reduced appetite, a low energy intake, and weight loss. Additional spices and flavoring may compensate for this diminished chemosensory function, enhancing patient compliance and quality of life.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2008.19.2690", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171035643", "source": "openalex"}

Procedures were aggregated by body system. Results We identified 351,777 adhesiolysis-related hospitalizations: 23.2% for primary and 76.8% for secondary adhesiolysis. The average LOS was 7.8 days for primary adhesiolysis. We found that 967,332 days of care were attributed to adhesiolysis-related procedures, with inpatient expenditures totaling $2.3 billion ($1.4 billion for primary adhesiolysis; $926 million for secondary adhesiolysis). Hospitalizations for adhesiolysis increased steadily by age and were higher for women. Of secondary adhesiolysis procedures, 46.3% involved the female reproductive tract, resulting in 57,005 additional days of care and $220 million in attributable costs. Conclusions Adhesiolysis remain an important surgical problem in the United States. Hospitalization for this condition leads to high direct surgical costs, which should be of interest to providers and payers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-11-13", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978431278", "source": "openalex"}

Seventeen cases of primary clear cell carcinoma from various sites within the female genital tract (11 ovary, 5 uterus, 1 vagina) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. These tumors were assessed for the expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), low and high molecular weight cytokeratin, (CAM5.2 and 34 beta E12, respectively), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Leu-M1, vimentin, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), bcl-2, p53, HER-2/neu, and CA-125. The characteristic immunoprofile for all sites was positivity for CK7, CAM5.2, 34 beta E12, CEA, Leu-M1, vimentin, bcl-2, p53, and CA-125; variably positivity for ER and HER-2/neu; and negativity for CK20 and PR. For comparison, two cases of urologic clear cell carcinoma (1 bladder, 1 urethra) were also studied, and their profile was found to be similar to the gynecologic cases. Aside from minor differences, clear cell carcinoma appears to have the same immunophenotype regardless of whether it originates in the endometrium, ovary, or genitourinary tract. Much of its profile is similar to other gynecologic adenocarcinomas, but some of the markers studied may be useful in the differential diagnosis of this tumor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004347-200107000-00008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2082398221", "source": "openalex"}

The imbalance of estrogen and progesterone disrupts their complex regulatory mechanisms, leading to estrogen dominance and progesterone resistance. Gynecological diseases are heavily associated with dysregulated steroid hormones and can induce chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, heavy bleeding, and infertility, which substantially impact the quality of women's lives. Because the menstrual cycle repeatably occurs during reproductive ages with dynamic changes and remodeling of reproductive-related tissues, these alterations can accumulate and induce chronic and recurrent conditions. This review focuses on faulty progesterone signaling mechanisms and cellular responses to progesterone in endometriosis, adenomyosis, leiomyoma (uterine fibroids), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and endometrial hyperplasia. We also summarize the association with gene mutations and steroid hormone regulation in disease progression as well as current hormonal therapies and the clinical consequences of progesterone resistance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11040647", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4213074681", "source": "openalex"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS After tumor removal and thorough surgical staging, patients were enrolled on this study and treated with three courses of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (BEP). Reassessment laparotomy was required of consenting, appropriate patients initially, but became an optional procedure in 1989. RESULTS Of 93 patients assessable on this trial, 89 are continuously free of germ cell cancer. At second-look laparotomy, two other patients were found to have small foci of immature teratoma; both remain clinically free of recurrence. One received subsequent alternate chemotherapy and one did not. Thus, 91 of 93 patients are currently free of germ cell cancer. Follow-up duration ranges from 4.0 to 90.3 months, with 67 patients monitored for longer than 2 years. Acute toxicity was moderate. One patient developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia 22 months after diagnosis. Another patient was noted to have a malignant lymphoma 69 months after protocol treatment. CONCLUSION Three courses of BEP will nearly always prevent recurrence in well-staged patients with completely resected ovarian germ cell tumors and should be given to all such patients. The development of acute leukemia as a complication of treatment is disturbing and mandates careful long-term follow-up, but is unusual and does not alter the risk-to-benefit ratio of treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1994.12.4.701", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141821404", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate how women experience the gynecologic examination and to assess possible factors associated with experiencing discomfort during the gynecologic examination. Methods. Consecutive patients visiting the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Glostrup County Hospital, Denmark, were invited to participate in the study, and received a postal questionnaire that included questions about the index visit, obstetric and gynecologic history and sexual abuse history. The response rate was 80% ( n = 798). The degree of discomfort during the gynecologic examination was indicated on a scale from 0 to 10. Experiencing discomfort was defined as a score of 6 or more, based on the 75th percentile. Results. Discomfort during the gynecologic examination was strongly associated with a negative emotional contact with the examiner and young age. Additionally, dissatisfaction with present sexual life, a history of sexual abuse and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and insomnia were significantly associated with discomfort. Conclusion. The emotional contact between patient and examiner seemed to have great importance when focusing on discomfort during the gynecologic examination. Furthermore, we found that discomfort was associated with a number of factors that are seldom known to the gynecologists, such as sexual abuse history, mental health problems and patients' sexual life.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2155269388", "title": "GnRH antagonists in the treatment of gynecological and breast cancers.", "text": "Approximately 80% of human ovarian and endometrial cancers and 50% of breast cancers express GnRH and its receptor as part of an autocrine regulatory system. After binding of its ligand the tumor GnRH receptor couples to G-protein alphai and activates a variety of intracellular signaling mechanisms. (1) Through activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase, autophosphorylation of growth factor receptors is reverted leading to an inhibition of mitogenic signaling and reduced cell proliferation. (2) Through activation of nuclear factor kappa B antiapoptotic mechanisms are induced protecting tumor cells from apoptosis induced, for example, by doxorubicin. (3) Through activation of the Jun kinase pathway AP-1 is induced, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. It seems reasonable to speculate that this system enables the tumor cell to reduce proliferation and to activate repair mechanisms while being protected simultaneously from apoptosis. Interestingly, GnRH antagonists show the same activity in this system as agonists, indicating that the dichotomy GnRH agonist-GnRH antagonist defined in the pituitary gonadotrope is not valid for the tumor GnRH system. Recently, a second type of GnRH receptor, specific for GnRH-II, has been identified in ovarian and endometrial cancers, which transmits significantly stronger antiproliferative effects than the GnRH-I receptor. GnRH antagonists have agonistic effects on this type II receptor. In animal models of human cancers, GnRH antagonists had stronger antitumor effects than GnRH agonists. Therefore, we performed a phase II clinical trial with the GnRH antagonist, cetrorelix (10 mg/day), in patients with ovarian or mullerian carcinoma refractory to platinum chemotherapy. Of 17 evaluable patients treated with cetrorelix, 3 obtained a partial remission (18%) which lasted for 2 to 6 months. Furthermore, 6 patients experienced disease stabilization (35%) for up to 1 year. In this very refractory patient population (median number of prior chemotherapies = 3) these results are quite remarkable when compared with palliative chemotherapy. In addition, cytotoxic GnRH analogs have been developed, where for example doxorubicin was covalently coupled to GnRH analogs. These compounds have superior antitumor effects in cancers expressing GnRH receptors as compared with native doxorubicin and allow for a targeted cytotoxic chemotherapy of gynecologic and breast cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1677/erc.0.0100291", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2155269388", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Data from Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 114 and 172 were retrospectively analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for statistical analyses. Results In 876 patients, median follow-up was 10.7 years. Median survival with IP therapy was 61.8 months (95% CI, 55.5 to 69.5), compared with 51.4 months (95% CI, 46.0 to 58.2) for intravenous therapy. IP therapy was associated with a 23% decreased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.90; P = .002).

This study explored the relationship between spiritual well‐being and quality of life (QOL) in gynecologic oncology patients in an attempt to clarify the significance of spiritual well‐being in the assessment process. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY : Eighteen women with gynecologic cancer completed a self‐administered questionnaire that obtained sociodemographic, medical, spiritual, and functional information. The Spiritual Well‐being Scale was used to assess spiritual well‐being, and the Functional Living Index: Cancer (FLIC) measured QOL. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, comparison of means, and analysis of variance. RESULTS : Patients with gynecologic cancers other than ovarian reported a better QOL and a higher degree of spiritual, existential, and religious well‐being. Older patients consistently reported higher degrees of spiritual well‐being and QOL than did younger patients. Married patients consistently reported higher degrees of spiritual well‐being than patients who were not married (never married or separated). Catholic patients scored higher in degrees of religious and spiritual well‐being as well as in FLIC scores than other patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS : Health professionals do not generally assess spiritual well‐being in their evaluations of patients' needs. The findings from this study support the inclusion of spirituality as part of routine patient assessment and intervention. Clinical intervention that would increase a patient's level of spiritual awareness and his or her level of comfort associated with a personal perspective on death could help decrease the patient's level of psychosocial distress. Despite the medical establishment's bias to the contrary, religion and spirituality are positively associated with both physical and mental health and may be particularly significant to terminally ill patients. The curricula of medical, nursing, and other health schools should be redesigned appropriately.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-5394.1998.006006333.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2062211442", "source": "openalex"}

We included randomized controlled trials in gynecologic surgery populations. Interventions and comparators included graduated compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, unfractionated heparin, and low molecular weight heparin; placebo and routine postoperative care were allowed as comparators.One thousand two hundred sixty-six articles were screened, and 14 randomized controlled trials (five benign gynecologic, nine gynecologic oncology) met eligibility criteria. In addition, nine prospective or retrospective studies with at least 150 women were identified and provided data on venous thromboembolism risk stratification, gynecologic laparoscopy, and urogynecologic populations.Two reviewers independently screened articles with discrepancies adjudicated by a third. Eligible randomized controlled trials were extracted for these characteristics: study, participant, surgery, intervention, comparator, and outcomes data, including venous thromboembolism incidence and bleeding complications. Studies were individually and collectively assessed for methodologic quality and strength of evidence. Overall incidence of clinical venous thromboembolism was 0-2% in the benign gynecologic population. With use of intermittent pneumatic compression for benign major procedures, venous thromboembolism incidence was less than 1%. No venous thromboembolisms were identified in prospective studies of benign laparoscopic procedures. Overall quality of evidence in the benign gynecologic literature was poor. Gynecologic-oncology randomized controlled trials reported venous thromboembolism incidence (including \"silent\" venous thromboembolisms) of 0-14.8% with prophylaxis and up to 34.6% without prophylaxis. Fair quality of evidence supports that unfractionated heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression are both superior to placebo or no intervention but insufficient to determine whether heparins are superior to intermittent pneumatic compression for venous thromboembolism prevention. Combining two of three risks (aged 60 years or older, cancer, or personal venous thromboembolism history) substantially elevated the risk of venous thromboembolism.Intermittent pneumatic compression provides sufficient prophylaxis for the majority of gynecology patients undergoing benign surgery. Additional risk factors warrant the use of combined mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e318232a394", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977540886", "source": "openalex"}

Five hundred and twenty-nine gynecology and gynecological oncology patients completed a questionnaire regarding CAM use. Overall, 56.3% of gynecology and gynecological oncology patients reported current use of CAM. Therapies used included nutritional supplements (20%), prayer as medical therapy (17%), exercise as medical therapy (12%), megavitamins (10%), and green tea (10%). While 69.5% believed CAM to be beneficial, only 31.6% discussed these therapies with their physician.

Gynecological oncology patients also spent more for CAM, with a mean expenditure of $711 versus $622 by gynecology patients. Within the gynecological oncology patient group, there were 69 patients currently receiving modern medical treatments for cancer; among these patients, 58% reported using CAM; of these, 39.3% communicated their use of CAM to their physician. Patients in this group spent an average of $1,178 on CAM during their illness, with only 6.3% receiving insurance reimbursement. Benefits from CAM were perceived by 54.5% in this group.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either IV paclitaxel 135 mg/m 2 over 24 hours followed by IV cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for six courses or IV carboplatin (area under curve 9) every 28 days for two courses, then IV paclitaxel 135 mg/m 2 over 24 hours followed by intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for six courses. RESULTS: Of the 523 patients who entered this trial, 462 were determined to be assessable, with prognostic factors well balanced between the treatments. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal and metabolic toxicities were greater in the experimental arm. As a result, 18% of the patients received ≤ two courses of IP therapy. Progression-free survival was superior for patients randomized to the experimental treatment arm (median, 28 v 22 months; relative risk, 0.78; log-rank P = .01, one-tail). There was a borderline improvement in overall survival associated with this regimen (median, 63 v 52 months; relative risk, 0.81; P = .05, one-tail). CONCLUSION: An experimental regimen including moderately high-dose IV carboplatin followed by IP paclitaxel and IV cisplatin yielded a significant improvement in progression-free survival when compared with a standard regimen of IV cisplatin and paclitaxel. Because the improvement in overall survival was of borderline statistical significance and toxicity was greater, the experimental arm is not recommended for routine use. However, the results provide direction for further clinical investigation in small-volume ovarian cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2001.19.4.1001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1922469696", "source": "openalex"}

The robotic platform allows less experienced laparoscopic surgeons to perform more complex procedures. In general gynecology and reproductive gynecology, the robot is being increasingly used for procedures such as hysterectomies, myomectomies, adnexal surgery, and tubal anastomosis. Among urogynecology the robot is being utilized for sacrocolopexies. In the field of gynecologic oncology, the robot is being increasingly used for hysterectomies and lymphadenectomies in oncologic diseases. Despite the rapid and widespread adoption of robotic surgery in gynecology, there are no randomized trials comparing its efficacy and safety to other traditional surgical approaches. Our aim is to update previously published reviews with a focus on only comparative observational studies. We determined that, with the right amount of training and skill, along with appropriate patient selection, robotic surgery can be highly advantageous. Patients will likely have less blood loss, less post-operative pain, faster recoveries, and fewer complications compared to open surgery and potentially even laparoscopy. However, until larger, well-designed observational studies or randomized control trials are completed which report long-term outcomes, we cannot definitively state the superiority of robotic surgery over other surgical methods.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/852061", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080393300", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2219319083", "title": "Personalized Circulating Tumor DNA Biomarkers Dynamically Predict Treatment Response and Survival In Gynecologic Cancers", "text": "Background High-grade serous ovarian and endometrial cancers are the most lethal female reproductive tract malignancies worldwide. In part, failure to treat these two aggressive cancers successfully centers on the fact that while the majority of patients are diagnosed based on current surveillance strategies as having a complete clinical response to their primary therapy, nearly half will develop disease recurrence within 18 months and the majority will die from disease recurrence within 5 years. Moreover, no currently used biomarkers or imaging studies can predict outcome following initial treatment. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a theoretically powerful biomarker for detecting otherwise occult disease. We therefore explored the use of personalized ctDNA markers as both a surveillance and prognostic biomarker in gynecologic cancers and compared this to current FDA-approved surveillance tools. Methods and Findings Tumor and serum samples were collected at time of surgery and then throughout treatment course for 44 patients with gynecologic cancers, representing 22 ovarian cancer cases, 17 uterine cancer cases, one peritoneal, three fallopian tube, and one patient with synchronous fallopian tube and uterine cancer. Patient/tumor-specific mutations were identified using whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing and ctDNA levels quantified using droplet digital PCR. CtDNA was detected in 93.8% of patients for whom probes were designed and levels were highly correlated with CA-125 serum and computed tomography (CT) scanning results. In six patients, ctDNA detected the presence of cancer even when CT scanning was negative and, on average, had a predictive lead time of seven months over CT imaging. Most notably, undetectable levels of ctDNA at six months following initial treatment was associated with markedly improved progression free and overall survival. Conclusions Detection of residual disease in gynecologic, and indeed all cancers, represents a diagnostic dilemma and a potential critical inflection point in precision medicine. This study suggests that the use of personalized ctDNA biomarkers in gynecologic cancers can identify the presence of residual tumor while also more dynamically predicting response to treatment relative to currently used serum and imaging studies. Of particular interest, ctDNA was an independent predictor of survival in patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. Earlier recognition of disease persistence and/or recurrence and the ability to stratify into better and worse outcome groups through ctDNA surveillance may open the window for improved survival and quality and life in these cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145754", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2219319083", "source": "openalex"}

Utilizing Cox proportional hazards modeling and relative survival rates analysis of 17,119 cases of cervical cancer indicated that the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histology, histological grade, lymph node status, and age at diagnosis were all independently prognostic. No evidence was found of survival differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Younger women were not found to have a poorer prognosis, survival declined with increased age. Analysis of 41,120 cases of endometrial cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, lymph node status, age at diagnostic, and race were all prognostic factors. Clear cell adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and mixed mullerian tumors were all found to have poorer prognosis. Analysis of 21,240 cases of ovarian cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, lymph node status, age at diagnosis, presence of ascites, and race were all prognostically significant. Analysis of 2,575 cases of vulvar cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, age, and race were all prognostically significant. Analysis of 916 cases of vaginal cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histologic grade, lymph node status, and age are all prognostically significant. Additional analysis of the data by combinations of independent prognostic factors indicates that the interaction of factors may be more predictive of outcome than any one factor separately. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Eighty two female recipients of liver transplantation at the University of Michigan between August 1985 and January 1992 were surveyed about menstrual function and gynecological and obstetrical histories before and after transplantation. Additional information was retrieved from medical records regarding their liver disease and details of pregnancies and gynecological care. In the year before transplantation, 27 women (42%) reported regular menstrual cycles, 18 (28%) irregular and unpredictable bleeding, and 19 (30%) amenorrhea. After transplantation, 30 women (48%) experienced regular menses, 16 (26%) irregular bleeding, and 16 (26%) amenorrhea. In women less than 46 years old, 27 (53%) had regular menses before and after transplant. Most women with acute liver disease had regular periods before (82%) and after transplant (73%). A total of 95% of women under the age of 46 had return of menstrual bleeding within the first year after transplantation. Of these women 49% had normal liver function tests at the time of survey, 33% mildly abnormal, and 18% severely abnormal. Liver function was not correlated with menstrual patterns. A total of 72% of women were sexually active after transplantation. Of 24 women under age 46 who had not undergone sterilization or hysterectomy, six women conceived seven pregnancies. Seven women reported abnormal cervical cytology results after transplantation. Six underwent colposcopy and 4 required some form of destructive therapy for cervical dysplasia. In women with liver disease, menstrual patterns may change after orthotopic liver transplantation. This is more common in women with chronic liver disease than in those with acute liver disease. There was no correlation between liver function and menstrual regularity after transplant. Return to sexual activity can be expected and pregnancies are not rare in a population of young women after liver transplantation.

METHODS: A two-site, randomized controlled trial included screen-positive women (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of at least 10) who met criteria for major depression, dysthymia, or both (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Women were randomized to 12 months of collaborative depression management or usual care; 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month outcomes were compared. The primary outcomes were change from baseline to 12 months in depression symptoms and functional status. Secondary outcomes included at least 50% decrease and remission in depressive symptoms, global improvement, treatment satisfaction, and quality of care. RESULTS: Participants were, on average, 39 years old, 44% were nonwhite, and 56% had posttraumatic stress disorder. Intervention (n=102) compared with usual care (n=103) patients had greater improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 months (P<.001) and 18 months (P=.004).

Although often studied as a separate domain, sexuality represents an integral component of psychological adjustment and quality of life (QoL) that is adversely affected by cancer treatments. The present study tests the association between sexual morbidity, and adverse psychological adjustment and QoL outcomes. <h3>Methods:</h3> A cross-sectional design was used. The participants were gynecological (cervical, endometrial, ovarian, and vulvar) cancer survivors who were partnered (N = 186), whose cancer was diagnosed 2 to 10 years previously, and who were at least 6 months post any cancer therapy. Most had been found to have early-stage disease (70%) and were treated with hysterectomy (77%), chemotherapy (43%), and/or radiotherapy (23%). Sexual morbidity was operationalized as a multidimensional construct including sexual behavior, sexual functioning, and subjective sexual satisfaction, assessed by patient self-report. Outcomes included self-reported depressive symptoms, traumatic stress symptoms, cancer-specific stress, stress about body changes, and QoL. Nurse-rated of performance status and disruptive signs/symptoms of treatment toxicity, as well as relevant sociodemographic and disease variables were collected as potential controls. <h3>Results:</h3> Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested sexual morbidity as a predictor of poor outcomes. All statistical models were significant, accounting for 12% to 53% of the variance in psychological adjustment/QoL. Sexual morbidity covaried with worsened depressive symptoms, body change stress, and psychological QoL beyond the negative contributions of (older) age, (poorer) performance status, and (greater) fatigue. Notably, disease and treatment variables were not statistically significant correlates of psychological adjustment or QoL. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> These findings suggest that prevention or treatment of sexual morbidity might foster improved psychological adjustment/QoL. Given the high rates of sexual morbidity in this population and the connection between sexuality and broader psychological adjustment/QoL, there is a clear need for better integration of sexuality rehabilitation into routine clinical care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/igc.0b013e3181d24ce0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982367639", "source": "openalex"}

Extension of telomeric repeats by telomerase prevents telomere shortening with cell divisions and contributes to chromosomal stability, possibly leading to immortalization of the cells. In the present study, we determined the telomerase activity of gynecological tumors and cell lines using a newly developed non-radioisotope telomeric repeat amplification protocol. A total of 21 cell lines derived from cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and choriocarcinoma was examined, and all lines were found to be positive for telomerase activity, although the activity varied among cell types. A total of 50 gynecological malignant tumors was also examined, and 10 of 12 (83%) cervical cancers, 12 of 13 (92%) endometrial cancers, 18 of 21 (86%) ovarian cancers, 2 of 2 tubal cancers, and 1 of 1 vulvar cancer were found to be positive for telomerase activity. A total of 88% of gynecological tumors tested was thus found to be telomerase positive. However, no significant correlation was observed between telomerase activity and clinical features for any tumor type, although ovarian tumors expressing high telomerase activity tended to be more invasive. In contrast to that in malignant tumors, telomerase expression was weak and less common in premalignant lesions, with 5 of 7 cervical intraepithelial lesions and 4 of 6 borderline ovarian tumors exhibiting faint activity. Nine benign uterine lesions were also examined, and all were negative for telomerase activity except 1 uterine myoma, which had a weak signal. Three benign ovarian cysts examined had weak telomerase activity. These findings suggest that telomerase activation is common in gynecological malignant tumors and may be a critical step in their pathogenesis.

In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of barriers to care contributing to health disparities in gynecological oncology management and to describe site-specific disparities in gynecologic care for endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer. Methods: We performed a literature review of peer-reviewed academic and governmental publications focusing on disparities in gynecological care in the United States by searching PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases. Results: There are multiple important underlying issues that may contribute to the disparities in gynecological oncology management in the United States, namely geographic access and hospital based-discrepancies, research-based discrepancies, influence of socioeconomic and health insurance status, and finally the influence of race and biological factors. Despite the reduction in overall cancer-related deaths since the 1990s, the 5-year survival for Black women is significantly lower than for White women for each gynecologic cancer type and each stage of diagnosis. For ovarian and endometrial cancer, black patients are less likely to receive treatment consistent with evidence-based guidelines and have worse survival outcomes even after accounting for stage and comorbidities. For cervical and endometrial cancer, the mortality rate for black women remains twice that of White women.

Therefore, we propose to determine the influence of gynecologic oncologists on the treatment and survival of patients with endometrial cancer. Patients and Methods Data were obtained from Medicare and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases from 1988 to 2005. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods were used for analyses. Results Of 18,338 women, 21.4% received care from gynecologic oncologists (group A) while 78.6% were treated by others (group B). Women in group A were older (age &gt; 71 years: 49.6% v 44%; P &lt; .001), had more lymph nodes (&gt; 16) removed (22% v 17%; P &lt; .001), presented with more advanced (stages III to IV) cancers (21.9% v 14.6%; P &lt; .001), had higher-grade tumors (P &lt; .001), and were more likely to receive chemotherapy for advanced disease (22.6% v 12.4%; P &lt; .001). In those with stages II to IV disease, the 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of group A was 79% versus 73% in group B (P = .001). Moreover, in advanced-stage (III to IV) disease, group A had 5-year DSS of 72% versus 64% in group B (P &lt; .001). However, no association with DSS was identified in stage I cancers. On multivariable analysis, younger age, early stage, lower grade, and treatment by gynecologic oncologists were independent prognostic factors for improved survival. Conclusion Patients with endometrial cancer treated by gynecologic oncologists were more likely to undergo staging surgery and receive adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced disease.

One-hundred fifty women scheduled for major gynecological surgery were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone 10 mg (D10), 5 mg (D5), 2.5 mg (D2.5), 1.25 mg (D1.25), or placebo (P) before the induction of general anesthesia. A standardized general anesthesia technique was used. Postoperative pain was treated with bolus IV doses of morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia device. Patients were assessed for incidence of vomiting at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after surgery. A total of 6, 6, 8, 15, and 19 patients in Groups D10, D5, D2.5, D1.25, and Group P experienced vomiting at least once within the first postoperative 24 h, respectively. Dexamethasone 10 mg, 5 mg, and 2.5 mg was more effective than dexamethasone 1.25 mg or placebo for antiemesis (P < 0.05). The difference in antiemetic effect among the 10 mg, 5 mg, and 2.5 mg groups was similar. The results suggest that 2.5 mg is the minimum effective dose of dexamethasone for postoperative antiemesis in patients undergoing general anesthesia for major gynecological surgery.Although dexamethasone is effective for antiemesis, major side effects may accompany its perioperative use. To achieve the best antiemesis with the fewest side effects, dexamethasone 10 mg, 5 mg, 2.5 mg, and 1.25 mg were compared with placebo in surgical patients.

Its widespread occurrence in cancer genome could inactivate many cellular pathways including DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, cell adherence, and detoxification. The abnormal promoter methylation might be a potential molecular marker for cancer management.For rapid identification of potential targets for aberrant methylation in gynecological cancers, methylation status of the CpG islands of 34 genes was determined using pooled DNA approach and methylation-specific PCR. Pooled DNA mixture from each cancer type (50 cervical cancers, 50 endometrial cancers and 50 ovarian cancers) was made to form three test samples. The corresponding normal DNA from the patients of each cancer type was also pooled to form the other three control samples. Methylated alleles detected in tumors, but not in normal controls, were indicative of aberrant methylation in tumors. Having identified potential markers, frequencies of methylation were further analyzed in individual samples. Markers identified are used to correlate with clinico-pathological data of tumors using chi2 or Fisher's exact test.APC and p16 were hypermethylated across the three cancers. MINT31 and PTEN were hypermethylated in cervical and ovarian cancers. Specific methylation was found in cervical cancer (including CDH1, DAPK, MGMT and MINT2), endometrial cancer (CASP8, CDH13, hMLH1 and p73), and ovarian cancer (BRCA1, p14, p15, RIZ1 and TMS1). The frequencies of occurrence of hypermethylation in 4 candidate genes in individual samples of each cancer type (DAPK, MGMT, p16 and PTEN in 127 cervical cancers; APC, CDH13, hMLH1 and p16 in 60 endometrial cancers; and BRCA1, p14, p16 and PTEN in 49 ovarian cancers) were examined for further confirmation. Incidence varied among different genes and in different cancer types ranging from the lowest 8.2% (PTEN in ovarian cancer) to the highest 56.7% (DAPK in cervical cancer). Aberrant methylation for some genes (BRCA1, DAPK, hMLH1, MGMT, p14, p16, and PTEN) was also associated with clinico-pathological data.Thus, differential methylation profiles occur in the three types of gynecologic cancer. Detection of methylation for critical loci is potentially useful as epigenetic markers in tumor classification.

Cells continuously produce free radicals and ROS as part of the metabolic process. They are involved in the various functions of the reproductive system. Antioxidants are enzymes or compounds that scavenge and reduce the presence of free radicals. Normally, a balance exists between concentrations of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant scavenging systems. The disruption of the delicate balance between pro- and antioxidants results in oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has been implicated in embryo fragmentation, DNA damage, apoptosis and poor pregnancy outcome. It has also been implicated in a large number of gynecologic diseases, such as endometriosis, pre-eclampsia and maternal diabetes. The use of antioxidants may be beneficial in combating the harmful effects of oxidative stress in many of these diseases.

Worldwide, FGR is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term morbidity. Ongoing advances in clinical care, especially in definitions, diagnosis, and management of FGR, require efforts to effectively translate these changes to the wide range of obstetric care providers. This article highlights agreements based on current research in the diagnosis and management of FGR, and the areas that need more research to provide further clarification of recommendations. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of available evidence along with practical recommendations concerning the care of pregnancies at risk of or complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. To achieve these goals, FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) brought together international experts to review and summarize current knowledge of FGR. This summary is directed at multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, healthcare delivery organizations and providers, FIGO member societies, and professional organizations. Recognizing the variation in the resources and expertise available for the management of FGR in different countries or regions, this article attempts to take into consideration the unique aspects of antenatal care in low-resource settings (labelled \"LRS\" in the recommendations). This was achieved by collaboration with authors and FIGO member societies from low-resource settings such as India, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Aspects of FGR addressed in this article include prediction, diagnosis, investigation, management, and postpartum counselling. The main recommendations are given below and are summarized in Table 1 (section 8) and in the management algorithms for high-resource settings (Figure 1a) and low-resource settings (Figure 1b) (section 4). This article is directed at multiple stakeholders with the intention of bringing attention to the assessment of fetal growth, with a particular focus on the screening, diagnosis, and management of FGR, which is a leading cause of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This article proposes to standardize and provide guidance for the screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management of FGR. The intended target audience includes: Healthcare providers: all those qualified to care for pregnant women (obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, general practitioners, midwives, nurses, advance practice clinicians, radiologists, sonographers, pediatricians, and neonatologists). Healthcare delivery organizations and providers: governments, federal and state legislators, healthcare management organizations, health insurance organizations, international development agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. Professional organizations: international, regional, and national professional organizations of obstetricians and gynecologists, obstetric ultrasound, family practitioners, pediatricians, neonatologists, and worldwide national organizations dedicated to the care of pregnant women and their offspring. In assessing the quality of evidence and grading of strength of recommendations, the article follows the terminology proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group.5 This system uses consistent language and graphical descriptions for the strength and quality of the recommendations and the evidence on which they are based. Recommendations are classified as strong or conditional (weak) (Table S1).6 The strength of recommendation is dependent not only on the quality of evidence, but also on factors such as risk–benefit, cost, resource allocation, values, and preferences. Thus, some recommendations may be based on low-quality evidence but still represent a benefit that outweighs the risks and burdens, and therefore may be strongly recommended. The overall quality of evidence was assessed for each of the recommendations and expressed using four levels of quality: very low, low, moderate, and high (Table S2).7 Considerations for quality of evidence include primarily the study design and methodology. As such, evidence based on randomized controlled trials is considered high-quality evidence, observational studies provide moderate or low quality of evidence, and all others are very low. However, other parameters must be considered while assessing the level of evidence: risk of bias, study limitations, consistency of results, precision, publication bias, indirectness of evidence, and scarcity of evidence. For the quality of evidence, cross-filled circles are used: ⊕○○○ denotes very low-quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○ low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○ moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕ high-quality evidence. FGR is a common pregnancy complication that worldwide is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term neonatal morbidity.8-15 The definition, diagnosis, and optimal management of FGR have generated controversy as clinicians strive for more harmonized care. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the available evidence and provide recommendations regarding the early prediction and prevention, diagnosis, investigation, monitoring, and timing of delivery of pregnancies complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this pregnancy complication. Given the variation in resources and expertise available for the assessment and monitoring of pregnancies complicated by FGR in different countries or regions, we have included, in addition to the standard of care or \"best\" recommendations, specific recommendations for low-resource settings, which are marked as in the recommendation tables. Management algorithms for women in high-resource and low-resource settings are summarized in Figure 1a,b, respectively. FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Clinically, this is reflected by a drop in fetal size percentiles over the course of gestation. However, fetal growth potential is difficult to determine, and serial assessments of fetal size to detect a drop in fetal weight percentile are usually not available. Instead, care providers most commonly have only a \"snapshot\" of fetal weight estimation at a given point in time. Therefore, in clinical practice, small for gestational age (SGA), defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference below a certain threshold such as the 10th or 3rd percentile, is most commonly used to suspect FGR. The use of SGA as a proxy for FGR has several limitations that need to be recognized. First, most SGA fetuses are constitutionally healthy small fetuses, whose smallness is merely the result of their predetermined growth potential (i.e. false-positive diagnosis of FGR). Second, some growth-restricted fetuses, depending on their original growth potential and timing of insult, may remain above the percentile threshold described above and may thus not be SGA (i.e. false-negative diagnosis of FGR). Third, the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR is limited by the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation, which has an estimation error of up to ±15%–20%. Finally, the diagnosis of SGA is highly dependent on the growth chart being used, which can therefore have a considerable effect on the proportion of fetuses or infants flagged as SGA in a given population. It should be noted that there is inconsistency in the literature regarding the terminology described above, where some use the term FGR to describe a fetus with an estimated weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and the term SGA to describe an infant with birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. However, for the purpose of this article, the term SGA is used to indicate an EFW or birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, and the term FGR to refer to a small fetus that has failed to achieve its growth potential because of a pathologic process. The major member societies of FIGO follow a definition using the 10th percentile as a means of diagnosing an SGA fetus, which then leads to further testing, assessment, and follow-up. There are proposals to address the limitations of this definition, but their validity regarding reduction in adverse outcomes needs to be tested. For example, in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations described above, a consensus-based definition for placenta-mediated FGR has been proposed via a Delphi procedure.1 To decrease the likelihood of false-positive and false-negative diagnosis of FGR, the consensus definition was based on a combination of measures of fetal size (fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference) and abnormal Doppler findings in the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries, as described in Box 1. The implementation of this definition is limited by the lack of a recommendation on which growth chart should be used to define the 10th and 3rd percentiles for EFW and fetal abdominal circumference. In addition, further research is needed to correlate this definition with adverse perinatal outcomes. Early-onset FGR (<32 weeks) Late-onset FGR (≥32 weeks) Abbreviations: AC, fetal abdominal circumference; AREDV, absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity; CPR, cerebroplacental ratio; EFW, estimated fetal weight; PI, pulsatility index; UA, umbilical artery; UtA, uterine artery. Adapted from Gordijn et al.1 It has been suggested that FGR should be broadly classified, based on gestational age at the time of diagnosis, into early-onset FGR (<32 weeks) and late-onset FGR (≥32 weeks). The rationale underlying this classification is based on differences between these two phenotypes of FGR in severity, natural history, Doppler findings, association with hypertensive complications, placental findings, and management.16-18 Early-onset FGR has a prevalence of 0.5%–1%, is usually more severe, and is more likely to be associated with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler than late-onset FGR. The underlying placental pathology is frequently similar to that observed in cases of early-onset pre-eclampsia (maternal vascular malperfusion), which explains the strong association of early-onset FGR with pre-eclampsia. Therefore, early-onset FGR is usually easier to detect, and the natural history tends to follow a predictable sequence of Doppler changes in the umbilical artery and ductus venosus. The main challenge in cases of early-onset FGR is management (i.e. timing of delivery), by attempting to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity.19 Late-onset FGR is more common than early-onset FGR with a prevalence of 5%–10%. In contrast to early-onset FGR, it is usually milder, is less likely to be associated with pre-eclampsia, and is usually associated with normal umbilical artery Doppler. Therefore, the main challenge with regard to late-onset FGR is diagnosis, while management (i.e. delivery) is relatively simple given that the diagnosis is commonly made during the late-preterm or term periods, where the risks associated with delivery are relatively small. The diagnosis of late-onset FGR mainly relies on adaptive changes in the cerebral circulation (\"redistribution\" or \"brain-sparing effect\"), which is reflected by low resistance to flow in the middle cerebral artery thereby generating a low cerebroplacental ratio, as described in section 8.1.7. Given that the umbilical artery and ductus venosus Doppler studies are usually normal in cases of late-onset FGR, the natural history in these cases is less predictable and there is a risk of sudden decompensation and stillbirth.16, 19 FGR is often the result of one or more maternal, placental, or fetal disorders that interfere with the normal mechanisms regulating fetal growth.20, 21 The most common etiologies of FGR are listed in Box 2. It is important to note that there is often confusion in the literature between \"etiologies\" (or pathogenetic pathways) and \"risk factors\" for FGR. For example, although maternal conditions such as chronic hypertension, kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and long-standing diabetes are often listed as \"maternal etiologies\" for FGR, these conditions should probably be viewed instead as maternal risk factors for abnormal placentation that may result in placenta-mediated FGR. Given that maternal nutrition and fetal growth are closely related,22, 23 maternal undernutrition is an important cause of FGR worldwide.24-26 The impact of maternal undernutrition on fetal growth depends on its timing and severity.20 To date, maternal interventions in dietary advice and modifications have lacked significant success in preventing FGR. While the mechanisms by which maternal anemia contribute to FGR are unclear, both impaired nutrient transport to the fetus 27 and abnormal placental adaptation to low maternal hemoglobin 28 have been suggested as potential mechanisms. Abnormal placentation is a common cause of FGR, 29 which is often diagnosed by ultrasound Doppler studies 30 and typical histopathological placental findings.31-33 Chromosomal abnormalities have been suggested to contribute to up to 5% of FGR cases; triploidy and trisomy 13 and 18 are important considerations in early-onset FGR and the risk of many aneuploidies is higher in the presence of structural fetal anomalies.34-36 In 1%–6% of cases of FGR with normal karyotype, submicroscopic (micro) duplications/deletions can be found using chromosomal microarray analysis,35 even when FGR is an apparently isolated finding.37 FGR is also more prevalent in fetuses with structural malformations, and the risk increases when multiple anomalies are present.38 FGR is related to intrauterine infection in up to 5% of cases.20, 39 Viral agents such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and Zika are common causes of infection-related FGR.40-44 Protozoan infections like toxoplasmosis and malaria are another important cause, especially in endemic areas.45, 46 The main mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of FGR in these cases is a decline in cell population.20 Finally, maternal exposure to teratogens such as radiation,47 illicit drugs,48, 49 and alcohol50 is another important etiology for FGR. The main short- and long-term risks associated with FGR are listed in Box 3. It is associated with both fetal and obstetric complications. The most devastating complication is stillbirth,51-53 and there is a well-established inverse relationship between weight percentile and the risk of stillbirth,54-57 which is more pronounced in the early preterm period than at term.58 FGR is an important cause of iatrogenic preterm birth,59 as early delivery remains the main and perhaps only strategy for the prevention of stillbirth in cases of severe FGR.16, 60 FGR is also an independent risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth.61 Other obstetric complications associated with FGR include pre-eclampsia and placental abruption, as the pathophysiology of these conditions is often closely related.29, 30, 62-66 Despite ongoing improvements in neonatal care, FGR is associated with increased neonatal mortality and short-term morbidity. The risk of perinatal mortality in term FGR is reported to be five- to 10-fold higher than in appropriately grown neonates.57, 61, 67 The severity of FGR, Doppler abnormalities, and associated prematurity are independent predictors of neonatal complications.68 Among preterm infants, the co-presence of FGR further increases the risk of certain prematurity-related complications such as respiratory morbidity, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and metabolic disorders.57 Among term infants, FGR increases the risks of low cord artery pH,69 low Apgar score,69 and neonatal complications such as hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and jaundice.70-72 Growth-restricted infants are also at risk of long-term complications including neurodevelopmental impairment 11, 73-78 and noncommunicable diseases.15, 79-82 This is discussed in greater detail in section 9.1 (Infant follow-up). Early prediction of FGR is important as it can identify women at high risk of FGR who may benefit from preventive interventions and close monitoring during pregnancy. Box 4 lists the most common risk factors for FGR. While the predictive value of individual risk factors is low, clinical prediction models that are based on combinations of the risk factors outlined below can considerably improve the prediction of FGR. One important limitation of most of the studies on early prediction of FGR is the lack of a gold standard for the antenatal or postnatal diagnosis of FGR. As such, there is wide variation among studies regarding the outcomes being predicted, including either SGA (birth weight below the 10th or 3rd percentile) or adverse perinatal outcomes that are associated with (but are not specific to) FGR. As many SGA infants are constitutionally small and healthy, differentiating between healthy small fetuses and those that are small due to FGR is critically important. As a rule, the prediction of early-onset severe FGR is better than of late-onset FGR. Abbreviations: FGR, fetal growth restriction; PlGF, placental growth factor; PAPP-A, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A; AFP, alpha-fetoprotein. aRefers to placental dimension (short-based thick placenta) and texture (calcifications, echogenic cystic lesions). Several maternal factors influence fetal growth and the risk of FGR: advanced maternal age, racial/ethnic origin (e.g. South Asian), consanguinity, low body mass index, nulliparity, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, assisted reproductive technology, and medical disorders such as chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune conditions (Box 4).83-89 Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for FGR and reduces birth weight by an average of 200 g in a dose–response manner.90 In a cohort of 33 602 pregnancies, maternal characteristics predicted 37% of women who subsequently delivered SGA neonates (birth weight <5th percentile) at a false-positive rate of 10%.83 Some risk factors for FGR are especially relevant in low-resource countries. In a recent review from Africa, the main risk factors reported were low maternal nutritional status, HIV infection, malaria, and hypertensive diseases. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that to a large extent FGR in Africa is preventable through established interventions for malaria, HIV, and maternal undernutrition.42 In addition, exposure during pregnancy and lactation to toxic environmental chemicals and heavy metals has become a growing problem, especially in low-resource countries.91 At this point there is no role for routine screening with serum biomarkers for FGR. However, when biochemical markers are available as part of prenatal genetic screening for trisomy 21, it may be reasonable to use this information for the purpose of risk stratification for FGR. The placenta releases multiple factors into maternal circulation from the early stages of pregnancy, and first-trimester serum levels of some of these factors have been shown to be associated with subsequent placenta-mediated complications.92, 93 Low levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a placental glycoprotein produced by the syncytiotrophoblast layer, have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. A meta-analysis including 32 studies and 175 240 pregnancies found that PAPP-A levels below the 5th percentile had a moderate association with birth weight below the 10th percentile (OR 2.08, positive predictive value of 18%), while the association was stronger for PAPP-A levels below the 1st percentile (OR 3.4; positive predictive value of 28%).94 Thus, although women with low PAPP-A are at increased risk for FGR, the majority of these women will have a normal pregnancy outcome, especially as an isolated biomarker in healthy women. However, a low PAPP-A level is often considered an indication for closer monitoring of fetal growth.95 Elevated second-trimester maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein are thought to reflect abnormal placental permeability and are associated with increased risk of placenta-mediated complications including FGR and stillbirth.96, 97 The combination of low PAPP-A in the first trimester and high alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester is particularly predictive of severe FGR.98 Elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels greater than 2.5 MoM in the second trimester, alone or combined with high alpha-fetoprotein levels, are also associated with an increased risk of SGA.99 Angiogenic factors play a key role in the regulation of placental vascular development.100 Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a proangiogenic factor highly expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast and the maternal endothelium. Impaired placentation is associated with reduced placental production of this protein. Low first-trimester PlGF levels have been shown to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome including pre-eclampsia and SGA.101-104 In a case–control study of 296 pregnancies with SGA and 609 controls, the detection rate of low PlGF for SGA at a false-positive rate of 5% and 10% was 15% and 21%, respectively. The combined use of PlGF and PAPP-A increased the detection rate to 19% and 27%, respectively.103 A multicenter screening study found that the detection rate of a combined screening by maternal factors, fetal biometry, and serum PlGF and alpha-fetoprotein at 19–24 weeks for the delivery of SGA infants below the 5th percentile at less than 32, 32–36, and greater than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation was 100%, 76%, and 38%, respectively, at a false-positive rate of 10%.96 Findings are less consistent for soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an antiangiogenic factor released from the placenta that results in maternal endothelial dysfunction characteristic of pre-eclampsia.105 Although maternal serum sFlt-1 levels are known to be elevated in pre-eclamptic pregnancies, a large case–control study demonstrated that high levels of sFlt-1 at 10–14 weeks were actually associated with a slightly reduced risk of SGA (OR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.96).101 Therefore, the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio test used to diagnose pre-eclampsia should not be used in the first trimester as a screening test for FGR.106 Several ultrasound-based markers have been shown to be predictive of FGR, including uterine artery Doppler, placental morphology, and placental volumes. However, given their modest predictive accuracy, they cannot be recommended for universal screening for FGR. Increased uterine artery resistance largely reflects a failure of extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion and transformation of the spiral arteries and is associated with the development of pre-eclampsia and FGR due to maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta.107 First- and second-trimester abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, defined as mean pulsatility index above the 95th percentile, have been shown to be associated with FGR.108-110 In a large prospective cohort study of 4610 nulliparous women, uterine artery pulsatility index at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks predicted 60% of preterm and 17% of term SGA infants at a false-positive rate of 10%.111 Although uterine artery Doppler shows promise, especially for the prediction of early-onset FGR, current evidence does not support routine screening with uterine artery Doppler for FGR in low- or high-risk pregnancies.112 Sonographic evaluation of the placenta is a routine part of the obstetric ultrasound examination. A method for systematic two-dimensional (2D) placental ultrasound examination has been described, often in combination with other parameters 30, 113, 114 Abnormal placental morphology is defined by placental dimensions, shape, texture, and cord insertion. Placental shape is considered abnormal when the placental thickness is above 4 cm or greater than 50% of placental length. Placental texture is defined as normal when it is homogenous, and abnormal when the placenta is heterogeneous and contains multiple echogenic cystic lesions or has a jelly-like appearance with turbulent uteroplacental flow.115, 116 Placental cord insertion is defined as central (>2 cm from placental disc margin), marginal (within 2 cm of margin), or velamentous (inserting into the surrounding membranes).114 In a cohort of 60 high-risk women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler, women with abnormal placental shape at 19–23 weeks had higher odds of FGR (OR 4.7) than women with normal placental shape.108 However, the use of 2D placental imaging has significant limitations, including difficulty in assessing nonanterior placentas and a wide variability in the morphology of normal placentas. Furthermore, there are no large-scale prospective studies validating the use of this modality for prediction of FGR.114 Improvements in ultrasonographic imaging provide a tool for estimating placental volume using three- and four-dimensional scanning techniques. Placental volume has been proposed as a marker for various obstetric complications related to defective placental function, including FGR.117, 118 A systematic review estimating the value of first-trimester 3D placental volume for the prediction of SGA found a detection rate of 24.7% at a 10% false-positive rate.119 Another parameter is the placental quotient, defined as the ratio of the placental volume to the fetal crown–rump length. The placental quotient was reported to have a high negative predictive value for perinatal complications but was not very useful when used for screening of SGA in a low-risk population, with a sensitivity of 27.1%.120 The discriminatory ability of placental volume alone for SGA appears to be modest, but may be integrated into a multivariable screening model. However, the use of 3D placental volume as a routine screening tool for FGR is limited by the need for proper equipment and training required to obtain these measurements in a reproducible manner. Currently there is no single screening test sufficiently predictive of FGR to recommend routine clinical use. Investigations are underway to combine various tests, but such prediction models have not been sufficiently validated in terms of outcomes studies and therefore must be considered investigative protocols at this time. In a prospective cohort of 4970 women, the combination of first-trimester maternal serum PAPP-A, beta hCG, maternal blood pressure, and uterine artery Doppler performed in the first trimester had a detection rate of 73% for early SGA (<34 weeks) but only 32% for late SGA (≥34 weeks).19 A different model that included maternal characteristics, first-trimester blood pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, PlGF, and sFlt-1 was evaluated in a larger cohort of 9150 women and achieved a detection rate of 86% for early-onset FGR and 66% for late-onset FGR, both at a false-positive rate of 10%.19, 121 In the second trimester, the SCOPE consortium examined 5606 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies and found that the combination of clinical risk factors, 15-week biomarkers (53 biomarkers were used), and 20-week ultrasound (fetal biometry and Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries) had only a moderate detection rate for SGA below the 10th percentile, with a positive predictive value of 32% and a negative predictive value of 91%.122 Ideally, all women should plan their pregnancies, adopting a healthy lifestyle and optimizing any medical conditions and their body mass index. The preconception period provides an opportunity for health promotion with the aim of reducing accepted risk factors, including those associated with FGR.123 Insufficient gestational weight gain has been associated with an increased risk of FGR, especially in women with low body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).124 Recognizing that these associations are only based on observational data, we still believe that it would be reasonable to recommend monitoring of weight gain and informing women of the target weight gain range, as recommended by the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines.125 These guidelines recommend a total gestational weight gain of 12.5–18 kg (28–40 lb) for underweight women (BMI <18.5); 11.5–16 kg (25–35 lb) for the normal weight group (BMI 18.5–24.9); 7–11.5 kg (15–25 lb) for overweight women (BMI 25.0–29.9); and 5–9 kg (11–20 lb) for obese women (BMI ≥30).126 Substance use, including smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs, is associated with low birth weight and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.90 Interventions to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy have been shown to result in a reduction in low birth weight (RR 0.81) and an increase in mean birth weight (+33 g).127 Women should be advised that smoking cessation at any point in gestation is of benefit, and that the greatest benefit is associated with cessation before 15 weeks of pregnancy.128 The risk of SGA with alcohol intake is increased with as little as one drink per day.129 Most studies on early prevention of placental complications have focused on pre-eclampsia, with the results often being extrapolated to FGR due to the common pathophysiology. However, to date, other than lifestyle modifications, no medical interventions to prevent FGR have been clearly established. Aspirin is recommended for women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia, but there is some evidence that it may a", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13522", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3139210974", "source": "openalex"}

Adnexal disorders may be classified into the following three categories: (a) disorders that cause hemorrhage (hemorrhagic ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancies); (b) disorders related to adnexal tumors (adnexal torsion and rupture of ovarian tumors); and (c) disorders related to pelvic inflammatory disease, such as tubo-ovarian abscesses. Unusual adnexal torsion, such as massive ovarian edema, isolated fallopian tube torsion, and paraovarian cyst torsion, has also been described. Uterine disorders in gynecologic emergencies may be classified into two categories: (a) acute fibroid complications, including red degeneration of a uterine leiomyoma, torsion of subserosal myomas, and torsion of the uterus; and (b) causes of acute uterine bleeding, including retained products of conception and uterine arteriovenous malformations. Some gynecologic diseases are self-limited, while others cause infertility or life-threatening infection or bleeding if left untreated. Therefore, prompt and accurate diagnosis is important for appropriate life-saving treatment and for the preservation of fertility. The imaging findings are important when evaluating acute gynecologic diseases because the symptoms and physical examination findings are often nonspecific and limited. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality; however, when a definitive diagnosis cannot be established, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may narrow the differential diagnosis. Appropriate management requires radiologists to be familiar with the CT and MR imaging features of gynecologic emergencies. With respect to rare conditions, radiologists should take into account the representative findings presented in this article to increase diagnostic accuracy. ©RSNA, 2017", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2017160170", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2741086403", "source": "openalex"}

Additional references were obtained from relevant articles and review articles. Methods of Study Selection: Included were all English language articles on the frequency of unintentional urinary tract injuries identified during or after benign gynecologic surgery. There were 22 reports on the frequency of lower urinary tract injuries after gynecologic surgery and eight on the use of routine cystoscopy during gynecologic surgery to diagnose unsuspected injuries. Tabulation, Integration, and Results: In the reports of studies not involving routine cystoscopy, the frequency of ureteral injury varied from 0 to 14.6 injuries per 1000 operations, with an overall frequency of 1.6 per 1000. The frequency of bladder injury varied from 0.2 to 19.5 per 1000, with an overall frequency of 2.6 per 1000.

Optimally timed cancer chemotherapy with doxorubicin or pirarubicin (06:00h) and cisplatin (18:00h) enhanced the control of advanced ovarian cancer while minimizing side effects, and increased the response rate in metastatic endometrial cancer. Therapy of metastatic bladder cancer with doxorubicin–cisplatin was made more tolerable by this same circadian approach resulting in a 57% objective response rate. This optimally timed therapy is also effective in the adjuvant setting, decreasing the expected frequency of metastasis from locally advanced bladder cancer. Circadian fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) continuous infusion (70% of the daily dose given between 15:00h and 21:00h) has been shown effective for metastatic renal cell carcinoma resulting in 29% objective response and stable disease of more than 1 yr duration in the majority of patients. Toxicity is reduced markedly when FUDR infusion is modulated to circadian rhythms. In a multicenter trial in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer, patients were randomized to a flat or a circadian-modified FUDR infusion. This study confirmed a significant difference in toxicity and dose intensity, favoring the circadian-modified group. Hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer has been treated with circadian-timed FUDR chemotherapy; however, without objective response. Biological agents such as interferon-α and IL-2 have shown low but effective disease control in metastatic renal cell cancer, however, with much toxicity. Each of these cytokines shows circadian stage dependent toxicity and efficacy in model systems. In summary, the timing of anthracycline, platinum, and fluoropyrimidine-based drug therapies during the 24h is relevant to the toxic–therapeutic ratio of these agents in the treatment of gynecologic and genitourinary cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1081/cbi-120002600", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2111025829", "source": "openalex"}

A number of self-administered questionnaires are available for assessing depression severity, including the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9). Because even briefer measures might be desirable for use in busy clinical settings or as part of comprehensive health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item version of the PHQ depression module, the PHQ-2. Methods. The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The PHQ-2 was completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics–gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. Results. As PHQ-2 depression severity increased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-2 score ≥3 had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 92% for major depression. Likelihood ratio and receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a PHQ-2 score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening purposes.

As limited drug supplies became more plentiful, a phase II trial of Taxol was initiated in patients with advanced squamous cervix cancer who had received no prior chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this trial, 30 assessable patients were initially entered onto the study and four partial responses were seen. Further accrual of 22 assessable patients was then accomplished to define better the response rate with smaller confidence intervals.

Laparoscopic hysterectomy not otherwise specified (1.8%, 95% CI 1.2-2.6) and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (1.0%, 95% CI 0.9-1.2) had the highest rates of injury. Most ureteral injuries resulted from electrosurgery (33.3%, 95% CI 24.3-45.8), whereas most bladder injuries resulted from lysis of adhesions (23.3%, 95% CI 18.7-29.0). Ureteral injuries were most often recognized postoperatively (60%, 95% CI 47-76) and were repaired by open ureteral anastomosis (47.4%, 95% CI 36.3-61.9). In contrast, bladder injuries were most often recognized intraoperatively (85%, 95% CI 75-95) and were repaired by laparoscopic suturing (34.9%, 95% CI 29.2-41.7).The incidence of lower urinary tract injury in gynecologic laparoscopy for benign indication remains low at 0.33%. Bladder injury was three times more common than ureteral injury, although ureteral injuries were more often unrecognized intraoperatively and underwent open surgical repair. These risk estimates can assist gynecologic surgeons in effectively counseling their patients preoperatively concerning the risks of lower urinary tract injury.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000002414", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2771983507", "source": "openalex"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients underwent initial surgical assessment and tumor debulking. Patients with stage III/IV disease received six cycles of chemotherapy on a planned 21-day cycle. Carboplatin dose was calculated based on projected area under the curve (AUC) for concentration over time (mg. mL-1.min) and escalated to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). Paclitaxel dose was also escalated as a 3-, 24-, or 96-hour infusion. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) were required at selected dose levels or could be added based on hematologic toxicity. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were enrolled and assessable for toxicity and response. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was hematologic, primarily neutropenia. Less than 2% of all cycles with paclitaxel as a 3- or 24-hour infusion were associated with either grade 4 thrombocytopenia or febrile neutropenia. The carboplatin MTD was AUC 7.5 (equivalent to a median dose of 471 mg/m2). The MTD for paclitaxel was 135 mg/m2 over 24 hours and 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours without initial G-CSF. A 96-hour infusion of paclitaxel at a dose of 120 mg/m2 was associated with excessive single-cycle and cumulative myelosuppression, and was not further evaluated. Measured carboplatin AUC agreed well with the calculated AUC. The overall complete (n = 16) and partial (n = 2) response rate among 24 patients with measurable disease was 75%, with a median progression-free survival time of 15 months. CONCLUSION Carboplatin could be safely combined with paclitaxel using a dose formula based on projected renal clearance. The recommended outpatient regimen is carboplatin AUC 7.5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours without initial G-CSF. This treatment safely achieved a greater dose-intensity of carboplatin than would have been achieved with conventional dosing based on body-surface area.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1996.14.6.1895", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1835347798", "source": "openalex"}

In a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial, we compared the analgesic requirement in patients receiving preincision ketamine with ketamine after skin closure or placebo after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. One-hundred-thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive preincision or postoperative ketamine 0.15 mg/kg or saline IV. Anesthetic technique was standardized. Patients were interviewed regularly up to 4 wk after surgery. Pain score, morphine consumption, side effects, and quality of recovery score were recorded. Patients receiving preincision ketamine had a lower pain score in the first 6 h after operation compared with the postoperative (P = 0.001) or placebo groups (P < 0.001). The mean (95% confidence intervals) time to first request for analgesia in the preincision group, 1.8 h (1.4–2.1), was longer than the postoperative group, 1.2 h (0.9–1.5; P < 0.001), or the placebo group, 0.7 h (0.4–0.9; P < 0.001). The mean ± sd morphine consumption in the preincision group, 1.5 ± 2.0 mg, was less than that in the postoperative group, 2.9 ± 3.1 mg (P = 0.04) and the placebo group, 3.4 ± 2.7 mg (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference among groups with respect to hemodynamic variables or side effects. No patient complained of hallucinations or nightmares. We conclude that a small dose of ketamine is not only safe, but it also provides preemptive analgesia in patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. IMPLICATIONS: In women undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, a small preoperative dose of ketamine (0.15 mg/kg) produced preemptive analgesia.

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 161 women, we compared the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of ondansetron (4 mg intravenously [IV]) with droperidol (0.625 mg or 1.25 mg IV) in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after outpatient gynecologic surgery. The incidence of PONV, times to achieving preset recovery criteria, and patient-evaluated visual analog scales for sedation, anxiety, pain, and nausea were recorded, along with postdischarge emetic episodes, medications, quality of sleep, and time to resumption of food intake, normal activity, and return to work. A decision analysis tree was used to divide each data set into nine mutually exclusive subgroups, and costs and probabilities were assigned to each subgroup. The cost-effectiveness ratio was determined by summing these weighted costs and dividing by the number of patients free from both PONV and side effects of antiemetic therapy. The incidence of PONV in the hospital and after discharge, the need for rescue antiemetic therapy, and recovery and discharge times were similar for the ondansetron and both droperidol groups but differed significantly from those for the placebo group. The cost-effectiveness ratios for both droperidol 0.625 mg and 1.25 mg groups were significantly lower than those for the ondansetron and placebo groups. We conclude that droperidol 0.625 mg IV provides antiemetic prophylaxis comparable to that of ondansetron 4 mg IV without increasing side effects or delaying discharge and is more cost-effective.

Uterine carcinosarcomas (UCs) are uncommon with approximately more than 35% presenting with extra uterine disease at diagnosis. Up to 90% ovarian carcinosarcomas (OCs) will have disease that has spread beyond the ovary. Prognosis for localized stage disease is poor with a high risk of recurrences, both local and distant, occurring within 1 year. The survival of women with advanced UC or OC is worse than survival of endometrioid or high-grade serous histologies. No improvement in survival rates has been observed in the past few decades with an overall median survival of less than 2 years. Currently, there is no clear evidence to establish consensus guidelines for therapeutic management of carcinosarcomas. Until recently, gynecological carcinosarcomas were considered as a subtype of sarcoma and treated as such. However, carcinosarcomas are now known to be metaplastic carcinomas and so should be treated as endometrial or ovarian high-risk carcinomas, despite the lack of specific data. For UCs, a comprehensive approach to management is recommended with complete surgical staging followed by systemic chemotherapy in patients with both early and advanced stage disease. Active agents include paraplatin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel. The combination of carboplatin-paclitaxel is the most commonly used regimen in the adjuvant and advanced setting. Adjuvant radiotherapy (external beam irradiation and/or vaginal brachytherapy) has not shown any overall survival benefit but has been reported to decrease local recurrences. For OCs and for other ovarian epithelial cancer, the mainstay of treatment remains cytoreductive surgical effort followed, even in early stage, by platinum-based chemotherapy, usually carboplatin-paclitaxel.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000228", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976710676", "source": "openalex"}

The etiology of the racial disparity in outcome among gynecologic cancer patients is multifactoral and site-specific. Black women with endometrial cancer often present with more advanced stage tumors that are associated with a worse prognosis compared with White women. Evidence suggests that observed disparities in outcome are due to inequalities in treatment or differing biologic etiologies. For cervix cancer, studies have suggested that survival among Black women may be lower than survival among White women that develop this disease. This occurs despite evidence that indicates that Pap smears are utilized similarly by Black and White women for cervix cancer screening. These differences in outcome may become less pronounced when comorbidities are accounted for and inequalities in treatment are eliminated. For ovarian cancer patients, survival has improved with the use of contemporary therapies over the past 30 years in Whites but less so for Blacks. This may be due to differences in the likelihood of primary surgical cytoreductions, which are performed less frequently in some Black women because of extensive metastatic spread or comorbidities. The observed decreases in survival for all 3 gynecologic cancers potentially may be affected by socioeconomic status of the patient in some healthcare settings. An improved understanding of the causative factors associated with racial disparities in gynecologic cancer outcome is necessary to facilitate efforts aimed at correcting this important healthcare problem.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.22797", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2057385650", "source": "openalex"}

The overall and age-specific incidence rates of cervical cancer appear to be varied according to geographical areas. The overall prevalence rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) in China is similar with other eastern Asian countries, but the age-specific HPV prevalence showed sustained high HPV prevalence rates in elderly women.

This review concentrates on the uses of inhibin staining in gynecological pathology. alpha-inhibin is diagnostically the most useful antibody and is a sensitive immunohistochemical marker of most ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors and, as such, is of value in the diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can be confused morphologically with a wide range of other tumors. Because the antibody is not entirely specific for ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, it should always be used as part of a larger panel. alpha-inhibin staining may also be of value in confirming late recurrence or metastasis of an ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor, especially a granulosa cell tumor. Sex cord-like elements within uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors are also commonly immunoreactive with alpha-inhibin, perhaps indicating true sex cord differentiation. alpha-inhibin staining may also be of value in cytological preparations in confirming a functional cyst and excluding a cyst or cystadenoma of epithelial origin. Syncytiotrophoblastic cells are also immunoreactive, as are most trophoblastic tumors. Thus, positive staining may be of value in confirming an intrauterine gestation or in the diagnosis of a trophoblastic neoplasm. Another gynecological neoplasm that is commonly positive with alpha-inhibin is the so-called female adnexal tumor of probable wolffian origin, and, therefore, the antibody is of no value in the distinction of this neoplasm from a sex cord-stromal tumor, tumors that are often in the differential diagnosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004347-200101000-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061591949", "source": "openalex"}

Based on encouraging response rates in breast cancer with high-dose megestrol acetate (MA) 800 mg/d, this phase II trial assessed response rates in patients with endometrial carcinoma treated with high-dose MA. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-three patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial carcinoma were entered into this Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study. Patients had either failed to respond to or were considered incurable with local therapy and had not received prior cytotoxic or hormonal therapy.

We hypothesized that, if this is the case, the frequency of STIC should be substantially lower in endometrial serous carcinomas, in nonserous gynecologic malignancies, and in benign gynecologic neoplasms than in ovarian or peritoneal serous carcinomas. From 2007 to 2009 the fallopian tubes of 342 consecutive gynecologic cases were entirely submitted for histology using the Sectioning and Extensively Examining the FIMbriated end protocol. This study included 300 of these cases (277 TAH-BSO, 23 BSO) after exclusion. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from the fallopian tubes were independently reviewed by 2 gynecologic pathologists who were blinded to all other findings; disagreements were resolved by a third pathologist. Among 46 cases of ovarian malignancies, STIC was identified in 6 (18.8%) of 32 cases of serous carcinoma, but not in any other subtype. Similarly, STIC coexisted in 4 (14.3%) of 28 cases of endometrial serous carcinoma; however, no STIC was identified in any of the 74 cases of nonserous endometrial malignancies. STIC was identified in 2 (28.6%) of 7 cases of peritoneal serous carcinoma.

In conclusion, the fallopian tube may be the origin of some pelvic serous carcinomas. Other possibilities that may explain the origin of pelvic high-grade serous carcinoma are discussed. Given that STIC coexisted with 14% of endometrial serous carcinomas, a more unifying theory may be that gynecologic serous carcinomas and STIC are multifocal lesions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0b013e31822ea955", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061945206", "source": "openalex"}

We undertook tumor typing to classify MMR defects to determine if MMR status is prognostic or predictive. Methods Primary EECs from NRG/GOG0210 patients were assessed for microsatellite instability (MSI), MLH1 methylation, and MMR protein expression. Each tumor was assigned to one of four MMR classes: normal, epigenetic defect, probable mutation (MMR defect not attributable to MLH1 methylation), or MSI-low. The relationships between MMR classes and clinicopathologic variables were assessed using contingency table tests and Cox proportional hazard models. Results A total of 1,024 tumors were assigned to MMR classes. Epigenetic and probable mutations in MMR were significantly associated with higher grade and more frequent lymphovascular space invasion. Epigenetic defects were more common in patients with higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage. Overall, there were no differences in outcomes. Progression-free survival was, however, worse for women whose tumors had epigenetic MMR defects compared with the MMR normal group (hazard ratio, 1.37; P &lt; .05; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.86). An exploratory analysis of interaction between MMR status and adjuvant therapy showed a trend toward improved progression-free survival for probable MMR mutation cases. Conclusion MMR defects in EECs are associated with a number of well-established poor prognostic indicators. Women with tumors that had MMR defects were likely to have higher-grade cancers and more frequent lymphovascular space invasion. Surprisingly, outcomes in these patients were similar to patients with MMR normal tumors, suggesting that MMR defects may counteract the effects of negative prognostic factors. Altered immune surveillance of MMR-deficient tumors, and other host/tumor interactions, is likely to determine outcomes for patients with MMR-deficient tumors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2016.67.8722", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2468958716", "source": "openalex"}

Transvaginal NOTES has gained the most popularity than other transluminal natural orifices such as mouth, rectum, urinary tract or vagina. Since vNOTES is introduced, many surgeons have developed the technique in various gynecologic surgeries. The aim is to collect the growing evidences of vNOTES in gynecological surgeries and highlight vNOTES with an acceptable safety profile. In the present literature review, the search was carried out using the PubMed database with the following keywords: \"natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery\", \"NOTES\", \"natural orifice\" and \"gynecologic surgery\". The current status of vNOTES in gynecologic surgeries was investigated. A total of 33 studies with 628 cases were included in the review. Our outcomes showed that vNOTES had been performed successfully in a series of surgical procedures including salpingectomy, ovarian cystectomy, myomectomy, hysterectomy, lymphadenectomy and sacrocolpopexy. Advances in technology have improved the feasibility of vNOTES as a treatment option for gynecologic surgeries. When the technical limitations are overcome, wide application of vNOTES is expected to increase.

Likewise, the identification of metastatic adenopathies at posttreatment imaging is essential for assessing response and detecting recurrence. Similar to urologic neoplasms, gynecologic neoplasms most often spread regionally to the pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, following the normal drainage pathways of the pelvic organs. Familiarity with routes of dissemination, treatment options, and means of analyzing lymph node characteristics is crucial to determine the extent of disease. Two staging systems can be used in characterizing gynecologic malignancies: the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) system, which is the most commonly and universally used, and the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system, which is based on clinical and/or pathologic classification. Anatomic assessment with multidetector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is still the most commonly used technique for the detection of lymph node spread, which is mainly based on morphologic criteria, the most important of which is nodal size. However, size has limited diagnostic specificity. Consequently, functional imaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted MR imaging, positron emission tomography combined with CT, lymphoscintigraphy, and sentinel lymph node mapping, which are based on molecular and physiologic activity and allow more precise evaluation, are often incorporated into diagnostic imaging protocols for staging of gynecologic malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2015140086", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1946844111", "source": "openalex"}

The literature regarding this topic is also confusing, as modern NHL classification systems were not used or patients were not staged according to the Ann Arbor system in many prior reports. In addition, immunophenotypic data is not available for many cases, particularly in older studies.

These cases were reviewed in the Pathology Department of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center during the past two decades, and many of these patients were treated at this hospital. In this review, these cases are reported using updated terminology and almost all cases were immunophenotyped using immunohistochemical methods or flow cytometric methods in a small subset of cases. These cases have also been segregated into two groups: 1) localized NHL, that presumably initially arose in the gynecologic tract and therefore are primary; and 2) NHL that involved the gynecologic tract as a part of systemic disease, and therefore most likely represent secondary involvement of the gynecologic tract.

This hypothesis has been demonstrated in meta-analyses on several cancer types. However, there was no study to confirm the prognostic roles of SII for gynecological and breast cancers, which was the goal of our study. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to collect the articles exploring the associations of SII with prognostic outcomes [overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI)] in gynecological and breast cancers. The prognostic value of SII was estimated by hazard ratio (HR) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Nine articles involving 2724 patients in 11 datasets were included. Meta-analysis showed that a high SII index was significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 2.12, 95% CI, 1.61–2.79, P &lt; 0.001), DFS/PFS (HR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.52–3.41, P &lt; 0.001) and an increased risk for LNM (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.50, P &lt; 0.001) in patients with gynecological and breast cancers. Subgroup analysis confirmed the prognostic role of SII for OS was applicable to all cancer types, but the association with DFS/PFS and LNM was only significant for ovarian cancer and breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer.

However, there is little work on male caregivers' subjective experience of caring for family members with cancer, and little is known on how caregivers experience the caring over time. Objective: The objective of the study was to explore male spouses'/partners' experience of caring for their wives/partners with breast and gynecologic cancer over a 1-year period. Method: An exploratory longitudinal qualitative descriptive design using face-to-face interviews of 15 spouses/partners was used in this study. Content analysis of the transcribed data was conducted to extract significant categories and themes. Results: Varying degrees of interrelated cognitive, physical, and psychological impact were experienced by caregivers that extended to 12 months. Gender-specific attitudes prevented male caregivers from supporting their own self. Male caregivers dealt with problems that arose in the caregiving congruent with their masculinity, such as minimizing disruptions, focusing on tasks, and keeping their own stress to themselves. Conclusion: Male caregivers as a separate group with their own needs have not received much attention in the cancer literature, and their concerns and challenges may differ from those of female caregivers.

There was no significant difference in overall survival between cisplatin and either of the combinations. Leukopenia, renal toxicity, peripheral neurotoxicity, and CNS toxicity were more frequent with CIFX (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION CIFX improved the response rate and PFS duration in advanced cervix cancer compared with cisplatin alone, but at the cost of greater toxicity and with no improvement in survival.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1997.15.1.165", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1932754573", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2323264979", "title": "The Important Roles of Steroid Sulfatase and Sulfotransferases in Gynecological Diseases", "text": "Gynecological diseases such as endometriosis, adenomyosis and uterine fibroids, and gynecological cancers including endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, affect a large proportion of women. These diseases are estrogen dependent, and their progression often depends on local estrogen formation. In peripheral tissues, estrogens can be formed from the inactive precursors dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and estrone sulfate. Sulfatase and sulfotransferases have pivotal roles in these processes, where sulfatase hydrolyzes estrone sulfate to estrone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to dehydroepiandrosterone, and sulfotransferases catalyze the reverse reactions. Further activation of estrone to the most potent estrogen, estradiol, is catalyzed by 17-ketosteroid reductases, while estradiol can be formed from dehydroepiandrosterone by the sequential actions of 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-4-isomerase, aromatase, and 17-ketosteroid reductase. This review introduces the sulfatase and sulfotransferase enzymes, in terms of their structures and reaction mechanisms, and the regulation and different transcripts of their genes, together with the importance of their currently known single nucleotide polymorphisms. Data on expression of sulfatase and sulfotransferases in gynecological diseases are also reviewed. There are often unchanged mRNA and protein levels in diseased tissue, with higher sulfatase activities in cancerous endometrium, ovarian cancer cell lines, and adenomyosis. This can be indicative of a disturbed balance between the sulfatase and sulfotransferases enzymes, defining the potential for sulfatase as a drug target for treatment of gynecological diseases. Finally, clinical trials with sulfatase inhibitors are discussed, where two inhibitors have already concluded phase II trials, although so far with no convincing clinical outcomes for patients with endometrial cancer and endometriosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2016.00030", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2323264979", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Women were randomized to receive either TPN or EUC; and chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and follow‐up were assessed over 12 months. Patients with breast cancer were analyzed separately from patients with gynecologic cancer. RESULTS: Overall adherence rates ranged from 87% to 94%, and there were no significant differences between the TPN group and the EUC group. Among women with breast cancer, 90% of the EUC group and 88% of the TPN group completed chemotherapy (14% of the EUC group and 26% of the TPN group delayed the completion of chemotherapy), 2% of the EUC group and 4% of the TPN group failed to complete chemotherapy, and 8% of the EUC group and 7% of the TPN group refused chemotherapy. Radiation treatment adherence was similar between the groups: Ninety percent of patients completed radiation (40% of the EUC group and 42% of the TPN group delayed the completion of radiation); in both groups, 2% failed to complete radiation, and 8% refused radiation. Among gynecologic patients, 87% of the EUC group and 94% of the TPN group completed chemotherapy (41% of the EUC group and 31% of the TPN group completed it with delays), 7% of the EUC group and 6% of the TPN group failed to complete chemotherapy, 6% of the EUC refused chemotherapy, 87% of the EUC group and 84% of the TPN group completed radiation (51% of the EUC group and 42% of the TPN with delays), 5% of the EUC group and 8% of the TPN group failed to complete radiation, and 8% of the EUC group and 5% of the TPN group refused radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence across randomized groups was notably higher than reported in previous studies, suggesting that active telephone patient navigation or written resource informational materials may facilitate adherence among low‐income, predominantly Hispanic women. Adherence also may have be facilitated by federal‐state breast and cervical cancer treatment funding.

Two of the newer genetic technologies in the prenatal setting are chromosomal microarray and whole-exome sequencing. Chromosomal microarray analysis is a method of measuring gains and losses of DNA throughout the human genome. It can identify chromosomal aneuploidy and other large changes in the structure of chromosomes as well as submicroscopic abnormalities that are too small to be detected by traditional modalities. Prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis is recommended for a patient with a fetus with one or more major structural abnormalities identified on ultrasonographic examination and who is undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis. Whole-genome sequencing analyzes the entire genome, including noncoding regions (introns) and coding regions (exons). However, because the introns are typically of little clinical relevance, there has been a focus instead on whole-exome sequencing, which examines the coding regions (exons) of the genome. The exons generally have greater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. However, the routine use of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001817", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4244360267", "source": "openalex"}

Ovarian cancer has emerged as one of the most common malignancies affecting women in India and has shown an increase in the incidence rates over the years. Although cervical cancer is on a declining trend, it remains the second most common cancer in women after breast cancer. Many researchers in India have published important data in the field of gynecologic oncology, covering all domains such as basic sciences, preventive oncology, pathology, radiological imaging, and clinical outcomes.

Fifteen minutes before induction they received single iv doses of either dexmedetomidine (0.5 micrograms/kg; n = 19) or saline (n = 20) in a double-blind fashion. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with N2O/O2 (70/30%) and thiopental. Dexmedetomidine was well tolerated and no serious drug-related subjective side-effects or adverse events were observed. The most prominent subjective effects were fatigue and decreased salivation. The total amount of thiopental needed to perform D & C of the uterus was reduced approximately 30% (from 456 +/- 141 mg [mean +/- SD] after saline to 316 +/- 79 mg after dexmedetomidine). This was mostly due to a smaller induction dose in the group receiving dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine appeared to improve the recovery from anesthesia as measured by visual analogue scales (VAS) on fatigue and nausea. The plasma concentration of norepinephrine was decreased by 56% after dexmedetomidine implying decreased sympathetic nervous activity. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were moderately reduced after dexmedetomidine administration. The authors conclude that dexmedetomidine preanesthetic medication decreases thiopental anesthetic requirements and improves the recuperation from anesthesia with no serious hemodynamic or other adverse effects.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1971643210", "title": "Relationship of Benign Gynecologic Diseases to Subsequent Risk of Ovarian and Uterine Tumors", "text": "Abstract Objective: Although endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas are common conditions, the extent to which either is associated with certain types of malignancies remains uncertain. Methods: Using record linkage techniques, we assessed the relationships between hospital and outpatient admissions for endometriosis or leiomyomas and the development of ovarian and uterine cancers in Denmark between 1978 and 1998. Based on a population-based cohort exceeding 99,000 women, including 2,491 ovarian cancers, 860 borderline ovarian tumors, and 1,398 uterine cancers, we derived relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) associated with overall and histology-specific tumor risks after adjustment for calendar time and reproductive characteristics. Results: Endometriosis seemed to predispose to the development of ovarian cancer, with the association restricted to endometrioid or clear cell malignancies. Five or more years after the diagnosis of endometriosis, the RRs (95% CIs) were 2.53 (1.19-5.38) for endometrioid (7 exposed cases) and 3.37 (1.24-9.14) for clear cell (4 exposed cases) malignancies. Uterine leiomyomas were associated with increases in the risk of uterine malignancies, particularly sarcomas, where the RRs (95% CIs) were 20.80 (11.32-38.22) for women with 1 to 4 years of follow-up (11 exposed cases) and 5.70 (2.27-14.32) for those with more extended follow-up (5 exposed cases). Conclusion: In combination with clinical, pathologic, and molecular data, our results support that some endometriotic lesions may predispose to clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancers. Uterine leiomyomas also showed a strong connection with subsequent uterine sarcomas, although it was difficult to decipher whether this reflected detection bias, shared risk factors, or an etiologic relationship.

This study identified gynecological and non-gynecological diseases that exhibited comorbidity with adenomyosis and endometriosis in Korean women. Methods We used Health Insurance Review and Assessment data from 2009 to 2011 and searched for adenomyosis and endometriosis (coded as N80.1 and D25 in International Classification of Disease, 10th revision [ICD-10], respectively). We selected records from patients who had independent disease occurrences in each year, and comorbidities were estimated using Fisher's exact test. We computed each year's similarities and combined 3 years' results using Fisher's P-value summation method. Results A total of 61,516 patients' data were collected during the study period. The prevalence of adenomyosis and endometriosis were similar each year: 12.4% and 9.3% in 2009, 12.5% and 9.4% in 2010 and 13.3% and 9.1% in 2011, respectively. Meta-analysis revealed that 31 ICD-10 codes were significantly related with adenomyosis, and 44 ICD-10 codes were related with endometriosis. Gynecological diseases, such as leiomyoma and benign ovarian tumor, were significantly related to adenomyosis and endometriosis. Non-gynecological diseases, such as anemia and hypercholesterolemia, were also related to adenomyosis and endometriosis. Conclusion We must monitor for the presence of gynecological and non-gynecological diseases with co-morbidities during evaluations and follow-up of patients with adenomyosis or endometriosis.

Dose-dependent antiproliferative effects of GnRH agonists in cell lines derived from these cancers have been observed by various investigators. GnRH antagonists also have marked antiproliferative activity in most breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines tested, indicating that the dichotomy of GnRH agonists and antagonists might not apply to the GnRH system in cancer cells. The classical GnRH receptor signal-transduction mechanisms, known to operate in the pituitary, are not involved in the mediation of antiproliferative effects of GnRH analogs in cancer cells. Rather, the GnRH receptor interacts with the mitogenic signal transduction of growth factor receptors and related oncogene products associated with tyrosine kinase activity, via activation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, resulting in downregulation of cancer cell proliferation. In addition, GnRH activates nuclear factor kappaB and protects the cancer cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, GnRH induces activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathway independent of the known AP-1 activators, protein kinase or mitogen activated protein kinase.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1530/eje.0.1460001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4322699776", "source": "openalex"}

This review focuses on the indications, contraindications, and limitations of frozen-section diagnosis specific to the female genital tract. An intraoperative consultation in gynecological pathology is indicated (a) to ensure that the tissue sampled is adequate for diagnosis, (b) to determine the nature of a disease process, (c) to plan for appropriate ancillary studies, (d) to determine tumor spread, and (e) to assess the margins. In the ovary, mucinous tumors in particular may present a challenge and potential for misdiagnosis at the time of frozen section. It is important to determine the nature of the ovarian involvement, as tumor size greater than 10 cm or bilateral involvement strongly suggests a metastatic process. Also, the distinction between ovarian carcinoma and tumors of borderline malignancy may be difficult in a limited sampling. In the germ cell category, an important distinction is that of a dysgerminoma from a large cell lymphoma, due to different treatment regimes. Pregnant and postpartum women present a unique challenge as the effects of high levels of pregnancy-related hormones may result in lesions that closely mimic malignancy. Although intraoperative frozen section should be discouraged as a primary diagnostic procedure for endometrial carcinoma, it can be very helpful to identify those patients who are at risk for extrauterine spread and who may require lymphadenectomy. Analysis of a cone biopsy of the cervix by frozen section may be warranted particularly if the previous biopsy showed equivocal stromal invasion, an uncertain depth of invasion, there are issues related to fertility; however, the process is time consuming and may compromise the permanent sections if the lesion is very small.

Design and Methods: Qualitative research using a descriptive phenomenological approach. Setting: Gynecologic oncology outpatient clinic of the Gulhane Military Medical Academy in Ankara, Turkey. Nineteen women with gynecologic cancer aged 43–70 years and 12 partners aged 46–73 years were recruited. Data were obtained through open‐ended and in‐depth, audio‐taped interviews which lasted approximately 35–45 minutes each. Findings: Seven themes emerged from the participants' description of their experience: (a) experiences during the diagnosis period; (b) experiences during the treatment period; (c) the effect of cancer on family life; (d) changes in daily life; (e) coping methods and support sources; (f) the meaning of illness; and (g) experiencing the illness as a woman. Conclusions: Receiving the diagnosis of gynecologic cancer was remembered as a very dramatic experience. The women and partners reported many physical and psychosocial difficulties relating to the treatment period. Healthcare professionals must understand and recognize cancer patients' and their partners' experiences to provide appropriate holistic care. Clinical Relevance: Nurses can only provide effective and comprehensive nursing care to gynecologic cancer patients and their families if they fully understand the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual experiences in their lives.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1547-5069.2008.00232.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165399122", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Data were collected for procedures in adult women from 1979 to 2006 using the National Hospital Discharge Survey, a federal discharge dataset of U.S. inpatient hospitals, including patient and hospital demographics and International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes for adult women from 1979 to 2006. Age-adjusted rates per 1,000 women were created using 1990 U.S. Census data. Procedural trends over time were assessed. RESULTS: More than 137 million obstetric and gynecologic procedures were performed, comprising 26.5% of surgical procedures for adult women. Sixty-four percent were only obstetric and 29% were only gynecologic, with 7% of women undergoing both obstetric and gynecologic procedures during the same hospitalization. Obstetric and gynecologic procedures decreased from approximately 5,351,000 in 1979 to 4,949,000 in 2006. Both operative vaginal delivery and episiotomy rates decreased, whereas spontaneous vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery rates increased. All gynecologic procedure rates decreased during the study period, with the exception of incontinence procedures, which increased. Common procedures by age group differed across a woman's lifetime. CONCLUSION: Inpatient obstetric and gynecologic procedures rates decreased from 1979 to 2006. Inpatient obstetric and gynecologic procedure rates are decreasing over time but still comprise a large proportion of inpatient surgical procedures for U.S. women.

Design and Setting.—Retrospective identification of patients with abnormal cervicovaginal cytology and identification of the initial clinical follow-up activity during the 12 months following the cytologic diagnosis. Main Outcome Measure.—Percentage of women receiving follow-up. Results.—Three hundred six laboratories reported follow-up information on 16 132 patients with gynecologic cytology diagnoses of carcinoma, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or glandular intraepithelial lesion. The following percentages of women received follow-up within 1 year: 85.6% of patients with cytologic diagnoses of carcinoma, 87.2% with diagnoses of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 82.7% with diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 84.9% with diagnoses of glandular intraepithelial lesion. Within 6 months, 82.2% of patients with cytologic diagnoses of carcinoma, 82.4% with diagnoses of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 71.9% with diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 74.7% with diagnoses of glandular intra-epithelial lesion received follow-up.

MAIN VARIABLES: DGCD data are organized within separate data forms as follows: clinical data, surgery, pathology, pre- and postoperative care, complications, follow-up visits, and final quality check. DGCD is linked with additional data from the Danish \"Pathology Registry\", the \"National Patient Registry\", and the \"Cause of Death Registry\" using the unique Danish personal identification number (CPR number).

The \"easy\" operation--the \"simple\" abdominal hysterectomy--and not the technically difficult pelvic one, is responsible for most ureteral injuries. Total abdominal hysterectomy accounts for almost 50% of the genitourinary fistulas and perhaps 80-99% of all surgical ureteral injuries. This problem will persist until a most important surgical axiom is applied routinely during the accomplishment of all pelvic operations: With all dissections, the contiguous structures subject to injury must be exposed. This step not only will avoid injuries to the ureter but also will facilitate an equally important aspect, that is, urinary tract injuries must be recognized at the time of operation. With recognition and adequate repair, problems such as fistula formation and serious morbidity (and litigation) can be avoided almost entirely. Because the gnecologic surgeon frequently will find that urologic consultation is not available at the time of urinary tract injury, he or she must be aware of and familiar with the various ureteral reconstructive procedures that may be required. The gynecologic surgeon must devote time and study to the management of urinary tract injuries before their occurrence. All pelvic surgeons eventually will encounter ureteral problems. The methods of bladder mobilization and ureteroneocystostomy should be within the ability of all who operate within the pelvis. When extensive damage has occurred and a urologist is not available, the gynecologist who is unfamiliar with the more demanding techniques (that is, ureteroureterostomy, bladder flaps, ileal conduits) should avoid additonal damage to the urinary tract and accomplish a simple catheter ureterostomy, deffering the definitive repair for a urologist.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00003081-197609000-00012", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046642443", "source": "openalex"}

Between 1983-1989, member institutions of the Gynecologic Oncology Group entered 155 patients in a prospective evaluation of modified radical hemivulvectomy and ipsilateral inguinal lymphadenecctomy for clinical stage I vulvar cancer. Only patients with neoplastic thickness of 5 mm or less, without vascular space invasion, and negative inguinal lymph nodes were eligible for this study. There have been 19 recurrences and seven deaths from disease among the 121 eligible and evaluable patients. Patients whose disease recurred on the vulva were frequently (eight of ten patients) salvaged by further operation. Five of the seven deaths due to cancer occurred among patients whose first recurrence was in the groin. Acute and long-term morbidity as well as hospital stay were each less than in the Group's previous experience in a comparable patient population treated with radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy. There was a significantly increased risk of recurrence but not death when compared with these same historic controls. Modified radical hemivulvectomy and ipsilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy is an alternative to traditional radical operation for these selected patients with stage I carcinoma of the vulva. The number of patients who experienced recurrence in the operated groin is of concern and may be attributable to the decision to leave the femoral nodes intact.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W10280605", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to describe a new reporting system called the Gynecologic Imaging Reporting and Data System (GI-RADS) for reporting findings in adnexal masses based on transvaginal sonography. Methods. A total of 171 women (mean age, 39 years; range, 16–77 years) suspected of having an adnexal mass were evaluated by transvaginal sonography before treatment. Pattern recognition analysis and color Doppler blood flow location were used for determining the presumptive diagnosis. Then the GI-RADS was used, with the following classifications: GI-RADS 1, definitively benign; GI-RADS 2, very probably benign; GI-RADS 3, probably benign; GI-RADS 4, probably malignant; and GI-RADS 5, very probably malignant. Patients with GI-RADS 1 and 2 tumors were treated expectantly. All GI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 tumors were removed surgically, and a definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained. The GI-RADS classification was compared with final histologic diagnosis. Results. A total of 187 masses were evaluated. The prevalence rate for malignant tumors was 13.4%. Overall GI-RADS classification rates were as follows: GI-RADS 1, 4 cases (2.1%); GI-RADS 2, 52 cases (27.8%); GI-RADS 3, 90 cases (48.1%); GI-RADS 4, 13 cases (7%); and GI-RADS 5, 28 cases (15%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 92%, 97%, 85%, 99%, and 96%, respectively. Conclusions.

Gynecologic malignancies are often the presenting cancer in these patients. Therefore, there is considerable benefit to identifying these patients and enrolling them and affected family members in surveillance programs for secondary malignancies. The molecular basis for Lynch syndrome is a defect in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Tumors can be screened for these defects using immunohistochemistry to identify loss of MMR proteins or by enlisting polymerase chain reaction to identify the microsatellite instability that attends dysfunctional MMR. However, diagnostic confirmation of Lynch syndrome requires germline mutational testing. The algorithm for screening endometrial carcinomas for Lynch syndrome remains a subject of debate, with some studies supporting universal screening and others proposing a hybrid approach informed by clinicopathologic features. This review discusses the rationales and relative merits of current Lynch syndrome-screening approaches for endometrial and ovarian cancers and provides pathologists with an informed approach to Lynch syndrome testing in gynecologic cancers. It also addresses the clinical difficulties presented by cases with discordant screening and germline results (Lynch-like cancers) and emphasizes the critical role of strong communication with clinician and genetic counseling colleagues to ensure that the significance of a positive screening test is appropriately conveyed to patients. Finally, it discusses the need for more nuanced cost-effective analyses and the potential role for next-generation sequencing panels in future screening efforts.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pas.0000000000000608", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2296403908", "source": "openalex"}

As part of an epidemiological study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome or irritable bowel disease we inquired about a history of chronic pelvic pain and related gynecological problems, and hypothesized that distress associated with either of these conditions was additive in women with both syndromes. A medically trained interviewer evaluated a sequential sample of 60 women with irritable bowel syndrome and 26 women with inflammatory bowel disease in an urban gastroenterology clinic using the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule, the Briere Child Maltreatment Interview (emotional, physical and sexual abuse), and a structured interview to elicit a lifetime history of chronic pelvic pain that was distinct from the history of bowel distress. Chronic pelvic pain was reported in 21 (35.0%) of the irritable bowel syndrome patients vs. 4 (13.8%) of the inflammatory bowel disease group (p < 0.05). Compared to women with irritable bowel syndrome alone, those with both irritable bowel syndrome and chronic pelvic pain were significantly more likely to have a lifetime history of dysthymic disorder, current and lifetime panic disorder, somatization disorder, childhood sexual abuse and hysterectomy. Logistic regression showed that mean number of somatization symptoms was the best predictor of a history of both irritable bowel syndrome and chronic pelvic pain compared either to inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome alone. Many women with irritable bowel syndrome may have a history of chronic pelvic pain as well. The high rates of psycho-pathology associated with irritable bowel syndrome and chronic pelvic pain independently are even higher in women with both syndromes, and women who present with either irritable bowel syndrome or chronic pelvic pain should probably be evaluated for both disorders.Key Words: Chronic Pelvic PainIrritable Bowel Syndrome", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/01674829609025662", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101438008", "source": "openalex"}

The review aimed to discuss the incidence, risk factors, and clinical presentation of VTE before examining the literature on the diagnosis, prevention, and management in the context of uterine, cervical, ovarian, and vulval cancers.A literature search was performed using Ovid Medline and Embase with the following words: \"gynecological malignancy,\" \"pelvic tumor,\" \"venous thromboembolism,\" \"deep vein thrombosis\" and \"pulmonary embolism.\"The incidence of VTE in patients with gynecological malignancy ranged between 3% and 25% and was affected by several patient and tumor factors. Duplex ultrasonography is currently the first-line imaging modality for deep venous thrombosis with sensitivity and specificity of up to 95% and 100%, respectively. Low-molecular-weight heparin is currently the VTE prophylaxis and treatment of choice for patients with gynecological malignancy, although warfarin and unfractionated heparin play a role in selected circumstances. The relatively new direct oral anticoagulants including factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors are increasingly being used, although further evaluations are required, particularly in cancer patients. Catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous mechanical and surgical thrombectomy may have a role in treating patients with severe symptomatic iliocaval or iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. Overall, VTE is a poor prognosis marker in patients with gynecological malignancy.Gynecological malignancy-associated VTE is associated with significant morbidity, contributing to a large number of life years lost. Although promising new therapies are emerging, a 2-pronged approach is required to simultaneously target cancer-specific management and predict early on those who are likely to be affected.

One hundred patients from outpatient GC clinics at two Melbourne-based hospitals completed a brief structured interview and self-report measures of anxiety, depression, spirituality, and spiritual coping. Using two sequential regression analyses, we found that younger women with more advanced disease, who used more negative spiritual coping, had a greater tendency towards depression and that the use of negative spiritual coping was associated with greater anxiety scores. Although not statistically significant, patients with lower levels of generalized spirituality also tended to be more depressed.

The incidence rate of the three gynecologic cancers combined is only 40 percent of the breast cancer rate (43.6 vs 109.5 per 100,000), whereas the combined mortality rate is half that for breast cancer (14.3 vs 27.3 per 100,000). Cervical cancer is distinctive in that it's hormonal correlates are few; it exhibits the epidemiologic characteristics of a sexually transmitted disease. Integration of Human Papilloma Virus DNA types 16, 18 (or other) within the cellular genome has been identified in more than 80% of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias and invasive carcinomas. Epithelial ovarian cancers occur most commonly in nulliparous, infertile women and familial carriers of BRCA1. Oral contraceptive (OC) use reduces ovarian cancer risk by at least one-half, a benefit which increases with increasing duration of use and persists for at least 15 years after discontinuation. Pregnancy and OCs suppress gonadotropin secretion, whereas fertility drugs enhance follicle-stimulating hormone production. These indicators of alterations in the hypothalmic-pituitary-ovarian axis provide some support for both the excess gonadotropin and the incessant ovulation theories of ovarian carcinogenesis. Endometrial carcinoma is the prototype hormonally-determined disease. Increased estrogen from either endogenous or exogenous sources increases risk. Lowering the estrogen load or adding progestin reduces risk. This explains the marked protection achieved by combined estrogen/progestin OC's and the dramatic increased risk uncurred by long-term estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). Breast tissue, also a target for sex steroid hormones, displays a more complex risk profile. Current ERT use increases breast cancer risk by about 30%; adding a progestin to the estrogen does not improve the situation (40% increased risk). Furthermore, OCs do not reduce breast cancer risk, but may increase it for current OC users under age 45. The magnitude of these hormonal effects is much smaller than that exhibited with endometrial cancer.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2346697006", "source": "openalex"}

The HPV16 encoded oncoproteins E6 and E7 are tumor-specific targets for the adaptive immune system permitting the development of an HPV16-synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine with an excellent treatment profile in animal models. Here, we determined the toxicity, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the HPV16 SLP vaccine in patients with advanced or recurrent HPV16-induced gynecological carcinoma. Methods Patients with HPV16-positive advanced or recurrent gynecological carcinoma (n = 20) were subcutaneously vaccinated with an HPV16-SLP vaccine consisting of a mix of 13 HPV16 E6 and HPV16 E7 overlapping long peptides in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. The primary endpoints were safety, toxicity and tumor regression as determined by RECIST. In addition, the vaccine-induced T-cell response was assessed by proliferation and associated cytokine production as well as IFNγ-ELISPOT. Results No systemic toxicity beyond CTCAE grade II was observed. In a few patients transient flu-like symptoms were observed. In 9 out of 16 tested patients vaccine-induced HPV16-specific proliferative responses were detected which were associated with the production of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-5 and/or IL-10. ELISPOT analysis revealed a vaccine-induced immune response in 11 of the 13 tested patients. The capacity to respond to the vaccine was positively correlated to the patient’s immune status as reflected by their response to common recall antigens at the start of the trial. Median survival was 12.6 ± 9.1 months. No regression of tumors was observed among the 12 evaluable patients. Nineteen patients died of progressive disease. Conclusions The HPV16-SLP vaccine was well tolerated and induced a broad IFNγ-associated T-cell response in patients with advanced or recurrent HPV16-induced gynecological carcinoma but neither induced tumor regression nor prevented progressive disease.

The association between men's reports of physical and sexual violence they had perpetrated against their wives and wives' reports of gynecologic symptoms was analyzed in bivariate and multivariate analyses.Overall, 37% of men said they had committed one or more acts of physical or sexual violence against their wives in the past 12 months, with 12% reporting physical violence only, 17% sexual violence only and 9% both physical and sexual violence. Thirty-four percent of women reported at least one symptom of gynecologic morbidity. Compared with women whose husbands reported no violence, those who had experienced both physical and sexual violence and those who had experienced sexual violence only had elevated odds of reporting gynecologic symptoms (odds ratios, 1.7 and 1.4, respectively).Plausible mechanisms through which domestic violence may influence gynecologic morbidity include physical trauma, psychological stress or transmission of STIs.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3021511903", "title": "Nature and Diffusion of Gynecologic Cancer–Related Misinformation on Social Media: Analysis of Tweets", "text": "Background Over the last two decades, the incidence and mortality rates of gynecologic cancers have increased at a constant rate in China. Gynecologic cancers have become one of the most serious threats to women’s health in China. With the widespread use of social media, an increasing number of individuals have employed social media to produce, seek, and share cancer-related information. However, health information on social media is not always accurate. Health, and especially cancer-related, misinformation has been widely spread on social media, which can affect individuals’ attitudinal and behavioral responses to cancer. Objective The aim of this study was to examine the nature and diffusion of gynecologic cancer–related misinformation on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Methods A total of 2691 tweets related to 2 gynecologic cancers—breast cancer and cervical cancer—posted on Weibo from June 2015 to June 2016 were extracted using the Python Web Crawler. Two medical school graduate students with expertise in gynecologic diseases were recruited to code the tweets to differentiate between true information and misinformation as well as to identify the types of falsehoods. The diffusion characteristics of gynecologic cancer–related misinformation were compared with those of the true information. Results While most of the gynecologic cancer–related tweets provided medically accurate information, approximately 30% of them were found to contain misinformation. Furthermore, it was found that tweets about cancer treatment contained a higher percentage of misinformation than prevention-related tweets. Nevertheless, the prevention-related misinformation diffused significantly more broadly and deeply than true information on social media. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest the need for controlling and reducing the cancer-related misinformation on social media with the efforts from both service providers and medical professionals. More specifically, it is important to correct falsehoods related to the prevention of gynecologic cancers on social media and increase individuals’ capacity to assess the veracity of Web-based information to curb the spread and thus minimize the consequences of cancer-related misinformation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2196/11515", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3021511903", "source": "openalex"}

All three main modes of assessment (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports) reveal a high burden of reproductive tract infections. The two most common conditions, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis and mucopurulent cervicitis. Approximately one-fourth of the women had clinical evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical ectopy, and fistula. The contribution of sexually transmitted diseases to overall gynecological morbidity appears to be relatively modest; 10 percent were so diagnosed. Associated conditions of anemia and chronic energy deficiency were common. Severe anemia was found in 17 percent of cases and severe chronic energy deficiency in 12 percent. These results indicate that radical improvements in women's health in India will require far more than the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract infections.An assessment of gynecological morbidity among 385 married mothers of children 6-12 months of age from a district in South India's Karnataka State revealed a high burden of reproductive tract infections. Research methods included clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports. A total of 152 women reported 226 gynecological complaints to a social worker, primarily vaginal discharge with bad odor and itching or irritation (22%), lower abdominal pain or vaginal discharge with fever (16%), and menstrual bleeding disorders or pain (15%). Under more extensive probing by a gynecologist, the proportion of women reporting menstrual problems rose to 62%. At medical examination, 36% of women had at least one clinically diagnosed reproductive tract infection, including pelvic inflammatory disease (11%), cervical ectopy (10%), and genital prolapse (3%). More than half had endogenous infections. The two most common infections, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis (18%) and mucopurulent cervicitis (37%). Sexually transmitted diseases, primarily trichomonal vaginalis, were diagnosed in 10%. Women residing in town, those with 6 or more years of schooling, and women with 4 or more pregnancies were significantly more likely to report menstrual problems. Laboratory-detected vaginosis was significantly higher among urban and sterilized women. There were no significant associations between demographic/socioeconomic status variables and the other reproductive health problems analyzed. Finally, severe anemia was present in 17% and chronic energy deficiency in 12%. The combination of widespread undernutrition/malnutrition and reproductive tract infections revealed in this study indicates an urgent need to take steps to implement the reproductive health strategy outlined at the 1994 Cairo Conference in South India.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/2138112", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2034331666", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either droperidol 1.25 mg (Group D1, n = 45), droperidol 1.25 mg plus dexamethasone 8 mg (Group D2, n = 45), metoclopramide 10 mg (Group M1, n = 45), metoclopramide 10 mg plus dexamethasone 8 mg (Group M2, n = 45), granisetron 40 micro g/kg (Group G1, n = 45), or granisetron 40 micro g/kg plus dexamethasone 8 mg (Group G2, n = 45) immediately before the induction of anesthesia. A standard general anesthetic technique and postoperative analgesia were used throughout the study. Complete response, defined as no PONV and no administration of rescue antiemetic medication during the first 24 h after anesthesia, was 49% in Group D1, 60% in Group D2 (P = 0.199 versus Group D1), 51% in Group M1, 62% in Group M2 (P = 0.198 versus Group M1), 80% in Group G1, and 96% in Group G2 (P = 0.025 versus Group G1). Our results suggest that dexamethasone enhances the antiemetic efficacy of granisetron but does not potentiate the other antiemetics-droperidol and metoclopramide-in female patients undergoing major gynecological surgery. Implications: We compared the efficacy of dexamethasone plus three different antiemetics-droperidol, metoclopramide, and granisetron-for the prevention of nausea and vomiting after gynecologic surgery.

Although recent immunohistochemical, cell culture, and molecular genetic studies all favor these cancers to be monoclonal in origin, the extent of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity in these tumors with divergent histology has not been reported previously. For this study, we microdissected a total of 172 carcinomatous or sarcomatous foci from 17 gynecological carcinosarcomas and analyzed allelic status with 41 microsatellite markers on chromosomal arms 1p, 1q, 3p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 9p, 10q, 11p, 11q, 13q, 16q, 17p, 17q, 18q, and 22q. With the exception of a single case with microsatellite instability, we found shared allelic losses and retentions among multiple individually dissected foci of each case, strongly supportive of the concept of a monoclonal origin for these neoplasms. In eight of these cases, we also found heterogeneous patterns of allelic loss at limited numbers of chromosomal loci in either the carcinomatous or sarcomatous components of the neoplasms. These heterogeneous patterns of allelic losses were consistent with either genetic progression or genetic diversion occurring during the clonal evolution of these neoplasms. In two cases, we found the specific patterns of genetic progression to be consistent with sarcomatous components of the neoplasms arising from carcinomatous components. We conclude that most of the gynecological carcinosarcomas have a monoclonal origin, and that genetic progression and diversion parallel the development of divergent phenotypes in these tumors. Because phenotypically divergent areas of the tumors share numerous genetic alterations, this divergence most likely occurs relatively late in the evolution of these tumors.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1615408253", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 17 studies that evaluated rates of cervical cancer screening, 13 found obese women significantly less likely than their nonobese counterparts to have had a recent Papanicolaou test, a trend that was stronger in white women when compared to African American women. Eight of the 15 studies examining routine mammography found an inverse association between increasing body weight and recent screening, although findings generally pertained only to women who were white and/or severely obese. Possible barriers to care included embarrassment and perceived weight stigma in the clinical setting, lack of appropriately sized examination equipment, and poor patient-provider communication.Further research is needed to clarify the challenges that obese women face in accessing care and to evaluate strategies such as ensuring the availability of appropriate equipment and supplies, the use of alternative screening methodologies, and more culturally sensitive counseling approaches that may improve screening rates in obese women.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmwh.2009.10.001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977197407", "source": "openalex"}

In this review of applications of IHC to the analysis of gynecologic malignancies, the usefulness of immunohistochemical analysis of neoplasms of the cervix, endometrium, and ovary is summarized. In the uterine cervix, dysplasia is associated with qualitative and quantitative alterations in the expression of the Ki-67 antigen expression, as well as an ability to detect human papillomavirus. Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas display a highly characteristic immunophenotype, with coexpression of cytokeratin and vimentin and demonstration of foci of high molecular weight cytokeratin expression; in addition, IHC analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptor and p53 expression can provide important prognostic information about this tumor. Stromal tumors of the endometrium may display a partial smooth muscle immunophenotype, but novel markers such as CD10 provide new tools for the identification of these tumors. The immunophenotypes of the normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and corresponding tumors display significant overlap with, but important distinctions from, mesothelium, and important new markers such as the Wilms tumor gene product can prove useful in the identification of carcinomas of the OSE. Important prognostic markers for carcinomas of the OSE include the HER-2/neu gene product and p53, alterations of which can both be assessed by IHC techniques. Finally, the recent availability of markers of ovarian stroma, including Melan-A and inhibin-alpha, has provided a means for the positive identification of ovarian stromal tumors, which can manifest protean histological appearances.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004347-200101000-00006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973865817", "source": "openalex"}

It arises from dysregulation of signaling factors responsible for inducing cell proliferation and death and for modulating the microenvironment. In gynecologic cancers, p53 is a pivotal determinant of cisplatin sensitivity, while BCL‐2 family members are associated with taxane sensitivity. Mitochondria fusion and fission dynamics are required for many mitochondrial functions and are also involved in mitochondria‐mediated apoptosis, which is closely associated with chemosensitivity. Mitochondrial dynamics are controlled by a number of intracellular proteins, including fusion (Opa1 and mitofusion 1 and 2) and fission proteins (Drp1 and Fis1), which can be proapoptotic or antiapoptotic, depending on the cell types, status, and stimuli from the microenvironment. This paper describes the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the mechanism of chemoresistance and the evidence supporting a significant contribution of a hyperfusion state to chemoresistance in gynecological cancers. Moreover, we discuss our findings showing that enforced fission induces apoptosis of cancer cells and sensitizes them to chemotherapeutic agents. Understanding the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in chemoresistance may provide insight into new biomarkers that better predict cancer chemosensitivity and may aid the development of effective therapeutic strategies for clinical management of gynecologic cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12883", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1948304460", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Anonymous, self-administered surveys to third-year medical students rotating on the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. Results: Eighty-one of 91 students participated (89% response rate): 33 men, 46 women, 2 declined to reveal their gender. No significant gender differences existed regarding number of interactions with residents and faculty; number of deliveries, surgeries, or examinations performed; perceived quality of teaching; or feeling included as part of the clinical team. Male students were more likely to report performing specific surgical procedures, such as operating the bovie cautery during gynecological surgeries (p = 0.005). More men experienced patients refusing to allow them to participate in the clinical interview (p < 0.0001) and physical examination (p < 0.0001). Male students were also more likely to report feeling that their gender negatively impacted their clerkship experience (p < 0.0001). Although less likely to report preclerkship and postclerkship career interest in obstetrics and gynecology, male students were more likely to report that their interest increased at the end of the clerkship. Conclusions: Male students were more likely to experience gender bias from patients on the obstetrics and gynecology service. Male students also described feeling socially excluded from female-dominated clinical teams. Obstetrics and gynecology educators need to consider methods of encouraging patients to accept medical student participation regardless of gender. Obstetrics and gynecology faculty and residents need to be sensitive to subtle forms of gender bias and ensure equal inclusion for both male and female medical students.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2009.1357", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026797030", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, GATA3 and TTF1 have been reported to be useful immunohistochemical markers for distinguishing mesonephric carcinomas from its morphologic mimics. Herein, we compared the performance of GATA3 and TTF1 to the traditional markers used for mesonephric carcinomas, CD10 and calretinin. We studied 694 cases: 8 mesonephric carcinomas (7 cervical [includes 3 mesonephric carcinosarcomas], 1 vaginal), 5 mesonephric-like carcinomas (4 uterine corpus, 1 ovarian), 585 endometrial adenocarcinomas, and 96 cervical adenocarcinomas. Mesonephric-like carcinomas were defined as tumors exhibiting the classic morphologic features of mesonephric carcinoma, but occurring outside of the cervix and without convincing mesonephric remnants. GATA3 had the highest sensitivity and specificity (91% and 94%) compared with TTF1 (45% and 99%), CD10 (73% and 83%), and calretinin (36% and 89%). GATA3, however, also stained a substantial number of uterine carcinosarcomas (23/113, 20%). TTF1 was positive in 5/5 (100%) mesonephric-like carcinomas and only 1/8 (13%) mesonephric carcinomas. In 4/6 (67%) TTF1 positive cases, GATA3 exhibited an inverse staining pattern with TTF1. In summary, GATA3 was the best overall marker for mesonephric and mesonephric-like carcinomas, but cannot be used to distinguish mesonephric carcinosarcomas from Müllerian carcinosarcomas. The inverse staining pattern between GATA3 and TTF1, suggests that TTF1 may be useful when GATA3 is negative in small biopsies where mesonephric or mesonephric-like carcinoma is suspected. The greater TTF1 positivity in mesonephric-like carcinomas suggests they may be biologically different from prototypical mesonephric carcinomas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pas.0000000000001142", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2888408005", "source": "openalex"}

Strategies for fertility control can also be complex since the efficacy and safety of hormonal contraceptives can be compromised by increased body weight. Obesity can aggravate symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence and increase the risk of endometrial polyps and symptomatic fibroids. Weight reduction enhances reproductive outcomes, diminishes symptoms of urinary incontinence and reduces morbidity following gynecological surgery.

Methods Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the study in 4 different clinical centers. The study included 40 patients with uncertain pelvic adnexal masses, 10 patients with pelvic masses indicative of recurrences of gynecologic tumors, 26 patients with uterine pathologic features, and 13 patients with cervical lesions. Results Application of CnTI technology after the SonoVue injection gave a picture of the intralesional microvascularization dramatically different from that obtained during color Doppler examination. Of the 40 pelvic masses, 15 (37.5%) were considered benign and 25 (62.5%) were considered malignant at B-mode and color Doppler examinations. Contrast-enhanced sonography showed no intralesional contrast perfusion in 11 (73%) of 15 cases, and all these were benign at final diagnosis. Of the 4 (27%) cases that had perfusion, 2 were malignant. Conversely, of the 25 cases with positive findings at color Doppler examination and therefore expected to show the appearance of contrast tissue-filling morphologic characteristics, 13 (52%) were malignant at final diagnosis. For evaluation of uterine pathologic features, the CnTI-SonoVue technology did not appear to be superior to the B-mode and color Doppler examinations; however, for the evaluation of cervical cancer, CnTI-SonoVue technology revealed a better definition of the margins of the neoplastic lesions in 4 (40%) of 10 cases.

It revolutionized surgical practice with well-proven advantages over traditional open surgery: reduced surgical trauma and incision-related complications, such as surgical-site infections, postoperative pain and hernia, reduced hospital stay, and improved cosmetic outcome. Nonetheless, proficiency in MIS can be technically challenging as conventional laparoscopy is associated with several limitations as the two-dimensional (2D) monitor reduction in-depth perception, camera instability, limited range of motion and steep learning curves. The surgeon has a low force feedback which allows simple gestures, respect for tissues and more effective treatment of complications. Since 1980s several computer sciences and robotics projects have been set up to overcome the difficulties encountered with conventional laparoscopy, to augment the surgeon's skills, achieve accuracy and high precision during complex surgery and facilitate widespread of MIS. Surgical instruments are guided by haptic interfaces that replicate and filter hand movements. Robotically assisted technology offers advantages that include improved three- dimensional stereoscopic vision, wristed instruments that improve dexterity, and tremor canceling software that improves surgical precision.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2016.00026", "url": "https://openalex.org/W176519738", "source": "openalex"}

The current review summarizes the major sources of bias and the results of these efforts. METHODS In the current study, a review of the literature was conducted. RESULTS The major sources of bias in measuring the sensitivity of gynecologic cytology are a lack of reproducibility, bias in the review process, bias in case selection, selection and correction of the gold standard, and the value of surrogate markers. Despite these sources of variation, the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is relatively stable, ranging from 50–75% if a single consistent threshold is used, to up to 94% if either Autopap-directed rescreening or thin-layer methods are used to diagnose high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions using a threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Methods for the routine evaluation of sensitivity currently are not available and may be difficult to devise. CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity of the Pap smear in study situations is well known.

Homeostasis of these micronutrients is tightly regulated by multiple compensatory mechanisms that balance their concentrations including transporters, importers, and metallothioneins. An altered intake of only one of these trace elements may cause an imbalance in their levels and result in their competition for absorption. Relatively low levels of zinc and increased levels of copper may result in an increased level of oxidative stress and impair the antioxidant properties of multiple enzymes. Altered levels of trace elements were discovered in various pathologies including immunological, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, due to the role of Zn and Cu in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, they were found to influence cancerogenesis. We review the roles of zinc and copper and their mechanisms in tumor growth, metastasis potential, microenvironment remodeling, and drug resistance.

The laparoscopic or robotic approach is recommended when vaginal surgery is not feasible. Thus far, robotic gynecologic surgery data have demonstrated feasibility, safety, and equivalent clinical outcomes in comparison with laparoscopy and better clinical outcomes compared with laparotomy. Robotics was developed to overcome challenges of laparoscopy and has led to technological advantages such as improved ergonomics, visualization with three-dimensional capabilities, dexterity and range of motion with instrument articulation, and tremor filtration. To date, applications of robotics in benign gynecology include hysterectomy, myomectomy, endometriosis surgery, sacrocolpopexy, adnexal surgery, tubal reanastomosis, and cerclage. Though further data are needed, robotics may provide additional benefits over other approaches in the obese patient population and in higher complexity cases. Challenges that arose in the earlier adoption stage such as the steep learning curve, costs, and operative times are becoming more optimized with greater experience, with implementation of robotics in high-volume centers and with improved training of surgeons and robotic teams. Robotic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, albeit still in its infancy where technical advantages compared with laparoscopic single-site surgery are still unclear, may provide a cost-reducing option compared with multiport robotics. The cost may even approach that of laparoscopy while still conferring similar perioperative outcomes.Advances in robotic technology such as the single-site platform and telesurgery, have the potential to revolutionize the field of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of robotic surgery in benign gynecologic surgery. Conclusions on the benefits and risks of robotic surgery should be made with caution given limited data, especially when compared with other routes. Route of surgery selection should take into consideration the surgeons' skill and comfort level that allows for the highest level of safety and efficiency. Ultimately, the robotic device is an additional minimally invasive surgical tool that can further the goal of minimizing laparotomy in gynecology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000293", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2413337695", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study. The gender of department-based leaders (chair, vice chair, division director) and residency program directors was determined from websites of 950 academic departments of anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Each specialty's representation ratio—proportion of leadership roles held by women in 2013 divided by proportion of residents in 1990 who were women—and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A ratio of 1 indicates proportionate representation. RESULTS: Women were significantly underrepresented among chairs for all specialties (ratios 0.60 or less, P≤.02) and division directors for all specialties except anesthesiology (ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.87–1.46) and diagnostic radiology (ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81–1.16). The representation ratio for vice chair was below 1.0 for all specialties except anesthesiology; this finding reached statistical significance only for pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Women were significantly overrepresented as residency program directors in general surgery, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics (ratios greater than 1.19, P≤.046). Obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics had the highest proportions of residents in 1990 and department leaders in 2013 who were women. CONCLUSION: Despite having the largest proportion of leaders who were women, representation ratios demonstrate obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in progression of women to departmental leadership. Women's overrepresentation as residency program directors raises concern because education-based academic tracks may not lead to major leadership roles. Representation ratios, which allow meaningful comparisons across specialties, demonstrate that obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in the progression of women to departmental leadership roles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001290", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2286701001", "source": "openalex"}

In the current study, we analyzed the clinical and histologic characteristics of patients with GynV and sought to identify features that differentiate the isolated from the systemic forms of the disease. We used pathology databases from our institution and an English-language literature search (PubMed) to identify affected patients with biopsy-proven GynV. Using a standardized format for data gathering and analysis, we recorded clinical manifestations, laboratory and histologic features, and surgical and medical therapies. Patients were analyzed as 2 subsets: IGynV and SGynV. A total of 163 patients with GynV were included (152 from the literature and 11 from the Cleveland Clinic pathology database). The incidence of vasculitis among all gynecologic surgeries in our institution over 16 years was 0.15%. Half of the patients presented with vaginal bleeding. Other less common presentations included the finding of an asymptomatic abdominal mass, uterine prolapse, atypical cervical smear, and pelvic pain. Constitutional and musculoskeletal symptoms were reported in 24% of patients. One hundred fifteen (70.6%) patients had IGynV, and 48 (29.4%) had SGynV. Compared to patients with SGynV, those with IGynV were younger (median age, 51 yr; range, 18-80 yr vs. median, 68 yr; range, 32-83 yr; p = 0.0001) and presented more often with vaginal bleeding (57% vs. 25%; p = 0.0002) and less frequently with asymptomatic pelvic masses (6% vs. 35%; p = 0.0001). IGynV was less often associated with constitutional or musculoskeletal symptoms (7% vs. 74%; p = 0.0001). Patients with IGynV were much less likely to have abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rates (26% vs. 97%; p = 0.0001) and anemia (17% vs. 80%; p = 0.0001) than patients with SGynV. None of the patients with IGynV received corticosteroids, whereas almost all patients with SGynV received corticosteroids and about one-third also received cytotoxic therapy. In IGynV, the site most often involved was the uterus, particularly the cervix, whereas in SGynV lesions were more often multifocal, affecting mainly ovaries, fallopian tubes, and myometrium. Nongranulomatous inflammation occurred in most patients with IGynV, while the predominant histologic pattern noted in SGynV was granulomatous. While vasculitis was the only lesion in 32% of the resected specimens, leiomyomas (18.4%) and endometrial carcinoma (8.3%) were the most frequent concomitant benign and malignant (nonvasculitic) lesions, respectively. Except for benign ovarian abnormalities, which were more frequent in SGynV than in IGynV (21% vs. 4%; p = 0.001), other benign (50%) and malignant (18%) conditions were similarly present in both groups. Among SGynV patients, giant cell arteritis was diagnosed in 29 of the 48 (60.4%) patients, and one-third presented without symptoms of vascular involvement or polymyalgia rheumatica. In summary, GynV is rare and most often occurs as a single-organ disease. It is usually an incidental finding in the course of surgery. The isolated form is associated with the absence of systemic symptoms and normal acute phase reactants, and does not require systemic therapy. Among systemic vasculitides, giant cell arteritis is the most frequently reported form of systemic vasculitis with gynecologic involvement.

Intervention: Recombinant human thrombopoietin was given before chemotherapy and after a second cycle of carboplatin therapy. Measurements: Peripheral blood counts and platelet transfusions. Results: Administration of rhTPO after chemotherapy significantly reduced the degree and duration of thrombocytopenia and enhanced platelet recovery. In patients who received the optimal biological dose of rhTPO (1.2 µg/kg of body weight) in cycle 2 (carboplatin plus rhTPO), the mean platelet count nadir was higher (44 × 109 cells/L and 20 × 109 cells/L; P = 0.002) and the duration of thrombocytopenia was shorter (days with a platelet count <20 × 109 cells/L, 1 and 4 [P = 0.002]; days with a platelet count <50 × 109 cells/L, 4 and 7 [P = 0.006]) than in cycle 1 (carboplatin only).

Therefore, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the safety and efficacy of different pain control regimens. Objective This article aimed to review the literature regarding pain control regimens for procedures such as endometrial biopsy, intrauterine device insertion, colposcopy and loop electrosurgical excisional procedure, uterine aspiration, and hysteroscopy. Evidence Acquisition A search of published literature using PubMed was conducted using the following keywords: \"pain\" or \"anesthesia.\" These terms were paired with the following keywords: \"intrauterine device\" or \"IUD,\" \"endometrial biopsy,\" \"uterine aspiration\" or \"abortion,\" \"colposcopy\" or \"loop electrosurgical excisional procedure\" or \"LEEP,\" \"hysteroscopy\" or \"hysteroscopic sterilization.\" The search was conducted through July 2015. Articles were hand reviewed and selected by the authors for study quality. Meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials were prioritized. Results Although local anesthesia is commonly used for gynecologic procedures, a multimodal approach may be more effective including oral medication, a dedicated emotional support person, and visual or auditory distraction. Women who are nulliparous, are postmenopausal, have a history of dysmenorrhea, or suffer from anxiety are more likely to experience greater pain with gynecologic procedures. Evidence for some interventions exists; however, the interpretation of intervention comparisons is limited by the use of different regimens, pain measurement scales, patient populations, and procedure techniques. Conclusions and Relevance There are many options for pain management for office gynecologic procedures, and depending on the procedure, different modalities may work best. The importance of patient counseling and selection cannot be overstated.

Patients were compared to a reference group of early‐stage patients who had received more limited treatment. Compared to the reference group, extensively‐treated women more frequently utilized both engagement and avoidant strategies including active coping, seeking social support, and mental disengagement. Use of engagement coping strategies such as active coping and seeking social support were not significantly related to quality of life or mood. However, avoidant coping strategies, including disengagement and cognitive avoidance, were strongly associated with poorer well‐being and more distressed mood. Moreover, relationships between coping and quality of life differed between the extensively‐treated patients and patients in the limited treatment reference group. The use of avoidance and seeking instrumental support were associated with poorer outcomes among extensively‐treated patients but not among the limited treatment group. Results of the current study suggest that coping patterns and outcomes may be more pronounced among cancer patients contending with severe disease and extensive treatment and that avoidant coping strategies may be particularly detrimental with respect to these patients' mood and quality of life.

Until recently, clinical management of these cancers has focused almost exclusively on prolonging the survival of patients. A recent literature search using MEDLINE revealed relatively few research studies that reported data on quality of life (QOL) in a gynecologic cancer population. Reports in the literature have been conflicting, with some studies finding deterioration in QOL and some finding stability or improvement in QOL over time. Until recently, the impact of various treatments (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) on QOL in this population was unknown. Recently, the QOL of women with gynecologic cancer has been compared to that of women with other types of cancer. Also, risk factors for poor adjustment in gynecologic cancer are beginning to be investigated. This presentation will attempt to 1) summarize the relevant literature on QOL in a gynecologic cancer population, 2) compare QOL in this population to other types of cancer, 3) examine risk factors for poor adjustment and 4) describe the limitations of the literature and future research directions. Overall, it appears that QOL is most negatively affected from time of diagnosis through completion of treatment. Following treatment, QOL appears to improve over the course of 6–12 months, but then appears to remain stable from that time through two years post-treatment. Compared to breast cancer patients, it appears that gynecologic cancer patients experience poorer QOL on several domains during active treatment, but that after completion of treatment, overall QOL is similar between groups. Risk factors for maladjustment include treatment with radiotherapy or multi-modality treatment, increased length of treatment, younger age, and coping using a disengaged style. Other risk factors include lower education, poor social support and lower levels of religious belief. The significance of these findings and future research directions will be discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7525-1-33", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120273584", "source": "openalex"}

Patient age ranged from 46 to 66 years (median 50 y), and none had a history of a tuberous sclerosis complex. Three cases arose in the uterine corpus, 1 in the vagina, 1 pelvic tumor, and 1 pulmonary tumor that was likely a recurrence/metastasis from a probable uterine primary. Five cases had clear cell epithelioid morphology that showed a spectrum of atypia, while 1 case had a mixture of clear cell epithelioid and spindle cells. A mostly consistent immunophenotype was observed in the clear cell epithelioid cases: each demonstrated diffuse TFE3, HMB45, cathepsinK labeling, either focal or no melanA staining, and variably weak reactivity to smooth muscle markers. The mixed clear cell epithelioid and spindle cell case had a similar expression pattern in its epithelioid component but strong muscle marker positivity in its spindle cell component. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 57 months. Three cases demonstrated aggressive behavior, and 3 cases had no evidence of recurrence. Both GYN-specific and traditional sets of criteria for malignancy were evaluated. The GYN model showed improved inclusion and specificity in comparison to the traditional model.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pas.0000000000000349", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2318044158", "source": "openalex"}

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 161 women, we compared the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of ondansetron (4 mg intravenously [IV]) with droperidol (0.625 mg or 1.25 mg IV) in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after outpatient gynecologic surgery. The incidence of PONV, times to achieving preset recovery criteria, and patient-evaluated visual analog scales for sedation, anxiety, pain, and nausea were recorded, along with postdischarge emetic episodes, medications, quality of sleep, and time to resumption of food intake, normal activity, and return to work. A decision analysis tree was used to divide each data set into nine mutually exclusive subgroups, and costs and probabilities were assigned to each subgroup. The cost-effectiveness ratio was determined by summing these weighted costs and dividing by the number of patients free from both PONV and side effects of antiemetic therapy. The incidence of PONV in the hospital and after discharge, the need for rescue antiemetic therapy, and recovery and discharge times were similar for the ondansetron and both droperidol groups but differed significantly from those for the placebo group. The cost-effectiveness ratios for both droperidol 0.625 mg and 1.25 mg groups were significantly lower than those for the ondansetron and placebo groups. We conclude that droperidol 0.625 mg IV provides antiemetic prophylaxis comparable to that of ondansetron 4 mg IV without increasing side effects or delaying discharge and is more cost-effective.

Experimental Design: Randomized controlled trial (control group [CG] and music therapy group [MTG]) to assess fatigue, quality of life, and symptoms of depression in women undergoing radiotherapy using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue (FACT-F) version 4, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G) version 4, and Beck Depression Inventory in 3 separate times, namely, during the first week of radiotherapy, on the week of the intermediary phase, and during the last week of radiotherapy. Individual 30- to 40-minute sessions of music therapy with the presence of a trained music therapist were offered to participants. Results: In this study, 164 women were randomized and 116 (63 CG and 53 MTG) were included in the analyses, with mean age of 52.90 years (CG) and 51.85 years (MTG).

Gynecological abnormalities are common with cloaca but may remain asymptomatic until puberty or adult life. We evaluate long-term gynecological sequelae in these patients with persistent cloaca. Materials and Methods: The records and radiographs of postpubertal patients (mean age 16.8 years, range 10 to 32) treated for cloacal malformation at 1 institution from 1970 to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome data at puberty were available in 41 patients. Of the patients 24 are currently older than 16 years and outcome data for sexual activity were available in 21 with 3 lost to followup. Results: All 41 patients were evaluated at puberty, and 28 (68%) had uterine function, 13 (32%) were menstruating normally and 15 (36%) presented with hematometra/hematocolpos. All 15 girls with an obstructed uterus required surgery, which included hysterectomy in 2, partial hysterectomy with vaginoplasty in 3 and vaginoplasty in 9. There was 1 complex case of fistula. Etiology of the obstructed uterus was vaginal stenosis after reconstruction in 3 cases, stenosis of persistent urogenital sinus (no previous reconstruction) in 11 and cervical stenosis in 1. Ten patients experienced primary amenorrhoea, which was confirmed in 8 (20%) while 2 (5%) continue to be followed for possible cryptic obstruction. In 10 girls the diagnosis of absent/vestigial uterus was made at early laparotomy but this was erroneous in 6 in whom uterine function developed at puberty. Of the 21 older girls (age at review 17 to 32 years, mean 24) 12 are or have been sexually active and 6 have been examined by a gynecologist and have an adequate vagina but are not sexually active. To date 4 patients have required revision vaginal surgery in adulthood to facilitate intercourse (re-do vaginoplasty in 3, introitoplasty in 1). One woman has postponed vaginal reconstructive procedures and 2 others are currently being followed. There have been no pregnancies in this series to date. Conclusions: Patients born with persistent cloaca have a high incidence of gynecological problems at the onset of menses and in early adult life. Therefore, it is necessary to reassess these girls at early puberty by ultrasound/magnetic resonance imaging and vaginoscopy. Additional surgery may then be necessary to create a vagina for menstruation and sexual intercourse. References 1 : Cloaca, the most severe degree of imperforate anus. Ann Surg1998; 228: 331.

Although their morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular profiles have been recently defined, little is known about their clinical behavior. Small studies have demonstrated inconsistent findings and no large studies have examined the clinical behavior of these adenocarcinomas. In this multi-institutional study, representing the largest and most stringently defined cohort of cases to date, we examined the clinicopathologic features of 99 MAs and MLAs (30 MAs of the uterine cervix, 44 MLAs of the endometrium, and 25 MLAs of the ovary). Only tumors with characteristic mesonephric morphology and either immunohistochemical or molecular support were included. Our results demonstrate that the majority of mesonephric neoplasms presented at an advanced stage (II to IV) (15/25 [60%] MA of the cervix, 25/43 [58%] MLA of the endometrium, and 7/18 [39%] MLA of the ovary). The majority (46/89 [52%] overall, 12/24 [50%] MA of the cervix, 24/41 [59%] MLA of the endometrium, and 10/24 [42%] MLA of the ovary) developed recurrences, most commonly distant (9/12 [75%] MA of the cervix, 22/24 [92%] MLA of the endometrium, and 5/9 [56%] MLA of the ovary). The 5-year disease-specific survival was 74% (n=26) for MA of cervix, 72% (n=43) for MLA of endometrium, and 71% (n=23) for MLA of ovary.

Our study objective was to investigate analgesic efficacy in an ambulatory day surgical population experiencing acute visceral pain. The null hypothesis was that there was no significant difference in pain relief between pregabalin and placebo. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 90 women having minor gynecological surgery involving the uterus. Patients received either oral pregabalin 100 mg (Group PG) or placebo (Group C) approximately 1 h before surgery. The primary outcome was pain score in the recovery unit and patients were followed for 24 h. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups for pain experienced in the recovery room (median, interquartile range 16, 0–36 vs 10, 6.5–36 for Groups PG and C, respectively, P = 0.80) or thereafter; nor for recovery room fentanyl requirement (42% Group PG versus 27% Group C, P = 0.12) or the quality of recovery at 24 h postoperatively (median, interquartile range score 17, 17–18 Group PG versus 18, 16.5–18 Group C, P = 0.75). The incidence of posthospital discharge light-headedness, visual disturbance, and difficulty with walking was significantly higher in the pregabalin group. CONCLUSIONS: A single preoperative dose of 100 mg pregabalin does not reduce acute pain or improve recovery after minor surgery involving only the uterus. IMPLICATIONS: An oral dose of pregabalin 100 mg given before minor gynecologic ambulatory surgery involving only the uterus did not reduce postoperative pain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/01.ane.0000286227.13306.d7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016051319", "source": "openalex"}

Since the clinical stage frequently underestimated the surgical stage, models that designate the relative risk associated with each of the variables were created for both clinical and surgical Stage I and 11 patients.We confirmed the importance of age, depth of myometrial invasion, and to a lesser degree, histologic grade, and cell type, as independent prognostic variables.The relative risk of death can be determined using a simple multiplicative calculation, and the absolute risk can be estimated by inspection of the accompanying figures.

METHODS: Three groups of 10 doctors with different levels of ultrasound experience in obstetrics and gynecology were included. The novices had less than 1 month of experience, the intermediate group had 12-60 months of experience and the senior participants were all consultants. Fifteen participants performed transabdominal fetal biometry and the other 15 participants performed systematic transvaginal gynecological ultrasound scans. All scans were video-recorded and assessed by two blinded consultants using the OSAUS scale. The OSAUS scores were compared between the groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and pass/fail scores were determined using the contrasting-groups method of standard setting. RESULTS: For the transabdominal fetal biometry examinations, the mean ± SD OSAUS scores of the novices, intermediates and senior participants were 1.5 ± 0.4, 3.3 ± 0.6 and 4.4 ± 0.4, respectively (P = 0.003).

METHODS: All patients who underwent gynecologic oncology surgery from June 2001 to June 2003 and received venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with only intermittent pneumatic compression and early ambulation were identified from our database. Patients were grouped by procedure (major/minor abdominal or nonabdominal surgery), diagnosis (malignant/nonmalignant), and cancer subtype. Groups were compared by χ2 analysis and logistic regression. Survival was studied with the Kaplan-Meier method and Mantel-Byar test. RESULTS: A total of 1,373 surgical patients were identified over the 2-year period, including 839 major abdominal surgery cases and 534 minor abdominal surgery or nonabdominal surgery cases. Of the 839 patients, 507 had a diagnosis of cancer, and 332 were benign. The incidence of pulmonary embolism among cancer patients undergoing major abdominal surgery was 4.1% (21/507) compared with 0.3% (1/332) among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery with benign findings (P < .001, odds ratio [OR] 13.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–102.1). The incidence of pulmonary embolism among patients undergoing minor/nonabdominal surgery was 0.4% (2/536).

However, concerning the adverse effects of NSAIDs and COXibs, it is still urgent and necessary to explore novel and specific anti-inflammation targets for potential chemoprevention. The signaling of cyclooxygenase 2-prostaglandin E 2 -prostaglandin E 2 receptors (COX-2-PGE 2 -EPs) is the central inflammatory pathway involved in the gynecological carcinogenesis. Methods Literature searches were performed to the function of COX-2-PGE 2 -EPs in gynecological malignancies. Results This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of COX-2-PGE 2 -EPs signaling in endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. Many studies demonstrated the upregulated expression of the whole signaling pathway in gynecological malignancies and some focused on the function of COX-2 and cAMP-linked EP2/EP4 and EP3 signaling pathway in gynecological cancer. By contrast, roles of EP1 and the exact pathological mechanisms have not been completely clarified. The studies concerning EP receptors in gynecological cancers highlight the potential advantage of combining COX enzyme inhibitors with EP receptor antagonists as therapeutic agents in gynecological cancers.

For celomic epithelial carcinomas of the ovary, a large number of cytotoxic agents have been shown to be active. Dramatic improvement in frequency of response with lesser improvement in survival has been noted with the use of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy as compared to single alkylating agents. More recent studies have evaluated alternative ways to employ cisplatin: higher dose schedules, intraperitoneal administration, and platinum compounds with a potentially better therapeutic index. None has yet been shown superior to a combination of relatively low-dose cisplatin plus an alkylating agent with or without doxorubicin. Cisplatin remains the best studied and most active single agent in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. While a number of other agents have demonstrated moderate activity, no combination of drugs has as yet proved superior to single-agent cisplatin. In endometrial carcinoma, progestins and doxorubicin are the most active agents. Tamoxifen, cisplatin, and hexamethylmelamine appear to have moderate activity. No combination has yet been shown to be superior to single agents. Information on chemotherapy for less common gynecologic malignancies is largely anecdotal. Two observations are of note. Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is highly active against germ-cell neoplasms of the ovary.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2722685099", "title": "FIGO's updated recommendations for misoprostol used alone in gynecology and obstetrics", "text": "In 2012, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) produced a chart detailing recommended dosages of misoprostol when used alone, for a variety of gynecologic and obstetric indications. In light of new evidence1-13 and through expert deliberation, this chart has now been revised and expanded (Fig. 1). Some areas were particularly challenging to develop given the limited, low-quality, or inconsistent evidence. The present commentary is intended to explain some of the changes and decisions made. The layout is now categorized vertically by gestation and horizontally by indication. Gestation is labelled and referred to as the number of weeks of gestation (<13 weeks, 13–26 weeks, and >26 weeks), with the final column being for postpartum use. However, in the case of incomplete abortion under 13 weeks, and inevitable abortion between 13–26 weeks, women should be treated on the basis of their uterine size rather than last menstrual period dating. Recommendations have been added for inevitable abortion and cervical preparation between 13 and 26 weeks, and for termination of pregnancy at more than 26 weeks. For less than 13 weeks' gestation, we decided to recommend a fixed number of doses without specifying a maximum. This is because many early pregnancy regimens will be used on an outpatient basis, so it is useful for healthcare providers to know in advance how many doses to give the client; there is also sufficient evidence to support a fixed number of doses for use in pregnancies of less than 13 weeks' gestation, as well as evidence that it is safe to give further doses if they are required.1-4, 14 For 13–26 weeks' gestation, the notion of a maximum number of doses has been extrapolated from clinical research in which maximum doses are commonly noted not on the basis of patient safety issues or efficacy,9 but rather as tangible endpoints. In clinical practice, however, they might not have great utility, and dosing should continue until expulsion, in the absence of rare complications. Suggesting that providers should discontinue dosing could actually increase risks, particularly when providers have few alternatives available if expulsion has not yet occurred. Some unpublished studies and clinical experience have shown that complete expulsion can be safely achieved by continuing the regimen up to 72 hours, without compromising the woman's safety.9 Given recently published evidence,2-9 we have added alternative routes for taking misoprostol; in most cases, this has meant the addition of the buccal route, in which the tablets are placed in the cheek for 30 minutes after which any remnants are swallowed. This route has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to the vaginal route. Further ongoing studies are indicating this to be a promising route for other indications on the chart, but these indications have not been included because data on efficacy have not been reported. Future studies will continue to provide evidence on what might be a variety of effective regimens and routes of administration. Although this could result in several available options for providers, it will also enable women's preferences to be taken into consideration. Women's preferences can vary, with some preferring the vaginal route (if inserting the pills themselves) and some preferring non-vaginal routes. However, the vaginal route should be avoided when there is bleeding and/or signs of infection. The chart does not include the rectal route. We recommend against using this route because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. The use of misoprostol at 13–26 weeks' gestation in women with previous cesarean or transmural uterine scar was debated because of concerns about an increased risk of uterine rupture. For fetal death, a Cochrane meta-analysis15 reported mixed findings, concluding that the data were insufficient to assess the occurrence of uterine rupture. A few studies have reported no increased likelihood of rupture,16 but often women with prior cesarean or uterine surgery are excluded from studies or reviews, or trials are insufficiently powered to detect a difference in safety outcomes as a result of the rarity of major adverse events. There is some evidence that, for terminations in this period, the risk of uterine rupture among women with a prior cesarean delivery using misoprostol is less than 0.3%1, 17; other studies9, 18-20 concluded that there are no significant differences in outcomes for women with previous cesarean(s). We therefore concluded that misoprostol can be used for women with previous cesarean or other transmural uterine scar throughout 13–26 weeks. There is insufficient evidence available to recommend a regimen of misoprostol for use at more than 26 weeks' gestation in women who have had a previous cesarean or transmural uterine scar. Therefore, without evidence to support a safe regimen, we do not provide one, other than to recommend following local protocol in these cases. Although there is some evidence to support a decreasing dose with increasing gestational age, there is little evidence to support the advice given in some international and national clinical guidelines to use lower doses of misoprostol in cases of fetal death. Irrespective of the issue of recommendations for different doses, various reviews15, 20, 21 have concluded that there is insufficient evidence overall of superiority of one dose or schedule of misoprostol over another for use in pregnancies at or over 13 weeks' gestation. In making recommendations, we acknowledged that providers might be keen to identify lowest possible doses because of reduced adverse effects,21 but that it was also important to consider success rates and time to delivery: low doses have been shown to be associated with a longer induction-to-delivery interval and lower overall effectiveness,15, 21 and evidence has supported the safety of the \"higher\" doses for women.7-9 Recommendations in the chart were compiled with this in mind, while also acknowledging that it is possible that a range of dosages could be effective and safe. There have been two studies of the use of misoprostol for the treatment of retained placenta following live birth, neither of which show any benefit over placebo.22 We therefore do not recommend misoprostol for retained placenta in late pregnancy. Secondary prevention is a community-based strategy that has been shown to be a comparable alternative to a universal prophylaxis approach in two large community trials (one in press).12 Rather than medicating all women during the third stage of labor with a prophylactic dose, a regimen of 800 μg sublingual misoprostol (the same as for treatment) can be used to treat only women with higher-than-average bleeding (e.g. approximately 350 mL or more). Although there is limited published data, it was agreed that secondary prevention of PPH is a strong alternative approach to universal prophylaxis, because it involves medicating far fewer women (5%–10% vs 100%), thus causing fewer adverse effects and reducing costs. The FIGO Misoprostol-only Recommended Regimens 2017 chart (Fig. 1) is the result of extensive collaboration among an international expert group. It has been endorsed by the FIGO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion Working Group and the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee, and approved by the FIGO Officers. Available in other languages and formats from http://figo.org, it is hoped that it will be as widely distributed and used as the previous version. Although these recommended dosages have been decided on the basis of current evidence available and expert opinion, new evidence is regularly emerging and thus there is a need to review and revise these recommendations in the future. Misoprostol is an important medicine and, although it should not be used in preference over oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage, or instead of mifepristone plus misoprostol for pregnancy termination, it could be the only medicine available in some circumstances, which is why FIGO believes this \"misoprostol-only\" chart is needed. Misoprostol must continue to be highlighted as an essential medicine and included in international documents, national guidelines, and essential medicines lists. Further, we must work to ensure the availability of high-quality misoprostol, and the establishment of policy and programs that support its availability and use. The recent WHO guidelines on health worker roles in providing safe abortion care23 outline a wide variety of healthcare providers who can manage medical abortion and postabortion care in the first trimester, with auxiliary nurses, nurses, and midwives listed, as well as lay health workers and doctors of complementary systems for some subtasks. Women can also fulfill some of the components of assessment and management themselves outside of a healthcare facility. It is anticipated that this misoprostol chart can be used by all healthcare providers identified in the WHO publication and that by implementing both, we will come closer to achieving optimal care for the women we aim to serve.

METHODS: Using data from National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program from 1973 through 2007, 189,206 cases with either in situ or invasive cervical, vulvar, or vaginal neoplasm were followed for 138,553,519 person-years for the development of subsequent primary anal cancer. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated from the observed number of subsequent anal cancers compared with those expected based on age-, race-, and calendar year–specific rates in the nonaffected population. RESULTS: Anal cancer developed in 255 women with a history of in situ or invasive gynecologic neoplasm, aggregate standardized incidence ratio of 13.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.9–15.3), indicating a 13-fold increase in anal cancer compared with expected. The standardized incidence ratio for anal cancer incidence among women with in situ vulvar cancer was 22.2 (95% CI 16.7–28.4) and was 17.4 (95% CI 11.5–24.4) for those with invasive vulvar cancer. The standardized incidence ratio for anal cancer incidence in women with in situ cervical cancer was 16.4 (95% CI 13.7–19.2) and was 6.2 (95% CI 4.1–8.7) for women with invasive cervical cancer. The standardized incidence ratio for anal cancer incidence among women with in situ vaginal cancer was 7.6 (95% CI 2.4–15.6) and was 1.8 (95% CI 0.2–5.3) for invasive vaginal cancer. CONCLUSION: Women with human papillomavirus–related gynecologic neoplasm are at higher risk for developing anal cancer compared with the general population. This high-risk population may benefit from close observation and screening for anal cancer.

Elevated levels of serum PRL in ovarian and endometrial cancers have been reported, indicating a potential role for PRL in endometrial and ovarian carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that serum PRL levels are significantly elevated in women with a strong family history of ovarian cancer. We show dramatically increased expression of PRL receptor in ovarian and endometrial tumors as well as in endometrial hyperplasia, signifying the importance of PRL signaling in malignant and premalignant conditions. PRL mRNA was expressed in ovarian and endometrial tumors, indicating the presence of an autocrine loop. PRL potently induced proliferation in several ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines. Binding of PRL to its receptor was followed by rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, CREB, ATF-2, and p53 and activation of 37 transcription factors in ovarian and endometrial carcinoma cells. PRL also activated Ras oncogene in these cells. When human immortalized normal ovarian epithelial cells were chronically exposed to PRL, a malignant transformation occurred manifested by the acquired ability of transformed cells to form clones, grow in soft agar, and form tumors in severe combined immunodeficient-beige mice. Transformation efficiency was diminished by a Ras inhibitor, providing proof that PRL-induced transformation uses the Ras pathway. In summary, we present findings that indicate an important role for PRL in ovarian and endometrial tumorigenesis.

ADM was also active and gave clinically worthwhile responses against squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and vagina. Occasional objective remissions were seen in patients with epithelial ovarian adenocarcinomas. The combination of ADM plus BLEO appeared to show no enhancement of the effect achieved by ADM alone. There were no objective responses in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with BLEO alone. The usual toxic manifestations of ADM and BLEO were observed, and there appeared to be no potentiation of the toxicity of each agent when used in combination.

All major complications after surgery were recorded. Major operative complications were defined as bowel, bladder, ureter, or vascular injuries or significant abdominal wall or other internal bleeding. Categorical analysis was used to compare differences in the rates of operative complications, conversions to laparotomy, and postoperative admissions after laparoscopy. We also estimated the influence of medical history and specific laparoscopic procedures on the risk of adverse complications after surgery.Operative complications and conversion to laparotomy occurred in 1.9% and 4.7% of laparoscopic procedures, respectively. Complications included four bowel, two bladder, one ureteral, two vascular, and five abdominal wall injuries. There were 165 patients (19.6%) admitted postoperatively. Aside from the type of operative procedure, increasing age was the most important predictor of complications. Relative to all other operative procedures, women treated for endometriosis or ovarian cystectomy had generally low rates of operative complications, conversions to laparotomy, and postoperative admissions. In contrast, 12.5% of women undergoing laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy experienced operative injuries or abdominal bleeding and 90% were hospitalized postoperatively.Serious operative complications after gynecologic laparoscopy were rare in this patient population. The more complex laparoscopic procedures resulted in proportionately greater rates of operative complications, conversions to laparotomy, and postoperative admissions to the hospital.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(98)00209-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064786408", "source": "openalex"}

Among several regulators of metabolic alterations, fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP) is a critical glycolytic regulator. Inhibition of the active form of PFKFB3 ser461 using a novel inhibitor, PFK158 resulted in reduced glucose uptake, ATP production, lactate release as well as induction of apoptosis in gynecologic cancer cells. Moreover, we found that PFK158 synergizes with carboplatin (CBPt) and paclitaxel (PTX) in the chemoresistant cell lines, C13 and HeyA8MDR but not in their chemosensitive counterparts, OV2008 and HeyA8, respectively. We determined that PFK158‐induced autophagic flux leads to lipophagy resulting in the downregulation of cPLA2, a lipid droplet (LD) associated protein. Immunofluorescence and co‐immunoprecipitation revealed colocalization of p62/SQSTM1 with cPLA2 in HeyA8MDR cells uncovering a novel pathway for the breakdown of LDs promoted by PFK158. Interestingly, treating the cells with the autophagic inhibitor bafilomycin A reversed the PFK158‐mediated synergy and lipophagy in chemoresistant cells. Finally, in a highly metastatic PTX‐resistant in vivo ovarian mouse model, a combination of PFK158 with CBPt significantly reduced tumor weight and ascites and reduced LDs in tumor tissue as seen by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy compared to untreated mice. Since the majority of cancer patients will eventually recur and develop chemoresistance, our results suggest that PFK158 in combination with standard chemotherapy may have a direct clinical role in the treatment of recurrent cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.31868", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2891973735", "source": "openalex"}

Increasing evidence suggests that vitamin D and its receptor play a crucial role in the development of gynecological cancers. In this review, we systematically analyzed the effect of vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor on endometrial, ovarian, cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer. Our literature research shows that vitamin D levels and vitamin-D-related pathways affect the risk of gynecological cancers. Numerous ecological studies give evidence on the inverse relationship between UVB exposure and gynecological cancer risk. However, epidemiologic research is still inconclusive for endometrial and ovarian cancer and insufficient for rarer types of gynecological cancers. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is upregulated in all gynecological cancers, indicating its influence on cancer etiology. The VDR polymorphism FokI (rs2228570) seems to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Other nuclear receptors, such as the RXR, also influence gynecological cancers. Although there is limited knowledge on the role of the VDR/RXR on the survival of endometrial, cervical, vulvar or vaginal cancer patients, some studies showed that both receptors influence survival. Therefore, we suggest that further studies should focus on the vitamin D- and its hetero dimer receptor RXR in gynecological cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18112328", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2765785177", "source": "openalex"}

FDG fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT has been widely adopted for staging assessments in patients with suspected advanced disease, in cases of suspected disease recurrence, and for determining prognosis in a number of malignancies. A number of pitfalls are commonly encountered when reviewing FDG fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scans in gynecologic and genitourinary cases; these pitfalls can be classified into those that yield potential false-positive or false-negative results. Potential false positives include physiologic uptake of FDG fluorodeoxyglucose by the endometrium and ovaries in premenopausal patients, physiologic renal excretion of FDG fluorodeoxyglucose into the ureters and the urinary bladder, and increased FDG fluorodeoxyglucose activity in benign conditions such as uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, and benign endometriotic cysts. Potential false negatives include low-level FDG fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by necrotic, mucinous, cystic, or low-grade tumors and the masking of serosal and peritoneal disease by adjacent physiologic bowel or bladder activity. In addition, there are inherent technical limitations—such as motion artifact (from respiratory motion and bowel peristalsis) and the limited spatial resolution of PET—that may limit the assessment of small-volume malignant disease. Knowledge of the key imaging features of physiologic and nonphysiologic FDG fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, in addition to understanding the principles of adequate patient preparation and PET scanning protocols, is important for accurate interpretation of gynecologic and genitourinary oncologic FDG fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT studies. ©RSNA, 2017", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2017160059", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2596957190", "source": "openalex"}

Imaging of the female pelvis following chemotherapy and radiation therapy is particularly challenging due to alteration of the normal anatomy and loss of tissue planes. Expected changes in appearance occur following chemotherapy-radiation therapy, as do complications such as fistulas, proctitis, enteritis, typhlitis, cystitis, and insufficiency fractures.

We conducted a case–control study in Italy, including 454 women with endometrial cancer and 908 hospital controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. Endometrial cancer risk was inversely associated with age at menarche (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5–1.0, for ≥14 vs. <12 years), and directly associated with age at menopause (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1–2.7, for ≥55 vs. <50 years) and years of menstruation (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.7–3.4, for highest vs. lowest tertile). Multiparity strongly reduced the risk among women under 60 years of age (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2–0.6, for ≥3 deliveries vs. <2). Oral contraceptive use conferred a 40% reduced risk (95% CI = 0.4–1.0), irrespective of time since cessation.

No significant associations with endometrial cancer risk emerged for age at first/last birth, breastfeeding, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, and history of uterine fibromyomas or polycystic ovary.

The purpose of this report is to comprehensively evaluate the patient-reported outcomes associated with IP versus IV therapy.

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI; which includes physical, functional, and ovarian subscales) and neurotoxicity (Ntx) and abdominal discomfort (AD) subscales were used to assess patient-reported outcomes. Assessments were completed before random assignment, before cycle 4, and 3 to 6 weeks and 12 months after treatment. Results Physical and functional well-being and ovarian cancer symptoms were significantly worse in the IP arm before cycle 4 (P &lt; .001) and 3 to 6 weeks after treatment (P = .001 for FACT-TOI).

Expression and function of HLA-E in normal tissues and solid tumors is not fully understood. We investigated HLA-E protein expression on tissue sections of 420 ovarian and cervical cancers and found equal or higher levels than normal counterpart epithelia in 80% of the tumors. Expression was strongly associated with components of the antigen presentation pathway, e.g., transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptide (ERAP), β2 microglobulin (β2m), HLA classes I and II, and for ovarian cancer with tumor infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTLs). This association argues against the idea that HLA-E would compensate for the loss of classical HLA in tumors. In situ detection of HLA-E interacting receptors revealed a very low infiltrate of natural killer (NK) cells, but up to 50% of intraepithelial CTLs expressed the inhibiting CD94/NKG2A receptor. In cervical cancer, HLA-E expression did not alter the prognostic effect of CTLs, most likely due to very high infiltrating CTL numbers in this virus-induced tumor. Overall survival of ovarian cancer patients, however, was strongly influenced by HLA-E, because the beneficial effect of high CTL infiltration was completely neutralized in the subpopulation with strong HLA-E expression. Interestingly, these results indicate that CTL infiltration in ovarian cancer is associated with better survival only when HLA-E expression is low and that intratumoral CTLs are inhibited by CD94/NKG2A receptors on CTLs in the tumor microenvironment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1100354108", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030307609", "source": "openalex"}

Its significance has been the subject of debate for decades, and it has been reported that the prognosis of adenoacanthoma (AA) is better than, the same as, and worse than that of AC. Part of this confusion has resulted from semantic differences relating to the use of AA and adenosquamous carcinoma (AS). To investigate the prognostic importance of squamous differentiation in endometrial carcinomas and compare the prognostic utility of two classification systems, 456 women were studied who had typical AC and 175 women who had typical AC containing areas of squamous differentiation (AC + SQ) and who had been entered in a Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol of Stage I and II endometrial adenocarcinoma. Assessment of histologic grade and depth of invasion was done both by the pathologist at the member institution and at a second highly structured review. Differentiation of the squamous component of endometrial carcinomas was found to parallel that of the glandular component in most tumors. The biologic behavior of endometrial carcinomas with squamous elements was similar, but not identical, to that of typical AC. Although the frequency of nodal metastasis was similar for both AC and AC + SQ, the presence of squamous elements was associated with an increased probability of survival. Division of AC + SQ by depth of myometrial invasion and by architectural grade of the glandular component provided useful prognostic information that was superior to that resulting simply from division of AC + SQ into AA or AS. The authors recommend that these terms be replaced by \"adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation\" and that the pathologist provide information on the architectural grade and depth of myometrial invasion to guide the gynecologist in determining appropriate therapy.

Beginning in 1983, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a prospective clinicopathologic study of primary malignant melanoma of the vulva. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationship of histopathologic parameters and microstaging to the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging and prognosis. Methods. All patients with primary untreated malignant melanoma of the vulva and no history of previous or subsequent other primary invasive malignancy were eligible for study entry. All patients were required to have modified radical hemivulvectomy as minimal therapy. Groin dissection was optional. Histopathologic specimens were reviewed for capillary space involvement, Clark's level, Breslow's depth of invasion, cell type, and melanin distribution. Patient characteristics were analyzed in their relationship to groin node status and recurrence-free interval. Results. Between 1983 and 1990, 81 patients were entered in the study. Of these, 71 were evaluable. Thirty-four patients underwent radical hemivulvectomy, and 37 patients underwent radical vulvectomy. In addition, 56 patients underwent groin node dissection. The factors that were independently correlated with groin node status were: capillary lymphatic space involvement (P = 0.0001) and central primary tumor location (i.e., bilateral/clitoral/T3) (P = 0.003). The other factors that were significant—clinical tumor size, vulvar staging (FIGO), GOG performance status, and Breslow's depth of invasion—were not independent predictors of positive nodes. The factor with the highest significant correlation with recurrence-free interval was the 1992 staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for malignant melanoma of the skin. Using multiple regression, AJCC stage was the only independent prognostic factor. In the absence of AJCC stage, Breslow's depth of invasion was the most prognostic. Conclusions.

We evaluated the frequency of financial toxicity at different COST levels and stratified risk factors and associations with cost-coping strategies by financial toxicity severity. Methods We analyzed previously collected survey data of gynecologic oncology patients from two tertiary care institutions. Both surveys included the COST tool and questions assessing economic and behavioral cost-coping strategies. We adapted a proposed grading scale to define three groups: no/mild, moderate, and severe financial toxicity and used χ 2 , Fisher’s exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare groups. We used Poisson regression to calculate crude and adjusted risk ratios for cost-coping strategies, comparing patients with moderate or severe to no/mild financial toxicity. Results Among 308 patients, 14.9% had severe, 32.1% had moderate, and 52.9% had no/mild financial toxicity. Younger age, non-white race, lower education, unemployment, lower income, use of systemic therapy, and shorter time since diagnosis were associated with worse financial toxicity (all p&lt;0.05).

Methods and Materials: Ninety-five patients with cervical carcinoma and PAN metastases were entered and 86 were evaluable: Stage I—14, Stage II—40, Stage III—27, Stage IVA—5. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were followed for 5 or more years or died. ERT doses were 4500 cGy (PAN), 3960 cGy to the pelvis (Stages IB/IIB), and 4860 cGy to the pelvis (Stages IIIB/IVA). Point A intracavitary (IC) doses were 4000 cGy (Stages IB/IIB), and 3000 cGy (Stages IIIB/IVA). Point B doses were raised to 6000 cGy (ERT + IC) with parametrial boost. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU 1000 mg/m2/day for 96 hours and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 in weeks 1 and 5. Results: Eighty-five of 86 patients completed radiation therapy and 90% of patients completed both courses of chemotherapy.

Conclusions: Extended field radiation therapy with 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy was feasible in a multicenter clinical trial.

Cancers of the ovary and uterus have well-defined, familiar natural histories. Pathways of spread are clear and reasons for treatment failure are often blatantly obvious. In the case of ovarian cancer, regional treatment with surgery and radiotherapy has been relatively ineffective and generally has not improved the survival statistics in the last two decades. Spread of tumor cells widely throughout the abdominal cavity outside radiation or surgical fields, even in patients with apparently early disease, is the obvious reason. Studies are underway to assess the impact of long-term postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with L-phenylalanine mustard, an alkylating agent effective in patients with advanced disease, in early stages of ovarian cancer following surgery and or x-irradiation. The search is on for more effective drugs, or combinations of drugs, that could subsequently serve as more effective adjuvant treatments. In carcinoma of the uterine cervix, chemotherapy as an adjunct to surgery and/or radiotherapy in patients with localized, or locally inoperable disease has been poorly evaluated; little data are available and the value of many established drugs in patients with metastatic cervical cancer is undermined. Some recent evidence suggests the use of hydroxyurea, a drug that by itself is not effective in controlling tumor, may enhance the effect of radiotherapy in patients with Stage II disease. Uterine fundal cancer is often successfully treated by surgery alone. The data for the use of pre- or postoperative radiotherapy are open to considerable question. While the relative nontoxic progesterone compounds are effective in a small but significant fraction of patients with advanced uterine cancer, no properly designed clinical trial has truly evaluated their role as postoperative adjuncts in patients who have resectable tumor but a definite high risk of recurrence. Systemic chemotherapy has been rarely used with any consistency against this tumor but, even so, some chemotherapeutic leads, such as the use of adriamycin, are worthy of exploration. The absence of useful information on systemic treatment of gynecologic malignancies can be traced to the excessive rigid compartmentalization of medical practice. Only recently have investigators of all persuasions begun to explore and exploit some of the therapeutic opportunities, which have been available for some time.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(197607)38:1<509::aid-cncr2820380175>3.0.co;2-a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049902445", "source": "openalex"}

This prospective randomized study was performed to compare the emetic sequelae and quality of recovery between a group of patients anesthetized with propofol alone and a group anesthetized with propofol plus nitrous oxide. Seventy patients, ASA grade I or II, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy under general anesthesia were included. Most factors which could influence the incidence of postoperative emesis were controlled. The overall incidence of emetic sequelae during the first 24 h postoperatively was 25% in the group anesthetized with propofol alone versus 29% for the group anesthetized with propofol and nitrous oxide. The incidence of emetic sequelae requiring therapeutic intervention was 13% and 6%, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. The group of patients who received propofol alone required an average propofol dose of 221.5 ± 71.9 μg·kg−1.min−1 to maintain anesthesia compared with 162.5 ± 43.9 μg·kg−1.min−1 for the group receiving propofol plus nitrous oxide (P < 0.001). The time from discontinuation of propofol to eye-opening and orientation was significantly longer in patients anesthetized with propofol alone. Otherwise, the recovery variables were comparable between the two groups. We conclude that supplementing propofol with nitrous oxide in patients undergoing ambulatory laparoscopy reduces the requirements of propofol, expedites immediate recovery (emergence), and does not increase the incidence of postoperative emesis. This tends to confirm that there is no clinical advantage to omitting nitrous oxide.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/00000539-199405000-00002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036292364", "source": "openalex"}

The prognostic significance of this test, however, has been questioned.Stressing histologic correlation and pitfalls in interpretation, we previously reported that the sensitivity of intraoperative peritoneal washing cytology was lower than was suggested earlier. This study evaluates the clinical utility of this test in the long-term follow-up of our patients.Staging (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO], 1971) and follow-up information was available for 355 unselected patients with primary tumors who had peritoneal washings performed during initial surgery at University Hospital-Stony Brook, NY, during the period from 1980 through 1989. There were 135 patients with endometrial carcinomas, 112 with ovarian carcinomas, 92 with cervical carcinomas, and 16 with borderline (i.e., of low malignant potential) ovarian tumors. The median follow-up of the patients was 57 months (range, 0-154 months). Follow-up data were obtained from the Tumor Registry at University Hospital-Stony Brook. Survival differences were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and were evaluated by two-tailed logrank test. RESULTS. Peritoneal washing cytology was positive at initial surgery for 120 (33.8%) of 355 patients, including 90 (80.4%) of 112 patients with ovarian carcinomas, five (31.2%) of 16 patients with borderline ovarian tumors, 17 (12.6%) of 135 patients with endometrial carcinomas, and eight (8.7%) of 92 patients with cervical cancers. For 203 patients with stage I tumors, the peritoneal cytology was positive in 29.4% of the patients with ovarian carcinomas, 18.2% with borderline ovarian tumors, 6.1% with endometrial carcinomas, and 5.2% with cervical carcinomas. By use of peritoneal histology as the standard, peritoneal cytology was highly specific (98.1%) but less sensitive (82.9%) in detecting intraperitoneal involvement. For patients with stage I tumors, 80.0% with ovarian carcinomas, 83.3% with endometrial carcinomas, and 100% with cervical carcinomas who showed positive cytology died of their cancer, compared with 25.0% with ovarian carcinomas, 13.0% with endometrial carcinomas, and 21.9% with cervical carcinomas who showed negative peritoneal cytology. Four (2.0%) patients with stage I tumors had positive peritoneal cytology but negative peritoneal histology. Of these patients, three (two with ovarian carcinoma and one with cervical carcinoma) died of their cancer, whereas one patient with a borderline ovarian tumor was free of disease at the last follow-up. Survival analysis indicated that peritoneal washing cytology stratified for stage provides better prognostic information for each primary cancer site studied than does stage alone. All patients with borderline ovarian tumors were alive at last follow-up, regardless of disease stage or peritoneal status.Regardless of FIGO stage, positive peritoneal washing cytology predicted poor prognosis for women with epithelial tumors of the genital tract, except for patients with borderline ovarian tumors. Patients in whom peritoneal cytology was the only evidence of intraperitoneal spread were few, but the disease in such patients was associated with poor outcome.Strict adherence to specialized cytologic criteria in peritoneal washing cytology allows for results that are highly predictive of survival.

This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions.

There are marked geographic differences in the prevalence of CCC. The CCC is more likely to be detected at an early stage than high-grade serous cancers, and when confined within the ovary, the prognosis is good. However, advanced disease is associated with a very poor prognosis and resistance to standard treatment. Cytoreductive surgery should be performed for patients with stage II, III, or IV disease. An international phase III study to compare irinotecan/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIV CCC has completed enrollment (GCIG/JGOG3017). Considering the frequent PIK3CA mutation in CCC, dual inhibitors targeting PI3K, AKT in the mTOR pathway, are promising. Performing these trials and generating the evidence will require considerable international collaboration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017958518", "source": "openalex"}

This study assessed its activity and tolerability in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) or primary peritoneal carcinomatosis (PPC). METHODS This open-label, multi-institutional, phase II study used a two-stage design. Eligible patients had persistent or recurrent OC/PPC after one to two prior cytotoxic regimens, and they experienced progression within 12 months of platinum-based therapy. Treatment consisted of sorafenib 400 mg orally twice per day. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and toxicity by National Cancer Institute criteria. Secondary end points were tumor response and duration of PFS and overall survival. Biomarker analyses included measurement of ERK and b-Raf expression in tumors and phosphorylation of ERK (pERK) in peripheral-blood lymphocytes (PBLs) before and after 1 month of treatment. Results Seventy-three patients were enrolled, of which 71 were eligible. Fifty-nine eligible patients (83%) had measurable disease, and 12 (17%) had detectable disease. Significant grade 3 or 4 toxicities included the following: rash (n = 7), hand-foot syndrome (n = 9), metabolic (n = 10), GI (n = 3), cardiovascular (n = 2), and pulmonary (n = 2). Only patients with measurable disease were used to assess efficacy. Fourteen survived progression free for at least 6 months (24%; 90% CI, 15% to 35%). Two patients had partial responses (3.4%; 90% CI, 1% to 10%); 20 had stable disease; 30 had progressive disease; and seven could not have their tumor assessed. ERK and b-Raf were expressed in all tumors. Exploratory analyses indicated that pERK in post-treatment PBL specimens was associated with PFS. CONCLUSION Sorafenib has modest antitumor activity in patients with recurrent OC, but the activity was at the expense of substantial toxicity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.26.7856", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109400578", "source": "openalex"}

Despite literature reporting good oncologic and fetal outcomes in women treated for cancer during pregnancy, as many as 44% of gynecologists would offer termination, and 37% would not administer chemotherapy or radiotherapy in pregnancy. Objectives The aims of this study were to summarize current recommendations for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers in pregnancy and to review updates on existing knowledge regarding the safety of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments in pregnancy, including both oncologic and fetal outcomes. Evidence Acquisition A detailed literature review was performed on PubMed. Results The treatment of gynecologic malignancies during pregnancy mirrors that outside pregnancy, with a balance between maternal versus fetal health. Fertility-sparing surgery can be offered to stage IA2 and low-risk IB1 cervical, stage I epithelial ovarian, germ cell ovarian, or sex-cord stromal ovarian tumors. Delayed treatment can be offered for stage IB1 cervical cancer. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy can be given for advanced gynecologic cancers with good disease-free survival without significant adverse neonatal outcomes. Conclusions A multidisciplinary approach and improved education of providers regarding the surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments in pregnancy are needed in order to fully inform patients regarding treatment options. Further research in women who are pregnant is needed to determine the safety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures used in the nonpregnant woman. Relevance This article reviews and supports treatment of gynecologic cancer during pregnancy, calls for additional study and long-term follow-up, and justifies improved education of patients and providers regarding treatment options.

This feasibility study examines the participation rates and preliminary outcomes for an online support group designed specifically for women who are sexually distressed subsequent to gynecologic cancer treatment Methods A 12‐week online intervention was developed to address the psychosexual impact of gynecologic cancer. This intervention included a professionally moderated, asynchronous discussion forum as well as the provision of psycho‐educational materials addressing the psychosexual impact of gynecologic cancer. Each week, a new topic was introduced and relevant material was posted on the website. Women were encouraged to share their experiences related to the topic. Twenty‐seven, sexually distressed, remitted gynecologic cancer patients were randomly assigned to immediate treatment or a waitlist control condition. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 4‐month and 8‐month follow‐ups assessing sexual distress as the primary outcome as well as anxiety, depression, and illness intrusiveness. Results Participation rates differed between the two groups, with greater participation occurring in the second group. Exit interviews indicated that the majority of the participants were satisfied with the intervention. Intent‐to‐treat analyses suggest a small effect for reduction in sexual distress Conclusions This feasibility study suggests that women find this intervention acceptable.

Opioid-based treatment often adversely affects recovery. Prescribed opioids increase the risk of chronic opioid use, abuse, and diversion and contribute to the current opioid epidemic. <h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate whether after hospital discharge, postsurgical acute pain can be effectively managed with a markedly reduced number of opioid doses. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> In this case-control cohort study, an ultrarestrictive opioid prescription protocol (UROPP) was designed and implemented from June 26, 2017, through June 30, 2018, at a single tertiary-care comprehensive cancer center. All patients undergoing gynecologic oncology surgery were included. Patients undergoing ambulatory or minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic approach) were not prescribed opioids at discharge unless they required more than 5 doses of oral or intravenous opioids while in the hospital. Patients who underwent a laparotomy were provided a 3-day opioid pain medication supply at discharge. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Total number of opioid pain medications prescribed in the 60-day perioperative period, requests for opioid prescription refills, and postoperative pain scores and complications were evaluated. Factors associated with increased postoperative pain, preoperative and postoperative pain scores, inpatient status, prior opioid use, and all opioid prescriptions within the 60-day perioperative window were monitored among the case patients and compared with those from consecutive control patients treated at the center in the 12 months before the UROPP was implemented. <h3>Results</h3> Patient demographics and procedure characteristics were not statistically different between the 2 cohorts of women (605 cases: mean [SD] age, 56.3 [14.5] years; 626 controls: mean [SD] age, 55.5 [13.9] years). The mean (SD) number of opioid tablets given at discharge after a laparotomy was 43.6 (17.0) before implementation of the UROPP and 12.1 (8.9) after implementation (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). For patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic surgery, the mean (SD) number of opioid tablets given at discharge was 38.4 (17.4) before implementation of the UROPP and 1.3 (3.7) after implementation (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). After ambulatory surgery, the mean (SD) number of opioid tablets given at discharge was 13.9 (16.6) before implementation of the UROPP and 0.2 (2.1) after implementation (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The mean (SD) perioperative oral morphine equivalent dose was reduced to 64.3 (207.2) mg from 339.4 (674.4) mg the year prior for all opioid-naive patients (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The significant reduction in the number of dispensed opioids was not associated with an increase the number of refill requests (104 patients [16.6%] in the pre-UROPP group vs 100 patients [16.5%] in the post-UROPP group;<i>P</i> = .99), the mean (SD) postoperative visit pain scores (1.1 [2.2] for the post-UROPP group vs 1.4 [2.3] for pre-UROPP group;<i>P</i> = .06), or the number of complications (29 cases [4.8%] in the post-UROPP group vs 42 cases [6.7%] in the pre-UROPP group;<i>P</i> = .15). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Implementation of a UROPP was associated with a significant decrease in the overall amount of opioids prescribed to patients after gynecologic and abdominal surgery at the time of discharge for all patients, and for the entire perioperative time for opioid-naive patients without changes in pain scores, complications, or medication refill requests.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.5452", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2904786361", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence based on meta-analyses of individual case-control studies is accumulating, defining specific individual variations in disease susceptibility. For example, genetic variations of the estradiol metabolism have been described as significant contributors to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. In the field of obstetrics and gynecology, the genetic contribution of polymorphic markers to a series of disorders has been characterized. These disorders include recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-related complications such as thrombosis. Among other genetic markers, thrombophilic genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A polymorphisms, as well as genetic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for example, CYP19 and CYP1B1, have been established as genetic risk markers and disease modifiers of recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss and HRT-independent and -dependent breast cancer, respectively. In addition, meta-analyses of data in the literature established the TGFBR1*6A, GSTP I105V, and TP53 R72P polymorphisms, as well as the GSTM1 gene deletion as low-penetrance genetic risk factors of sporadic breast cancer. With respect to genetic modulation of therapeutic effects, beneficial effects of estrogen replacement therapy and HRT are modulated by the carriage of single nucleotide polymorphisms, for example, osteoprotection and blood lipid changes by the estrogen receptor-α (ER-a) PvuII polymorphism. Polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), ER-α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and Factor V genes have been demonstrated to modulate the timing of natural menopause. Lastly, a strong genetic contribution of polymorphisms to the development and the clinical course of endometriosis has been established with data pointing to polymorphisms of the COMT, GST, NAT-2, and ER-α genes as susceptibility markers. In summary, the available evidence points to a number of polymorphisms of a wide variety of genes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign and malignant gynecologic and obstetric conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1517/phgs.5.1.57.25687", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160293805", "source": "openalex"}

This study models a comparison of management strategies for women who carry a Lynch/HNPCC mutation. METHODS: A decision analytic model with three arms was designed to compare annual gynecologic examinations with annual screening (ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy, CA 125) and with hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 30 years The existing literature was searched for studies on the accuracy of endometrial and ovarian cancer screening using endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasonography, and serum CA 125. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database from 1988 to 2001 was used to estimate cancer mortality outcomes. RESULTS: In the surgical arm, 0.0056% of women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 0.0060% of women with endometrial cancer. These numbers increased to 3.7% and 18.4% in women being screened, and 8.3% and 48.7% in women undergoing annual examinations, respectively. Surgical management led to the longest expected survival time at 79.98 years, followed by screening at 79.31 years, and annual examinations at 77.41 years. If starting at age 30 and discounting life years at 3%, surgery still leads to the greatest expected life years. When comparing prophylactic surgery with the screening option, one would need to perform 75 surgeries to save one woman's entire life. For cancer prevention, however, only 28 and 6 prophylactic surgeries would need to be performed to prevent one case of ovarian and endometrial cancer, respectively. CONCLUSION: Risk-reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered in women with Lynch/HNPCC to prevent gynecologic cancers and their associated morbidities.

Elevated levels of IL‐6 were occasionally seen in patients with benign disease. IL‐6 serum levels appeared to be less sensitive than CA 125 in ovarian cancer diagnosis. In cancer patients, increased IL‐6 serum levels were related to the presence of the tumor since all post‐operative patients exhibited a marked decrease. In patients with advanced ovarian cancer post‐operative levels of IL‐6 correlated with residual disease. Very high levels of IL‐6 were observed in the ascitic fluid of9 ovarian cancer patients, but IL‐6 mRNA was not detected in tumor cells. This suggests that the increased production of IL‐6 observed in ovarian cancer is reactive. Higher levels of IL‐6 were found in patients unresponsive to chemotherapy, as compared with responsive ones. Univariate analysis of survival data suggests that increased IL‐6 serum levels correlate with negative prognosis. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910570305", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077765884", "source": "openalex"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS This protocol was developed to evaluate the following (1) the biologic behavior of ovarian LMP tumors, (2) the effectiveness of melphalan chemotherapy in patients with clinically detectable residual disease after surgical staging and in patients whose tumors progress or recur after surgical therapy, and (3) the response rate to cisplatin in those who failed to respond to melphalan therapy. The study group consisted of 146 assessable patients with stage I serous LMP tumors. All of these women had the affected ovary (or ovaries) removed, and a complete staging operation was performed in each case. While 123 patients had a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), 21 retained the uterus and one normal-appearing ovary and fallopian tube. No adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy was administered to any patients in the stage I study group. RESULTS The median follow-up time was 42.4 months (range, 1.6 to 108). Thus far, no patient with a stage I ovarian serous LMP tumor has developed recurrent disease. CONCLUSION Stage I ovarian serous LMP tumors rarely, if ever, recur. Limited resection, after meticulous surgical exploration, is adequate therapy for women of reproductive age.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1995.13.11.2752", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1924619776", "source": "openalex"}

As an obstetrics and gynecology physician or provider, you will likely encounter women who are at risk of development or relapse of a mental disorder during this vulnerable time. Objective The aim of this review is to examine theory and research on mood and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period with an emphasis on screening recommendations. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed and PsycINFO search for English-language publications about perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and screening was performed and included studies on subtopics. Results The literature reviewed suggests that perinatal mood and anxiety symptoms are prevalent and have significant consequences, and best practices for early detection are through routine depression and anxiety screening in the obstetrics setting. This includes overcoming barriers to care and use of liaison services to potentially reduce risk. Conclusions and Relevance High-quality prenatal care systems should develop the capacity for depression and anxiety risk assessment and treatment. Providers should routinely screen using validated screening tools, provide maternal mental health education, and be aware of the various medical, psychological, and complementary approaches for treating mood and anxiety disorders, to best guide and refer patients. The use of this practice will increase the quality of life in pregnant women with depression and anxiety and may help to reduce the likelihood of adverse birth outcomes, postpartum mental health problems, and adverse effects on offspring. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to name 3 adverse birth outcomes related to prenatal symptoms of depression and anxiety; identify symptoms, prevalence, and consequences of depression and anxiety in pregnancy and postpartum; and contrast and apply reliable, valid, and widely used screening tools to assess for depression and anxiety and practice appropriate referral for this population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0000000000000477", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2751991476", "source": "openalex"}

We have prospectively recorded patients characteristics, indications for laparoscopy, leading diagnosis, main operative procedures, post-operative course, surgical and anesthetic incidents and accidents. Complications were defined as any event that would modify the usual course of laparoscopy or of the post-operative period.One thousand and thirty-three laparoscopies were included. 80.1% of the procedures were major or advanced laparoscopies. The overall complication rate was 3%, with a laparotomy rate of 1.2%. About half of those complications (54.8%) occurred during the installation of laparoscopy. Veress needle and first trocar insertion accounted for 23.5% of those accidents (0.3% of the procedures) and suprapubic trocar insertion for 76.5%. Hemorrhages constituted almost all of the complications occurring during the operative stage (80%). The risk increased with the level of surgery and decreased with surgeon's experience. Prior abdominal surgery had no significant effect on the overall morbidity rate. Post-operative and anesthetic complications were rare.

No differences in QOL occur between survivors of early and advanced stage disease. Cervical cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy reported more QOL impairments than survivors treated with other approaches.

METHODS: This was a retrospective case–control study. Consecutive gynecologic oncology patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic surgery between July 1 and November 5, 2014, were treated on an enhanced recovery pathway. Enhanced recovery pathway components included patient education, multimodal analgesia, opioid minimization, nausea prophylaxis as well as early catheter removal, ambulation, and feeding. Cases were matched in a one-to-two ratio with historical control patients on the basis of surgery type and age. Primary endpoints were length of hospital stay, rates of discharge by noon, 30-day hospital readmission rates, and hospital costs. RESULTS: There were 165 patients included in the final cohort, 55 of whom were enhanced recovery pathway patients. Enhanced recovery patients were more likely to be discharged on postoperative day 1 compared with patients in the control group (91% compared with 60%, P &lt;.001, odds ratio 6.7, 95% confidence interval 2.46–18.04). Fifteen percent of enhanced recovery patients achieved discharge by noon compared with 4% of historical control patients ( P =.03). Postoperative pain scores decreased (2.6 compared with 3.12, P =.03) despite a 30% reduction in opioid use. Average total hospital costs were decreased by 12% in the enhanced recovery group ($13,771 compared with $15,649, P =.01). Readmission rates, mortality, and reoperation rates did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: An enhanced recovery pathway in patients undergoing gynecologic oncology minimally invasive surgery is associated with significant improvements in recovery time, decreased pain despite reduced opioid use, and overall lower hospital costs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001466", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2412539936", "source": "openalex"}

The quintessential examination of women, gynaecology is not simply the study of women's bodies, but also serves to define and constitute them. Any critical analysis of gynaecology is therefore, as Kapsalis affirms, an investigation of what it means to be female. In this respect she considers the public exposure of female 'privates' in the performance of the pelvic examination.From J. Marion Sims' surgical experiments on un-anesthetised slave women in the mid-nineteenth century, to the use of cadavers and prostitutes to teach medical students gynaecological techniques, Kapsalis focuses on the ways in which women and their bodies have been treated by the medical establishment. Removing gynaecology from its private cover within clinic walls and medical textbook pages, she decodes the gynaecological examination, seizing on its performative dimension.She considers traditional medical practices and the dynamics of 'proper' patient performance; non-traditional practices such as the cervical self-examination; and, incarnations of the pelvic examination outside the bounds of medicine, including its appearance in David Cronenberg's film Dead Ringers and Annie Sprinkle' performance piece Public Cervix Announcement. Confounding the boundaries that separate medicine, art, and pornography, revealing the potent cultural attitudes and anxieties about women, female bodies, and female sexuality that permeate the practice of gynaecology, Public Privates concludes by locating a venue from which challenging, alternative performances may be staged. Provocative and daring, this book will be important to readers engaged in women's studies, cultural studies, and performance studies, and to those concerned with issues of women's health.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.35-0317", "url": "https://openalex.org/W160123011", "source": "openalex"}

Sarcomas can develop within the irradiated field after radiation therapy (RT) for gynecologic malignancies. We undertook a study to assess the outcome after treatment of postirradiation sarcoma (PIS) of the gynecologic tract. In reviewing our data and the literature, we compare the absolute risk of PIS and other radiation-associated second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) with the mortality risk of surgery and general anesthesia. Between 1955 and 1987, 114 patients with uterine sarcomas were seen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Medical Center. Thirteen had a prior history of RT. Conditions for which these patients received RT included choriocarcinoma (one), menorraghia (four), cervical cancer (six), and ovarian cancer (two). RT doses were known in six cases and ranged from 4,000 to 8,000 cGy. Latency time from RT to the development of PIS ranged from 3 to 30 years, with a median of 17 years. Twelve patients were treated with surgery or additional RT. Two patients remain alive 5 months and 57 months, respectively, following salvage therapy. Five-year disease-specific survival for all patients is 17%. From our data and a review of the literature, we estimate that the absolute risk of PIS with long-term follow-up ranges from 0.03 to 0.8%. Postirradiation sarcoma of the gynecologic tract is a relatively rare event associated with a poor prognosis. Mortality risks of radiation-associated SMN are similar to mortality risks of surgery and general anesthesia. Given the large number of patients with gynecologic malignancies who can be cured or palliated with RT, concern regarding radiation sarcomagenesis should not be a major factor influencing treatment decisions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000421-199602000-00013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2331413925", "source": "openalex"}

Numerous cytokines, chemokines, and growth and transcription factors have indisputable roles in the establishment and maintenance of benign gynecologic disorders by initiating complex cascades that promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and lesion progression. The interaction between inflammation and benign gynecologic disorders is orchestrated by a plethora of factors, including sex steroids, genetics, epigenetics, extracellular matrix, stem cells, cardiometabolic risk factors, diet, vitamin D, and the immune system. The role of inflammation in these disorders is not limited to local pathobiology but also extends to involve clinical sequelae that range from those confined to the reproductive tract, such as infertility and gynecologic malignancies, to systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease. Enhanced understanding of the intricate mechanisms of this association will introduce us to unvisited pathophysiological perspectives and guide future diagnostic and therapeutic implications aimed at reducing the burden of these disorders. Utilization of inflammatory markers, microRNA, and molecular imaging as diagnostic adjuncts may be valuable, noninvasive techniques for prompt detection of benign gynecologic disorders. Further, use of novel as well as previously established therapeutics, such as immunomodulators, hormonal treatments, cardiometabolic medications, and cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-κB inhibitors, can target inflammatory pathways involved in their pathogenesis. In this comprehensive review, we aim to dissect the existing literature on the role of inflammation in benign gynecologic disorders, including the proposed underlying mechanisms and complex interactions, its contribution to clinical sequelae, and the clinical implications this role entails.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioab054", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3135997022", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Mortality statistics show that of the cancers under study, breast cancer has the greatest impact, and of racial/ethnic groups, African Americans suffer the greatest disparities, with highest mortality rates for breast, uterine and cervical cancers, and second highest for ovarian cancer. Recent studies demonstrated that black breast cancer patients suffer more underuse of appropriate adjuvant therapy, and greater delays in diagnosis and institution of treatments, and blacks and Hispanics suffered greater postsurgical pain and symptomatology. Data indicate that the biology of some breast cancers in blacks is unique and more aggressive. One study demonstrated that more black breast cancer patients died of nonbreast cancer causes and that excessive comorbidity in blacks explained substantial amounts of survival disparity. Research is beginning to identify important disparities in nonblack minority racial/ethnic groups, including Hispanics and South Asian Americans.

In the present study, cancer cell lines and normal/benign/malignant tissues of the human female genital tract were examined for the expression of both c-kit and SCF by Northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Two of 16 cell lines showed mRNA expression of both c-kit and SCF, while 2 and 12 cell lines expressed c-kit and SCF, respectively. In tissues, several cases of malignant tumors, including three cervical cancers, one ovarian cancer, and one ovarian immature teratoma, expressed mRNA of both c-kit and SCF. In normal tissues, squamous epithelium expressed SCF immunohistochemically, while c-kit protein was detected only in melanocytes. Some tissues of malignant tumors, one squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, two small cell carcinomas of the cervix, two serous adenocarcinomas of the ovary, and two immature teratomas of the ovary, expressed both c-kit and SCF proteins immunohistochemically. It is also notable that c-kit protein was expressed only in malignant germ cells of dysgerminomas, while SCF was expressed in the connective tissues surrounding germ cells.

This is a preliminary report of nine patients with gynecologic carcinoma in whom a continent urinary diversion procedure was performed. A segment of distal ileum, the ascending colon, and part of the transverse colon are used to create the colonic reservoir. The segment of colon is opened along the tenia and folded onto itself. The walls of the ascending and transverse colon are anastomosed to detubularize this segment of bowel and eliminate the transient high pressure of the colon. Surgical staples are used for the anastomosis. The segment of ileum is tapered and three purse-string sutures (2-O silk) are placed at the level of the ileocecal valve to achieve continence. The short segment of ileum is then exteriorized as a stoma through which the patient catheterizes. Antirefluxing, non-tunneled ureterocolonic anastomoses are performed. The anterior wall of the reservoir is closed with absorbable staples. Postoperative urodynamic studies have shown maximum capacity of 750 ml and the area of continence to be at the ileocecal valve where the purse-string sutures are placed.

From 1975 to 2000, medical malpractice costs for obstetrician–gynecologists have risen nearly four-fold higher than that of other medical costs. In addition, it has been estimated that defensive medicine may cost society $80 billion per year. Most importantly, many obstetrician–gynecologists are frustrated and seem to be abandoning the parts of their practice they perceive to put them at higher liability risk. This article discusses other medical specialty society efforts that have been successful in addressing the area of patient safety. Efforts to better track quality outcomes has been initiated by the American College of Surgeons through the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists has demonstrated both dramatically improved outcomes and reduced liability costs through a concerted patient safety effort. The author proposes changes in four areas to specifically address patient safety in obstetrics and gynecology, including: the development of reliable and reproducible quality control measures (and a system to track them); national closed claim reviews to better understand and address the most important safety and liability areas for obstetrician–gynecologists; work prospectively with pharmaceutical and surgical device manufacturers to develop innovative new products that would increase the likelihood of safe outcomes; and create a culture of safety in obstetrics and gynecology by incorporating safety education into all levels of training.

A total of 35 endometrial carcinomas (1 slide per case) were reviewed by 11 gynecologic pathologists (median experience: 10 y) from 11 North American institutions. The cases were selected from the files of 3 institutions on the basis of the presence of at least focal clear cells and had previously been classified as a variety of histotypes at these institutions. Diagnoses were rendered in a blinded manner and without predetermined diagnostic criteria or categories. The κ values between any pair of observers ranged from 0.18 to 0.69 (combined 0.46), which was indicative of a \"moderate\" level of interobserver agreement for the group. Subgroups of \"confirmed CCC\" [cases diagnosed as such by at least 8 (73%) of the 11 observers, n=14] and \"possible CCC\" (cases diagnosed as CCC by ≥1 but <8 observers, n=13) were compared with regard to a variety of semiquantified morphologic features. By combining selected morphologic features that displayed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups on univariate analyses, the following approximate morphologic profile emerged for the confirmed CCC group: papillae with hyalinized cores in ≥33% of the lesion, clear cells in ≥33% of the lesion, hyperchromasia in ≥33% of the lesion, the absence of nuclear pseudostratification in >3 cells on the papillae, the absence of nuclear pseudostratification in glands in ≥33% of the lesion, the absence of diffuse grade 3 nuclei, the absence of long and slender papillae in ≥33% of the lesion, and glands and papillae lined by cuboidal to flat, noncolumnar cells. In a backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, features from the profile that predicted the confirmed CCC group included: (1) absence or minimality of diffuse sheets of grade 3 nuclei [P=0.025; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0266-0.363]; (2) absence or minimality of nuclear stratification in glands and papillae (P=0.040; 95% CI, -0.228 to -0.0054); and (3) glands and papillae lined by cuboidal to flat, noncolumnar cells (P=0.008; 95% CI, 0.0911-0.566). The 2 groups displayed significant overlap regarding a wide variety of features, and no single case displayed a full complement of potentially diagnostic features. Morphologic patterns associated with cases with very high levels of interobserver variability (defined as cases with ≥4 different diagnoses rendered for them, n=9) included the near-exclusive or exclusively solid pattern of clear cells (3/9) and glandular/papillary proliferations whose only CCC-like feature was the presence of clear cells (2/9). In conclusion, the diagnosis of endometrial carcinomas with clear cells by gynecologic pathologists is associated with a moderate level of interobserver variability. However, there is a morphologic profile that characterizes cases that gynecologic pathologists more uniformly classify as CCC, and the presence of these features is supportive of a CCC diagnosis in an endometrial carcinoma with clear cells. Cases that display broad and significant qualitative deviations from the aforementioned profile should prompt the consideration of a diagnosis other than CCC.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pas.0b013e31825dd4b3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991661658", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with Stage IB carcinoma of the cervix (>3-mm invasion) underwent a radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Patients with involved paraaortic nodes or gross extracervical disease were excluded. Of 813 evaluable patients, 645 had squamous, 104 with adenocarcinoma, and 64 had adenosquamous cell type. The time to failure and the following clinical/pathologic characteristics were compared among the three cell types: age, Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status (PS), gross versus occult tumor, histologic grade, depth of invasion, node status, uterine extension, parametrial extension, surgical margins, and capillary–lymphatic space (CLS) involvement. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the patients with adenosquamous and adenocarcinoma to those with squamous while adjusting for prognostic factors. The median age was 40 years (range, 21–87). Pelvic nodes were involved in 119 (15%) of patients. There were no significant differences between cell types in distributions of the following factors: age, PS, positive nodes, depth of invasion, uterine extension, surgical margins, or parametrial extension.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1978983532", "title": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by tumor debulking prolongs survival for patients with poor prognosis in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma", "text": "BACKGROUND Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IIIC should be treated by radical surgical tumor debulking with the goal of complete tumor resection. Prolonged median survival can be achieved in those patients entirely free of tumor after surgery by the administration of postsurgical platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. However, residual tumor is present in the majority of patients, which limits survival prognosis. Different therapy approaches should be utilized to improve prognosis in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce “downstaging” of the tumor and thus improve operability. Here, evidence of large ascites volume (>500 mL) can be used to identify those patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS In a prospective, nonrandomized Phase II study, 31 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received 3 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy, followed by tumor debulking surgery and 3 additional cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy. During the same period, 32 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received conventional therapy (tumor debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy). The two groups were investigated and compared with respect to tumor resection rates, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery, duration of surgery, and median survival. RESULTS The tumor resection rate in the patient group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that of the conventionally treated group; the median survival time of 42 months versus 23 months also was significantly longer (P = 0.007). Time spent in surgery, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of FIGO Stage IIIC who will benefit only marginally from conventional therapy can be identified by evidence of large ascites volume.

Of the symptomatic women surveyed, 31 percent sought care, overwhelmingly from private providers (70 percent). Only 8 percent of women consulted frontline paramedical health workers. Care‐seeking behavior and type of providers consulted varied significantly across different Indian states. Significant differentials in care‐seeking by age, caste, religion, education, household wealth, and women' autonomy suggest the existence of multiple cultural, economic, and demand‐side barriers to care‐seeking. Although socially disadvantaged women were less likely than better‐off women to consult private providers, the majority of even the poorest, uneducated, and lower‐caste women consulted private providers. Geographical access to public health facilities had no significant association with choice of provider, whereas access to private providers had only a moderately significant association with that choice. The predominance of use of private services for self‐perceived gynecological morbidity warrants the inclusion of private providers in the national reproductive health strategy to enhance its effectiveness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2003.00173.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969216424", "source": "openalex"}

However, increasing clinical demand for improved lesion characterization and disease mapping to optimize patient management has resulted in the incorporation of newer sequences, such as diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, into routine protocols for pelvic MR imaging. DW imaging provides functional information about the microenvironment of water in tissues, hence augmenting the morphologic information derived from conventional MR images. It can depict shifts of water from extracellular to intracellular compartments, altered cell membrane permeability, disruption of cell membrane depolarization, and increased cellular density. Such changes may be associated with tumors. DW imaging has emerged as an important cancer biomarker and takes the role of the radiologist from the level of mere macroscopic diagnosis to more active participation in determining patient prognosis and management through a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment. With the growing acknowledgment of DW imaging as a pivotal tool in the radiologist's armamentarium, radiologists must be familiar with the appearances of various gynecologic tumors at DW imaging and understand the implications of this sequence for improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting and monitoring treatment response. Although positron emission tomography/computed tomography is extremely useful for detecting tumor recurrence in cervical and ovarian carcinomas, it has a limited specificity in the immediate posttreatment setting. DW imaging may aid in detection of residual or recurrent tumors in such situations. DW imaging is a potentially useful adjunct to conventional MR imaging for evaluation of gynecologic tumors, thus improving overall diagnostic accuracy, tumor staging, prediction of response to therapy, and treatment follow-up. ©RSNA, 2014", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.345130131", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2106026023", "source": "openalex"}

An association between PCOS and type-1 endometrial cancer has often been reported in the literature. The prolonged anovulation with consequent continued secretion of estrogen unopposed by progesterone may enhance the development and growth of this malignancy, particularly in young women. Hypersecretion of luteinizing hormone [LH], chronic hyperinsulinemia and increased serum insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-I levels may represent risk factors for endometrial cancer. However, data available in the literature do not allow a meta-analysis to be carried out to calculate an estimate of the relative risk of endometrial cancer in women with PCOS. Anecdotal cases of low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma and carcinosarcoma have been reported in association with prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation, and in particular with PCOS. A few studies have addressed the possibility of an association between PCOS and epithelial ovarian cancer risk, and the results are conflicting but generally reassuring, and similarly the few available data appear to exclude a strong association between PCOS and breast cancer.Polycystic ovary syndromeendometrial cancerlow-grade endometrial stromal sarcomaepithelial ovarian cancerbreast cancer", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590400021201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2045170174", "source": "openalex"}

In the current study, expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its receptor (the c-fms proto-oncogene) was investigated in 42 samples of gynecologic tissues. There were 15 samples of normal ovarian and uterine tissue or benign conditions of these organs; 11 samples of primary ovarian cancer tissue; seven samples of metastatic ovarian cancer tissue; and nine samples of primary endometrial cancer tissue. Steady state transcript levels were assessed by Northern Blot analysis. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) expression was not observed in any of the specimens of benign abnormalities or of normal organs; c-fms expression was detected in two of 15 (13%) of these specimens, albeit at very low levels. In contrast, 14 (78%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens, and five (55%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed M-CSF. Similarly, 16 (89%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens and six (67%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed c-fms. Most positive malignant tissues (19 [86%] of 22) showed coexpression of M-CSF and c-fms. of interest, M-CSF and c-fms mRNA were detected in tumor, but not in adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, M-CSF and c-fms transcripts were produced by all metastatic tumors, including two cases in which the corresponding primary tumor from the same patient was negative. Because M-CSF mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, the increased levels of both these gene products in gynecologic malignancies suggest that an interaction between M-CSF and c-fms may participate in the development of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas and especially in progression to the metastatic state.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19910215)67:4<990::aid-cncr2820670422>3.0.co;2-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031336219", "source": "openalex"}

Gynecologic cancers were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry. The outcome measure was the standardized incidence ratio (95% CI) calculated as the ratio between the observed to the expected number of cancers and defined for each gynecologic cancer and further stratified according to the histology, follow-up time since surgery, and age at follow-up. The follow-up was 838,685 person-years, and the Finnish female population served as the reference.Endometriosis was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer (standardized incidence ratio 1.76 [95% CI 1.47-2.08]), especially with endometrioid (3.12 [2.15-4.38]) and clear cell (5.17 [3.20-7.89]) histologic type and to a lesser extent with serous type (1.37 [1.02-1.80]).

The overall risk of ovarian cancer was not increased among women with peritoneal and deep infiltrating endometriosis. However, peritoneal endometriosis was associated with a twofold increase in risk of endometrioid histology. The risk of endometrial cancer was not altered in the entire cohort. The standardized incidence ratio for precancerous cervical lesions was 0.81 (0.71-0.92) and for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical cancer 0.46 (0.20-0.91).The excess risk of ovarian cancer among women with ovarian endometriosis translates into two excess cases per 1,000 patients followed for 10 years.

One hundred ninety-five women, who were enrolled in a Gynecologic Oncology Group treatment protocol of Stage IB squamous carcinoma of the cervix and underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic and paraaortic node sampling, formed the study population. The tumors were graded first by participating institutional pathologists, with submitted slides subjected to an independent review by two pathologists (R.J.Z. and S.W.). The histologic parameters examined included the presence and amount of keratinization, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic rate, gestalt grading, pattern of invasion at the stromal interface, and inflammatory cell infiltrate. The depth of invasion and presence or absence of vascular invasion also were assessed. The probability of pelvic lymph node metastasis and the progression-free interval were determined for each parameter. Surprisingly, none of the grading methods was effective in predicting nodal spread or progression-free interval. However, an increasing depth of invasion strongly correlated with nodal spread and a diminished progression-free interval (P < 0.0001). Vascular invasion was less effective in these predictions (0.05 < P < 0.10). Both measurements were reasonably reproducible.

Data sources and methods: We reviewed the published literature on calcium channel blockers and their pharmacology and therapeutic applications in obstetrics and gynecology. We paid particular attention to methods of animal research and recent clinical evaluations. Conclusions: The dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers (type II calcium blockers) and, specifically, nifedipine are safe for use in pregnancy. They have little teratogenic or fetotoxic potential. Nifedipine's mechanism of action is through smooth-muscle relaxation secondary to blockage of the slow calcium channels into the cells. In vivo, there is minimal effect on the cardiac conducting system. Multiple studies in women have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of nifedipine as an antihypertensive. Therapeutic doses range from 10-30 mg orally every 6-8 hours. For acute control of hypertension, 10 mg of sublingual nifedipine may be used. Nifedipine is as effective as betamimetics in decreasing uterine activity. As a tocolytic agent, it is more effective as there are fewer patients who have to discontinue nifedipine because of side effects. The side effects of nifedipine include flushing, headache, or, rarely, hypotension in the hypovolemic patient. Nifedipine has potential and theoretical indications for dysmenorrhea and bladder irritability.(Obstet Gynecol 1994;83:616-24)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006250-199404000-00024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991694792", "source": "openalex"}

Screening and prophylactic surgery have been recommended as prevention strategies. In this study, the authors estimated the net health benefits and cost-effectiveness of these strategies in a Markov decision-analytic model.Five strategies were compared for a hypothetical cohort of women with Lynch syndrome: 1) no prevention ('reference'); 2) prophylactic surgery (hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) at age 30 years; 3) prophylactic surgery at age 40 years; 4) annual screening with endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA 125 from age 30 years; and 5) annual screening from age 30 years until prophylactic surgery at age 40 years (combined strategy). Net health benefit was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the primary outcome measured was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Baseline and transition probabilities were obtained from published literature, and costs were from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Agency for Health Care Quality and Research. Sensitivity analyses were performed for uncertainty around various parameters.The combined strategy provided the highest net health benefit (18.98 QALYs) but had an ICER of $194,650 per QALY relative to the next best strategy (prophylactic surgery at age 40 years). Prophylactic surgery at age 30 years and annual screening were dominated by alternate strategies.Annual screening followed by prophylactic surgery at age 40 years was the most effective gynecologic cancer prevention strategy, but the incremental benefit over prophylactic surgery alone was attained at substantial cost. The ICER would become favorable by improving the effectiveness and reducing the costs of screening in this population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.23554", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2053386046", "source": "openalex"}

To control for the diagnosis of cancer and for prior hysterectomy, 24 age-matched early stage gynecologic cancer patients not receiving chemotherapy and assessed 1 year following diagnosis were examined as a comparison group. All subjects completed psychosocial assessments at a clinic visit. Medical information was retrospectively abstracted from patient charts.Decrements in physical, emotional, and functional well-being were reported by extensively treated patients, whereas social well-being and satisfaction with the relationship between doctor and patient were close to the norms of the comparison group. Extensively treated patients reported more fatigue and less vigor, but their depression and anxiety did not differ from early stage patients. Almost all extensively treated patients reported that their treatment had been worthwhile. Patients using avoidant coping reported poorer physical and emotional well-being, along with greater anxiety, depression, fatigue, and total mood disturbance. Those using active coping reported better social well-being, better relationships with their doctors, and less overall distress.This study indicates that gynecologic oncology patients extensively treated with chemotherapy experienced substantial decrements to quality of life, and yet treatment still was considered worthwhile by a majority of patients.

Objective To examine the effect of intraoperative esketamine infusion on the incidence of PSD in patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from August 2021 to April 2022 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in China. Participants included patients aged 18 to 65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status classification of I to III (with I indicating a healthy patient, II a patient with mild systemic disease, and III a patient with severe systemic disease) who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to either the esketamine group or control group. Data were analyzed using the per protocol principle. Interventions Patients in the esketamine group received a continuous infusion of esketamine, 0.3 mg/kg/h, intraoperatively. Patients in the control group received an equivalent volume of saline. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the incidence of PSD on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 3. Postoperative sleep disturbance was defined as a numeric rating scale score of 6 or higher or an Athens Insomnia Scale score of 6 points or higher. The secondary outcomes included postoperative anxiety and depression scores using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, postoperative pain using the visual analog scale, postoperative hydromorphone consumption, and risk factors associated with PSD. Results A total of 183 female patients were randomized to the control group (n = 91; median [IQR] age, 45 [35-49] years) and the esketamine group (n = 92; median [IQR] age, 43 [32-49] years). The incidence of PSD in the esketamine group was significantly lower than in the control group on POD 1 (22.8% vs 44.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.20-0.72]; P = .002) and POD 3 (7.6% vs 19.8%; OR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13-0.84]; P = .02). There were no differences in postoperative depression and anxiety scores between the 2 groups. Postoperative hydromorphone consumption in the first 24 hours (3.0 [range, 2.8-3.3] mg vs 3.2 [range, 2.9-3.4] mg; P = .04) and pain scores on movement (3 [3-4] vs 4 [3-5] points; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) were significantly lower in the esketamine group than in the control group. On multivariable logistic regression, preoperative depression (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.70) and anxiety (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.04-1.80) scores, duration of anesthesia (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and postoperative pain score (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24-2.96) were identified as risk factors associated with PSD. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this trial showed the prophylactic effect of intraoperative esketamine infusion on the incidence of PSD in patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery.

Surgical knots reduce the tensile strength of all sutures by thinning and stretching the material. The tying of surgical knots introduces the potential of human error and interuser variability. Knot-secured smooth suture must create an uneven distribution of tension across the wound with the higher tension burdens placed at the knots. Given the excessive relative wound tension on the knot and the reasonable concerns of surgeons for suture failure due to knot slippage, there is a natural tendency toward overcoming these concerns by over-tightening knots; however, tighter knots may be worse for wound healing and strength than looser knots. In minimally invasive laparoscopic surgeries, the ability to quickly and properly tie surgical knots presents a new challenge. In cases in which knot tying is difficult, the use of knotless barbed suture can securely reapproximate tissues with less time, cost, and aggravation.

Their transport across the plasma membrane may determine their cytotoxicity and thus nucleoside transporter (NT) expression patterns may be of clinical relevance. Lack of appropriate antibodies for use in paraffin‐embedded biopsies has been a bottleneck to undertake high‐throughput analysis of NT expression in solid tumors. Here we report the characterization of 2 new antibodies raised against the low‐affinity equilibrative NTs, hENT1 and hENT2, suitable for that purpose. These 2 antisera, along with a previously characterized antibody that specifically recognizes the high‐affinity Na‐dependent concentrative NT, hCNT1, have been used to analyze, using a tissue array approach, NT expression in gynecologic cancers (90 ovarian, 80 endometrial and 118 uterine cervix carcinomas). Human CNT1 was not detected in 33% and 39% of the ovarian and uterine cervix carcinomas, respectively, whereas hENT1 and hENT2 expression was significantly retained in a high percentage of tumors (91% and 96% for hENT1, 84% and 98% for hENT2, in ovarian and cervix carcinomas, respectively). Only a few endometrial carcinomas (15%) were found to be negative for hCNT1, but they all retained hENT1 and hENT2 expression. In ovarian cancer, the loss of all 3 NT proteins was a more common event in the clear cell histologic subtype than in the serous, mucinous and endometrioid histotypes. In uterine cervix tumors, the loss of expression of hCNT1 was significantly associated with the adenocarcinoma subtype. In summary, hCNT1 was by far the isoform whose expression was most frequently reduced or lost in the 3 types of gynecologic tumors analyzed. Moreover, NT expression is related to the type of gynecologic tumor and its specific subtype, hCNT1 protein loss being highly correlated with poor prognosis histotypes. Since hCNT1, hENT1 and hENT2 recognize fluoropyrimidines as substrates, but with different affinities, this study anticipates high variability in drug uptake efficiency in solid tumors. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.20524", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035418610", "source": "openalex"}

Open laparoscopy does not reduce the risk of major complications during the set‐up procedures for laparoscopy. Randomized prospective trials are indispensable for comparing the risks involved with the classic technique and those of open laparoscopy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1600-0412.2003.00251.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973463977", "source": "openalex"}

The aggregated results from 1992 to 2014 are reported herein. Methods and Results The total number of registered treatments was 393 745 cycles, of which 66 550 were pregnancy cycles and 46 008 were cycles with a live birth. Compared to the number of registered treatments in 2008, when the cycle‐based registry was newly introduced, there was a 2.07‐fold increase in the total number of treatments and a 2.25‐fold increase in the number of cycles with a live birth. As the average age of patients who receive assisted reproductive technology has become markedly higher year by year, the most common age of those patients who received assisted reproductive technology in 2014 was 40 years. Conclusion The total numbers of both assisted reproductive technology treatments and assisted reproductive technology live births are likely to be higher in the future. In addition, the trend toward aging patients seems to be continuing into the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/rmb2.12014", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606313022", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods: Mutational analysis of p53 was performed in RNA or genomic DNA extracted from frozen tumor. An immunohistochemistry assay was used to detect p53 overexpression in fixed tumor. Results: There were 81 patients (74%) with a single mutation, three patients (3%) with two mutations, and 25 patients (23%) lacking a mutation in exons 2 to 11 of p53. Although most mutations occurred within exons 5 to 8, mutations outside this region were observed in 11% of patients. A mutation in exons 2 to 11 of p53 was associated with a short-term improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival. Adjusted Cox modeling demonstrated a 70% reduction in risk of death (P = .014) and a 60% reduction in risk of disease progression (P = .014) for women with such mutations. However, these striking risk reductions increased over time (P &lt; .02) and eventually disappeared with longer follow-up. Overexpression of p53 was observed in 55 patients (100%) with only missense mutation(s), seven patients (32%) with truncation mutations, and eight patients (40%) lacking a mutation in exons 2 to 11. Overexpression of p53 was associated with tumor grade but not with patient outcome. Conclusion: Alterations in p53 are a common event in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. A mutation in p53, but not overexpression of p53, is associated with a short-term survival benefit. Additional studies are required to define the roles that p53 plays in regulating therapeutic responsiveness and patient outcome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2003.11.052", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088344791", "source": "openalex"}

Design: The risks and benefits of oophorectomy as detailed in published articles are reviewed with regard to quality-of-life issues and mortality outcomes in oophorectomized versus nonoophorectomized women from five diseases linked to ovarian hormones (coronary heart disease, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, stroke, and hip fracture). Results: Numerous reports link oophorectomy to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, hip fractures, dementia, short-term memory impairment, decline in sexual function, decreased positive psychological well-being, adverse skin and body composition changes, and adverse ocular changes, as well as more severe hot flushes and urogenital atrophy. The potential benefits associated with oophorectomy include prevention of ovarian cancer, a decline in breast cancer risk, and a reduced risk of pelvic pain and subsequent ovarian surgery. In our study of long-term mortality after oophorectomy using Markov modeling, preservation of ovaries until women are at least aged 65 years was associated with higher survival rates. For women between ages 50 and 54 with hysterectomy and ovarian preservation, the probability of surviving to age 80 was 62% versus 54% if oophorectomy was performed. This 8% difference in survival is primarily due to fewer women dying from cardiovascular heart disease and/or hip fracture. This survival advantage far outweighs the 0.47% increased mortality rate from ovarian cancer prevented by oophorectomy. If surgery occurred between ages 55 and 59, the survival advantage was 4%. After age 64 there were no significant differences in survival rates. Prior literature supports our conclusion of a benefit over risk for ovarian conservation. Conclusions: Elective oophorectomy is associated with short-and long-term health consequences that merit serious consideration. For women with an average risk of ovarian cancer, ovarian conservation until at least age 65 seems to benefit long-term survival.

We performed a prospective randomized phase III study to examine whether sequential administration of topotecan can improve the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel in first-line treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: A total of 1308 patients with previously untreated ovarian cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IIB–IV) were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by either four cycles of topotecan (TC-Top; 658 patients) or surveillance (TC; 650 patients) on a 3-week per cycle schedule. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life. Time-to-event data were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and a stratified log-rank test was used to compare distributions between treatment groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Categorical data were compared using a stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Median progression-free survival was 18.2 months in the TC-Top arm versus 18.5 months in the TC arm (stratum-adjusted HR = 0.97 [95% CI = 0.85 to 1.10]; P = .688). Median overall survival was 43.1 months for the TC-Top arm versus 44.5 months for the TC arm (stratum-adjusted HR = 1.01 [95% CI = 0.86 to 1.18]; P = .885). At 3 years, overall survival in both arms was 57% (58.5% in the TC arm and 55.7% in the TC-Top arm). Compared with patients in the TC arm, patients in the TC-Top arm had more grade 3–4 hematologic toxic effects (requiring more supportive care) and more grade 3–4 infections (5.1% versus 2.7%; P = .034) but did not have a statistically significant increase in febrile neutropenia (3.3% versus 3.1%; P = .80). Among patients who had measurable disease (TC, n = 147; TC-Top, n = 145), overall (i.e., complete or partial) response was 69.0% (95% CI = 61.4% to 76.5%) in the TC-Top arm and 76.2% (95% CI = 69.3% to 83.1%) in the TC arm ( P = .166). Conclusions: The sequential addition of topotecan to carboplatin–paclitaxel did not result in superior overall response or progression-free or overall survival.

When applied in conjunction with existing histologic criteria, these \"biomarkers\" have the potential to enhance diagnostic consistency and reproducibility. The gains expected are to practicing diagnostic pathologists (who will enjoy greater diagnostic consistency) and to academics (for whom biomarkers may uncover new pathways unappreciated by histologic diagnosis alone).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2149584122", "title": "International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system revised: what should be considered critically for gynecologic cancer?", "text": "The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the first organization to develop a staging system of gynecologic cancer, became the official patron of the Annual Report for the development and changes of gynecologic cancer classification and staging since 1958.1 Thereafter, FIGO staging system has been structured to represent major prognostic factors in predicting patients' outcomes and lending order to the complex dynamic behavior of gynecologic cancers. The purpose of the FIGO staging system is to offer a classification of the extent of gynecologic cancer in order to provide a method of conveying one's clinical experience to others for the comparison of treatment methods without ambiguity. To achieve this objective, FIGO staging systems have been updated several times according to the latest available data over the past decades, thus implying that the FIGO staging system is responsive and adaptive to scientific development. Recently, the revised FIGO staging system for carcinoma of the vulva, cervix, endometrium, and uterine sarcomas was approved by the members of FIGO Executive Board in early September 2008.2,3 Thus, we must become accustomed to the new staging system, and apply it in future clinical settings from now on. For revising the FIGO staging system for carcinoma of the cervix, the 2 major issues, surgical staging and lymph node involvement, have been considered because clinical staging is less accurate than surgical staging, despite significant advances in imaging techniques. Also, lymph node involvement is known to be a poor prognostic factor regardless of the disease extent. The FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology decided that clinical staging should be continued, while lymph nodal assessment during staging is not necessary because surgical staging cannot be employed worldwide, especially in low-resource countries. Thus, the above two changes have been approved in the new staging system as follows. First, the subdivision of the tumor size (with a 4 cm cut-off in maximum diameter) has been applied for previous stage IIA, while the subdivision regarding the tumor size, and uni- or bilateral parametrial invasion has not been considered in previous stages IIB-IIIB, because of few available data and identity of treatment. Second, the previous stage 0 has been deleted from the new clinical staging system because it is a pre-invasive lesion.4 In the revised FIGO staging system for carcinoma of the endometrium, there are 4 major changes, which are as follows. First, the previous stages IA and IB have been combined as stage IA because there was no significant difference in a 5-year survival among previous stage IA G1, IB G1, IA G2 and IB G2, as stated in volumes 23 to 26 of the FIGO annual report. Moreover, stage IB is now equal to or greater than the outer one-half of the myometrium. Second, stage II no longer has a subset A and B, and involvement of the endocervical gland of the cervix is now considered stage I. Third, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node involvement in previous stage IIIC has been separated because many previous studies have suggested that the prognosis may be worse if para-aortic lymph nodes are involved. Thus, the previous stage IIIC is now categorized as IIIC1 (indicating positive pelvic lymph nodes) and IIIC2 (indicating positive para-aortic lymph nodes with or without positive pelvic lymph nodes). Fourth, positive cytology has been excluded as factors for defining the new surgical staging.5 Among the revised FIGO staging systems for gynecologic cancers, the greatest change is in the new staging system for carcinoma of the vulva. Although the previous stage IA remains unchanged because this is the only group of patients with a negligible risk of lymph node metastasis, the previous stages I and II have been combined because many studies have demonstrated that the size of the lesion with negative lymph nodes is no longer a prognostic factor in previous stages I and II. Moreover, the number and morphology (size and extracapsular spread) of positive lymph nodes have been taken into account because they have been shown to be important prognostic factors, whereas the bilaterality of positive nodes have been discounted due to controversy from previous studies.6 After the establishment of the 1988 FIGO criteria for carcinoma of the corpus uteri, uterine sarcomas including leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), adenosarcoma and carcinosarcoma, were classified according to the FIGO criteria for carcinoma of the corpus uteri because of their relative rarity. However, this old classification is no longer sufficient because more information on uterine sarcomas has become available and this justified the independent staging. Thus, The FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology approved the new staging system for uterine sarcomas in early September 2008. The revised staging system for uterine sarcomas includes 3 new classifications such as staging for leiomyosarcoma, staging for ESS and adenosarcoma, and staging for carcinosarcoma. Although leiomyosarcoma, ESS, and adenosarcoma are newly classified in this revised staging system, carcinosarcoma is still staged identically to carcinoma of the endometrium.3 However, some types of gynecologic cancers such as ovarian, and fallopian tubal cancers have not been revised for the staging system, albeit recent scientific advances,7 and the revised FIGO staging system for gynecologic cancer reflects major issues insufficiently, which include residual tumor status, different patterns of tumor spread to lymph node, blood and bone, classification of findings in sentinel node biopsies, and molecular markers as prognostic factors. A better FIGO staging system should have 3 basic characteristics such as validity, reliability and practicality.1 In other words, this staging system should be flexible and adaptable to significant scientific changes for validity, ensure that identical cases are assigned to the same stage category without ambiguity for reliability, and be user-friendly and suitable for use in different clinical environment for practicality. Thus, future efforts to revise the FIGO staging system should be made to classify disease status of gynecologic cancers more definitely, based on updated scientific evidence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2009.20.3.135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149584122", "source": "openalex"}

Setting A cohort study of women newly diagnosed with gynecological cancer at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Odense University Hospital (OUH) Denmark, during a 15-month period from October 1st 2006 to December 31st 2007. Method Data were obtained from four different questionnaires, the Electronic Patient Journal (EPJ) and The Danish Gynecological Cancer Database (DGCD). 161 women were included; ovarian cancer: 63, endometrial cancer: 50, cervical cancer: 34 and vulvar cancer: 14. Outcome measures were different delay types counted in days and the influence of four clinical important variables: Presence of alarm symptoms, age (≤ or > 60 years), performance of gynecological examination by the GP and notification of cancer suspicion on first referral from GP’s on the diagnostic delay (short delay ≤90 days and long delay >90 days). Results Across cancer type a median total delay of 101 days was observed. The 10% of women with the longest delay experienced a total delay of 436 days or more. Vulva cancer had the longest delays while women with ovarian cancer had shortest delay. Over one third (39%) of the women consulted their GP for reasons other than the alarm symptoms predefined by us. Gynecologic examination by the GP was less likely to be performed if the woman did not present with vaginal bleeding as an alarm symptom. The length of the delay was shortened by performance of a gynecological examination by the GP and a primary referral from the GP raising a cancer suspicion with the receiver. Conclusion Reducing diagnostic delays should be achievable, particularly for those most delayed, named as “the heavy tail”. Interventions aimed at reducing delays especially among the heavy tail need to be developed and creation of new valid instruments for measuring delay are essential to do so.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e31821d2770", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031923263", "source": "openalex"}

Endometrial carcinoma represents the largest group, with approximately 30% of these cancers caused by dMMR/MSI. Thus, testing for dMMR is now routine for endometrial cancer. Somatic mutations leading to dMMR account for approximately 90% of these cancers. However, in 5-10% of cases, MMR protein deficiency is due to a germline mutation in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or EPCAM. These germline mutations, known as Lynch syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of both endometrial and ovarian cancer, in addition to colorectal, gastric, urinary tract, and brain malignancies. So far, gynecological cancers with dMMR/MSI are not well characterized and markers for detection of MSI in gynecological cancers are not well defined. In addition, currently advanced endometrial cancers have a poor prognosis and are treated without regard to MSI status. Elucidation of the mechanism causing dMMR/MSI gynecological cancers would aid in diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Recently, a new immunotherapy was approved for the treatment of solid tumors with MSI that have recurred or progressed after failing traditional treatment strategies. In this review, we summarize the MMR defects and MSI observed in gynecological cancers, their prognostic value, and advances in therapeutic strategies to treat these cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12113319", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3100391307", "source": "openalex"}

DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and clinicaltrials.gov through August 2012. We also screened reference lists of retrieved articles and manually searched abstracts from conference proceedings. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and high-quality observational studies that compared outcomes for single-incision laparoscopy and conventional laparoscopy for gynecologic surgery in patients. Included studies met predefined quality criteria and reported, at minimum, on complications, conversions, and operative time. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, RESULTS: Six RCTs and 15 observational studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 2,085 patients (899 single-incision laparoscopies and 1,186 conventional laparoscopies). In the pooled analysis, there was no significant difference in the risk of total complications between single-incision laparoscopy and conventional laparoscopy groups (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.40; P=.97, random effects model). The meta-analysis was powered to detect a 5% difference in complications (power=0.8, alpha=0.05). Mean operative time for adnexal surgery performed by single-incision laparoscopy was 6.97 minutes longer than conventional laparoscopy (95% CI 0.16–13.77; P=.045; I2=47.2; random effects based on three RCTs). There was no significant difference in mean operative time for hysterectomy procedures performed by single-incision laparoscopy (8.29 minutes, 95% CI −5.85 to 22.43; P=.251; I2=83.6; random effects based on three RCTs). Clinical outcomes of postoperative pain, change in hemoglobin, length of hospital stay, and scar cosmesis could not be pooled because of paucity of data and lack of uniform reporting. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the risk of complications between single-incision laparoscopy and conventional laparoscopy approaches in gynecologic surgery. Studies with imprecise effect sizes suggest that single-incision laparoscopy may have longer operative time for adnexal surgery, but not for hysterectomy. Effects on other surgical outcomes remain uncertain. Single-incision laparoscopy is comparable with conventional multi-incision laparoscopy with respect to risk of complications but may take slightly longer to perform.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e318288828c", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099242722", "source": "openalex"}

MEDLINE was searched for all articles written in the English literature from July 1966 to May 2013. Reports were collected systematically and all the references were also reviewed. Malignant transformation of gynecologic benign diseases such as endometriosis, adenomyosis and LM to ovarian and endometrial cancer remains unclear. Hormonal factors, inflammation, familial predisposition, genetic alterations, growth factors, diet, altered immune system, environmental factors and oxidative stress may be causative factors in carcinogenesis. Early menarche, low parity, late menopause and infertility have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of these cancers. Ovarian cancers and endometriosis have been shown to have common genetic alterations such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH), PTEN, p53, ARID1A mutations. MicroRNAs have also been implicated in malignant transformation. Inflammation releases proinflammatory cytokines, and activates tumor associated macrophages (TAMS) and nuclear factor kappa b (NF-KB) signaling pathways that promote genetic mutations and carcinogenesis. MED12 mutations in LM and smooth muscle tumors of undetermined malignant potential (STUMP) may contribute to malignant transformation to LMS. A hyperestrogenic state may be shared in common with pathogenesis of adenomyosis, LM and endometrial cancer. However, the effect of these benign gynecologic diseases on endometrial cancer should be studied in detail. This review study indicates that endometriosis, LM, adenomyosis may be associated with increased risk of gynecological cancers such as endometrial and ovarian cancers. The patients who have these gynecological benign diseases should be counseled about the future risks of developing cancer. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between STUMPs, LMS and LM and characteristics and outcome endometrial carcinoma in adenomyotic patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.10.5589", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164284887", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: An investigator-designed questionnaire about abortion training in obstetrics and gynecology residency programs was mailed to all U.S. residency directors. Collected data included program information, abortion training, and numbers of residents trained. Data were analyzed to estimate differences in abortion training by region, program size, and type of training offered. RESULTS: Of the 252 questionnaires mailed, 185 (73%) were returned. Of the 185, 94 (51%) program directors reported routine instruction in elective abortion, 72 (39%) optional training, and 19 (10%) no training. Large programs and programs located in the Northeast and West Coast were significantly more likely to offer routine training in terminations (P < .01). In the programs offering routine training, more than 50% of residents received instruction in termination practices. Of those practices, the most common were first-trimester surgical abortion (85% of programs), followed by medical abortion (59%), second-trimester induction (51% of programs), and dilation and extraction (36%). As compared with those in programs with optional training, residents in programs with routine training were significantly more likely to receive instruction in all modalities of abortion provision and performed proportionally more first- and second-trimester terminations (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Routine training in elective abortion resulted in greater exposure to abortion practices and greater experience in more complicated abortion techniques during residency.

Although there have been advancements in cytotoxic chemotherapies, there has not been significant improvement in overall survival in these patients. While targeted therapies have shown some benefit in many solid tumors, further development of these agents is needed for the treatment of gynecologic malignancies. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) catalyzes the polyADP-ribosylation of proteins involved in DNA repair. Inhibitors of PARP were originally developed for cancers with homologous recombination deficiencies, such as those harboring mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. However, preclinical research and clinical trials have suggested that the activity of PARP inhibitors is not limited to those with BRCA mutations. PARP inhibitors may have activity in cancers deficient in other DNA repair genes, signaling pathways that mitigate DNA repair, or in combination with DNA-damaging agents independent of DNA repair dysfunction. Currently there are seven different PARP inhibitors in clinical development for cancer. While there has been promising clinical activity for some of these agents, there are still significant unanswered questions regarding their use. Going forward, specific questions that must be answered include timing of therapy, use in combination with cytotoxic agents or as single agent maintenance therapy, and whether there is a predictive biomarker that can be used with PARP inhibition. Even with large strides in the treatment of many gynecologic malignancies in recent years, it is imperative that we develop newer agents and methods to identify patients that may benefit from these compounds. The focus of this review will be on preclinical data, current clinical trials, and the future of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2013.00237", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2163840401", "source": "openalex"}

Commercial tissue microarrays were assessed using an optimized manual immunohistochemical method using MAb 26B3, a newly described monoclonal antibody. A positive result was defined as ≥5% of the sample demonstrating membranous staining. A semiquantitative staining algorithm, defined as the M-score, was used to analyze staining intensity between sample histotypes. MAb 26B3 showed uniform membranous staining and high levels of expression of FRA in ovarian, fallopian tube, and endometrial cancers. All serous ovarian cancers analyzed (70) were positive for FRA expression and no relationship to stage or grade was found. However, a significant difference for FRA expression, between serous and mucinous ovarian carcinomas, was demonstrated (P=0.014). In addition, approximately 90% of all endometrial adenocarcinomas were positive for FRA expression but, unlike ovarian serous carcinomas, a statistically significant relationship to grade was observed (P=0.0029). Although normal ovary is completely devoid of FRA immunoreactivity, normal fallopian tube and cortical serous/tubal inclusion cysts demonstrated uniform and intense FRA staining of columnar epithelium supporting the hypothesis that serous ovarian carcinoma is similar to the tubal epithelium. The data presented further support the hypothesis that FRA expression in gynecologic tumors is due to the cell of origin normally expressing this receptor. This is possibly due to an associated growth advantage, rather than the process of tumorigenesis resulting in aberrant expression of FRA per se.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0b013e3182774562", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2313984291", "source": "openalex"}

Experimental Design: Cohorts of eligible patients were treated daily for 3 days through an i.p. catheter. Vector doses ranged from 1 × 109 to 1 × 1012 viral particles per day. Toxicity was evaluated using CTCv3.0. CA-125 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria were used to determine clinical efficacy. Corollary biological studies included assessment of CRAd replication, wild-type virus generation, viral shedding, and neutralizing antibody response. Results: Twenty-one patients were treated. Adverse clinical effects were limited to grade 1/2 fever, fatigue, or abdominal pain. No vector-related grade 3/4 toxicities were noted. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were noted. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Over a 1 month follow-up, 15 (71%) patients had stable disease and six (29%) had progressive disease. No partial or complete responses were noted. Seven patients had a decrease in CA-125; four had a &amp;gt;20% drop. RGD-specific PCR showed the presence of study vector in ascites of 16 patients. Seven revealed an increase in virus after day 3, suggesting replication of Ad5-Δ24-RGD. Minimal wild-type virus generation was detected. Viral shedding studies showed insignificant shedding in the serum, saliva, and urine. Anti-adenoviral neutralizing antibody effects were prevalent. Conclusions: This study, the first to evaluate an infectivity-enhanced CRAd in human cancer, shows the feasibility, safety, potential antitumor response, and biological activity of this approach in ovarian cancer.

The primary care practitioner has a key role to play in this—they must recognize the symptoms and signs of gynecological cancer and make prompt evidence-based decisions regarding further investigation and referral. However, this is often difficult as many of the symptoms of gynecological cancers are nonspecific and are more likely to be caused by benign rather than malignant disease. As primary care is generally the first point of patient contact, those working in this setting usually encounter cancer patients at an earlier, and possibly less symptomatic, stage than practitioners in secondary care. Despite these challenges, research has improved our understanding of the symptoms patients present to primary care with, and a range of tests and referral pathways now exist in the UK and other countries to aid early diagnosis. Primary care practitioners can also play a key role in gynecological cancer prevention. A significant proportion of gynecological cancer is preventable either through lifestyle changes such as weight loss, or, for cervical cancer, vaccination and/or engagement with screening programs. Primary care provides an excellent opportunity to discuss cancer risk with patients and to promote risk reduction strategies and lifestyle change. In this article, the first in a series discussing cancer detection in primary care, we concentrate on gynecological cancer and focus on the three most common forms that a primary care practitioner is likely to encounter: ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer. We outline key risk factors, briefly discuss prevention and screening strategies, and offer practical guidance on the recognition of symptoms and signs and the investigation and referral of women with suspected cancer.

Rates of compliance with the methodologic criteria and their time trends were analyzed. Results: The proportion of articles using logistic regression analysis increased over time: 1.7% in 1985, 2.8% in 1990, and 6.5% in 1995 (P < .001 for trend). Violations and omissions of methodologic criteria for reporting logistic models were common. The research question, in terms of dependent and independent variables, was not clearly reported in 32.1%. The process of variable selection was inadequately described in 51.8% of the articles. Among articles with ranked independent variables, 85.1% did not report assessment of conformity to linear gradient. Tests for goodness of fit were not given in 93.2% of articles. The contribution of the independent variables could not be evaluated in 36.2% of the articles because of a lack of coding of the variables. Interactions between variables were not assessed in 86.4% of articles. Analysis of variations in the quality of logistic regression analyses over time showed no increase in reporting of the criteria concerning variable selection and goodness of fit. However, the proportion of articles reporting one quality criterion concerning interpretation of the substantive significance of independent variables showed a trend toward improvement: 42.3% in 1985, 73.6% in 1990, and 75.4% in 1995 (P = .004 for trend). Conclusion: The reporting of multivariable logistic regression models in the obstetrics and gynecology literature is poor, and the time trends of improvement in quality of reporting are not particularly encouraging.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(98)00537-7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994059850", "source": "openalex"}

Currently, no studies of US OB/GYN residents exist that question their knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward discussing age-related fertility decline and oocyte cryopreservation with patients.A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the fall of 2014 among residents in American Council for Graduate (ACOG) Medical Education-approved OB/GYN residency programs. Program directors were emailed via the ACOG Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology server listing and asked to solicit resident participation.Participants included 238 residents evenly distributed between post-graduate years 1-4 with varied post-residency plans; 90% of residents were women and 75% were 26-30 years old. The survey was divided into three sections: demographics, fertility awareness, and attitudes toward discussing fertility preservation options with patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted.A strong majority of residents (83%) believed an OB/GYN should initiate discussions about age-related fertility decline with patients (mean patient age 31.8), and 73% percent believed these discussions should be part of an annual exam. One third of residents overestimated the age at which there is a slight decline in female fertility, while nearly half of residents overestimated the age at which female fertility markedly declines. Over three-quarters of residents (78.4%) also overestimated the likelihood of success using assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). Residents were likely to support oocyte cryopreservation in cancer patients irrespective of the woman's age, but much less likely to support elective oocyte cryopreservation. For elective oocyte cryopreservation, 40% believed OB/GYNs should initiate discussions with patients (mean age 31.1), while only 20% believed this topic should be part of an annual exam.Because the study invitation was sent through US OB/GYN residency program directors rather than directly to residents, it is possible that some residents did not receive the invitation to participate. This limits the generalizability of the findings.Within the USA, there appears to be a critical need for improved education on fertility decline in OB/GYN residency programs. To promote informed reproductive decision-making among patients, efforts should be made to help OB/GYNs provide comprehensive fertility education to all women, while also respecting patient choices.None.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dev308", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2235432447", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: An anonymous, prospective, online questionnaire in English was posted to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation web site (http://ednf.org). RESULTS: Of the 1,769 of those who completed the survey, 1,225 reported a typed diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Further stratification to the three most common types and reproductive-aged women (n=775) allowed conclusions to be made about differences in rates of obstetric complications and gynecologic dysfunction compared with the general population and between types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Rates of obstetric outcomes for women who reported at least one pregnancy included term pregnancy in 69.7%, preterm birth in 25.2%, spontaneous abortion in 57.2%, and ectopic pregnancy in 5.1%. Infertility was reported by 44.1% of survey respondents. Normal menstrual cycles were reported by only 32.8% with intermenstrual bleeding occurring in 18.6%. Heavy menstrual bleeding was reported by 32.9% survey participants. Gynecologic pain reported included dysmenorrhea by 92.5% and dyspareunia by 77.0%. CONCLUSION: There is a much greater prevalence of obstetric and gynecologic issues reported by women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome than in the general population. Additionally, rates differed significantly among the three most common types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with vascular type having the highest rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and menstrual abnormalities. Physician providers should be aware of these challenges and should counsel patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome about relevant options and risks.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either droperidol 1.25 mg (Group D1, n = 45), droperidol 1.25 mg plus dexamethasone 8 mg (Group D2, n = 45), metoclopramide 10 mg (Group M1, n = 45), metoclopramide 10 mg plus dexamethasone 8 mg (Group M2, n = 45), granisetron 40 micro g/kg (Group G1, n = 45), or granisetron 40 micro g/kg plus dexamethasone 8 mg (Group G2, n = 45) immediately before the induction of anesthesia. A standard general anesthetic technique and postoperative analgesia were used throughout the study. Complete response, defined as no PONV and no administration of rescue antiemetic medication during the first 24 h after anesthesia, was 49% in Group D1, 60% in Group D2 (P = 0.199 versus Group D1), 51% in Group M1, 62% in Group M2 (P = 0.198 versus Group M1), 80% in Group G1, and 96% in Group G2 (P = 0.025 versus Group G1). Our results suggest that dexamethasone enhances the antiemetic efficacy of granisetron but does not potentiate the other antiemetics-droperidol and metoclopramide-in female patients undergoing major gynecological surgery. Implications: We compared the efficacy of dexamethasone plus three different antiemetics-droperidol, metoclopramide, and granisetron-for the prevention of nausea and vomiting after gynecologic surgery.

In the patients with ovarian cancer the sensitivities of LSA and CA 125 for patients with clinical evidence of disease were 71% and 76% respectively; the specificities for patients with no clinical evidence of disease were 90% and 86% respectively. Using both tumor markers, a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 85% was obtained. Additionally, CA 125 was elevated in 59% of patients with clinically advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, and LSA was elevated in 63% of patients with clinical evidence of cervical cancer. Neither CEA nor CA 19-9 levels correlated with clinical status in patients with ovarian or cervical cancer. The values of Ca 125 and LSA were examined in relation to the findings at second-look surgery in patients with ovarian cancer. Absence of elevated tumor markers does not obviate the need for second-look surgery; the false negative rate for CA 125 was 40% (6/15). However, the finding of two elevated plasma markers 1 month or more apart, in ovarian cancer patients who were clinically free of disease, was strongly suggestive of recurrent cancer; 13 of 14 such patients showed this association.

A nursing intervention to address these \"patient-related barriers\" was developed based on Johnson's self-regulation theory. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether provision of individually tailored sensory and coping information about analgesic side effects and specific information to counter misconceptions would enhance pain management in a sample of 43 women with gynecologic cancers. It was hypothesized that at 1-month post-test and 2-month follow-up, those subjects randomized to the information condition would (a) have lower barriers scores; (b) use more adequate analgesic medication; (c) have lower analgesic side effect scores; (d) have lower pain intensity scores; and (e) experience less pain interference with life and better overall quality of life compared to those in the care-as-usual control group. There was no main effect for group on any of the dependent variables. Rather, all women reported a decrease in barriers between baseline and 2-month follow-up (p < .05); all subjects experienced a decrease in pain interference with life scores between baseline and 1-month post-test (p < .05); and there was a significant shift of women from unacceptable pain management at baseline to acceptable pain management at 1-month post-test (p < .05). In addition, the majority of women reported that the intervention contained novel and useful information that helped them to feel more comfortable taking pain medication, to be less concerned about addiction, and helped them talk more openly about pain with a doctor or nurse. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Anesthesia was initially maintained with des- flurane 2.5% (subsequently titrated to maintain an electroencephalogram-bispectral index value of 60) and nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Before skin incision, an infusion of either esmolol (5 μg · kg−1 · min−1) or remifentanil (0.05 μg · kg−1 · min−1) was started and titrated to maintain the heart rate within 25% of the baseline value.

Esmolol (12.8 ± 13.1 μg · kg−1 · min−1) and remifentanil (0.04 ± 0.02 μg · kg−1 · min−1) infusions were equally effective in maintaining a stable heart rate during these laparoscopic procedures. Although the mivacurium requirement was larger in the Esmolol group (7 ± 5 vs 3 ± 4 mg), the Esmolol group reported a smaller incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (4% vs 35%).

External pneumatic calf compression was most effective during the first five days postoperatively and also reduced the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in patients at highest risk. When applied during surgery and for five days postoperatively, external pneumatic calf compression significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative venous thrombosis.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W288986732", "source": "openalex"}

Much of our current knowledge surrounding the FRT microbiota relates to the vaginal microbiota, where ‘health’ has long been associated with low bacterial diversity and Lactobacillus dominance. This concept has recently been challenged as women can have a diverse vaginal microbial composition in the absence of symptomatic disease. The structures of the upper FRT (the endocervix, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries) have distinct, lower biomass microbiotas than the vagina; however, the existence of permanent microbiotas at these sites is disputed. During homeostasis, a balance exists between the FRT bacteria and the immune system that maintains immune quiescence. Alterations in the bacteria, immune system, or local environment may result in perturbances to the FRT microbiota, defined as dysbiosis. The inflammatory signature of a perturbed or “dysbiotic” FRT microbiota is characterized by elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cervical and vaginal fluid. It appears that vaginal homeostasis can be disrupted by two different mechanisms: first, a shift toward increased bacterial diversity can trigger vaginal inflammation, and second, local immunity is altered in some manner, which disrupts the microbiota in response to an environmental change. FRT dysbiosis can have negative effects on reproductive health. This review will examine the increasing evidence for the involvement of the FRT microbiotas and inflammation in gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis, infertility, and endometrial and ovarian cancer; however, the precise mechanisms by which bacteria are involved in these conditions remains speculative at present. While only in their infancy, the use of antibiotics and probiotics to therapeutically alter the FRT microbiota is being studied and is discussed herein. Our current understanding of the intimate relationship between immunity and the FRT microbiota is in its early days, and more research is needed to deepen our mechanistic understanding of this relationship and to assess how our present knowledge can be harnessed to assist in diagnosis and treatment of gynecologic conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/frph.2022.963752", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4290744543", "source": "openalex"}

Prolonged median survival can be achieved in those patients entirely free of tumor after surgery by the administration of postsurgical platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. However, residual tumor is present in the majority of patients, which limits survival prognosis. Different therapy approaches should be utilized to improve prognosis in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce \"downstaging\" of the tumor and thus improve operability. Here, evidence of large ascites volume (>500 mL) can be used to identify those patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In a prospective, nonrandomized Phase II study, 31 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received 3 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy, followed by tumor debulking surgery and 3 additional cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy. During the same period, 32 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received conventional therapy (tumor debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy). The two groups were investigated and compared with respect to tumor resection rates, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery, duration of surgery, and median survival.The tumor resection rate in the patient group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that of the conventionally treated group; the median survival time of 42 months versus 23 months also was significantly longer (P = 0.007). Time spent in surgery, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery were not significantly different.Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of FIGO Stage IIIC who will benefit only marginally from conventional therapy can be identified by evidence of large ascites volume. Higher tumor resection rates and longer median survival can be achieved in these patients by the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The objectives of the study were: to assess the subjective QOL of stable Sudanese women cancer outpatients and their family caregivers, using the WHO 26-item QOL Instrument; compare with matched general population groups, as well as diabetic and psychiatric patient groups; examine patient-caregiver concordance in ratings; and assess the variables associated with their QOL, with a view to identifying factors that can enhance quality of care. Methods Responses of oncology outpatients with breast cancer (117), cervical cancer (46) and ovarian cancer (18) (aged 44.6, SD 11.5) were compared with those of their family caregivers and matched general population groups. Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Results The cancer groups had similar QOL domain scores, which were significantly lower than those of their caregivers, but higher than the control group as well as those of psychiatric and diabetic patients studied previously. Patients who were married, with higher education, better employment, and with longer duration of illness had higher QOL. Patients on radiotherapy and their caregivers had higher QOL scores. Correlations between patient's ratings and caregiver impression of patient's QOL were high. Caregiver impression was a significant predictor of patient's and caregiver's QOL. Other predictors for the patient were: currently feeling sick and duration of illness; for the caregiver: feeling sick, relationship to patient, and age. Conclusion Cancer patients in stable condition and with psychosocial support can hope to enjoy good QOL with treatment. The findings constitute an evidence base for the country's cancer care program, to boost national health education about prognosis in cancer. Families living with women cancer patients are vulnerable and need support if the patient is recently diagnosed, less educated, single, not formally employed; and the caregiver is female, parent, younger, less educated, unemployed and feels sick. Clinicians need to invest in the education and support of family caregivers. The patient-caregiver dyad should be regarded as a unit for treatment in cancer care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-7-102", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2008191088", "source": "openalex"}

The NH2-terminal RING domains of both proteins act as interaction modules and form a ubiquitin ligase, which has functions in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint regulation, and mitosis. Interestingly, up-regulated expression of truncated BARD1 isoforms was found to be associated with poor prognosis in breast and ovarian cancers and, in a hormonally regulated fashion, in the human cytotrophoblast, a cell type with properties reminiscent of cancer cells. We therefore performed reverse transcription-PCR to determine the structure of BARD1 isoforms in cell lines derived from hormone-dependent and hormone-independent cancers. We found a specific combination of isoforms, generated by differential splicing and alternative transcription initiation, mostly lacking the BRCA1 interaction domain, in gynecologic but not hematologic cancer cell lines. To investigate the prevalence of BARD1 isoforms in tumors, we applied immunohistochemistry to ovarian cancers, using antibodies distinguishing full-length BARD1 and isoforms. Expression of NH2 terminally truncated BARD1 was correlated with advanced stage of cancer, and expression of spliced isoforms was typical for clear cell carcinoma, the ovarian cancer with worst prognosis, suggesting a role of BARD1 isoforms in cancer progression. To challenge this hypothesis, we silenced BARD1 isoforms in ovarian cancer cells that lacked wild-type BARD1 by siRNA interference, which led to a complete proliferation arrest. Thus, BARD1 isoform expression is required for cancer cell proliferation, which is compatible with the notion that BARD1 isoforms act as cancer maintenance genes.

Fiberoptic examination revealed the vocal cords or cords and posterior or anterior epiglottis in 96 and no trace of dye in 99 patients. One patient regurgitated dye immediately after induction, and the stain was seen on the LMA after removal. The remaining 99 LMAs were not stained. Thirty patients were randomly selected for fiberoptic examination of the laryngopharynx before neuromuscular block was antagonized. Methylene blue staining did not occur in any of these patients. In 91 patients with complete pH data, regurgitation (pH < 4.0) did not occur.

After premedication with midazolam 2 mg IV, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg · kg−1 IV in combination with either esmolol 1 mg · kg−1 IV (n = 27) or remifentanil 1 μg · kg−1 IV (n = 26) and succinylcholine 1 mg · kg−1 IV according to a randomized, double-blinded protocol. Anesthesia was initially maintained with des- flurane 2.5% (subsequently titrated to maintain an electroencephalogram-bispectral index value of 60) and nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Before skin incision, an infusion of either esmolol (5 μg · kg−1 · min−1) or remifentanil (0.05 μg · kg−1 · min−1) was started and titrated to maintain the heart rate within 25% of the baseline value. Mivacurium, 0.04 mg/kg IV, bolus doses were administered to maintain a stable peak inspiratory pressure. Esmolol (12.8 ± 13.1 μg · kg−1 · min−1) and remifentanil (0.04 ± 0.02 μg · kg−1 · min−1) infusions were equally effective in maintaining a stable heart rate during these laparoscopic procedures. Although the mivacurium requirement was larger in the Esmolol group (7 ± 5 vs 3 ± 4 mg), the Esmolol group reported a smaller incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (4% vs 35%). Both drugs were associated with frequent \"postanesthesia care unit bypass\" rates (78–81%), short times to \"home readiness\" (119–120 min), excellent patient satisfaction (81–85%), and rapid resumption of normal activities (2.6–3.2 d). Fast-tracked patients were ready for discharge home significantly earlier (112 ± 46 vs 151 ± 50 min). We concluded that esmolol infusion is an acceptable alternative to remifentanil infusion for maintaining hemodynamic stability during desflurane-based fast-track anesthesia for outpatient gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Implications Adjunctive use of a variable-rate infusion of esmolol during outpatient anesthesia with desflurane-nitrous oxide was associated with less postoperative nausea and vomiting than a remifentanil infusion.

A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned into three groups to receive an intraperitoneal instillation of 20 mL of either bupivacaine 0.5% (Group B), ropivacaine 0.75% (Group R) or saline (Group S) at the end of surgery. All patients received analgesia with acetaminophen and ketoprofen IV infusions. Pain was assessed by using a 0–10 graded numerical scale (NS) every 5 min in the postanesthesia care unit and IV morphine was administered if NS was >4. Assessment of pain was continued every 4 h on the ward, and subcutaneous morphine was injected if needed to keep the NS score < 4. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was rated on a 4-point scale. The morphine consumption at wake-up and over the first 24 h was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in Group B (mean, 0.92 mg at wake-up; 3.08 mg over 24 h) and in Group R (mean, 0.25 mg at wake-up; 0.69 mg over 24 h), than in Group S (mean, 4.18 mg at wake-up; 12.93 mg over 24 h). The morphine-sparing effect of ropivacaine was significantly greater than that of bupivacaine. Both local anesthetics were effective in the prevention of PONV. We concluded that local anesthetics should be instilled in all gynecologic patients at the end of all laparoscopic procedures. Implications Local anesthetic instillation (ropivacaine rather than bupivacaine) at the end of laparoscopy prevents postoperative pain and dramatically decreases the need for morphine. This technique, compared with placebo, is safe, improves patient comfort, shortens the stay in the postoperative care unit and decreases nursing care in the ward.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000539-200008000-00032", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035702508", "source": "openalex"}

Women may use herbs and supplements for chronic gynecologic conditions, such as menopause, premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, cyclic mastalgia, and infertility. This review is an evidence‐based evaluation of herbs and supplements for these conditions. Therapies that carry a higher level of support from randomized controlled trial evidence include black cohosh for menopause; vitamins B 1 and E for dysmenorrhea; calcium, vitamin B 6 , and chasteberry for premenstrual syndrome; and chasteberry for cyclic mastalgia. There were too few trials involving herbs and supplements in infertility to warrant a solid recommendation, but chasteberry, antioxidants, and Fertility Blend have some preliminary support.

Recovery after anesthesia, with special focus on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), was assessed. Control groups received a similar desflurane anesthetic (placebo) or a propofol-infusion-based (active control) anesthetic. The study design was randomized, controlled, and double-blind (regarding ondansetron) and single-blind (regarding the anesthetic technique). Early recovery (eye opening, orientation, following commands, sitting) was similar in the three groups. However, overall home readiness (toleration of oral fluids, walking, pain tolerable by oral analgesics, no or only mild nausea) was achieved faster in the desflurane group receiving ondansetron (109 [21-937] min, P < 0.01) and in the propofol group (110 [33-642] min, P < 0.001) when compared to the desflurane only group (372 [45-723] min) (median [range]). The total incidence of PONV in the desflurane-only group was 80% (P < 0.01), compared to 40% and 20% in the desflurane group receiving ondansetron and the propofol group, respectively. The postoperative antiemetic requirements were consistently and significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the desflurane-only group compared to the other two groups. Postoperative sedation, analgesic requirements, and psychomotor recovery (assessed by the Maddox Wing and the Digit Symbol Substitution Tests) were similar in the three groups. Our results suggest that in order to achieve a propofol-like recovery profile in patients with a high likelihood of PONV, desflurane should be combined with a potent antiemetic (e.g., ondansetron).

Conventional polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of HPV types in cervicovaginal samples obtained from patients during gynecologic examination.One hundred four (n = 104) of the women were excluded from the study because of the incomplete data and a total of 403 women were used for the final analysis. There were, 93 (23%) women with cytologic abnormality and 310 (77%) women with normal cytology. Overall, 23% of the women was HPV positive. The overall prevalence of HPV in women with abnormal Pap smears was 36% (93/403), of which in ASCUS 22%, LSIL 51% and HSIL 60%. Also, HPV DNA was positive in 20% of the women with normal cervical cytology. The most common HPV types in cytologically normal women were as follows; HPV 16 (36%), HPV 6 (22%) and HPV 18 (13%).

The most common HPV types in cytologically abnormal women were HPV 16 (35%), HPV6 (19%) and HPV18 (8%). The rate of multiple HPV infections in women with normal Pap test was 2.2%.HPV prevalence and type distribution in this study were similar to that reported worldwide at least in our study population.

Outcome measurements include the number and stage of screen-detected cancers, the number and stage of cancers not detected at screening, the number of equivocal screening results requiring recall/repetition, and the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease.Thirteen epithelial ovarian malignancies (12 invasive and one borderline), developed in the cohort.

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR is a signaling pathway in mammal cells that coordinates important cell activities. It has a critical function in the survival, growth, and proliferation of malignant cells and was object of important research in the last two decades. The mTOR pathway emerges as an attractive therapeutic target in cancer because it serves as a convergence point for many growth stimuli and, through its downstream substrates, controls cellular processes that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of cancer. Aberrant PI3K‐dependent signaling occurs frequently in a wide range of tumor types, including endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. The present study reviewed the available evidence regarding the potential impact of some mTOR pathway inhibitors in the treatment of gynecological cancer. Few advances in medical management have occurred in recent years in the treatment of advanced or recurrent gynecological malignancies, and a poor prognosis remains.

This study is centered on the role of some nutraceuticals as anticancer agents and on their efficiency in the oncological gynecological field. Gynecological cancers include cervical, ovarian, and breast neoplasia and these are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the female population. Cervical neoplasia affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 40 years and is considered the second leading cause of death for women worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong association of this cancer with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, independent of any others risk factors. Ovarian cancer represents about 4% of all women's cancers and breast neoplasia registers 52.8 new cases per 100,000 women annually. Since ancient times, herbal therapies have shown a wide range of beneficial effects and a high potential for safeguarding human health. Azadirachta indica (Neem) is a medicinal plant of Indian origin, a tree with more of 140 isolated compounds and at least 35 biologically active principles that have shown an important influence as tumor suppressors by interfering with the carcinogenesis process. Used for centuries in Asia as a natural remedy for cancer, neem compounds present in bark, leaves, flowers, and seed oil have been shown to possess properties such as chemopreventive capacity, apoptotic activities, immunomodulatory effects, and induction of p53-independent apoptosis.

Methods: Patients were stratified according to operative time and type of tumor and were randomized into two arms: A) early oral feeding and B) nasogastric decompression followed by feeding at the first passage of flatus. Variables assessed included nausea, vomiting, time to first passage of flatus and stool, time elapsed before adequate tolerance of a regular diet, postoperative stay, and complications. Results: Sixty-one patients were randomized into each arm. The types of tumor, the surgical procedures performed, and the operative times were similar in both groups. Early oral feeding in patients in arm A was associated with a significantly faster resolution of postoperative ileus (P < .01), with a more rapid return to a regular diet (P < .01), with an earlier first passage of stool (P < .01), and with a shorter postoperative stay (P < .05) than patients in arm B. Rates of nausea and vomiting were similar in both arms. Hindered deglutition and nasal soreness caused by the nasogastric tube were observed in 88% of patients in arm B. Insertion of a nasogastric tube was necessary in six patients in arm A (10%), and three of these had postoperative complications. Thus, early feeding was feasible in 95% of patients and did not seem to be related to preoperative chemotherapy, tumor type, or lymphadenectomy. Conclusion: Early feeding is feasible and well tolerated and is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and a more rapid recovery in patients undergoing major surgery for gynecologic malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(98)00401-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980262487", "source": "openalex"}

In general, disease-, treatment-, or symptom-specific questionnaires are assumed to be better able to identify between-group differences (sensitivity) and changes over time (responsiveness) than are cancer-specific or generic questionnaires. However, little work has tested this assumption in oncology. We set out to (<i>a</i>) identify all multidimensional HRQoL questionnaires used in studies with women with gynecologic cancer and (<i>b</i>) evaluate their track records in identifying minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs), with a view to making recommendations. <h3>Methods:</h3> We searched MEDLINE using the term <i>quality of life</i> and each gynecologic cancer type, as well as the names of identified questionnaires. We used 10% of the scale range as the threshold for an MCID. <h3>Results:</h3> We identified 1 generic (SF-36/SF-12), 3 cancer-specific (European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ] C30, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G], and short-form Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System [CARES-SF]), and 1 disease-specific (QOL-Ovarian Cancer Patient Version) HRQoL questionnaires and 5 disease-specific (QLQ-OV28, FACT-O for ovarian, QLQ-CX24, FACT-Cx for cervical and FACT-V for vulvar), 1 treatment-specific (FACT and Gynecologic Oncology Group-Ntx for neurotoxicity), and 2 symptom-specific (FACT-Anemia and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness and Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue) modules. Twenty-seven articles reported results from 26 studies in which an MCID had been identified. The FACIT9s anemia and fatigue subscales were more sensitive, and the neurotoxicity subscale more sensitive and responsive than the FACT-G on at least 1 comparison. However, we found no evidence for superior performance by the FACT-G compared with the SF-36 or EORTC and FACIT disease-specific modules versus the QLQ-C30 and FACT-G. There was also little evidence to favor EORTC versus FACIT questionnaires or vice versa. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> The evidence we reviewed offered little support for the hypothesis that disease-, symptom-, or treatment-specific instruments are more sensitive and responsive than cancer-specific or generic questionnaires. However, conclusions were limited by the small number of head-to-head comparisons available.

This review examines publications in this area. Recent findings PET scans are mostly performed using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). It is valuable in primary staging of untreated advanced cervical cancer, for posttreatment unexplained tumor marker elevation and restaging of potentially curable recurrent cervical cancer. Its value in early-stage cervical cancer is limited. In ovarian cancer, sequential imaging predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and survival. It also provides benefits when increases in serum CA 125 or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging defined recurrence is noted but biopsy deemed infeasible. A few studies have shown that FDG-PET may facilitate optimal management of endometrial cancer, especially for posttherapy surveillance and after salvage therapy. FDG-PET is potentially useful in selected gestational trophoblastic neoplasia by monitoring response and localizing viable tumors after chemotherapy. Scanty studies have been reported in vulvar and vaginal cancer. The methodology and prospects of using integrated PET/computed tomography in the management of gynecological cancer are discussed. Other PET compounds are briefly introduced. Summary The role of PET or PET/computed tomography has evolved from a diagnostic tool into a potential indicator of response to treatment and prognosis.

Methods and materials : Sixty‐six patients programmed to receive brachytherapy in two hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) were included in this study. The patients were randomly allocated to either the study group ( n =32) or the control group ( n =34). Patients in both groups received training regarding brachytherapy, but only study group patients received training in relaxation and guided imagery. After collection of sociodemographic data, all patients were given a set of questionnaires on anxiety and depression: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and on quality of life: Cuestionario de Calidad de Vida QL‐CA‐AFex (CCV), prior to, during and after brachytherapy. Results : The study group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in anxiety ( p =0.008), depression ( p =0.03) and body discomfort ( p =0.04) compared with the control group. Conclusions : The use of relaxation techniques and guided imagery is effective in reducing the levels of anxiety, depression and body discomfort in patients who must remain isolated while undergoing brachytherapy.

METHODS: Data were collected for patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecologic surgery from January 2000 to January 2009. Incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism diagnosed within 6 weeks of surgery was estimated. Fisher's exact test was used to estimate the association between the presence of perioperative venous thromboembolism and categorical variables. RESULTS: Six (of 849) patients developed symptomatic venous thromboembolism (0.7%, 95% confidence interval: 0.024–1.44%). The median time to diagnosis of venous thromboembolism was postoperative day 15.5 (range, 1–41 days), median body mass index was 25.4 kg/m2 (range, 18.4–50 kg/m2), median operative time was 176 minutes (range, 53–358 minutes), and median estimated blood loss was 125 mL (range, 10–250 mL). Five of 430 (1.2%) patients with a history of gynecologic malignancy developed postoperative thromboembolic events. Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in three of 662 (0.5%) patients undergoing intermediate complexity procedures and three of 106 (2.8%) patients undergoing high-complexity procedures. Three patients with venous thromboembolism (50%) had a history of at least one previous modality of cancer treatment before laparoscopy. One patient (17%) had DVT only, four (67%) had pulmonary emboli without an identified DVT, and one (17%) had both. There were no associated mortalities. CONCLUSION: The incidence of thromboembolism in patients undergoing low- and intermediate-complexity, minimally invasive surgery was low, even among patients with a gynecologic malignancy. Patients undergoing high-complexity, minimally invasive procedures may benefit from postoperative anticoagulation.

First, understanding the proper techniques for the initial examination is key to establishing a long-term relationship with this age group. Reservations about the first gynecologic examination are common, and the practitioner’s goal is foremost to make the patient as comfortable as possible. Preventive health in this patient population is key, and practitioners should become comfortable with providing education about topics as diverse as sexuality, eating disorders, and dating violence. Furthermore, the frequency with which teenagers report sexual activity and the high unintended pregnancy rate in this age group makes counseling regarding effective contraception essential. Additionally, practitioners are encouraged to take the opportunity to discuss the availability of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with adolescents. In 2007, adolescents were designated as a special population, given the frequency with which they acquire and clear mild HPV-related cervical dysplasia. More conservative treatment in this population is generally favored. During their transition through puberty, disorders of menstruation become the most common complaint requiring the attention of the gynecologist. Most commonly, anovulation serves as the cause behind such abnormal bleeding. Polycystic ovarian syndrome can develop in early puberty and carry its consequences into adulthood. Infertility, diabetes, and hirsutism mark the most important components of the syndrome and require age-appropriate management. Finally, the consequences of endometriosis on the future fertility of adolescents have brought early intervention to light. Recognition and prompt treatment are advocated to prevent the future implications of this disease. Unique clinical gynecologic problems in adolescents require particular expertise, caring, and consideration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e31819b6303", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4237674126", "source": "openalex"}

The mechanism responsible is unknown. Objective: The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis, formulated a priori, that the dependence of LH pulsatility and ovarian function on energy availability declines with gynecological age (years since menarche). Design: The study was a controlled experiment repeated in two menstrual cycles, performed 2001–2004. Setting: The study was conducted at a university laboratory and general clinical research center. Participants: The study population consisted of healthy, habitually sedentary, young women of normal body composition with 5–8 yr (adolescents, n = 9) and 14–18 yr (adults, n = 10) of gynecological age recruited by advertisement from approximately 9000 women aged 18–34 yr in a college community. Samples were similar in age of menarche, length of menstrual cycle and luteal phase, body size and composition, aerobic capacity, and dietary intake. None were withdrawn due to adverse effects. Interventions: Interventions included energy availabilities of 45 and 10 kcal/kg of fat-free mass per day for 5 d in the early follicular phases of separate menstrual cycles in random order. Main Outcome Measures: LH pulsatility, estradiol, and luteal phase length were measured. Results: Low energy availability reduced LH pulse frequency in adolescents (P < 0.01) but not adults (P = 0.39), did not increase LH pulse amplitude in either group (both P = 0.13), and suppressed 24-h mean LH in adolescents (P = 0.01) but not adults (P = 0.72). Estradiol was unaffected (both P = 0.48), but the subsequent luteal phase was shorter in adolescents (P < 0.01).

However, instruments for identifying and monitoring somatic symptoms are few in number and not widely used. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief measure of the severity of somatic symptoms. Methods The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-15 comprises 15 somatic symptoms from the PHQ, each symptom scored from 0 (\"not bothered at all\") to 2 (\"bothered a lot\"). The PHQ-15 was administered to 6000 patients in eight general internal medicine and family practice clinics and seven obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Outcomes included functional status as assessed by the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20), self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Results As PHQ-15 somatic symptom severity increased, there was a substantial stepwise decrement in functional status on all six SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. PHQ-15 scores of 5, 10, 15, represented cutoff points for low, medium, and high somatic symptom severity, respectively. Somatic and depressive symptom severity had differential effects on outcomes.

Preoperative risk assessment of the individual patient will provide insight into the level of risk and the potential benefits of prophylaxis. Common risks include a history of venous thromboembolism, age, major surgery, cancer, use of oral contraceptives or hormone therapy, and obesity. Based on the presence of risk factors, the patient should be categorized into one of four risk groups and appropriate thromboprophylaxis prescribed. Randomized clinical trials in gynecologic surgery and general surgery have established the significant value of thromboprophylaxis. For moderate- and high-risk patients undergoing surgery for benign gynecologic conditions, low-dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight (LMW) heparins, intermittent pneumatic leg compression, and graded compression stockings all have demonstrated benefit. If using low-dose unfractionated heparin in high-risk patients, the heparin should be administered 5,000 units every 8 hours. Because DVT often begins in the perioperative period, it is important to initiate low-dose unfractionated heparin or administer the first LMW heparin dose either 2 hours preoperatively or 6 hours after the surgical procedure. Low molecular weight heparin has the advantage of being administered once daily but is more expensive than low-dose unfractionated heparin. In addition, LMW heparin has not been shown to be more effective and has similar risk of bleeding complications when compared with low-dose unfractionated heparin. In the very high-risk patient, a combination of two prophylactic methods may be advisable and continuing LMW heparin for 28 days postoperatively appears to be of added benefit.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e31823d389e", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101135089", "source": "openalex"}

All laparoscopic injuries were localized to the iliac arteries, caused bleeding, and were treated with arterial suture without complications or late sequelae. Injuries during laparotomy were most frequently venous and all patients had hemorrhage as the main symptom. In one case the external iliac vein was ligated, with immediate postoperative swelling, and in another case the external iliac artery was ligated, after which the patient developed postoperative ischemia.

Results of epidemiologic studies suggest that the onset and multiplication of these cancers are associated with estrogen. Estrogens are metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and converted into catecholestrogens, which are carcinogens. CYP1A1 has several polymorphisms, the major one being T6235C transition in the non-coding 3'-flanking region (MspI polymorphism), and another being A4889G transition in exon 7 (Ile/Val polymorphism). These polymorphisms can affect the metabolites of estrogens and contribute to the susceptibility to gynecological malignancy. In this study, to determine whether CYP1A1 polymorphism plays a role in the development of gynecological malignancy in the Japanese population, we assessed the association of CYP1A1 polymorphism in Japanese patients with gynecological malignancy in comparison to that in controls. The odds ratios (ORs) of Ile/Val polymorphism were 1.16 in ovarian cancer patients and 1.70 in endometrial cancer patients. The ORs of MspI polymorphism were 1.33 in ovarian cancer patients and 0.88 in endometrial cancer patients. No significant association was found between these CYP1A1 polymorphisms and gynecological malignancy. Although the frequency of CYP1A1 polymorphism in the Japanese population is higher than that in the Caucasian population, CYP1A1 polymorphism is not related to gynecological malignancies in Japanese population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-1438.2003.13607.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2338886696", "source": "openalex"}

The information was obtained from a computer search of MEDLINE for studies published in the English language regarding angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors in gynecological malignancies between 1970 and December 2003; additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. In ovarian cancer, various different angiogenic activators have been found to correlate with microvessed density (MVD), stage, lymph node and peritoneal metastasis, and survival. In cervical cancer, correlation has been seen between increased angiogenic markers and stage, grade, tumor size, and survival. Studies in endometriat cancer show correlation of angiogenic markers with stage, grade, MVD, and survival. Whereas, in gestational trophoblastic neoplasm (GTD) only few markers have been studied, and some correlated with progression. Information on anti angiogenic drugs currently in ongoing and upcoming trials in gynecological malignancies is also presented.

Intravenous morphine, 4 mg, was studied as a positive analgesic control. Methods In this multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, women experiencing moderate-to-severe pain on the first day after abdominal hysterectomy or myomectomy received one intravenous dose of parecoxib sodium, 20 or 40 mg, ketorolac, 30 mg, morphine, 4 mg, or placebo. Analgesic efficacy and tolerability were evaluated for 24 h postdose or until patients, whose pain was not adequately controlled, opted to receive rescue analgesia. Results Two hundred two patients were enrolled. All treatment groups had comparable demographics and baseline pain status. All active treatments had an equally rapid time to onset of analgesia (10-23 min). Overall, each parecoxib sodium dose and ketorolac were significantly superior to morphine and placebo for most measures of analgesic efficacy at most time points, including a significantly longer (two- to threefold) time to rescue analgesia (P &lt;/= 0.05). All treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions Single intravenous doses of parecoxib sodium, 20 mg and 40 mg, have comparable analgesic effects and are well tolerated after laparotomy surgery.

However, this relationship has not been well evaluated within clinical learning environments.To evaluate the relationship between student attendance and academic performance in a medical student obstetrics/gynecology clinical rotation.A prospective cohort study of student attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities during a full academic year (September 2011 to June 2012) within a publicly funded university teaching hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Students were expected to attend 64 activities (26 clinical activities and 38 tutorial-based activities) but attendance was not mandatory. All 147 fourth-year medical students who completed an 8-week obstetrics/gynecology rotation were included.Student attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities, recorded using a paper-based logbook.The overall examination score (out of a possible 200 points) was obtained using an 11-station objective structured clinical examination (40 points), an end-of-year written examination comprising 50 multiple-choice questions (40 points) and 6 short-answer questions (40 points), and an end-of-year long-case clinical/oral examination (80 points). Students were required to have an overall score of 100 points (50%) and a minimum of 40 points in the long-case clinical/oral examination (50%) to pass.The mean attendance rate was 89% (range, 39%-100% [SD, 11%], n = 57/64 activities). Male students (84% attendance, P = .001) and students who failed an end-of-year examination previously (84% attendance, P = .04) had significantly lower rates. There was a positive correlation between attendance and overall examination score (r = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.44-0.70]; P < .001). Both clinical attendance (r = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.32-0.64]; P < .001) and tutorial-based attendance (r = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40-0.70]; P < .001) were positively correlated with overall examination score. The associations persisted after controlling for confounding factors of student sex, age, country of origin, previous failure in an end-of-year examination, and the timing of the rotation during the academic year. Distinction grades (overall score of ≥60%) were present only among students with attendance rates of 80% or higher. The odds of a distinction grade increased with each 10% increase in attendance (adjusted odds ratio, 5.52; 95% CI, 2.17-14.00). The majority of failure grades (6/10 students; 60%) occurred in students with attendance rates lower than 80%. The adjusted odds ratio for failure with attendance rates of 80% or higher was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.72).Among fourth-year medical students completing an 8-week obstetrics/gynecology clinical rotation, attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities was positively correlated with overall examination scores.

(11)C-choline PET and (18)F-FDG PET were performed within 2 wk of each other on each patient. The patients fasted for at least 5 h before the PET examinations, and PET was performed 5 min ((11)C-choline) and 60 min ((18)F-FDG) after injection of each tracer. PET images were corrected for the transmission data, and the reconstructed images were visually analyzed. Then, the standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for quantitative assessment of tumor uptake. PET results were compared with surgical histology or >6 mo of clinical observations.Of 18 untreated patients, (11)C-choline PET correctly detected primary tumors in 16 patients, whereas (18)F-FDG PET detected them in 14 patients. In 1 patient with small uterine cervical cancer and 1 diabetic patient with uterine corpus cancer, only (11)C-choline PET was true-positive. Both tracers were false-negative for atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium in 1 patient and were false-positive for pelvic inflammatory disease in 1 patient. For the diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer (n = 3), (11)C-choline PET and (18)F-FDG PET were true-positive in 1 patient, whereas neither tracer could detect cystic recurrent tumor and microscopic peritoneal disease in the other 2 patients.

The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is expressed in most transformed cells, where it displays potent anti-apoptotic, cell-survival and potentially, transforming activities. IGF-1R expression and activation are typical hallmarks associated with tumor initiation and progression. Multiple approaches have been used to abrogate IGF-1R signaling for targeted cancer therapy including antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These novel IGF-1R targeting agents have produced significant experimental and clinical results in many cancers and generated considerable optimism in the field of cancer therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1517/14728222.2013.749863", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978387360", "source": "openalex"}

Furthermore, patients desire more R/S involvement by the medical community; however, physicians typically do not incorporate R/S assessment into medical interviews with patients. The effects of physicians' R/S beliefs on willingness to participate in controversial clinical practices such as medical abortions and physician-assisted suicide has been evaluated, but how a physician's R/S beliefs may affect other medical decision-making is unclear. Methods Using SurveyMonkey, an online survey tool, we surveyed 1972 members of the International Gynecologic Oncologists Society and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists to determine the R/S characteristics of gynecologic oncologists and whether their R/S beliefs affected their clinical practice. Demographics, religiosity, and spirituality data were collected. Physicians were also asked to evaluate 5 complex case scenarios. Results Two hundred seventy-three (14%) physicians responded. Sixty percent \"agreed\" or \"somewhat agreed\" that their R/S beliefs were a source of personal comfort. Forty-five percent reported that their R/S beliefs (\"sometimes,\" \"frequently,\" or \"always\") play a role in the medical options they offered patients, but only 34% \"frequently\" or \"always\" take a R/S history from patients. Interestingly, 90% reported that they consider patients' R/S beliefs when discussing end-of-life issues. Responses to case scenarios largely differed by years of experience, although age and R/S beliefs also had influence. Conclusions Our results suggest that gynecologic oncologists' R/S beliefs may affect patient care but that most physicians fail to take an R/S history from their patients. More work needs to be done to evaluate possible barriers that prevent physicians from taking a spiritual history and engaging in discussions over these matters with patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e31820ba507", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150723541", "source": "openalex"}

The use of POCUS enables the clinician to perform the ultrasound scan either at the medical office or the patient’s bedside and used as an extension of the physical examination. Real-time images can immediately be correlated with the patient’s symptoms, and any changes in a (critical) patient’s condition can be more rapidly detected. POCUS in OBGYN POCUS is also suitable for time-critical scenarios, and depending on the situation and its dynamics, the course and results of any therapy may be observed in real time. POCUS should be considered to be a routine extension of practice for most OB/GYN clinicians as it can give immediate answers to what could be life-threatening situations for the mother and/or baby.

METHODS: The Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR), the cancer registry for the Department of Defense, was used to identify children, adolescents, and young adults diagnosed with gynecologic malignancies. Specifically, primary ovarian, uterine, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar malignancies diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 were included in the analysis. Data from the Department of Defense tumor registry were then compared with results obtained from the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Report (SEER) program database. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-one cases were identified in the Department of Defense tumor registry. The most common primary site was ovary, with 116 cases (46%), followed by cervix, with 108 cases (43%). The most common histological types were germ cell (35%) for ovary, squamous cell (52%) for cervix, choriocarcinoma (18%) for uterus, and squamous cell (30%) for vulva/vagina. The 21- to 25-year-old age group had the greatest number of cases for the entire cohort (23%). Most patients had only local disease at time of diagnosis, and the 5-year survival percentage was 86% (95% confidence interval 80–91) for all patients with ovarian and cervical carcinoma. Data from the SEER program demonstrated a similar distribution and incidence pattern. CONCLUSION: The ovary and cervix are the most common primary sites of gynecologic malignancies in patients 25 years of age or younger. Health maintenance programs for patients in this age group should continue to include pelvic exams and Pap test screening.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2077775923", "title": "Quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors", "text": "Cancer survivorship is a process with both positive and negative aspects. Although much is known about survival rates and complications of therapy for gynecologic cancers, the issue of quality of life has been addressed only recently. The results of preliminary studies only prove how complex the issues are and how difficult they are to quantify. Quality of life is a concept that is at once obvious and ephemeral. There are as many definitions as there are observers. Factors contributing to a quality life also vary across the lifetime of an individual and take into account various physical, intellectual, and economic opportunities and limitations. Quality of life is influenced by outside forces and intrinsic capabilities. Human beings are enormously adaptable. An individual given major changes in life circumstances finds that what was once unacceptable becomes manageable and what was unappreciated takes on new meaning. That incredible ability to adapt is what makes life so precious and measuring its quality so difficult. The experience of cancer dramatically changes an individual's major concerns in a unique way. Measurement tools must reflect this changed perspective. General population measures are simply not adequate to assess important aspects of quality of life for cancer patients. In addition, different cancers affecting different organ systems produce different symptoms at different stages in the disease. Individual treatment modalities may require specific modification of quality-of-life instruments. The need to focus on the individual meaning of quality of life introduces many variables and makes empiric investigation difficult. Somewhere between the extremes of food, clothing, and shelter and a uniquely individual definition of quality of life are broad general categories of qualities that are desirable in life. Hornquist1 described a construct based on human needs satisfaction and identified the following six spheres, or domains, of importance: physical, psychological, social, activity, marital, and political (involving dealings with justice and authorities). Berg and colleagues2 asked 150 well health workers the relative importance that they, in a position of health, placed on 50 abilities or functions. Respondents rated cognitive, emotional, and social functions highest. They placed the highest values on being able to think clearly, to see, to love and be loved, to make decisions for oneself, to maintain contact with family and friends, to live at home, and to walk. These are qualities desired from a perspective of health, however. When health begins to deteriorate or when a life-threatening situation occurs, evaluation criteria alter dramatically. Where one lives becomes relatively less important than how one lives or, more particularly, how comfortably and how long one lives. The working definition of quality of life for cancer patients described by Cella and Cherin3 is the patients' appraisal of and satisfaction with their current level of functioning as compared with what they perceive to be possible or ideal. Thus, the issues assessed must be those that are important to cancer survivors. General quality-of-life measures are not applicable. Existential issues may assume greater importance and other factors may re-cede.4 The meaning of life and the value of each day may supersede other, now trivial aspects of daily living. Both general and specific measures are needed. Many publications in the field have been based on personal experience, not on careful scientific analysis. An ideal quality-of-life instrument addresses all of the major domains (physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and global) and positive influences. Psychometric testing must show reliability and validity. The instrument should be broad, representative enough to detect changes important to the patient, and based on patient-generated questions that the patient asks herself through self-administration. To be acceptable to patients, providers, and researchers, a quality-of-life instrument must have a short completion time and be easy to score. Few instruments for assessing quality of life in cancer patients satisfy all of these criteria. Cella et al5 have noted that few available measures were developed with careful attention to principles of test construction and evaluation. His group developed the functional assessment of cancer therapy scale and refined it for evaluation of patients with gynecologic cancer. In most studies of gynecologic cancer, survival without major morbidity has been the primary outcome measure. Complications of disease and treatment can be negative influences on quality of life. Yet little is known about how survivors adapt to these side effects. With the refinement of treatment techniques and the development of equally curative alternatives, attention is now focusing on refining outcome measures as well. The corresponding development of quality-of-life measures now enables health professionals to look at the effects of diagnosis and treatment on specific aspects of an individual's life. Once these effects are identified, better decisions for treatment and recommendations for assistance can follow. Gynecologic cancers are the fourth most common cancers in American women.6 Some gynecologic cancers are common diseases with high survival rates, such as cancers of the cervix and endometrium. Some are rare diseases with high survival rates, such as cancer of the vulva, gestational trophoblastic disease, and germ cell tumors of the ovary. Some are uncommon cancers with low survival rates, such as epithelial ovarian cancers. Each year 33,000 cases of endometrial cancer, 15,000 cases of cervical cancer, and 26,000 cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed in the United States; overall survival rates are 82%, 68%, and 44%, respectively. Thus, approximately 49,000 women who will be long-term survivors of gynecologic cancers are added to the population each year. If only a small percentage of these survivors suffer morbidity, the result can be a major cost to society in human suffering, loss of productivity, and health care expenditure. All cancer survivors face the issues of uncertainty, reestablishment of life roles in the family and workplace, financial and insurance problems, short-term and long-term physical disabilities, possible development of second malignancies, and reestablishment of autonomy. In addition to these general issues, gynecologic cancer survivors must face sexual and fertility issues and body image changes that may be less obvious than those in breast cancer patients. Variables such as age at diagnosis and treatment, treatment type, time since treatment, and associated conditions that add comorbidity also influence quality of life. The impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment varies with the age of the patient. Adolescents treated for germ cell tumors of the ovary with surgery and chemotherapy have been dealt both educational and developmental setbacks. Limited surgery allows retention of ovarian hormonal and fertility functions, but chemotherapy may have side effects detrimental to both sexual function and fertility. Self-image problems from hair loss are temporary and resolve after the completion of treatment. Long-term energy deficits may be the most limiting disability for these young women. Studies of long-term follow-up show excellent cure rates, but little information is available about quality of life in these individuals. Women in the reproductive years treated for cervical cancers are most affected by fertility and hormonal issues. Either radiation or surgery results in loss of childbearing capacity. Ovaries may be retained after radical hysterectomy as a source of ova for in vitro fertilization, making surrogate parenting a possibility, but it is usually an unrealistic option for most women. Retaining hope for such a possibility may be comforting. Retained ovaries may continue hormonal function, but a high incidence of premature ovarian failure has been observed.7 Radiation therapy results in almost immediate ovarian failure. Attempts to transpose ovaries out of the radiation field have not been successful in providing high rates of long-term ovarian function and can lead to formation of painful cysts or to additional surgery for complications.7 Women in the middle years are strongly affected by concerns about sexual function; provision for family needs; employment and professional development; and the reestablishment of family, work, and community relationships. Postmenopausal women affected by endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancers face long-term disability secondary to treatment that often enhances or exaggerates the decline in abilities associated with normal aging. The threat of second malignancies8 and genetic implications for family members9 may cloud an otherwise optimistic future for many gynecologic cancer survivors. Familial patterns of ovarian and endometrial cancer may place individuals at increased risk for breast and bowel cancers. Body habitus patterns that contributed to the development of endome-trial cancers may also confer risk for other diseases. Behaviors such as smoking may increase the risk of the survivor of cervical or vulvar cancer for other genital cancers or other smoking-related cancers and disabilities. The type of treatment used also influences the issues facing the long-term survivor of gynecologic cancer. Surgery results in missing organs with physical and psychological consequences. Hysterectomy is accompanied by loss of menstrual function, infertility, and possibly sexual dysfunction. The emotional impact of this may vary from positive to negative. Gender identity issues and body image changes are generated by the loss of the organ and the external scars. Vulvectomy is more physically deforming and leads to evident dysfunction in sexuality, urination, and even sitting. The most extreme alteration of body function and body image results from exenteration with urinary and fecal diversions.9 stoma management and stocking of necessary supplies, management of output from either continent or noncontinent stomas, accidental leakage, skin and odor problems, retraction of stomas with weight gain, peristomal hernias, electrolyte imbalance, and alteration of sexual and recreational activities are but a few of the time-consuming lifelong daily demands on these patients. Vaginal reconstruction may help overcome some sexual dysfunction but can also add scars and body image concerns that can detract from quality of life.9 Radiation therapy is especially associated with long-term side effects and alterations of bodily function. Fibrosis and atrophy are permanent tissue changes that affect tissue tolerance of ultraviolet radiation, hypotension, and trauma and infection. Dietary limitations are often imposed on patients with lactose and roughage intolerance. Diarrhea may limit the individual's freedom of movement or lead to complicated travel rituals. Fistulas are rare but cause a major disruption of daily life when they occur. Vaginal drying, atrophy, and contraction lead to sexual dysfunction. A contracted bladder may also severely limit mobility. Loss of ovarian function leads not only to infertility but also to loss of hormone function with the attendant increased risks of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Chemotherapy also has an impact on ovarian function, and the effect is greater with advancing age. Long-term effects on energy levels and on renal, neurologic, marrow, and cardiac function are only now beginning to be appreciated. Secondary leukemia, which can be life-threatening, is a real risk after some chemotherapy regimens. As we begin to gather data about the effects on quality of life of both the diagnosis and the treatment of gynecologic cancers, we must look at all relevant issues with instruments developed specifically for our patient population. Although anecdotal or individual case reports are useful, they do not give a broad enough picture. Some studies have reported no greater psychopathologic distress in cancer patients than in the general population.10 Like their healthy counterparts, most cancer survivors adapt to their limitations and live fulfilling lives. A significant percentage of cancer survivors may exist, however, who do report major dysfunction.10 In addition to depression and anxiety, the emotional distress can consist of intrusive thoughts about cancer and symptoms that may be similar to the distress seen in post-traumatic stress disorder. Predictors of post-traumatic symptoms are now being researched in breast cancer and bone marrow transplant patients, but little is known about such symptoms in gynecologic cancer patients. The ability to identify individuals at high risk for chronic distress or post-traumatic symptoms would be a major contribution. It is possible that patients who refuse to participate in quality-of-life studies may be the most distressed, both physically and emotionally. To date, the effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on women with survivable gynecologic cancers have been evaluated in only one longitudinal prospective study, which looked at the incidence and cause of major life difficulties for gynecologic cancer survivors.11 In this study the cancer patients had recently diagnosed, but as yet untreated, gynecologic cancers in either stage I or stage II. Two clinical groups were studied for comparison. The first consisted of women undergoing treatment for disruptive but benign gynecologic disease, most of whom were about to have surgery for uterine leiomyomas or stress incontinence. The second control group consisted of healthy women scheduled for routine gynecologic examinations who provided a baseline, or normative estimate, for the samples. All patients were assessed at intake and at 4, 8, and 12 months after treatment. The cancer subjects underwent intake assessment during the metastatic work-up, roughly 1 to 2 weeks after the patient learned of the diagnosis from the referring physician and before she received any treatment. The benign gynecologic disease subjects were assessed initially at the preoperative visit 1 week before the surgical admission. The healthy subjects were assessed the day they came in for their routine gynecologic checkups. At initial pretreatment assessment significant differences were found among all three groups in the level of total mood disturbance reported. The cancer patients were significantly more distressed than were the women with benign disease, who, in turn, were significantly more distressed than were the healthy women. The origin of the distress appeared to be a combination of fatigue, anxiety, and confusion. Fatigue levels reflected the overall group differences between women who are healthy and those with disease, whether malignant or benign. Cancer patients had levels of anxiety comparable to those of the individuals anticipating surgery for noncancerous conditions, and both groups were significantly more anxious than were the healthy controls. Cancer patients reported significantly more depression than did either comparison group. The benign disease group was more depressed than the healthy group but less depressed than the cancer group. Another interesting finding was the significantly greater confusion of the cancer group. A quality often noted in cancer patients, and as yet not quantified, is their sense of generalized confusion and inability to concentrate, as evidenced in their not remembering information told them repeatedly. Clinicians often attribute this confusion to anxiety, depression, or denial, and it may relate to all three qualities. In this study, however, those in the benign disease group did not report high levels of confusion despite their comparable level of anxiety and some depression. This suggests that for the gynecologic cancer patient, confusion may be a separate measure of emotional disturbance, not simply the result of anxiety or depression. Women directly questioned about the source of their acknowledged confusion often report that they no longer know how to interpret body symptoms and have difficulty understanding how their bodies work. Essentially, it appears that the mind must restock experience, akin to learning to walk again after a stroke. By identifying this component of mood disturbance, we may be able to resolve it with information and education. Because chemotherapy and radiation treatments may cause many new side effects, the need for education is ongoing. A decrease in confusion over time as the learning process progresses would support this assumption. In fact, follow-up assessment showed exactly that. At 4 months after treatment, overall mood improved significantly in the two disease groups compared with their initial assessments; further decrease to the baseline levels of the healthy group occurred by 12 months. Social adjustment measures showed no differences in familial or social relationships or activities among the three groups or across time. Marital adjustment was also similar across all groups and across time, with equal rates of marital breakups or problems. Employment status and occupation were also similar among groups and across time. Understandably, women in the two disease groups spent less time “on the job” during recovery, but they returned to pretreatment levels by the 12-month follow-up. These data suggest that the stresses of the diagnostic and treatment phases are time-limited and lend support to the idea that a crisis response to cancer diagnosis and treatment occurs and that distress dissipates with recovery. We should remember that this was a study of early stage, potentially curable cancers with a limited prescribed treatment. Cancers requiring more prolonged treatment and less certain outcome will inevitably result in more complex patterns of response. The reactions of patients with chronic illness and fatal disease may be altogether different. Sexual dysfunction has received more extensive attention from researchers than has any other aspect of quality of life. As might be expected because of the organs involved, a high degree of sexual dysfunction is reported among gynecologic cancer survivors, with estimates ranging from 20% to 100%. The variability of these estimates reflects the lack of uniformity in the groups studied, whose treatments ranged from exenteration to vulvectomy to simple hysterectomy and from surgery to radiation therapy. The degree and nature of sexual dysfunction vary according to the type, length, and intensity of treatment. Vulvectomy and exenteration introduce the most dramatic and anatomically obvious changes. Radiation therapy has long-term sequelae for vaginal function. Therapy-induced menopause aggravates any other anatomic changes. Most studies of sexual dysfunction in gynecologic cancer have assessed women at some time after treatment. Andersen and colleagues'12 prospective longitudinal study assessed pretreatment status and compared changes over time, using groups with no gynecologic problems and those undergoing benign gynecologic surgery to control for the influence of both surgery and the cancer diagnosis itself. Cancer patients report premorbid patterns of sexual activity and responsiveness similar to those of healthy women, with similar rates of inhibited desire, excitement, or orgasm in both groups. With the appearance of cancer signs and symptoms, cancer patients report experiencing significant symptoms of dysfunction, including inhibited sexual desire and loss of desire for intercourse. Little loss of desire for nonsexual affectionate behavior such as kissing was reported.13 Among women who had no sexual dysfunction before the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, approximately 50% eventually were diagnosed with at least one dysfunction during the year after treatment. Although some improved, others worsened, and by 12 months after treatment approximately 30% of cancer patients were suffering from some sexual dysfunction.12 An important element to remember in assessing sexual function is partner dysfunction. In Andersen's study the two disease groups had equal rates of partner dysfunction, and both had significantly increased frequencies of partner dysfunction compared with the healthy group. Signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency were significant in both disease groups at 4 and 8 months; at 12 months these signs and symptoms resolved for the benign disease group but persisted for the cancer patients. Thus, menopausal symptoms and signs were induced temporarily for the benign group and continuously for the cancer group. Even in women who have undergone surgical management of early cervical cancer with or without transposition of retained ovaries, a very high percentage suffer from premature ovarian failure.7 These women will suffer from osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and genitourinary atrophy, any of which can negatively affect quality of life. The long-term survival of one-half to two-thirds of all gynecologic cancer pa-tients6 means that many women require assistance in returning to normal psycho-sexual functioning. We know next to nothing about their quality of life. We can theorize that these women are more anxious about body symptoms and dysfunction and that they may have residual limitations from the toxicity of the treatment they have undergone. They will also meet with institutional and societal prejudices about the “possibly cured” cancer patient and may have difficulty in employment and insurability. Although little information exists about gynecologic cancer patients, findings in the nongynecologic cancer literature may be helpful in establishing research directions. At the termination of active cancer treatment, a marked increase in depression, death anxiety, and anger have been reported,14–18 accompanied by an increased need for reassur-ance.19 Along with the loss of a treatment perceived as actively fighting the cancer, patients also lose the immediate social and informational support of the medical staff.15, 20 In addition, numerous social and role issues arise when women reenter the family and work environment, including expectations for resumption of “normal” activities during a time of continued low energy and recovery.21, 22 Although some studies have reported a normalization of mood by 1 year after breast cancer treatment,22–25 particularly in patients with less severe disease,26, 27 long-term residual disturbances have also been noted, including difficulties with depression, energy level, occupational functioning, relationships, sense of well-being, and fear of recurrence.26–31 These continuing issues are thought to be related to psychological sequelae from the trauma of diagnosis, treatment, and threat of death14 and continuing confrontation with cancer-related physical changes and losses.32 Auchincloss33 has reviewed psychosocial issues observed in gynecologic cancer survivors and emphasizes the difficulty such women have in forming support groups to help in dealing with survivor problems and stresses. This difficulty may be in part the result of the relative rarity of each individual disease with its specific constellation of disease- and treatment-related characteristics and problems. She points out that intervention studies are the next focus of research efforts. Andersen34 has called for studies assessing predictors of risk for psychological morbidity in cancer survivors, emphasizing the importance of psychiatric comorbidity, illness comorbidity, social support, and demographic status as factors identifiable at the time of diagnosis. A model is proposed combining the following factors: the extent of disease and treatment, the occurrence of new health problems in the cancer survivor, and coping style. The purpose of the model is to identify individuals in low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk groups for psychological and behavioral morbidity. Such a model provides a construct for future research. Another question that needs more attention is that of the positive gains of having been treated for cancer and having survived. In addition to survival, appreciation of life and reorientation of priorities may greatly add to quality of life. We are entering an era of intense effort to develop specific quality-of-life measurement tools for gynecologic cancer patients and survivors and to refine our ability to assess the impact on the patient of disease and treatment. The results of this effort should enable us to develop better management protocols, to give patients more information with which to make decisions regarding the conduct of their lives, and to allocate better increasingly scarce resources. Schipper et al35 point out that “quality of life studies will force us to come out from the comfort of technological medicine into a world that is less concrete and less controllable, but more human. Out of it we will be better physicians, more sensitive to the vigor, complexity, and adaptability of the human soul.” Understanding the stresses faced by our patients can enable us as caregivers to ease emotional and physical pain. At the very least, we can sustain the patient through an arduous course of treatment and a prolonged and uncertain follow-up. At best, she can grow to a new and deeper level of understanding and awareness that can enhance her life immeasurably and can be inspirational to those around her, including family and medical personnel.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3322/canjclin.47.4.218", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077775923", "source": "openalex"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligibility criteria included patients with one of the cancers noted above, with the largest residual disease 0.5 cm or less in maximum diameter at the end of second-look surgery, and prior treatment with systemic paclitaxel was permitted. The treatment plan was paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 i.p. weekly for 16 weeks, followed by surgical evaluation in patients without evidence of disease progression. RESULTS Of 80 patients entered onto the study, 76 were eligible, of whom 86% were considered to be potentially cisplatin-sensitive.

The extent of surgical intervention was categorized into modified surgical complexity scoring (MSCS) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. Odds ratios were adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, and operative factors.Of 6854 patients, 369 (5.4%) were diagnosed with SSI. Surgical site infection after laparotomy was 3.5 times higher compared with minimally invasive surgery (7% vs 2%; P < 0.001). Among laparotomy group, independent predictors of SSI included endometrial cancer diagnosis, obesity, ascites, preoperative anemia, American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than or equal to 3, MSCS greater than or equal to 3, and perioperative blood transfusion. Among laparoscopic cases, independent predictors of SSI included only preoperative leukocytosis and overweight. For patients with deep or organ space SSI, significant predictors included hypoalbuminemia, preoperative weight loss, respiratory comorbidities, MSCS greater than 4, and perioperative blood transfusion for laparotomy and only preoperative leukocytosis for minimally invasive surgery. Surgical site infection was associated with longer mean hospital stay and higher rate of reoperation, sepsis, and wound dehiscence. Surgical site infection was not associated with increased risk of acute renal failure or 30-day mortality. These findings were consistent in subset of patients with deep or organ space SSI.Seven percent of patients undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic malignancy developed SSI. Surgical site infection is associated with longer hospital stay and more than 5-fold increased risk of reoperation.

The rapid escalation in the sale of these products may imply that women are using them inappropriately. The purposes of this study were to determine (1) whether women could correctly diagnose VVC and common genitourinary tract problems after reading classic case scenarios, (2) whether women could correctly select the appropriate treatment for these cases, and (3) whether a previous diagnosis of VVC by a clinician had any effect on a woman's ability to self-diagnose and self-treat VVC.Women 16 years of age and older were recruited from medical and community sites to complete a 63-question survey instrument designed to assess their knowledge of the symptoms and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease, bacterial vaginosis, acute cystitis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis after reading classic case scenarios.A total of 601 women completed the questionnaire, 552 subjects and 49 medically trained women who served as a criterion standard for comparison. Of the 552 subjects, 365 reported a prior diagnosis of VCC and 154 reported no such prior diagnosis. The medically trained cohort was more accurate in diagnosing VVC (83.7% correct) than were subjects who had received a prior diagnosis of VVC (34.5% correct), and more accurate than subjects without a previous diagnosis of VVC (11.0% correct, P < .001). A greater percentage of subjects in whom VVC had been previously diagnosed, as compared with the medically trained cohort, would use OTC agents inappropriately for pelvic inflammatory disease (6.7% vs 4.3%, respectively; P = NS), bacterial vaginosis (14.6% vs 6.4%, respectively; P = .028), urinary tract infection (2.0% vs 0%, respectively; P < .001), and vaginal trichomoniasis (11.8% vs 6.6%, respectively; P = .048).A minority of women were able to correctly diagnose VVC from a classic case scenario. A prior clinical diagnosis of VVC had only a moderate positive effect on subjects' ability to correctly diagnose a classic case. Based on our findings, women likely use OTC antifungals inappropriately to treat gynecologic conditions that are similar but potentially more severe. Numerous adverse consequences may result from misdiagnosis.

Experimental Design: Primary measure of efficacy was progression-free survival at 6 months. Mutations in exons 18 to 21 of EGFR and/or immunohistochemical expression of EGFR were evaluated in tumor specimens from patients enrolled in this trial as well as from patients not treated with gefitinib. Results: Twenty-seven of 30 (90%) patients were eligible and evaluable for analysis of gefitinib efficacy and toxicity. Of these, four survived progression-free &amp;gt;6 months with one objective response (4%). The most commonly observed grade 3 toxicities were dermatologic (15%, 4 of 27) and diarrhea (30%, 8 of 27). Specimens from 26 of 26 or 25 of 26 patients were evaluable for immunohistochemical or mutation analysis, respectively. The response rate for patients with EGFR-positive tumors was 9% (1 of 11). EGFR expression was associated with longer progression-free survival (P = 0.008) and possibly longer survival (P = 0.082). The patient with the only objective response had a mutation in the catalytic domain of the tumor's EGFR (P = 0.04). Among 32 invasive tumors from patients not treated with gefitinib, one exhibited a catalytic domain mutation. Conclusions: Gefitinib was well tolerated but had minimal activity in unscreened patients with recurrent ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Prescreening patients for activating mutations in EGFR may improve response rate to gefitinib.

Postoperative extended field radiotherapy was employed with minimum complications and the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 50% with a median survival time of 29 months. In order to justify the utilization of surgical staging for gynecologic neoplasms, it is necessary to demonstrate a survival advantage in patients where the precise extent of disease has been established and subsequent therapy tailored accordingly. In addition, it must be shown that surgical staging does not increase complications or decrease the efficacy of subsequent therapeutic interventions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19901015)60:8+<2010::aid-cncr2820601512>3.0.co;2-y", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135007053", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the academic rank and gender of gynecologic oncology faculty in the United States were determined from online residency and fellowship directories and departmental web sites. Each individual's h-index and years of publication were determined from Scopus (a citation database of peer-reviewed literature). The h-index is a quantification of an author's scholarly productivity that combines the number of publications with the number of times the publications have been cited. We generated descriptive statistics and compared rank, gender, and productivity scores. RESULTS: Five hundred seven academic faculty within 137 U.S. teaching programs were identified. Of these, 215 (42%) were female and 292 (58%) were male. Men had significantly higher median h-indices than women, 16 compared with 8, respectively (P<.001). Women were more likely to be of junior academic rank with 63% of assistant professors being female compared with 20% of full professors. When stratifying h-indices by gender and academic rank, men had significantly higher h-indices at the assistant professor level (7 compared with 5, P<.001); however, this difference disappeared at the higher ranks. Stratifying by the years of active publication, there was no significant difference between genders. CONCLUSION: Female gynecologic oncologists at the assistant professor level had lower scholarly productivity than men; however, at higher academic ranks, they equaled their male counterparts. Women were more junior in rank, had published for fewer years, and were underrepresented in leadership positions. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Although women in academic gynecologic oncology at the assistant professor level have lower scholarly productivity than men, this difference disappears at higher academic ranks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001133", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2315778441", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1977476782", "title": "Female Sexual Dysfunction in Obstetrics and Gynecology", "text": "Sexual dysfunction in women is common, with a community prevalence of 30% to 50%. The sexual response cycle in women is complex, with multiple overlapping dimensions, which necessitates a biopsychosocial approach for understanding the basis of dysfunction. Physiological events such as pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, aging as well as gynecological conditions like infertility, prolapse, urinary incontinence, and gynecological cancers, have an impact on sexual well-being. The interaction of these conditions with sexual health needs to be better understood to deal effectively with the problems as a whole. However, the woman concerned should be sufficiently distressed by her problem for the diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction to be made. Overall, gynecological surgery performed to alleviate symptoms which have an organic basis have the potential to improve sexual function, and this does not necessarily correlate with the anatomical outcome of the surgery. Hysterectomy done by any approach does not compromise sexual function. Sexual health enquiry and evaluation in clinical practice can be done with the help of simple screening questions, a comprehensive history followed by an adequate examination. As no single laboratory test is recommended as a marker of sexual dysfunction, investigations are best dictated by clinical judgment. Detailed assessment tools in the form of self-report questionnaires and diagnostic tests for objective measures of sexual dysfunction could be used in special circumstances. Therapy entails understanding the point of break in the sexual response cycle and the underlying pathophysiology. While there are multiple treatment options available, integrated therapy which deals with both the psyche and the soma yield best results. Sexual counseling plays a vital role when therapy becomes necessary. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to categorize the types and understand the spectrum of presentations of female sexual dysfunction, actively compile symptoms while obtaining a patient history, and prepare anticipatory guidance regarding female sexual dysfunction in association with different gynecologic disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0b013e31817f13e3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977476782", "source": "openalex"}

The predictive accuracy of the two staging systems was compared using concordance estimation.Two hundred nineteen patients had sufficient clinical and pathologic information to be staged under both systems; 132 patients were upstaged using the AJCC staging system, whereas only four were downstaged. Stage-specific PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III differed substantially between the two staging systems. In both systems, there was prognostic overlap between stages II and III. Thus, despite the marked stage-specific differences in 5-year PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III, both systems had similar concordance indices.Estimates of stage-specific PFS and OS for uterine LMS were altered substantially when using the AJCC versus FIGO staging system.

However, there are complications that are related to the abdominal entry process. Serious complications are gastrointestinal tract and major blood vessel injuries. This review introduces the recent available literature to prevent and eliminate the laparoscopic entry complications. The open entry technique is associated with a significant reduction of failed entry, compared to the closed entry technique; however there is no difference in the incidence of visceral or vascular injury. Laparoscopic entry by the left upper abdomen (i.e., Palmer's point) or the middle upper abdomen (i.e., the Lee-Huang point) could be considered in patients with suspected periumbilical adhesions or a history of umbilical hernia, or after three failed attempts of insufflation at the umbilicus. The Lee-Huang point has its own benefit for the operative laparoscopy in large pelvic pathologies and gynecology malignancy cases. The angle of Veress needle insertion varies from 45° in nonobese women to 90° in extraordinarily obese women. The high intra-peritoneal pressure entries, which range from 20 mmHg to 25 mmHg, minimize the risk of vascular injury. Therefore, this will not adversely affect the cardiopulmonary function in healthy women. The Veress intraperitoneal pressure (<10 mmHg) is a reliable indicator of correct intraperitoneal placement of the Veress needle. The elevation of anterior abdominal wall for placement of a Veress needle increases the risks of failed entry and shows no advantage in regard to vascular or visceral complications. Surgeons should continue to increase their knowledge of anatomy, their training, and their experience to decrease laparoscopic complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gmit.2013.07.003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2082515631", "source": "openalex"}

The size effects on these active site have been estimated by changing the number of titanium atoms of the TiCl3 model clusters. The most important interaction in the olefin coordinated state is electron delocalization from the occupied Ti dxz orbital of the methyltitanium chlorides to the π∗ orbital of the coordinated olefin molecule, while in the transition state is electron delocalization from the occupied C p and Ti dxz orbital of the methyltitanium chloride species to the π∗ orbital of the olefin.

The coordination energy and the activation energy for the olefin insertion are almost independent of the cluster size when the number of Ti atoms is greater than three. The corner type active site has been shown to be stabilized at the transition state by the absence of one of the Cl atoms which are located orthogonal to the insertion plane. Thus, the olefin insertion on the corner type active site is more favorable than that on the edge type active site. In the case of propylene insertion, syn-orientation of propylene is favored. This regioselectivity should be lower on the corner type active site than that on the edge type active site.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.08.016", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2079159326", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: This is an observational study conducted through web sites of U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residency programs accredited in 2012–2013. RESULTS: In obstetrics and gynecology departmental administrative leadership roles, women comprised 20.4% of chairs, 36.1% of vice chairs, and 29.6% of division directors. Among educational leaders, women comprised 31.9% of fellowship directors, 47.3% of residency directors, and 66.1% of medical student clerkship directors. Chairs were most likely to be maternal–fetal medicine faculty (38.2%) followed by specialists in general obstetrics and gynecology (21.8%), reproductive endocrinologists (15.6%), and gynecologic oncologists (14.7%). Among chairs, 32.9% are male maternal–fetal medicine specialists. Family planning had the highest representation of women (80.0%) among division directors, whereas reproductive endocrinology and infertility had the lowest (15.8%). The largest proportion of women chairs, vice chairs, residency program directors, and medical student clerkship directors were specialists in general obstetrics and gynecology. CONCLUSION: Women remained underrepresented in the departmental leadership roles of chair, vice chair, division director, and fellowship director. Representation of women was closer to parity among residency program directors, in which women held just under half of positions. Nearly one in three department chairs was a male maternal–fetal medicine specialist.

Serial changes of lymphatic function before and after lymph node dissection and risk factors for secondary lymphedema are important indicators. Methods: A prospective cohort observational study was conducted with 100 consecutive gynecologic cancer patients who underwent pelvic lymph node dissection. Lymphatic function was assessed by noninvasive lymphography using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging on a routine schedule. Earliest findings after lymphadenectomy and risk factors for lower leg lymphedema were investigated. Results: Atypical transient dermal backflow patterns were observed in an early postoperative period in 50 cases, all of which disappeared within 3 months. Of these patterns, the splash pattern was observed in 31 patients, of which five improved to normal following a natural course. In contrast, the stardust pattern was observed in 27 patients, and none had improved with conservative therapy. Postoperative radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for the stardust pattern. Conclusions: All patients who undergo lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignancies should be examined for secondary lower extremity lymphedema by qualitative evaluation methods on a routine schedule to determine the earliest possible diagnosis. Because the splash pattern on indocyanine green lymphography is a reversible lymphatic disorder following a natural course, surgical treatments are not recommended.

Methods: Twelve human gynecologic cancer cell lines (the ovarian cell lines—A224, AD10, UCI 101, UCI 107, SKOV3, 222, CP70, ML3B, and ML5; the cervical cell lines—HT3 and ME180; and the endometrial cell line—Hec 1A were tested for sensitivity to 4HPR (by assaying cell proliferation rates). Gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA fragmentation was used to measure programmed cell death (apoptosis). Specific retinoid receptor (retinoic acid receptor [RAR] and retinoid X receptor) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured by northern blot hybridization. AD10 cells were stably transfected with human RARβ complementary DNA, and the effect of 4HPR on cell proliferation was examined.

Consequently, there has been a growing interest in functional imaging modalities. Based on molecular diffusion, diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) is a unique, noninvasive modality that provides excellent tissue contrast and was shown to improve the radiological diagnosis of malignant tumors. Using quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurement of DWI provides a new tool for better distinguishing malignant tissues from benign tumors. The aim of the present review is to report on the results of DWI for the assessment of patients with gynecological malignancies. An analysis of the literature suggests that DWI studies would improve the diagnosis of cervical and endometrial tumors. It may also improve the assessment of tumor extension in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from gynecological malignancies. However, since the signal intensity of some cancers can range from high intensity to low intensity, a degree of uncertainty was demonstrated due to the proximity of the normal uterine myometrium and ovaries. Interestingly, there is also evidence that ADC might improve the follow‐up and monitoring of patients who receive anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy or radiation therapy. J. Magn. Reson.

Defective cell cycle regulation is the hallmark of cancers underpinning the development and progression of the disease. Normal cell cycle is driven by the coordinated and sequential rise and fall of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) activity. The transition of cell cycle phases is governed by the respective checkpoints that prevent the entry into the next phase until cellular or genetic defects are repaired. Checkpoint activation is achieved by p53- and ATM/ATR-mediated inactivation of CDKs in response to DNA damage. Therefore, an aberrant increase in CDK activity and/or defects in checkpoint activation lead to unrestricted cell cycle phase transition and uncontrolled proliferation that give rise to cancers and perpetuate malignant progression. Given that CDK activity is also required for homologous recombination (HR) repair, pharmacological inhibition of CDKs can be exploited as a synthetic lethal approach to augment the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors and other DNA damaging modalities for the treatment of gynecologic cancers. Here, we overview the basic of cell cycle and discuss the mechanistic studies that establish the intimate link between CDKs and HR repair. In addition, we present the perspective of preclinical and clinical development in small molecule inhibitors of CDKs and CDK-associated protein targets, as well as their potential use in combination with hormonal therapy, PARP inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiation to improve treatment outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2018.00303", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2885466333", "source": "openalex"}

Mechanism: A comprehensive search was performed in the PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. Findings in Brief: To date the prevention programmes of all degrees exist exclusively for cervical cancer. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination prevents from infection and development of precancerous lesions and contributes significantly to the deflection of the incidence of cervical cancer. Screening for HPV-related lesions is worldwide performed by cervical smear (Pap-test) and HPV test. Finally, tertiary prevention is aimed at the treatment of previously diagnosticated lesions with the aid of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Unfortunately, to date the prevention programmes of other gynecological tumors have not reached a good performance; indeed, the primum movens that leads to the development of such neoplasms has not been identified yet. Actually, no screening programs for the early diagnosis of endometrial cancer are available, however, it is recommended the adoption of a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet. Diagnostic biomarkers would be helpful for screening asymptomatic high-risk women, but histopatological examinations remain the gold standard for diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Similarly, there are no screening tests for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. In recent years many steps forward have been made in this field and new perspectives have been presented, however, additional investigation is needed to optimize the duration and timing of treatment, examine its cost-effectiveness, and identify potential tumor or host biologic factors predictive of the efficacy and adverse events. Finally, there are no primary and secondary prevention for vulvar cancer so patients should be invited to self-examination and pay attention to the presence of symptoms. Conclusions: Are the available screening programs for the diagnosis of gynecological carcinomas sufficient? The prevention and the diagnosis of precancerous lesions is the goal to be achieved for all gynecological cancers in order to improve patient outcomes, reduce the costs for managing the disease and prolonged follow up.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31083/j.ceog5008160", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4385581587", "source": "openalex"}

Their expression is related to the progression of gynecological cancers (e.g. endometrial, cervical or ovarian carcinoma). In this study we investigated the expression pattern of the 23 MMPs, currently known in humans, in different gynecological cancer cell lines. Methods In total, cell lines from three endometrium carcinomas (Ishikawa, HEC-1-A, AN3 CA), three cervical carcinomas (HeLa, Caski, SiHa), three chorioncarcinomas (JEG, JAR, BeWo), two ovarian cancers (BG-1, OAW-42) and one teratocarcinoma (PA-1) were examined. The expression of MMPs was analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot and gelatin zymography. Results We demonstrated that the cell lines examined can constitutively express a wide variety of MMPs on mRNA and protein level. While MMP-2, -11, -14 and -24 were widely expressed, no expression was seen for MMP-12, -16, -20, -25, -26, -27 in any of the cell lines. A broad range of 16 MMPs could be found in the PA1 cells and thus this cell line could be used as a positive control for general MMP experiments. While the three cervical cancer cell lines expressed 10-14 different MMPs, the median expression in endometrial and choriocarcinoma cells was 7 different enzymes. The two investigated ovarian cancer cell lines showed a distinctive difference in the number of expressed MMPs (2 vs. 10). Conclusions Ishikawa, Caski, OAW-42 and BeWo cell lines could be the best choice for all future experiments on MMP regulation and their role in endometrial, cervical, ovarian or choriocarcinoma development, whereas the teratocarcinoma cell line PA1 could be used as a positive control for general MMP experiments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-553", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149458557", "source": "openalex"}

This will lead to an acute onset of menopausal symptoms, which may be more debilitating than those occurring as a result of natural aging, and of which hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia, mood swings, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, malaise and a general feeling of apathy are the most common. About 25% of gynecological cancers will occur in pre- and perimenopausal women, a large percentage of whom will become menopausal as a result of their treatment. There are also the gynecological cancer survivors who are not rendered menopausal as a result of the treatment strategy but who will become menopausal because of natural aging. Concern among the medical attendants of these women is whether use of estrogen therapy or estrogen and progestogens for their menopausal symptoms will reactivate tumor deposits and therefore increase the rate of recurrence and, as a result, decrease overall survival among these women.

Skin antisepsis (cleansing) with chlorhexidine and alcohol solutions has demonstrated superiority to povidone-iodine in a variety of surgical interventions. Our objective was to determine if chlorhexidine and alcohol antisepsis protocol reduces the rate of SSIs in elective gynecological laparotomies compared with povidone-iodine antisepsis.This retrospective study was carried out at the Department of Gynecology in a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv. Patients undergoing elective gynecological laparotomies during two periods of time and who were treated with two different antisepsis protocols were included. The protocols for antisepsis were povidone-iodine 10% scrub followed by 10% povidone-iodine in 65% alcohol (n = 145) and chlorhexidine 2% followed by 70% alcohol (n = 111). The rate of SSIs as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the risk factors for the occurrence of SSIs were calculated.Antisepsis with chlorhexidine and alcohol was associated with a reduction in the overall rate of SSIs from 14.6% to 4.5% compared with the povidone-iodine protocol (p = 0.011). The two groups of patients were similar in regard to baseline characteristics and medical history. Surgical procedures as well as the type of cut, drains, and tension suture use were similar in the two groups. Patients with SSIs tended to be older and heavier. Risk factors found to be associated with SSIs were hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), immunodeficiency, and the use of the povidone-iodine antisepsis protocol.This retrospective study demonstrates that antisepsis with chlorhexidine and alcohol was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of SSIs compared to povidone-iodine antisepsis in patients undergoing elective gynecological laparotomies. This is of extreme clinical importance, as a change in antisepsis protocol can significantly reduce the morbidity and healthcare costs associated with patients undergoing elective gynecological surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2010.2391", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2029859282", "source": "openalex"}

The term \"targeted cancer therapy\" refers to a new generation of drugs designed to interfere with a specific molecular target that is believed to play a critical role in tumor growth or progression, is not expressed significantly in normal cells, and is correlated with clinical outcome. There has been a rapid increase in the identification of targets that have potential therapeutic application. The clinical success of the small-molecule kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors has accelerated the development of a new era of molecular targeted cancer therapy. The number of agents under preclinical and clinical investigation has grown accordingly. This emphasis on molecular biology and genetics has also resulted in significant changes in the treatment of gynecologic cancers. Several promising drugs targeting tyrosine kinases (EGFR and Her-2/Neu), mTOR, Raf kinase, proteasome, and histone deacetylases, as well as drugs affecting apoptosis and mitosis, are under development for clinical application. However, some clinical trials of p53 gene therapies and farnesyl transferase inhibitors have had limited success.

Down-regulation of apoptosis pathways is one of the key determinants for chemoresistance. Here, we report higher gelsolin (GSN) levels in chemoresistant gynecological cancer cells compared with their sensitive counterparts. cis-Diammine dichloroplatinium (II) (CDDP)-induced GSN down-regulation is associated with its cleavage and apoptosis. Although the C-terminal GSN fragment (C-GSN) sensitized chemoresistant cells to CDDP, intact GSN and its N-terminal fragment (N-GSN) attenuated this response. GSN silencing also facilitated CDDP-induced apoptosis in chemoresistant cells. In contrast, intact GSN (I-GSN) was prosurvival in the presence of CDDP through a FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP)-Itch interaction. This interaction was colocalized in the perinuclear region that could be dissociated by CDDP in sensitive cells, thereby inducing FLIP ubiquitination and degradation, followed by apoptosis. In resistant cells, GSN was highly expressed and CDDP failed to abolish the I-GSN-FLIP-Itch interaction, resulting in the dysregulation of the downstream responses. In addition, we investigated the association between GSN expression in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma and progression free survival and overall survival, as well as clinical prognosis. GSN overexpression was significantly associated with more aggressive behavior and more cancer deaths and supported our hypothesis that high GSN expression confers chemoresistance in cancer cells by altering the GSN-FLIP-Itch interaction. These findings are in agreement with the notion that GSN plays an important role in the regulation of gynecological cell fate as reflected in dysregulation in chemosensitivity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1401166111", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070538820", "source": "openalex"}

As the first step, each author collected information from the original ultrasound reports from his/her own center on predefined ultrasound features of the tumors and by reviewing the ultrasound images to identify information on variables not described in the original report. As the second step, 16 ultrasound examiners reviewed the images electronically in a consensus meeting and described them using predetermined terminology.We identified 116 patients with leiomyosarcoma, 48 with endometrial stromal sarcoma and 31 with undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma. Median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 26-86 years). Most patients were symptomatic at diagnosis (164/183 (89.6%)), the most frequent presenting symptom being abnormal vaginal bleeding (91/183 (49.7%)). Patients with endometrial stromal sarcoma were younger than those with leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (median age, 46 years vs 57 and 60 years, respectively). According to the assessment by the original ultrasound examiners, the median diameter of the largest tumor was 91 mm (range, 7-321 mm). Visible normal myometrium was reported in 149/195 (76.4%) cases, and 80.0% (156/195) of lesions were solitary. Most sarcomas (155/195 (79.5%)) were solid masses (> 80% solid tissue), and most manifested inhomogeneous echogenicity of the solid tissue (151/195 (77.4%)); one sarcoma was multilocular without solid components. Cystic areas were described in 87/195 (44.6%) tumors and most cyst cavities had irregular walls (67/87 (77.0%)). Internal shadowing was observed in 42/192 (21.9%) sarcomas and fan-shaped shadowing in 4/192 (2.1%). Moderate or rich vascularization was found on color-Doppler examination in 127/187 (67.9%) cases.

Morcellation can negatively influence the prognosis of patients, and transecting the specimen into pieces prevents the pathologist from performing proper disease staging. Many societies have published their statements regarding this issue. The European Society for Gynecological Oncology has established a working group of clinicians involved in diagnostics and treatment of oncogynecological patients to provide a statement from the oncological point of view. Leiomyosarcomas and undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas have generally dismal prognosis, whereas low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas and adenosarcomas have variable prognosis based on their stage. A focus on the detection of patients at risk of having a sarcoma should be mandatory before every surgery where morcellation is planned by evaluation of risk factors (African American descent, previous pelvic irradiation, use of tamoxifen, rapid lesion growth particularly in postmenopausal patients) and exclusion of patients with any suspicious ultrasonographic signs. Preoperative endometrial biopsy should be mandatory, although the sensitivity to detect sarcomas is low. An indication for myomectomy should be used only in patients with pregnancy plans; otherwise en bloc hysterectomy is preferred in both symptomatic and postmenopausal patients. Eliminating the technique of morcellation could lead to an increased morbidity in low-risk patients; therefore, after thorough preoperative evaluation and discussion with patients, morcellation still has its place in the armamentarium of gynecologic surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000911", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2560872496", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Baseline surgical site infection rates were determined retrospectively for cases of open uterine cancer, ovarian cancer without bowel resection, and ovarian cancer with bowel resection between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012, at an academic center. A perioperative bundle was prospectively implemented during the intervention period (August 1, 2013, to September 30, 2014). Prior established elements were: patient education, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate shower before surgery, antibiotic administration, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol coverage of incisional area, and cefazolin redosing 3–4 hours after incision. New elements initiated were: sterile closing tray and staff glove change for fascia and skin closure, dressing removal at 24–48 hours, dismissal with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, and follow-up nursing phone call. Surgical site infection rates were examined using control charts, compared between periods using χ2 or Fisher exact test, and validated against the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program decile ranking. RESULTS: The overall 30-day surgical site infection rate was 38 of 635 (6.0%) among all cases in the preintervention period, with 11 superficial (1.7%), two deep (0.3%), and 25 organ or space infections (3.9%). In the intervention period, the overall rate was 2 of 190 (1.1%), with two organ or space infections (1.1%). Overall, the relative risk reduction in surgical site infection was 82.4% (P=.01). The surgical site infection relative risk reduction was 77.6% among ovarian cancer with bowel resection, 79.3% among ovarian cancer without bowel resection, and 100% among uterine cancer. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program decile ranking improved from the 10th decile to first decile; risk-adjusted odds ratio for surgical site infection decreased from 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0–2.6) to 0.6 (0.3–1.1). CONCLUSION: Implementation of an evidence-based surgical site infection reduction bundle was associated with substantial reductions in surgical site infection in high-risk cancer procedures. Implementation of an evidence-based intervention bundle is associated with a reduction in surgical site infection rates after laparotomies for uterine and ovarian cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001449", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2375003843", "source": "openalex"}

The questionnaire asked patients about their comfort levels with having medical students present during commonly encountered clinical situations. A random subsample of these patients were also asked whether they would allow a medical student to be present during future visits, and why or why not.A total of 229 patients completed the survey and 124 responded to the supplemental survey. Sixteen respondents were excluded due to missing data or a lack of an adequate comparison group. A majority responded they would feel comfortable having a medical student present during most clinical situations. Almost half of the patients preferred to see the doctor and medical student together, while less than a quarter wanted to see just the physician. Patients with more experience with medical students were more likely to favor medical student involvement and would feel more comfortable having a medical student present during obstetrics or gynecology clinical situations.Patients are willing to involve and feel comfortable with medical students in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic.

We have designed the combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment (CORT) procedure for the treatment of postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall and developed several new techniques for its realization. The aim of the surgery is as follows: (1) total resection of the tumor with only a microscopic margin (R1) at the pelvic wall, preserving the bony pelvis and the neurovascular support of the leg; (2) modulation of the therapeutic index for a second high-dose irradiation of the pelvic wall by transferring autologous tissue from the abdomen or the thigh, and (3) reconstruction of pelvic organ functions lost due to tumor resection. The tumor bed is irradiated postoperatively with brachytherapy through transcutaneous guide tubes implanted at the pelvic wall. METHODS Between April 1989 and December 1994, we treated 48 patients with postirradiation recurrent or persistent gynecologic malignancies infiltrating the pelvic wall with CORT and followed them prospectively with the following endpoints: tumor control, survival, complications, and quality of life. RESULTS At a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 3–71 months), the 5-year survival probability calculated with the Kaplan–Meier method was 44%. The overall local control rate was 68%, and 85% in the last 25 patients in the series. The censored severe complication rate at 5 years was 33%. No patient died as a consequence of the treatment. Quality of life was self-assessed with a validated questionnaire by 15 patients without evidence of disease, and was rated with a total of 74% of the maximum score points. Age of the patient, state of resection at the pelvic wall (R1 vs. R2), and recurrent tumor size independently influenced tumor progression after CORT in this series. CONCLUSIONS CORT appears to be a feasible, innovative treatment with long term survival potential and acceptable quality of life for selected patients with postirradiation gynecologic tumor recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall. R1 resection of the tumor at the pelvic wall is mandatory; however, the reconstruction options within the pelvis are limited.

Methods This was a retrospective study. From the operative records of the eight participating gynecological ultrasound centers, we identified patients with a surgically confirmed diagnosis of adnexal torsion, defined as surgical evidence of ovarian pedicle, paraovarian cyst and/or Fallopian tube twisted on its own axis, who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced examiner, between 2008 and 2018. Only cases with at least two available ultrasound images and/or videoclips (one grayscale and one with Doppler evaluation) were included. Clinical, ultrasound, surgical and histological information was retrieved from each patient's medical record and entered into an Excel file by the principal investigator at each center. In addition, two authors reviewed all available ultrasound images and videoclips of the twisted adnexa, with regard to the presence of four predefined ultrasound features reported to be characteristic of adnexal torsion: (1) ovarian stromal edema with or without peripherally displaced antral follicles, (2) the follicular ring sign, (3) the whirlpool sign and (4) absence of vascularization in the twisted organ. Results A total of 315 cases of adnexal torsion were identified. The median age of the patients was 30 (range, 1–88) years. Most patients were premenopausal (284/314; 90.4%) and presented with acute or subacute pelvic pain (305/315; 96.8%). The surgical approach was laparoscopic in 239/312 (76.6%) patients and conservative surgery (untwisting with or without excision of a lesion) was performed in 149/315 (47.3%) cases. According to the original ultrasound reports, the median largest diameter of the twisted organ was 83 (range, 30–349) mm. Free fluid in the pouch of Douglas was detected in 196/275 (71.3%) patients. Ovarian stromal edema with or without peripherally displaced antral follicles was reported in the original ultrasound report in 167/241 (69.3%) patients, the whirlpool sign in 178/226 (78.8%) patients, absent color Doppler signals in the twisted organ in 119/269 (44.2%) patients and the follicular ring sign in 51/134 (38.1%) patients. On retrospective review of images and videoclips, ovarian stromal edema with or without peripherally displaced antral follicles (201/254; 79.1%) and the whirlpool sign (139/153; 90.8%) were the most commonly detected features of adnexal torsion. Conclusion Most patients with surgically confirmed adnexal torsion are of reproductive age and present with acute or subacute pain. Common ultrasound signs are an enlarged adnexa, the whirlpool sign, ovarian stromal edema with or without peripherally displaced antral follicles and free fluid in the pelvis. The follicular ring sign and absence of Doppler signals in the twisted organ are slightly less common signs. Recognizing ultrasound signs of adnexal torsion is important so that the correct treatment, i.e. surgery without delay, can be offered. Copyright © 2020 ISUOG.

They may be particularly susceptible to these agents if their origins are related to hereditary breast cancer (BRCA) mutations; this implicates defective DNA repair secondary to inherited alterations in BRCA function. The concept of 'BRCAness' was introduced by Ashworth and colleagues in order to identify phenotypic changes in sporadic cancer that would lead to analogous treatment susceptibility. In fact, recent analyses of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer have led to further extending this concept to all women with high-grade serous cancer, the predominant form of ovarian cancer arising in association with hereditary mutations in BRCA genes. Presumably, most serous types of cancer of gynecological origin share BRCA dysfunction to some extent. This renders these types of cancer susceptible to platinum and to other DNA-damaging agents, justifying the general inclusion of this histology in trials of new drugs and therapeutic strategies that have shown activity against hereditary cancer. More recently, however, differences in outcome between BRCA mutation carriers vis-à-vis those with no mutations or those with epigenetic or acquired forms of BRCA genes (somatic mutations) in their respective tumors have been identified. These findings raise additional questions on modifiers of 'BRCAness' and other pathways that appear to contribute to the effects of platinum and other DNA-damaging agents in ovarian cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas analyses delineate the complexity of genomic alterations in ovarian cancer and other malignancies of Mullerian epithelial origin promising further refinements of the 'BRCAness' concept.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121419775", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: A systematic review assessed the relationship of the organization of gynecologic oncology services with patient survival and surgical outcomes. The electronic databases medline and embase (ovid: 1996 through 9 January 2015) were searched using terms related to gynecologic malignancies combined with organization of services, patterns of care, and various facility and physician characteristics. Outcomes of interest included overall or disease-specific survival, short-term survival, adequate staging, and degree of cytoreduction or optimal cytoreduction (or both) for ovarian cancer patients by hospital or physician type, and rate of discrepancy in initial diagnoses and intraoperative consultation between non-specialist pathologists and gyne-oncology–specialist pathologists. Results: One systematic review and sixteen additional primary studies met the inclusion criteria. The evidence base as a whole was judged to be of lower quality; however, a trend toward improved outcomes with centralization of gynecologic oncology was found, particularly with respect to the gynecologic oncology care of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Conclusions: Improvements in outcomes with centralization of gynecologic oncology services can be attributed to a number of factors, including access to specialist care and multidisciplinary team management.

Typical microscopic findings include a uniform population of endometrial stromal-type cells invading the myometrium and myometrial vessels. Imaging studies cannot reliably diagnose ESS preoperatively, so surgical resection for a presumed fibroid is a common scenario. Hysterectomy is the cornerstone of treatment for localized ESS, but morcellation should be avoided. Systematic lymphadenectomy in ESS does not improve the outcome. Leaving the ovaries in situ does not worsen survival and this is of importance especially for young women.

CONCLUSION This study, performed before the institution of the new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education resident duty hour policies, demonstrated that, although women house officers continued to work more than 80 hours per week during pregnancy, most had a good pregnancy outcome. Nevertheless, there was a higher frequency of preterm labor, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction in female residents than in spouses or partners of male residents. Most women residents in obstetrics and gynecology work more than 80 hours per week throughout pregnancy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006250-200311000-00012", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4235304294", "source": "openalex"}

Despite this amount of evidence describing the efficacy of magnesium, few and un-systematize data are available about the pharmacological mechanism of this ion for these conditions. Herein, we review and systematize the available evidence about the use of oral magnesium supplementation in several gynecological conditions and discuss the pharmacological mechanisms that characterize these interventions.

Four questions asked women the type (obstetrician/gynecologist, nurse practitioner, or primary care physician) and sex of provider who performed their last pelvic examination and their preferences in type and sex of provider for these examinations. This was a random sample of female HMO members 35-85 years of age who were empaneled with a primary care physician from one of three categories: family practitioner, general internist, or subspecialist. Of the 5164 respondents who received their last pelvic examination at Kaiser Permanente, 56% had seen a gynecologist, 26% a nurse practitioner, and only 18% their own primary care physician for the examination. Of these women, 60.3% reported preferring a gynecologist for basic gynecology care, 12.6% preferred a nurse practitioner, 13.3% preferred their own primary care physician, and 13.8% had no preference. Patients of family practitioners were more likely to prefer their own primary care practitioner than patients of other types of doctors. The strongest independent predictor of preferring a gynecologist over the primary care physician was having seen a gynecologist for the last pelvic examination (OR = 28.3, p < 0.0001). Other independent predictors of preferring a gynecologist were younger age, higher education and income, and having a male primary care physician. Of respondents, 52.2% preferred a female provider for basic gynecological care, and 42.0% had no preference for the sex of the provider. Preferring a female provider was strongly and independently associated with lower income, higher education, nonwhite race, having a male primary care physician, having an older primary care, physician, and having seen a female provider at the last pelvic examination. In this HMO, a majority of women reported a preference for seeing an obstetrician/gynecologist for their routine gynecological care, despite having a primary care physician. This most likely reflects the strong influence of previous patient experience and that familiarity with a particular type of provider leads to preferences for that type. This medical group's structure probably also affects preferences, as in this HMO, primary care physicians can be discouraged from performing pelvic examinations. Many women do prefer female providers for pelvic examinations, but a large percentage have no preference. These women often see male providers for basic gynecological care. As managed care places increasing emphasis on providing integrated, comprehensive primary care, this apparent preference for specialty gynecological care will require further study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/152460999319147", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2122959588", "source": "openalex"}

Methods All pelvic exenteration procedures performed between 01/2003 and 06/2009 were evaluated. Extent of surgical radicality, operative techniques, and outcome were evaluated. Kaplan–Meier curves were calculated for Overall (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). Results Forty‐seven patients (median age: 52.5 years) were evaluated. Ten of 47 patients (21.3%) had a primary and 37(78.7%) a relapsed cancer. Most common (80.8%) site of origin was the cervix. Patients (80.8%) had undergone previous pelvic irradiation. A total exenteration was performed in 32/47 patients (68%). A complete tumor resection was obtained in 23 patients (49%). Thirty‐three patients (70.2%) had at least one major complication, including ileus (8.5%), intestinal‐fistula (29.8%), ureteral anastomotic insufficiency (6.4%), abscess (6.4%), and cardiothrombotic events (23.4%). At a median follow‐up of 7 months (range: 1–42), 22/47 patients (46.8%) died and 22/47 (46.8%) experienced a relapse. Median OS was 4 months (range: 0.1–16) and 22 months (range: 6–42) for patients with versus without postoperative tumor residuals, respectively ( P = 0.0006), while median PFS was 4 months (range:0.1–16) versus 12months (range: 6–42) ( P &lt; 0.0001).

Transcatheter embolization procedures performed with the use of radiologic imaging for guidance are minimally invasive and may obviate surgery, thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality and safeguarding the patient's future fertility potential. To integrate this treatment method optimally into patient care, knowledge is needed about the clinical indications for therapeutic embolization, the relevant vascular anatomy, technical considerations of the procedure, and the potential risks and benefits of embolization. The most well-known and well-studied transcatheter embolization technique for treating a gynecologic-obstetric condition is uterine fibroid embolization. However, the clinical indications for transcatheter embolization are much broader and include many benign gynecologic conditions, such as adenomyosis and arteriovenous malformations, as well as intractable bleeding due to inoperable advanced-stage malignancies. Uterine artery embolization may be performed to prevent or treat bleeding associated with various obstetric conditions, including postpartum hemorrhage, placental implantation abnormality, and ectopic pregnancy. Embolization of the uterine artery or the internal iliac artery also may be performed to control pelvic bleeding due to coagulopathy or iatrogenic injury, and ovarian vein embolization has been shown to be effective for the management of pelvic congestion syndrome. The article discusses these and other gynecologic and obstetric indications for transcatheter embolization, provides detailed descriptions of imaging findings before and after embolization, and reviews procedural techniques and outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.326125524", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139495640", "source": "openalex"}

An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the cases, the likely source of infection, and the route of transmission. Four recent HCV infections were identified. Based on molecular fingerprinting analysis and epidemiological investigation, transmission between the putative source patient (an HCV-positive woman who was the first patient of the surgical session) and outbreak patients was highly suggestive. All patients, including the source patient, were infected with HCV type 1b. Molecular characterization of HCV clones by sequence analysis of both structural envelope regions (20 clones from the source patient and 58 from the outbreak patients) and the nonstructural NS5 region of the viral genome (12 clones from the source patient and 32 from the outbreak patients) showed close homology between the viral isolates from the source and those from the outbreak patients that was higher than that observed between the viral isolates from the source and those from four unrelated, HCV type 1b-infected patients from the same geographical area (in the latter case, 33 clones were sequenced for the envelope regions and 30 were sequenced for the NS5 region). The mean percent divergence between clones was 4.69 for the envelope and 3.71 for the NS5 region in the source patient and the outbreak patients compared with 6.76 ( P = 0.001) and 5.22 ( P = 0.01) in the source patient and control patients, respectively. Among the risk factors investigated, only that of having undergone surgery in the morning session of the same day reached statistical significance ( P = 0.003). The investigation showed that the source patient and outbreak patients shared only the administration of propofol in multidose vials. The study documents the risk of nosocomial transmission of HCV and the importance of infection control procedures in the operating room and highlights the crucial role of molecular strategies, especially sequence-based phylogenetic analysis of cloned viral isolates, in the investigation of HCV outbreaks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.39.8.2860-2863.2001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086820218", "source": "openalex"}

Determination of the N‐terminal sequence of this peptide revealed that it is closely related or identical to the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. Therefore, the peptide is called tumor‐associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI). The concentration of TATI was determined by radioimmunoassay in the urine of 148 patients with various forms of gynecologic malignancy and in a reference population consisting of 98 patients with non‐malignant gynecologic disease, and also in 40 patients with severe infections or inflammatory disease. In the reference population, the median urinary concentration of TATI was 22 μg/g creatinine and the central 95 % reference interval was 7‐50 μg/g creatinine. Elevated urinary levels were observed in 53 % of all patients with gynecologic cancer, in 63 % of those with active disease and 26% of those in clinical remission. The highest urinary TATI level (11,000 μg/g creatinine) was over 200 times the upper limit of the reference range. Patients with cervical cancer had the highest frequency of elevated values. Increased excretion of TATI was also observed in patients with severe bronchopulmonary infections and pancreatitis. Although increased excretion of TATI is not cancer‐specific, the distinction by elevated levels of TATI between malignant and nonmalignant gynecologic disease is better than by most other putative tumor markers, and the increased excretion of TATI in patients with active disease can be important for the understanding of tumor biology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910310606", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114054465", "source": "openalex"}

BACKGROUND: Women receive more negative feedback and evaluations than men—from both sexes. Some suggest that, to be successful in traditionally male roles such as surgeon, women must manifest a warmth-related (communal) rather than competence-related (agentic) demeanor. Compared with male residents, female residents experience more interpersonal difficulties and less help from female nurses. We examined feedback provided to residents by female nurses. METHODS: We examined Professional Associate Questionnaires (2006–2014) using a mixed-methods design. We compared scores per training year by gender using Mann-Whitney and linear regression adjusting for resident and nurse cohorts. Using grounded theory analysis, we developed a coding system for blinded comments based on principles of effective feedback, medical learners' evaluation, and impression management. χ2 examined the proportions of negative and positive and communal and agentic comments between genders. RESULTS: We examined 2,202 evaluations: 397 (18%) for 10 men and 1,805 (82%) for 34 women. Twenty-three compliments (eg, \"Great resident!\") were excluded. Evaluations per training year varied: men n=77–134; women n=384–482. Postgraduate year (PGY)-1, PGY-2, and PGY-4 women had lower mean ratings (P<.035); when adjusted, the difference remained significant in PGY-2 (MWomen=1.5±0.6 compared with MMen=1.7±0.5; P=.001). Postgraduate year-1 women received disproportionately fewer positive and more negative agentic comments than PGY-1 men (positive=17.3% compared with 40%, negative=17.3% compared with 3.3%, respectively; P=.041). CONCLUSION: Evidence of gender bias in evaluations emerged; albeit subtle, women received harsher feedback as lower-level residents than men. Training in effective evaluation and gender bias management is warranted. Gender bias is evident in nurse evaluations of obstetrics and gynecology residents: in this study, women received harsher comments in year 1 and worse scores in year 2.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001044", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2325831870", "source": "openalex"}

Finally, we reviewed current clinical trials that incorporate metformin as a prevention or treatment strategy for gynecologic cancers. Evidence Acquisition A thorough search of PubMed for all current literature was performed. All preclinical, clinical, and epidemiologic reviews were evaluated across all cancers, with a focus on gynecologic cancer. Results The preclinical, epidemiologic, and clinical data evaluated in this review are strongly supportive of the use of metformin for the prevention and treatment of gynecologic cancer. On the basis of these data, centers are currently enrolling for clinical trials using metformin in patients diagnosed with gynecologic malignancies. Conclusions and Relevance The data supporting the use of metformin in the prevention and treatment of cancers are building, including that of endometrial and ovarian cancer. The association between obesity, insulin resistance, as well as increased risk and poor outcomes in endometrial and ovarian cancer patients makes metformin an attractive agent for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians Learning Objectives After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to appraise the underlying biologic mechanisms of metformin's antitumorigenic effects; assess the epidemiologic and preclinical data that affect a woman's risk for developing endometrial cancers, support the use of metformin in patients with endometrial and ovarian cancer, and explore its use in the prevention and treatment of both of these cancers; as well as evaluate clinical trials that incorporate metformin as a prevention or treatment strategy for gynecologic cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0000000000000092", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2044649390", "source": "openalex"}

Acute surgical pain is a modifiable risk factor for development of chronic postoperative pain, which is reported by up to 26% of gynecologic surgical patients. In other surgical populations, multimodal analgesia has shown improved pain control and decreased reliance on opioids. This review examines recent evidence for various analgesic modalities applied specifically to the gynecologic surgical population. Recent findings Nonopioid agents like acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs resulted in reduction in postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Application of regional anesthetic techniques had a favorable effect that persisted beyond the immediate recovery period. Preemptive analgesia remains unproven. The best evidence for effective combinations comes from ERAS studies that incorporated multimodal analgesia into a systemic approach geared towards early discharge. Summary Multimodal analgesia had demonstrated advantages for all types of gynecological surgeries in terms of improving postoperative pain control and minimizing opioid-related adverse effects. Multimodal analgesia includes acetaminophen, NSAIDS, and gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs combined with intraoperative nonopioid analgesics such as ketamine, regional anesthesia or intrathecal morphine. Further research should focus on determining most effective combinations and doses of multimodal analgesia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000584", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2790157604", "source": "openalex"}

When preventive measures fail, prompt recognition and management of injury can avoid long-term sequelae such as fistula formation and loss of renal function. Intraoperative identification should be the primary goal when an injury occurs, although this is not always possible. Postoperative injury recognition requires a high level of suspicion and vigilance. In addition to history and physical examination, appropriate radiologic studies can be useful in localizing injury and planning management strategies. Some injuries may require Foley catheter drainage or ureteral stenting alone, whereas others will require operative intervention with ureteral resection and reanastomosis or reimplantation. Prompt restoration of urinary drainage or diversion will avoid further renal compromise. Prevention, prompt recognition, and management of urologic injuries after gynecologic surgery will reduce the risks of fistula formation and loss of renal function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001425", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2351236140", "source": "openalex"}

However, since in the modern era women delay their childbearing for a variety of social reasons, more and more women in the near future will be nulliparous and have a diagnosis of EC at the same time. Hence, a more conservative approach of EC is desirable to preserve fertility of these women, without compromising their survival. Recently, the number of studies reporting encouraging results on fertility-sparing management of EC with high dose of progestins is increasing. It seems that preserving the uterus and the ovaries in a carefully selected patient with EC confers only a very small risk combined with an enormous benefit. Selection of women suitable for such a conservative approach, as well as method of treatment, follow-up, recurrence, obstetric outcomes, and survival rates are very important parameters when consulting women with EC wishing to preserve their fertility.

This study aimed to identify risk factors for LLL and to develop a prediction model for its occurrence.Pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA) with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PALA) was performed on 366 patients with gynecologic malignancies at Yaizu City Hospital between April 2002 and July 2014; we retrospectively analyzed 264 eligible patients. The intervals between surgery and diagnosis of LLL were calculated; the prevalence and risk factors were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. We developed a prediction model with which patients were scored and classified as low-risk or high-risk.The cumulative incidence of LLL was 23.1% at 1 year, 32.8% at 3 years, and 47.7% at 10 years post-surgery. LLL developed after a median 13.5 months. Using regression analysis, body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.616; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.030-2.535), PLA + PALA (HR, 2.323; 95% CI, 1.126-4.794), postoperative radiation therapy (HR, 2.469; 95% CI, 1.148-5.310), and lymphocyst formation (HR, 1.718; 95% CI, 1.120-2.635) were found to be independently associated with LLL; age, type of cancer, number of lymph nodes, retroperitoneal suture, chemotherapy, lymph node metastasis, herbal medicine, self-management education, or infection were not associated with LLL. The predictive score was based on the 4 associated variables; patients were classified as high-risk (scores 3-6) and low-risk (scores 0-2). LLL incidence was significantly greater in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.440-3.324).

However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of different statins or the effects of these statins in gynaecological malignancies. The apoptotic potential of two lipophilic statins (lovastatin and simvastatin) and one hydrophilic statin (pravastatin) was assessed in cancer cell lines (ovarian, endometrial and cervical) and primary cultured cancerous and normal tissues. Cell viability was studied by MTS assays and apoptosis was confirmed by Western blotting of PARP and flow cytometry. The expressions of key apoptotic cascade proteins were analysed. Our results demonstrate that both lovastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, selectively induced cell death in dose- and time-dependent manner in ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers. Little or no toxicity was observed with any statin on normal cells. Lipophilic statins induced activation of caspase-8 and -9; BID cleavage, cytochrome C release and PARP cleavage. Statin-sensitive cancers expressed high levels of HMG-CoA reductase compared with resistant cultures. The effect of lipophilic statins was dependent on inhibition of enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase since mevalonate pre-incubation almost completely abrogated the apoptotic effect. Moreover, the apoptotic effect involved the inhibition of synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate rather than farnesyl pyrophosphate. In conclusion, lipophilic but not hydrophilic statins induce cell death through activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic cascades in cancerous cells from the human female genital tract, which express high levels of HMG-CoA reductase. These results promote further investigation in the use of lipophilic statins as anticancer agents in gynaecological malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00771.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2021001174", "source": "openalex"}

In studies from genetic screening clinics, women with mutations in the breast and ovarian susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been found to have a low risk of peritoneal carcinoma in the first years after bilateral oophorectomy. We assessed the level and persistence of reduction of ovarian (including peritoneal) cancer risk after gynecologic surgeries for women who carry BRCA1/2 mutations but were not selected from high-risk clinics. Methods: We identified 1124 Israeli women with incident ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer and tested 847 of them for the three Ashkenazi founder mutations. We compared gynecologic surgery history among all case patients, BRCA1 (n = 187) and BRCA2 (n = 64) carrier case patients, and the non-carrier case patients (n = 598) with that in control subjects drawn from a population registry (n = 2396). We estimated ovarian cancer risk (odds ratios [ORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) after gynecologic surgery in mutation carriers and non-carriers with logistic regression models. Results: Eight women with primary peritoneal cancer and 128 control subjects reported a previous bilateral oophorectomy (OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.06 to 0.24). Other gynecologic surgeries were associated with a 30%–50% reduced risk of ovarian cancer, depending on the type of surgery, with surgery to remove some ovarian tissue associated with the most risk reduction (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.74). Reduced risks were seen in BRCA1/2 carriers and non-carriers. Age at surgery and years since surgery did not affect risk reductions.

Methods: During a 1-year period, 200 gynecologic oncology patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of early compared with traditional oral postoperative feeding. Patients allocated to early postoperative oral feeding began a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day and then advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. Patients allocated to traditional postoperative oral feeding received nothing by mouth until return of bowel function (defined as the passage of flatus in the absence of vomiting or abdominal distention), then began a clear liquid diet, and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. Results: Age, case distribution, surgery length, blood loss, and first passage of flatus were similar in the early and traditional feeding groups. Significantly more patients in the early group developed nausea. Despite this, the incidence of vomiting, abdominal distention, incidence and duration of nasogastric tube use, and percentage of patients who tolerated clear liquid and regular diets on the first attempt were comparable in both groups. Time to development of bowel sounds, time to initiation of clear liquid and regular diets, and hospital stay were significantly longer in the traditional group.

Suicidal ideation, which was thought to be precursor to suicide attempts, has not been well studied. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, and determinants of suicidal ideation for women with gynecological cancer, and then to assess the effect of coping style and social support on suicidal ideation. Methods Patients with cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancers seen at Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital from September 2012 to June 2013 were consecutively recruited and were asked to complete the Zung Self‐Rating Depression Scale, Suicidal Ideation of Self‐rating Scale, Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire and Social Support Rating Scale. Path analysis was used to examine the relationship among coping style, social support, depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. Results A total of 579 (579/623, 93.0%) gynecological cancer patients were enrolled in this study and completed all investigations between September 2012 and June 2013. Among them, 105 (18.1%) patients reported suicidal ideation, with the highest rate in patients with ovarian cancer (30.16%). Suicidal ideation was associated with depression symptoms, care providers, chemotherapy history and acceptance‐resignation. Path analysis showed that the acceptance‐resignation affected suicidal ideation directly as well as mediated by social support and depression symptoms, while confrontation and avoidance affected suicidal ideation entirely through social support and depression symptoms. Conclusions Suicidal ideation is high among patients with gynecological cancer, especially among ovarian cancer patients. Coping strategies such as confrontation and avoidance, and social support may be helpful for preventing suicidal ideation among them.

Neuroendocrine tumors in the gynecologic tract are uncommon and account for about 2% of all gynecologic malignancies but may also be metastatic from other sites. They require a multimodality therapeutic approach determined by the extent of disease and the primary organ of involvement. Pathological diagnosis is critical to guide therapy.

This statistic rises to 30% in late pregnancy and in immunosuppressed patients. The most often occurring species is Candida albicans. Host factors, especially local defense deficiencies, gene polymorphisms, allergic factors, serum glucose levels, antibiotics, psychosocial stress and estrogens influence the risk for a Candida vulvovaginitis. In less than 10% of all cases, non-albicans species, especially C. glabrata, but in rare cases also Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cause a vulvovaginitis, often with fewer clinical signs and symptoms. Typical symptoms include premenstrual itching, burning, redness and non-odorous discharge. Although pruritus and inflammation of the vaginal introitus are typical symptoms, only less than 50% of women with genital pruritus suffer from a Candida vulvovaginitis. Diagnostic tools are anamnesis, evaluation of clinical signs, the microscopic investigation of the vaginal fluid by phase contrast (400 x), vaginal pH-value and, in clinically and microscopically uncertain or in recurrent cases, yeast culture with species determination. The success rate for treatment of acute vaginal candidosis is approximately 80%. Vaginal preparations containing polyenes, imidazoles and ciclopiroxolamine or oral triazoles, which are not allowed during pregnancy, are all equally effective. C. glabrata is resistant to the usual dosages of all local antimycotics. Therefore, vaginal boric acid suppositories or vaginal flucytosine are recommended, but not allowed or available in all countries. Therefore, high doses of 800 mg fluconazole/day for 2-3 weeks are recommended in Germany. Due to increasing resistence, oral posaconazole 2 × 400 mg/day plus local ciclopiroxolamine or nystatin for 15 days was discussed. C. krusei is resistant to triazoles. Side effects, toxicity, embryotoxicity and allergy are not clinically important. A vaginal clotrimazole treatment in the first trimester of pregnancy has shown to reduce the rate of preterm births in two studies. Resistance of C. albicans does not play a clinically important role in vulvovaginal candidosis. Although it is not necessary to treat vaginal candida colonization in healthy women, it is recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy in Germany, because the rate of oral thrush and diaper dermatitis in mature healthy newborns, induced by the colonization during vaginal delivery, is significantly reduced through prophylaxis. Chronic recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis requires a \"chronic recurrent\" suppression therapy, until immunological treatment becomes available. Weekly to monthly oral fluconazole regimes suppress relapses well, but cessation of therapy after 6 or 12 months leads to relapses in 50% of cases. Decreasing-dose maintenance regime of 200 mg fluconazole from an initial 3 times a week to once monthly (Donders 2008) leads to more acceptable results. Future studies should include candida autovaccination, antibodies against candida virulence factors and other immunological trials. Probiotics should also be considered in further studies. Over the counter (OTC) treatment must be reduced.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0507.2012.02185.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1993171046", "source": "openalex"}

To gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenological experiences in question, we interviewed nine gynecological cancer patients and seven cancer-free women. After implementing a relaxation protocol, we asked each woman to describe her feelings and thoughts on her sexuality and body image in one-on-one interviews. A variety of themes emerged on patients' attitudes and perspectives concerning sexuality and body image following diagnosis and treatment of the cancer. The themes that were considerably different from those of the cancer-free women included decreased sexual functioning and body image, abrupt shifts in self-identity due to loss of physical integrity, and distancing in intimate relationships. Several implications of these findings for clinical practice are discussed, as well as the need to train medical professionals to properly assess these patients' alterations in sexuality.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1037/a0021428", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1966162740", "source": "openalex"}

Additionally, another objective is to analyze the association between psychological distress and sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and social support to produce a prediction model for the outcome measures. Methods A cross‐sectional study was carried out with 100 women who had undergone radical surgery for breast or gynecological cancer. Both groups were divided into the following: younger than 50 years old and 50 years old or older. Body Image Scale, Rosenberg's Self‐Esteem Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were used. Results Age had a significant main effect on psychological distress but the type of cancer did not. Younger women showed significantly greater distress than older women ( p ‐values &lt; 0.001). A significant interaction between age and type of cancer was found, indicating that older women with breast cancer had worse body image and more depression than those with gynecological cancer ( p ‐values &lt; 0.001); no significant differences were found between younger groups. The prediction model for increased body image disturbance and depression included the joint effect of the following variables: being younger, inactive occupational status, and post‐adjuvant therapy side effects. For lower self‐esteem, the variables were: being younger, post‐adjuvant therapy side effects, and dissatisfaction with social support. And for higher anxiety, the sole variable included was post‐adjuvant therapy side effects. Conclusions Both mastectomy and hysterectomy/oophorectomy cause similar psychological distress in younger women, but mastectomy causes greater distress in older women than hysterectomy/oophorectomy.

This narrative review brings all the relevant information from the guidelines together into one document, to support patient care. We present a detailed review of published guidelines, statements, comments from peer-reviewed journals, and nationally/internationally recognized professional bodies and societies' web pages (in English or with English translation available) between December 1, 2019 and May 27, 2020. Search terms included combinations of COVID, SARS-COV-2, guideline, gynecology, oncology, gynecological, cancer. Recommendations for surgical and oncological prioritization of gynecological cancers are discussed and summarized. The role of minimally invasive surgery, patient perspectives, medico-legal aspects, and clinical trials during the pandemic are also discussed. The consensus is that elective benign surgery should cease and cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy should continue based on prioritization. Patient and staff face-to-face interactions should be limited, and health resources used efficiently using prioritization strategies. This review and the guidelines on which it is based support the difficult decisions currently facing us in gynecological cancer.

This paper describes some of the most common types of information bias, using examples from obstetrics and gynecology, and describes how information bias may affect results of observational studies. Non-differential misclassification occurs when the degree of misclassification of exposure status among those with and those without the disease is the same; in cohort studies, this type of bias is most likely and will bias estimates toward no association when exposure is dichotomized. Non-differential underreporting of an exposure with more than two categories may mask a true threshold effect as a dose-response relation and, if a true threshold effect exists, the threshold will be set at too low a level, if the exposure is underreported. Differential misclassification may cause bias in either direction and is particularly likely, when exposure status is reported after the outcome occurred. Misclassification of confounders is an issue that needs special attention by researchers, as failure to measure accurately one or more (strong) confounders may seriously bias the observed results. Misclassification of disease status may also cause bias of estimates of association in either direction. Information bias is probably best prevented during planning of data collection, as there are few and insufficient methods available for correcting inaccurate information.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13330", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2790309788", "source": "openalex"}

To demonstrate the role of pRb regulation by p21, we measured the sensitivity to NaB of cervical cancer cells in which pRb had been inactivated by HPV E7. The cervical cancer cells displayed a sensitivity in NaB-mediated G2/M arrest in addition to their sensitivity in G0/G1 arrest. Arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M accompanied induction of senescence-like phenotypes (SLPs). Most importantly, the effect of NaB on senescence induction was not coupled with the predominance of hypophosphorylated pRb forms in the cervical cancer cells. This suggested that NaB had the potential to elicit SLPs through p21-mediated withdrawal from cell cycle progression. The consequences of p21 induction were manifold. The effects of NaB on gynecologic cancer cell growth indicated its potential use in cancer treatment. NaB was effective even in the cancer cells with mutant p53 and/or Rb genes by eliciting cell senescence. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.1448", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1993943690", "source": "openalex"}

To assess this association, the authors used data from a large cohort of 54,362 women with a diagnosis of infertility who were referred to Danish fertility clinics between 1963 and 1998. Through 2003, 1,975 cancers were identified by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. Cancer risk was assessed through standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, using general and parity-specific cancer incidence rates in the general population of Denmark as a reference. After adjustment for parity status, significantly increased SIRs were observed for breast (SIR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.16) and ovarian (SIR = 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 1.71) cancer. The risk of breast cancer increased with follow-up time. Similar risk patterns were observed for the different histologic types of breast cancer and all nonmucinous types of ovarian cancer, whereas the risk of mucinous ovarian cancers seemed not to be increased. These data thus suggest higher risks of breast and ovarian cancer among infertile women. However, since these results could not distinguish the effects of underlying infertility from the effects of fertility treatment, additional studies are needed to disentangle the effects of these two factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwn094", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152092767", "source": "openalex"}

The suppression of apoptosis contributes to carcinogenesis, as well as to a resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Circulating soluble Fas (sFas), which is generated by alternative mRNA splicing, can antagonize cell-surface Fas function. We investigated sFas levels in 64 patients with gynecological malignancies (28 cervical carcinomas, 18 endometrial carcinomas, and 18 ovarian carcinomas) and in 24 healthy female donors by using a Fas-specific ELISA. In each carcinoma group, serum sFas demonstrated a statistically significant elevation relative to levels in normal controls (P < 0.0001). Levels of serum sFas in patients with advanced cancer (FIGO stages III and IV) significantly exceeded those in patients with localized cancer (FIGO stages I and II) or those in normal control subjects (P < 0.0001).

In countries with an established screening program for cervical cancer, the majority of gynecologic malignancies occur in postmenopausal women. However, a substantial number of affected women are of childbearing age and have not completed their families. In these younger women, consideration of fertility preservation may be important. This article describes the fertility-sparing treatment options that are currently available and outlines the role of imaging in the selection of eligible patients on the basis of a review of the literature. In the setting of cervical cancer, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used to delineate the size, position, and stage of the tumor for selection of patients who are suitable for radical trachelectomy. In patients with solitary complex adnexal masses, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging sequences are used to categorize the likelihood of invasive or borderline malignancy for consideration of unilateral ovarian resection, with fertility preservation when possible. In patients with endometrial cancer, MR imaging is used to rule out signs of invasive disease before hormone therapy is considered. Imaging is also used at patient follow-up to detect recurrent disease; however, evidence to support this application is limited. In conclusion, imaging is an essential tool in the care of patients with gynecologic malignancies who are considering fertility-preserving treatment options. ©RSNA, 2016", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2016150254", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2552064396", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 19 patients with neoplastic cells in their peritoneal washing cytology specimens, 12 had primary ovarian neoplasms, 4 had primary uterine cervical neoplasms, 2 had primary endometrial neoplasms, and 1 had mammary carcinoma metastatic to the ovary. Gynecologic oncologists at this institution are now routinely obtaining peritoneal washing cytology specimens whenever there is intraabdominal surgery on patients known to have or suspected of having a pelvic neoplasm. The following criteria were found to be essential to the accurate evaluation of these specimens: (1) cells considered to be malignant should be present both singly and in groups and should be malignant by the usual cytologic criteria, (2) the patients must have or be known to have had a neoplasm whose cells are similar to those in the washing specimen, and (3) the cells considered to be neoplastic must be different from and not confused with reactive mesothelial cells. The last criterion is important because the peritoneal lavage traumatically removes mesothelium, which can appear atypical. These criteria make the cytologic interpretation of most peritoneal washing specimens straightforward; interesting diagnostic problems occur, however, including the evaluation of neoplasms of borderline malignancy, those \"spilled\" during surgery and second neoplasms found by peritoneal washing cytology.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2407311745", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Databases of four gynecological ultrasound centers were searched to identify patients with histologically proven GCTs who had undergone a standard preoperative ultrasound examination. Results A total of 23 women with confirmed GCT were identified. Twelve (52%) women were postmenopausal, nine (39%) were of fertile age and two (9%) were prepubertal. Clinical symptoms were abdominal distension (7/23, 30%), pain (5/23, 22%) and irregular vaginal bleeding (6/23, 26%). Seven patients (30%) were asymptomatic. Endometrial pathology was found in 54% (7/13) of the patients from whom endometrial biopsies were taken. On ultrasound scan 12/23 (52%) masses were multilocular–solid, 9/23 (39%) were purely solid, one mass (4%) was unilocular–solid and one mass was multilocular (4%). Multilocular and multilocular–solid cysts typically contained large numbers of small locules (&gt; 10). The echogenicity of the cyst content was most often mixed (6/16, 38%) or low level (7/16, 44%). Papillary projections were found in only four women (17%).

Conclusions At ultrasound examination, most GCTs are large multilocular–solid masses with a large number of locules, or solid tumors with heterogeneous echogenicity of the solid tissue. Hemorrhagic components are common and increased vascularity is demonstrated at color/power Doppler ultrasound examination.

METHODS: Sentinel events, medication errors, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and decision making were measured before and after the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education work-hour reforms. Data sources consisted of the perinatal database at MetroHealth Medical Center (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH), incident reports filed in the hospital department of risk management, the patient-satisfaction database at MetroHealth Medical Center, and the pharmacy medication error database. Two reviewers examined all incident reports separately, and discrepancies were resolved by mutual agreement. RESULTS: Patient demographics did not change across the 2 time periods. Obstetric outcomes were the same for third- and fourth-degree lacerations, umbilical arterial pH less than 7, fever, and the need for general anesthesia.

Some cytokines have been shown to have potential in the diagnosis of cancer. METHODS A total of 111 patients with ovarian, cervical, or endometrial carcinomas or benign ovarian or uterine tumors were enrolled on the study, and the levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured by cytokine specific, enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays. In addition, ratios of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ production were studied to characterize the type of T-cell response that occurred in the peritoneal cavities of the patients. RESULTS High levels of M-CSF (mean for all patients, 26,050 pg/mL) and G-CSF (mean for all patients, 20,267 pg/mL) were observed in virtually all patients, but no significant differences between the study groups were observed. Similarly, no differences in the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, or TNF-α were found. However, IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with ovarian carcinoma (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]: 5572 ± 1266) or benign tumors (mean ± SEM: 4474 ± 2008) than in those with cervical (mean ± SEM: 1222 ± 546) or endometrial carcinoma (mean ± SEM: 1977 ± 616). A predominantly Th1 type cytokine profile, irrespective of the diagnosis, was observed in patients with gynecologic tumors. CONCLUSIONS With the exception of IL-6, the cytokine synthesis profiles in the peritoneal fluids of patients with benign and malignant gynecologic tumors were found to be similar. These results suggest that cytokine production in these patients is a result of nonspecific inflammation rather than a specific response against the tumor cells, and that skewing of cytokine synthesis toward either the Th1 or the Th2 phenotype is not the underlying mechanism resulting in the malignant process in women with gynecologic tumors.

We identified randomized controlled trials using intrauterine local anesthetic in gynecologic procedures.Titles and abstracts were screened for 1,236 articles. We identified 45 potential articles for inclusion. We excluded 22 of these studies because: 1) they were not randomized controlled trials; 2) they did not describe a quantifiable dose of medication used in the study; 3) they did not investigate an intrauterine anesthetic; 4) they did not study a potentially awake, outpatient procedure; and 5) they did not clearly report results or represented duplicate publication. Twenty-three articles were ultimately included for review.Two authors independently reviewed full search results and assessed eligibility for inclusion and independently abstracted data from all articles that met criteria for inclusion. Disagreements regarding eligibility or abstraction data were adjudicated by a third independent person. Our primary end point was the reported effect of intrauterine local anesthesia on patient-reported pain scores. As a result of heterogeneity in study methods, outcome measures, and reporting of outcomes, results could not be combined in a meta-analysis. Good evidence supports use of intrauterine anesthesia in endometrial biopsy and curettage, because five good-quality studies reported reduced pain scores, whereas only one good-quality study reported negative results. We found moderate evidence to support intrauterine anesthesia in hysteroscopy, because one good-quality study and two fair or poor quality studies reported reduced pain scores, whereas two good-quality studies had negative results. Good evidence suggests that intrauterine anesthesia is not effective in hysterosalpingography; three good-quality studies reported that pain scores were not reduced, and no good quality studies showed a beneficial effect in that procedure. Evidence was insufficient concerning first-trimester abortion, saline-infusion ultrasonogram, tubal sterilization, and intrauterine device insertion.Intrauterine local anesthesia can reduce pain in several gynecologic procedures including endometrial biopsy, curettage, and hysteroscopy and may be effective in other procedures as well.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e3182639ab5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984770030", "source": "openalex"}

We evaluated the pathological features of reproductive organs removed during exenteration to determine the incidence of malignant pathology in these organs and the need for removal. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent radical cystectomy between January 1994 and December 2000. Of these 382 patients, we identified 68 females who underwent radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma. We reviewed preoperative, operative and pathological findings, including bladder, lymph nodes, uterine and adnexal pathology, in these female patients. Results: Median patient age was 64 years (range 35 to 86). Gynecologic organs were present in 40 of the 68 surgical specimens (59%). The reasons for absent gynecologic pathology were previous hysterectomy in 26 cases and the preservation of organs during orthotopic urinary diversion creation in 2. Malignancy was identified in 3 specimens, including invasive urothelial carcinoma in 2 (5%). In these 2 cases invasion was clearly identified intraoperatively. Low grade stromal sarcoma of the uterus was present in 1 specimen (2%). Conclusions: In the absence of clinical suspicion radical hysterectomy at cystectomy rarely improves cancer control. Furthermore, secondary malignancies are rare. The functional impact of preserving gynecologic organs is a subject of ongoing study.

An evaluation form was developed that contained 16 items under three major headings: clinical competency, interpersonal skills, and overall assessment. These forms were distributed to the 16 residents in our program, and the residents were asked to complete an evaluation form on themselves and their 15 peers. Evaluation forms were also distributed to all 14 clinical faculty members and to six members of the Obstetrics and Gynecology nursing staff. Intraclass correlation coefficients were determined for each rating group, and using the attending ratings as the gold standard, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between groups of raters. The reliability of faculty ratings was good to excellent, whereas resident ratings showed excellent reliability for all three measured variables. Ratings provided by the nurses were the least reliable of the groups rating the residents. Compared with attending ratings, the peer ratings showed significant positive linear relationships in all categories evaluated. There was a low degree of correlation between attending and self-evaluations and attending and nurse evaluations. This small study supports the use of peer evaluations in addition to attending evaluations for Obstetrics and Gynecology residents in training. It also demonstrates that our residents may benefit from doing self-evaluations to improve their ability to honestly appraise their clinical and interpersonal skills.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(02)01658-7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078461091", "source": "openalex"}

Reduced BRCA1 expression is associated with enhanced sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. We sought to examine the prognostic relevance of BRCA1 expression in EOC patients treated with intraperitoneal platinum/taxane.The GOG-172 was a phase III, multi-institutional randomised trial of intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin (IV therapy) vs intravenous paclitaxel, intraperitoneal cisplatin plus paclitaxel (IP therapy) in patients with optimally resected stage III EOC. The BRCA1 expression was assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining blinded to clinical outcome in archival tumour specimens. Slides with 10% staining were defined as aberrant and >10% as normal. Correlations between BRCA1 expression and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.Of the 393 patients, 189 tumours had aberrant expression, and 204 had normal BRCA1 expression. There was an interaction between BRCA1 expression and route of administration on OS (P=0.014) but not PFS (P=0.054). In tumours with normal BRCA1 expression, the median OS was 58 months for IP group vs 50 months for IV group (P=0.818). In tumours with aberrant BRCA1 expression, the median OS was 84 vs 47 months in the IP vs IV group, respectively (P=0.0002). Aberrant BRCA1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for better survival in women randomised to IP therapy (hazard ratio (HR)=0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.47-0.97, P=0.032). Similar survival was observed in the IV and IP patients with normal BRCA1 expression. Multivariate but not univariate modelling demonstrated that IV patients with aberrant vs normal BRCA1 expression had worse survival.Decreased BRCA1 expression is associated with a 36-month survival improvement in patients with EOC treated with IP chemotherapy. Although these results merit validation in future studies, the results suggest that decreased BRCA1 expression predicts for improved response to cisplatin-based IP chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2013.70", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2085076399", "source": "openalex"}

Describe techniques to perform an adequate and gentle genital examination in a school-age girl. 2. Discuss the differential diagnosis for vaginal bleeding in the prepubertal girl. 3. Identify a strategy to diagnose and treat vaginitis in the prepubertal child. Assessing gynecologic symptoms and signs in prepubertal children can be a challenge for pediatricians. Adult pelvic examinations are a standard part of medical school education, and learning objectives for the American Board of Pediatrics emphasize knowledge of adolescent gynecology. Pediatric practice standards recommend routine external examinations for girls of all ages at health supervision examinations. Unfortunately, pediatricians often lack training in examination techniques, determination of normal findings, and gynecologic pathology of infants and prepubertal children. In the past decade, a high level of concern for child sexual abuse and emphasis on the sentinel role of pediatricians in recognizing abnormalities due to child abuse paradoxically has left pediatricians and other child health clinicians more anxious and uncomfortable in performing these examinations. However, although child sexual abuse is common, it rarely is diagnosed primarily by physical complaints. It is much more likely that a girl who is brought to the physician because of genital symptoms has either normal variant findings or a nontraumatic disorder. (1) The aim of this article is to review normal anatomy and physiology in infants and prepubertal children, emphasizing developmental changes, normal variants, and the differential diagnosis for common signs and symptoms. ### Infant and Toddler The newborn girl is affected by maternal estrogens that cross the placenta. Breast buds are usual, and a milky discharge from the nipples is not uncommon. Like her mother, the neonate may develop mastitis. Vaginal discharge is common in newborns, as are long hymenal tags that frequently are visible, extending outside the vestibule. The vaginal epithelium also demonstrates the estrogen …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/pir.27-6-213", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133127278", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to determine the ovarian volume by transvaginal ultrasonography in a gynecologically healthy population of women using no contraception, using intrauterine contraceptive device, or using oral contraceptive. Materials and method . The study had a cross‐sectional design. The ovaries of 428 women aged 14 45 who contacted the family planning clinic in the county of Funen were examined. Most of the statistical analyses were carried out using standard techniques. However polynomial regression analysis was used to model ovarian volumes as a function of the day of cycle. Results . No differences between the volumes of the right and the left ovary were found in any of the groups. Significant differences were found between the ovarian volumes of the three groups. The ovarian volumes were found to be largest in women using intrauterine contraceptive device, lesser in women using no contraception and smallest in women using oral contraception. A significant difference was found of the ovarian volumes throughout the menstrual cycle in women who were not using oral contraception. The ovarian volumes did not change throughout the menstrual cycle in women using oral contraception. In women not using oral contraception the largest ovary increased in volume from the start of the cycle to day 19, thereafter the volume declined. No evidence of any change of volume over the menstrual cycle was found in the smallest ovary and, for women using oral contraception, both ovaries. There was no correlation between age, height, weight, parity, and ovarian volume in any of the groups. Conclusion . The ovarian volumes, in gynecologically healthy women using intrauterine contraceptive device, are larger than in women using no contraception.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using the MarketScan database was performed. MarketScan is a claims-based data source that captures claims from more than 50 million privately insured patients and 6 million Medicaid enrollees from 12 states. We identified women who underwent major and minor gynecologic surgery from 2009 to 2016. Among women who received an opioid prescription, new persistent opioid use was defined as receipt of one or more opioid prescriptions from 90 to 180 days after surgery with no intervening additional procedures or anesthesia. Multivariable models were used to examine associations between clinical characteristics and any use and new persistent use of opioids. RESULTS: A total of 729,625 patients were identified. Overall, 60.0% of patients received a perioperative opioid prescription. Receipt of an opioid prescription ranged from 36.7% in those who underwent dilation and curettage to 79.5% of patients who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy. Among patients who received a perioperative opioid prescription, the rate of new persistent opioid use overall was 6.8%. The rate of new persistent opioid use was 4.8% for myomectomy, 6.6% for minimally invasive hysterectomy, 6.7% for abdominal hysterectomy, 6.3% for endometrial ablation, 7.0% for tubal ligation, and 7.2% for dilation and curettage ( P &lt;.001). In a multivariable model, patients who underwent dilation and curettage and endometrial ablation were at highest risk for new persistent opioid use.

Numerous literatures have demonstrated the feasibility of robotic surgery in gynecologic oncology. However, further research should be performed to demonstrate the superiority of robotic surgery compared to conventional laparoscopy. Additionally, cost reduction of robotic surgery is needed to adopt robotic surgery into gynecologic oncology worldwide. SPLS has several possible benefits including reduced operative complications, reduced postoperative pain, and better cosmetic results compared to conventional laparoscopy. Although several authors have indicated that SPLS is a feasible approach for gynecologic surgery, there have been few reports demonstrating the potential advantages over conventional laparoscopy. Moreover, technical difficulties of SPLS still exist. Therefore, the advantages of a single port approach compared to conventional laparoscope should be evaluated with comparative study, and further technologic development for SPLS is also needed.

METHODS: A total of 177 consecutive female patients, with or without pain, consulting in a gynecologic emergency unit, underwent initial pain evaluation. We used three self-report pain intensity scales: visual analog scale, numeric rating scale, and verbal rating scale, and two nonverbal structured behavioral indices (BI-1, first behavioral index, BI-2 second behavioral index). Diagnosis and treatment took place in routine manner. RESULTS: The five scales were unidimensional according to principal component analysis (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient=0.89). Missing data rates were greater for the two behavioral scales than for the self-report scales (n=177; 6.2% for BI-1 and 12.4% for BI-2). Patients had lower scores with the behavioral scales than with the self-report ones. Variations of pain intensity according to the pain physiology or the pain location were similar whatever the method of measurement used. The five methods were all sensitive to the physiology of the pain, the location and the severity of the illness, and pain as a main complaint. None of the methods used was affected by age, occupational categories, parity, or geographical origins. CONCLUSION: All methods adequately measured the pelvic pain intensity in gynecologic emergencies. The self-report scales were easier to use than the behavioral indices. Self-report measurements of pelvic pain intensity provide useful information at the time of triage in gynecologic emergency departments.

Medical screening was rated as most important in preventing recurrence, followed by positive attitude and prayer. Stronger causal attributions were generally associated with elevated depressive symptomatology and anxiety, but women citing potentially controllable causes were more likely to be practicing healthy behaviors. Similarly, women citing health behaviors as important in preventing recurrence reported greater anxiety but were more likely to practice positive health behaviors. Health behavior and lifestyle attributions interacted with health practices in predicting distress. For example, among women who had not made positive dietary changes, rating lifestyle as important in preventing recurrence was associated with greater distress, whereas among women who had made a positive change in diet, this belief was associated with less distress.Results suggest that stronger attributions are associated with greater distress, but engaging in behavior believed to be important in preventing cancer or recurrence may ameliorate this distress.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.psy.0000188402.95398.c0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066322074", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods The medical records of 360 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent surgical staging were collected from four institutions and were retrospectively reviewed. By using serum CA-125 levels, preoperative biopsy data, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, a multivariate logistic model was created. Patients whose predicted probability was less than 4% were defined as low risk. The developed model was externally validated in 180 patients from two independent institutions. Results Serum CA-125 levels and three MRI parameters (deep myometrial invasion, lymph node enlargement, and extension beyond uterine corpus) were found to be independent risk factors for nodal metastasis. The model classified 53% of patients as part of a low-risk group, and the false negative rate was 1.7%. In the validation cohort, the model classified 43% of patients as low-risk, and the false negative rate was 1.4%. The model showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve = 0.85) and was calibrated well. The negative likelihood ratio of our low-risk criteria was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.29), which was equivalent to the false-negative rate of 1.3% (95% CI, 0.5% to 3.3%) at the assumed prevalence of nodal metastasis of 10%.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs have been used in the therapy of the endocrine-dependent cancers. The authors attempted to determine the frequency with which Gn-RH receptor (Gn-RHR) is present in gynecological cancers. Methods. Experiments were performed on gynecologic tumors that had been surgically removed and their cloned cell lines. Gn-RHR was characterized by [3H]Gn-RH binding to plasma membrane preparations. Gn-RHR messenger ribonucleic acid was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers synthesized according to the published human Gn-RHR sequence. Results. High affinity binding sites with nanomolar range of Kd and Gn-RHR mRNA were detected in a high proportion (over 90%) of the specimens from endometrium (6 of 6) and endometrial carcinomas (16 of 17), myometrium (6 of 6) and myomas (4 of 5), epithelial carcinoma (21 of 23), and stromal tumors (3 of 3) of the ovary. There was no substantial Gn-RHR in cervical carcinomas or germ cell-derived tumors of the ovary. Cloned cell lines gave identical results to those obtained in their respective mother tumors. Conclusions. We detected Gn-RHR in a wide range of the carcinomas and tissues originating from the endometrium and ovary, but not in the uterine cervix or germ cell-derived tumors. The expression of Gn-RH receptor raises the possibility that Gn-RH may play a direct regulatory role in the growth of these carcinomas, and provides a possible point of attack for therapeutic approaches using Gn-RH analogs in these malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19941101)74:9<2555::aid-cncr2820740925>3.0.co;2-x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2002181841", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty-five cases (1.2%) were identified with ureteral injury in a total of 2,927 gynecologic surgeries. Risk factors included endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, previous pelvic surgery, history of pelvic radiation, and congenital anomalies. Among 2,927 patients, 522 had predisposing factors for ureteral injuries.The incidence of ureteral injury in laparoscopic cases was 1.1%, similar to the cases of laparotomy (1.2%). The rate of ureteral injury was significantly higher in the group with risk factors (2.7%) than in the group without risk factors (0.9%; p=0.002). Prophylactic ureteral stenting was performed in 101 of 522 patients with risk factors according to the gynecologic surgeon's preference. The injury rate (1.0%) in the stenting group was lower than that in the non-stenting group (3.1%; p=0.324). Management of ureteral injuries was successful in all cases. Of the patients with postoperatively diagnosed injuries, two patients were managed with secondary procedures, such as retrograde balloon dilatation or ureteroneocystostomy.The incidence of ureteral injury was significantly higher in cases having risk factors than in cases without risk factors.

One-hundred fifty-eight women received either ondansetron (4 mg) or droperidol (20 micro g/kg) intravenously during induction of anesthesia. Nausea was measured at three intervals: at admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 1 h after admission to the PACU, and on Postoperative Day 1. The incidence of vomiting was tabulated in the PACU and on Postoperative Day 1. Sedation was assessed 1 h after admission to the PACU. No differences in nausea, sedation, or number of patients vomiting in the PACU were found. More patients in the ondansetron group reported vomiting on Postoperative Day 1 than subjects in the droperidol group (25 vs 11). No difference in opiate use was found among patients who vomited. We conclude that droperidol is equivalent to ondansetron for the prophylactic treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy, and that significant cost savings can be appreciated if droperidol is used. Implications: Either ondansetron or droperidol, frequently used antiemetics, was given to women before they underwent gynecologic laparoscopy. No difference in the number of women experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting or their level of sedation was found. Equivalent effectiveness and significant cost-savings may be obtained by using droperidol prophylactically for laparoscopic surgery.

METHODS: One hundred forty-six surgical inpatients were randomized to specific ambulation goals or routine care. We assessed the number of pedometer-recorded steps in the 24 hours preceding discharge as well as patient-identified barriers to ambulation. Groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Of the 129 participants with outcome data, 12% were discharged without any pedometer-recorded steps. We did not detect an effect of specific ambulation goals by group (routine care: 87 compared with ambulation goals: 80, P=.7). The three main barriers to ambulation from a patient perspective were indwelling catheters (38.5%), intravenous poles (28%), and pain (12.5%) The median number of postoperative steps was higher after minimally invasive surgery (143) compared with laparotomy (27) (P=.035).

The present review of the literature shows that robot-assisted surgery is consistently more expensive than video-laparoscopy and in many cases open surgery. The average additional variable cost for gynecological procedures was about 1600 USD, rising to more than 3000 USD when the amortized cost of the robot itself was included. Generally most robotic and laparoscopic procedures have less short-term morbidity, blood loss, intensive care unit, and hospital stay than open surgery. Up to now no major consistent differences have been found between robot-assisted and classic video-assisted procedures for these factors. No comparative data are available on long-term morbidity and oncologic outcome after open, robotic, and laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. It seems that currently only for very complex surgical procedures, such as cardiac surgery, the costs of robotics can be competitive to open surgical procedures.

One such endocrine disrupter, diethylstilbestrol (DES), is linked to gynecological cancers and changes in uterine structure that reduce or completely abrogate reproductive competence. Until recently, little was known about the identity of target genes and signaling pathways involved in pathologies linked to endocrine disrupters such as DES. We outline genetic, cellular and molecular roles for patterning genes, with emphasis on homeobox and Wnt genes. There is evidence that changes in the expression of Wnt and homeogenes underlie many of the defects induced by DES. Data obtained from murine systems will likely apply to a broad spectrum of gynecological pathologies involving abnormal cell behaviors ranging from fibroids to malignant tumors.

A custom radiochromic film dosimetry apparatus was 3D‐printed in PC‐ISO with a single catheter channel and a slit to hold a film segment. The apparatus was designed specifically to test geometry pertinent for use of this material in a clinical setting. A brachytherapy dose plan was computed to deliver a cylindrical dose distribution to the film. The dose plan used an source and was normalized to 1500 cGy at 1 cm from the channel. The material was evaluated by comparing the film exposure to an identical test done in water. The Hounsfield unit (HU) distributions were computed from a CT scan of the apparatus and compared to the HU distribution of water and the HU distribution of a commercial GYN cylinder applicator. The dose depth curve of PC‐ISO as measured by the radiochromic film was within 1% of water between 1 cm and 6 cm from the channel. The mean HU was for PC‐ISO and for water. As expected, the honeycombed structure of the PC‐ISO 3D printing process created a moderate spread of HU values, but the mean was comparable to water. PC‐ISO is sufficiently water‐equivalent to be compatible with our HDR brachytherapy planning system and clinical workflow and, therefore, it is suitable for creating custom GYN brachytherapy applicators.

METHODS: On January 1, 2006, we initiated a universal protocol of dual prophylaxis with sequential compression devices and three times daily heparin (or daily low molecular weight heparin) until discharge in gynecologic cancer patients having major surgery. Patients with both malignancy and age over 60 years (or history of prior clot) were discharged on 2 weeks of anticoagulant. Before January 2006, all patients were given sequential compression devices starting before the induction of anesthesia, continuing until discharge from the hospital. Records of gynecologic cancer service patients admitted in 2005 and 2006 were reviewed, excluding patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or those admitted on an anticoagulant. Any pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis diagnosed within 6 weeks of surgery was identified.

The response rate was 77% ( n = 3,641). The overall prevalence of any lifetime experience of AHC was 13–28%. High educational level, physical complaints, post‐traumatic stress symptoms, and sleeping problems were associated with AAHC in women without EPSA (new victims). Poor self‐rated health was strongly associated with AAHC in the 3 groups of women with EPSA. Conclusion . AHC is commonly reported by gynecological patients in the Nordic countries, but not yet properly explored or understood. The most important factors associated with AAHC were high educational level and poor self‐rated health.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00016340601185368", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115098121", "source": "openalex"}

Stratford Rd., Ste. 303, Winston-Salem, NC 27104. n my personal library, I have all four editions of Peter W. Callen’s Ultrasonography in Obstetrics and Gynecology , a textbook that I consider to be the standard reference textbook in the field. Looking back on the first edition, which was published about the time I was getting ready to take the radiology boards, I remember that I considered this textbook to be the bible for obstetric sonography. Although in retrospect I still believe this to be true, the first edition appears relatively diminutive—a veritable 98-ounce weakling— when compared with the later editions. Throughout the subsequent editions, the textbook has continued to bulk up with new information, enhanced images, and color photographs and illustrations; moreover, like a professional baseball player on anabolic steroids, the newly published fourth edition continues to hit home runs. The new edition is an impressive tome, containing 1078 pages (in comparison, the first edition was only 346 pages), a voluminous index, innumerable state-of-the-art sonograms, correlative ultrasound studies, specimen photographs, and multiple tables and diagrams. The increase in size from edition to edition is not mere fluff but an impressive addition of new material and information gleaned from the medical literature since the previous publication. Compared with the third edition published 6 years ago, the current edition contains two additional chapters and new or expanded sections covering topics such as sonography of infertility, surgical therapy for fetal anomalies, ultrasound evaluation of syndromes, and three-dimensional ultrasound, to name only a few. In addition, as in previous editions, Dr. Callen has enlisted the aid of leading authorities in the field to update and expand the information contained in the textbook. As a result, each chapter is replete with a wealth of new information and extensive current references pertaining to obstetric and gynecologic sonography. Familiar and user-friendly appendixes covering a wide array of fetal and gynecologic sonographic measurements are still found at the back of the book, a section that always seems to get a lot of use by my residents when they go over the cases before review with the attending radiologist. A useful appendix on sonographic detection of chromosomal abnormalities has been added to the fourth edition since the publication of the third. Like the previous editions, the fourth edition is well organized and the subject matter is easily found using either the table of contents or the index. The textbook can be used to provide a quick reference at the viewbox, or, alternatively, individual chapters can be read in their entirety to provide more detailed knowledge of a particular subject. The multiple tables, diagrams, and illustrations serve to enhance the text and illuminate the many teaching points. In summary, the fourth edition of Callen’s Ultrasonography in Obstetrics and Gynecology is a valuable addition to your ultrasound library even if you have access to the earlier editions. The increase in new information is substantial, and the extra shelf space necessary for the bulked up new edition is certainly worth it. Randall M.

Approach: seventy six patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status I, II and III scheduled for vaginal hysterectomy, vaginal wall repair and tension free vaginal tape were prospectively studied. Patients were randomly allocated to receive intrathecally either 10 mg isobaric bupivacaine plus 5 µg dexmetedomidine (group D n = 38) or 10 mg isobaric bupivacaine plus 25 mg fentanyl (group F n = 38), the onset time to reach peak sensory and motor level, the regression time for sensory and motor block, hemodynamic changes, and side effects were recorded. Results: Patients in group D had significant longer sensory and motor block times than patients in group F. the mean time of sensory regression to S1 was 274±73 min in group D and 179±47 min in group F (P < 0.001). The regression time of motor block to reach modified Bromage 0 was 240±60 min in group D and 155±46 min in group F (P< 0.001). The onset times to reach T10 dermatome and to reach peak sensory level as well as onset time to reach modified Bromage 3 motor block were not significantly different between the two groups.

Current estimates of the proportion of cancer patients who should optimally receive radiotherapy are based either on expert opinion or on the measurement of actual usage rates rather than on the best available scientific evidence.With the goal of developing an evidence-based benchmark for radiotherapy use in the treatment of malignancies of the cervix, vagina, vulva, and ovary (endometrial malignancies are covered in a separate article), the authors reviewed international evidence-based treatment guidelines. Optimal radiotherapy usage trees were constructed, and proportions of patients with clinical indications for radiotherapy were obtained from epidemiologic data. These ideal usage rates were compared with actual radiotherapy utilization rates recorded in Australia and elsewhere.According to the best available evidence, radiotherapy is indicated at least once for 58% of patients with cervical carcinoma, 4% of patients with ovarian carcinoma, 100% of patients with vaginal carcinoma, and 34% of patients with vulvar carcinoma. A review of the limited data available suggests that actual radiotherapy usage rates for patients with gynecologic malignancies are comparable to optimal usage rates.Actual practice appears to approximate the authors' model of optimal radiotherapy use. This finding reflects the high level of agreement among treatment guidelines as well as the existence of high-quality evidence related to the management of gynecologic malignancies, and it may also be indicative of the fact that a large proportion of patients are treated in specialist units. The management of gynecologic malignancies may serve as a good example in the development of management strategies for other types of cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.20444", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3135391045", "source": "openalex"}

Communication between all parties involved in gynecology and obstetrics (clinical staff/professionals, expectant mothers/patients and their partners, close relatives or friends providing social support) should be improved to ensure patient safety, including the avoidance of preventable adverse events (pAEs). Therefore, interventions including an app will be developed in this project through a participatory approach integrating two theoretical models. The interventions will be designed to support participants in their communication with each other and to overcome difficulties in everyday hospital life. The aim is to foster effective communication in order to reduce the frequency of pAEs. If communication is improved, clinical staff should show an increase in work satisfaction and patients should show an increase in patient satisfaction. Methods The study will take place in two maternity clinics in Germany. In line with previous studies of complex interventions, it is divided into three interdependent phases. Each phase provides its own methods and data. Phase 1: Needs assessment and a training for staff ( n = 140) tested in a pre-experimental study with a pre/post-design. Phase 2: Assessment of communication training for patients and their social support providers ( n = 423) in a randomized controlled study. Phase 3: Assessment of an app supporting the communication between staff, patients, and their social support providers ( n = 423) in a case-control study. The primary outcome is improvement of communication competencies. A range of other implementation outcomes will also be assessed (i.e. pAEs, patient/treatment satisfaction, work satisfaction, safety culture, training-related outcomes). Discussion This is the first large intervention study on communication and patient safety in gynecology and obstetrics integrating two theoretical models that have not been applied to this setting. It is expected that the interventions, including the app, will improve communication practice which is linked to a lower probability of pAEs. The app will offer an effective and inexpensive way to promote effective communication independent of users’ motivation. Insights gained from this study can inform other patient safety interventions and health policy developments.

METHODS: One hundred thirty-six ultrasound program directors from 254 accredited obstetrics and gynecology residency programs completed a web-based survey regarding obstetric ultrasound training for residents. Questions were presented in yes-or-no, ranking, short-answer, and open-comment formats that examined general teaching environment and curriculum content. These results were compared with a mandatory fetal ultrasound training survey that was independently administered to 4,666 obstetrics and gynecology residents during the 2003 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) In-Training Examination. Friedman one-way analysis of variance was used to compare ranked nonparametric data with the Dunn posttest. Statistical significance was taken at the P < .05 level. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of accredited obstetrics and gynecology residencies responded to the survey of ultrasound directors from November 2000 to April 2003. Nearly all responding directors were obstetrician-gynecologists, many of whom had subspecialty training in maternal-fetal medicine. Full-time faculty and sonographers were the most important individuals contributing to ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residents. Hands-on scanning and observation were the most significant educational activities for ultrasound training. Ultrasound program directors generally rated the overall preparedness of residents as ranging from adequate to excellent. The most important learning obstacles were limited curriculum and faculty time. Most programs evaluated competency by direct observation of scanning skills. According to the CREOG survey, only 16.3% of residents indicated that the performance and interpretation of fetal ultrasound examinations were mandatory program requirements. Nearly two thirds of residents believed that their training would be adequate by the time of graduation. Only 18.4% of residents, however, were planning to perform or interpret fetal ultrasound scans in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Fetal ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residents is perceived by most ultrasound program directors and residents to be adequate. Future development of standardized guidelines and competency assessment tools should consider that approximately one fifth of obstetrics and gynecology residents are currently planning to use this diagnostic modality in clinical practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2 Fetal ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residencies is perceived as being adequate, although limited curriculum and faculty time are potential obstacles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000109522.51314.5c", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2069394172", "source": "openalex"}

During the past decade, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) flourished in the field of general surgery, and it has emerged as a new concept of minimally invasive surgery. NOTES yields access to the abdominal cavity without any incisions on the abdominal wall (scarless surgery), and the natural orifices of the body surface, such as the mouth and the vagina, serve as the gateway to the peritoneal cavity. In gynecology, the vagina of a woman can be considered as an additional route for surgery. Recently, clinical application of transvaginal NOTES has broadened significantly in gynecology. Using transvaginal NOTES by applying the method of single-incision laparoscopic surgery via the vaginal route, not only adnexal surgery and hysterectomy, but also myomectomy and oncologic surgery could be performed safely and effectively in selected patients.

However, in the 1920s, Otto Warburg reported the so‐called “Warburg effect” in which cancer cells produce ATP that is biased toward glycolysis rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation not only in anaerobic environment but also in aerobic environment. Glucose is converted into lactate without going into mitochondria after being metabolized in glycolysis. Compared with oxidative phosphorylation, the glycolysis has a faster ATP production rate but it is very inefficient, resulting in cancer cells consuming a large amount of glucose. Increased glucose metabolism has become a biomarker for cancer cells and has led to the development of positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose. Till date, the Warburg effect has been an inefficient system for cancer cells with regard to efficient energy production, but since the consumption of oxygen can be suppressed as the tumor grows in mass, it is thought that the Warburg effect is advantageous in this situation wherein the tumor can increase despite the lack of vessels. In addition, an increased lactate by the glycolysis causes acidosis in the microenvironment of tissues, which is thought to damage the surrounding normal tissues and favor the invasion and metastasis of cancer. Thus, Warburg effect is one of the key mechanisms for cancer development and will be the next promising target. In this review, we introduce key players that can be targeted in the Warburg effect and outline the prospects of treatment, targeting the Warburg effect in gynecological cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.13867", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2902741527", "source": "openalex"}

The objectives were to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AZD5363, define a recommended dosing schedule, and evaluate preliminary clinical activity. Experimental Design: Patients were aged ≥18 years with World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 to 1. Dose escalation was conducted within separate continuous and intermittent [4 days/week (4/7) or 2 days/week (2/7)] schedules with safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analyses. Expansion cohorts of approximately 20 patients each explored AZD5363 activity in PIK3CA-mutant breast and gynecologic cancers.

These responses were less than the prespecified 20% response rate; therefore, the criteria to stop further recruitment to the PIK3CA-mutant cohort were met. Conclusions: At the recommended phase II dose, AZD5363 was well tolerated and achieved plasma levels and robust target modulation in tumors. Proof-of-concept responses were observed in patients with PIK3CA-mutant cancers treated with AZD5363. Clin Cancer Res; 24(9); 2050–9. ©2017 AACR.

Four years later, we now describe the results of this trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS After a median follow-up of 4 years and 9 months, 115 of 159 cases of advanced ovarian cancer, originally randomized to receive six cycles of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 and either a high dose (HD) of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin or a low dose (LD) of 50 mg/m2 (LD) cisplatin, have now died. RESULTS The overall survival for HD and LD patients is 32.4% and 26.6%, respectively, and the overall relative death rate is 0.68 (P = .043). This represents a reduction in overall benefit with longer follow-up compared with the first 2 years (relative death rate of 0.52). Toxicity, particularly neurotoxicity, is still evident in the fourth year (10/31 on HD compared with 1/24 on LD). CONCLUSION Our recommended dose of cisplatin in combination schedule is therefore 75 mg/m2, representing the optimal balance between efficacy and toxicity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1996.14.7.2113", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2261061437", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Fifteen women participated in a one-on-one, semistructured interview. Data collection and analysis were based on guidelines of interpretive description. Results: Definitions of healthy sexuality included emotional intimacy, body image, sexual self-schema, and sexual response. Unmet sexual needs were reported when women’s current sexual experiences did not correspond with their subjective perceptions of healthy sexuality. Most women desired informational services, delivered one-on-one or through written material. Younger women often did not utilize services due to practical barriers and emotional avoidance, while older women reported that shyness and stigma discouraged them from discussing sexuality with their health care team.

This study prospectively evaluates the combination of bleomycin to this regimen in women with histologically proven advanced recurrent or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible women were randomized to receive either cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide (5 g/m 2 over 24 hours), and mesna (6 g/m 2 during ifosfamide infusion and the following 12 hours) (CI) versus bleomycin 30 units over 24 hours on day 1 followed by cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide (5 g/m 2 over 24 hours), and mesna (6 g/m 2 during ifosfamide infusion and the following 12 hours) (CIB). Three hundred three women were enrolled onto this trial, of which 287 were assessable. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between CI and CIB with regard to response rates (32% v 31.2%, respectively), progression-free survival (PFS), or overall survival. PFS and survival were associated with initial performance status (PS). Patients with a PS of 0 experienced a lower rate of failure (P = .013) and a lower risk of death (P = .009) compared with patients with PS of 2. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea and vomiting. Neither regimen was associated with a significant increase in incidence of these toxicities. CONCLUSION: The CI regimen was virtually identical to CIB with regard to response rate, PFS, survival, and toxicity profile.

Several studies demonstrated that tumor cell dissemination may occur in gynecologic cancer and affect clinical outcome. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of DTC and to assess their prognostic significance in patients with gynecologic malignancies. <h3>Methods:</h3> Bone marrow aspirates from 377 patients with primary ovarian (112), endometrial (141), cervical (102), and vulvar cancer (22) undergoing surgery at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany between November 2001 and November 2007, were included into the study. Disseminated tumor cells were identified by immunocytochemistry using the pancytokeratin antibody A45B/B3 and by cytomorphology. <h3>Results:</h3> Disseminated tumor cells were detected in 19% of BM aspirates from patients with gynecological malignancies. Incidences of DTC in ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer were 25%, 16%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. For patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer, no correlation with established clinicopathological factors was observed. In case of cervical cancer, BM positivity was correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, tumor size, and nodal involvement. Bone marrow positivity of ovarian cancer patients was correlated with significantly shorter disease-free survival (<i>P</i> = 0.035). For other tumor entities, no association between BM status and clinical outcome could be observed. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> We conclude that up to 25% of patients with loco-regionally restricted gynecologic malignancies present with DTC at the time of diagnosis.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether 3-dimensional (3D) sonography can provide a rapid, efficient, and accurate way to do a transvaginal gynecologic scan compared with traditional 2-dimensional (2D) sonography. Methods. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent gynecologic sonography formed the study cohort. After a standard 2D transvaginal scan was done, including measurements of the endometrium and abnormalities, 4 volume acquisitions were obtained, encompassing the uterus (2 volumes) and the ovaries. These volumes were reviewed offline without any patient information. Endometrium and other measurements were performed on the volumes. The 2D and 3D results were compared by paired t tests. Results. The mean time needed for the standard 2D scan was 2.6 minutes compared with 1.07 minutes for the 3D volume acquisitions. The mean time for the reconstruction, measurement, and interpretation of the volumes offline was 1.19 minutes. The mean time for the entire 3D examination (both parts) was 2.26 minutes (P = .047, comparing 2D with total 3D). There was no significant difference between the measurements of the endometrium, fibroids, and ovarian cysts when comparing 2D and reconstructed 3D images. Two-dimensional and 3D sonography differed little in their ability to identify the organs and the abnormalities on the scans. Conclusions. This study shows that a complete transvaginal gynecologic examination can be done in 1.07 minutes of scan time and interpreted offline in an additional 1.19 minutes.

Recently, two novel minimally invasive, non-ablative Er:YAG laser techniques have been introduced, a vaginal tightening therapy IntimaLaseTM and a stress urinary incontinence therapy IncontiLase TM , which show the potential to become an optimal solution for many women suffering from these problems. Both treatment techniques exploit the photothermal effect of a laser beam on mucosa tissue in order to cause its shrinkage without any removal of tissue. The overall impact and burden on the patient's organism is thus minimal, as opposed to more invasive classical or laser surgical procedures. In this paper, a special Er:YAG Pixel Screen technology used in these novel gynecological treatments, and its ablative characteristics, are first analyzed with the aim to establish a range of laser parameters for safe, single-pulse or SMOOTH mode, non-ablative treatment of mucosa tissue. The initial results of multi-center clinical studies of the IntimaLase TM and IncontiLase TM treatments are then presented. All five centers involved in the studies of the IntimaLaseTM treatment reported positive results, i.e an improvement in vaginal tightness for a large majority of treated patients, with practically no adverse effects. Similarly, all four studies of the IncontiLase TM treatment showed improvement in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) for a large majority of treated patients. Many patients with mild SUI reported to become free of the symptoms of incontinence following the treatment. There were no adverse effects of this treatment reported in any of the studies. Based on these initial clinical results, the new IntimaLaseTM and IncontiLaseTM gynecological treatments are promising to become a minimally invasive solution of choice for many women suffering from vaginal relaxation syndrome or stress urinary incontinence.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2335920552", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Sixty‐eight women with a histological diagnosis of fibroma or fibrothecoma of the ovary who had undergone a preoperative ultrasound examination between 1999 and 2007 were identified from the databases of four ultrasound centers. The tumors were characterized on the basis of ultrasound images, ultrasound reports and research protocols (when applicable) using the terms and definitions of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group. In 51 patients, ultrasound information had been collected prospectively; in the remaining 17 cases it was retrieved retrospectively from ultrasound reports and images. In 44 cases, electronic ultrasound images of good quality were available. These were reviewed by two observers, who described them using pattern recognition. Results Of the 68 patients identified, 53 had fibroma and 15 had fibrothecoma. The mean patient age was 54 (range, 17–80) years. Sixty‐three percent (41/65) were postmenopausal and 60% (39/65) had no symptoms. Most (75%; 51/68) fibromas/fibrothecomas were solid tumors and most (75%; 51/68) manifested minimal or moderate blood flow on color Doppler examination. Using pattern recognition, all solid fibromas/fibrothecomas were described as round, oval or slightly lobulated tumors. Most (66%; 29/44) were solid tumors, with regular or slightly irregular internal echogenicity with stripy shadows, and some contained cystic spaces. Others (23%, 10/44) were solid tumors with regular or slightly irregular internal echogenicity without stripy shadows and with or without cystic spaces. Two were solid tumors that were so dense it was difficult to assess their internal echogenicity, two were multilocular solid tumors with large cystic spaces and one was described as being mainly cystic. Half of the women with fibroma/fibrothecoma had fluid in the pouch of Douglas and 16% (11/68) had ascites; CA 125 titers ≥35 U/mL were found in 34% (17/50) of the cases in which CA 125 results were available. Conclusions Most fibromas and fibrothecomas are round, oval or lobulated solid tumors that cast stripy shadows and are associated with fluid in the pouch of Douglas, and most manifest minimal to moderate vascularization. A fibroma/fibrothecoma with atypical ultrasound appearance may be mistaken for a malignancy, in particular if associated with fluid in the pouch of Douglas or ascites, high color content and raised CA 125 levels.

Recent proteomics-based analyses show great promise for the discovery of new and more useful biomarkers. In this review, we will discuss the currently utilized serum tumor markers for gynecologic cancers and the novel biomarkers that are now under investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers2021312", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1967092668", "source": "openalex"}

Eighteen of 24 (75%) patients with ovarian cancer who received a primary reanastomosis did not have a protecting colostomy, whereas all 11 patients who underwent exenteration had a protecting colostomy. There were no anastomotic leaks in any of these patients, although morbidity occurred in seven of 35 patients (20%). There were no operative mortalities.

For breast cancer, women with obesity exhibit more than a twofold increase in the odds of being diagnosed with cancer, with a greater risk of advanced stage at diagnosis, and ≤40% greater risk of recurrence and death than their normal-weight counterparts. These findings are similar in gynecologic cancers, where women who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 have up to six times greater risk of developing endometrial cancer and a 9.2% increase in mortality with every 10% increase in BMI. Likewise, patients with obesity exhibit a twofold higher risk of premenopausal ovarian cancer, and patients who are obese with advanced stage ovarian cancer have shown a shorter time to recurrence and poorer overall survival. Obesity is accompanied by changes in expression of adipose factors that act on local tissues and systemically. Once obesity was recognized as a factor in cancer incidence and progression, the adipose cytokine (adipokine) leptin became the focus of intense investigation as a putative link, with nearly 3000 publications on the topic. Leptin has been shown to increase cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, promote angiogenesis, and increase therapeutic resistance. These characteristics are associated with a subset of cells in both liquid and solid tumors known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), or tumor initiating cells. We will review the literature discussing leptin’s role in breast and gynecologic cancer, focusing on its role in CSCs, and consider goals for targeting future therapy in this arena to disrupt tumor initiation and progression in women’s cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2018-00379", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2810136617", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, I review the current issues (a review of the relevant literature), and the effects of the dietary and nutrient intake on three types of gynecologic cancer (cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers). In cervical cancer, the most important roles of diet/nutrition in relation to cancer are prophylaxis and countermeasures against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The main preventive and reductive factors of cervical cancer are antioxidants, such as vitamin A, C, D and E, carotenoids, vegetables and fruits. These antioxidants may have different abilities to intervene in the natural history of diseases associated with HPV infection. For endometrial cancer, the increase in peripheral estrogens as a result of the aromatization of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue in obese women and insulin resistance are risk factors. Thus, we must mainly take care to avoid the continuous intake of fat energy and sugar. In ovarian cancer, the etiology has not been fully understood. To the best of our knowledge, the long-term consumption of pro-inflammatory foods, including saturated fat, carbohydrates and animal proteins is a risk factor. The intake of acrylamide is also a risk factor for both endometrial and ovarian cancer. Most papers have been epidemiological studies. Thus, further research using in vitro and in vivo approaches is needed to clarify the effects of the dietary and nutrient intake in detail.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare7030088", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2955165061", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: After routine histologic assessment within the hospital pathology department, 119 colposcopic cervical biopsies were interpreted by two subspecialty-trained gynecologic pathologists (GYN I and GYN II) blinded to each other’s interpretations and to the interpretations of the hospital general pathologists (GEN). Biopsies were classified as normal (including cervicitis), low grade (LG, including CIN I and human papillomavirus changes), and high grade (HG, including CIN II/III). The interobserver agreement rates between GEN and GYN I, between GEN and GYN II, and between GYN I and GYN II were described using the κ statistic. The proportions of biopsies assigned to each biopsy class were compared using McNemar test. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement rates between GEN and GYN I were moderate for normal (κ = 0.53) and LG (κ = 0.46) and excellent for HG (κ = 0.76).

Methods All patients undergoing PE at our institution from 1983 to 2002 were screened. In 203 cases data were obtainable and analyzed with respect to factors predicting outcome considering morbidity, mortality, and survival. Follow‐up data and data concerning late complications not documented in our records were obtained by telephone interviews. Results Mean age was 55 (22–77) years. PE was performed for locally advanced (36%) or recurrent (64%) cervical (n = 133), endometrial (n = 26), vaginal (n = 23), vulvar (n = 10), and ovarian cancer (n = 11, cases with rectum and/or bladder resections). In 13.4% (n = 26) the intent of the procedure was palliation in the remaining cure. Procedures performed were anterior (n = 91), posterior (45), or total (n = 67) PE. 53% of patients underwent preoperative radio‐chemotherapy, 11.8% as a neoadjuvant treatment. Mean OR time was 8.1 hr, an average of 5.6 units of packed red blood cells were perioperatively transfused. Microscopically complete resection was achievable in n = 69 patients. Perioperative mortality was 1% (n = 2). Seventy‐one percent (n = 144) of patients were available for follow‐up. Five‐year overall survival in patients treated with a curative intent was 21%, 5‐year survival in those patients with complete resection was 32%. Forty‐two percent of patients with a complete resection without lymph node involvement, age 30–50, curative intention, and the absence of a pelvic sidewall infiltration survived 5 years or longer. Conclusion In our series a 5‐year survival rate of over 40% could be achieved for nodal‐negative patients without pelvic sidewall infiltration when treated with curative intent and after complete resection.

There is no information, however, comparing the prevalence of alcohol abuse in women who receive periodic gynecologic care and those who seek care for menstrual disorders such as the premenstrual syndromes. This question was studied in two private practice settings. Women seeking periodic care were obtained from a suburban, general gynecology practice. Women seeking treatment for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were obtained from a practice that specialized in the care of PMS. Ninetyfive patients with PMS and 147 patients seeking periodic care were screened with the CAGE questions—a mnemonic for attempts to Cut back on drinking, being Annoyed at criticism about drinking, feeling Guilty about drinking, and using alcohol as an Eye-opener. Women who gave affirmative responses to one or more of the CAGE questions were evaluated for the presence of alcohol abuse. In the women seeking periodic care, 33% were CAGE positive and 12% were alcohol abusers. In the PMS practice, 51% were CAGE positive and 21% were alcohol abusers. Alcohol abuse is a common problem in gynecologic practice.

Materials and Methods Thirteen women with gynecologic malignancies who were to receive radiation and/or chemotherapy were recruited for this study. Subjects were imaged on a 3T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner at baseline (after surgery but before radiation or chemotherapy), 6 months, and 12 months after treatment. Water–fat imaging was used to generate high‐resolution, 3D signal fat fraction (sFF) maps extending from mid‐femur to L3. Treatment changes were assessed by measuring marrow sFF in the L4 vertebra, femoral necks, and control tissues. Results Pretreatment and 6‐month scans were compared in nine women. sFF increased significantly in both the L4 vertebral marrow ( P = 0.04) and the femoral necks ( P = 0.03), while no significant change was observed in control regions. Qualitatively, chemotherapy changes were more uniform in space, whereas the radiation‐induced changes were largest in marrow regions inside and close to the target radiation field. Conclusion Water–fat MRI is sensitive to changes in red/yellow marrow composition, and can be used for quantitative and qualitative assessment of treatment‐induced marrow damage. J. Magn. Reson.

Although existing treatment strategies have ameliorated the clinical outcomes of patients, the overall survival rate of advanced diseases remains unsatisfactory. Increasing evidence has indicated that the development and prognosis of tumors are closely related to the tumor microenvironment (TME), which restricts the immune response and provokes malignant progression. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main component of TME and act as a key regulator in tumor metastasis, immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance. Several preclinical trials have studied potential drugs that target TAMs to achieve potent anticancer therapy. This review focuses on the various functions of TAMs and how they influence the carcinogenesis of gynecological and breast cancers through regulating cancer cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis and tumor-related immunosuppression. Besides, we also discuss the potential application of disabling TAMs signaling as a part of cancer therapeutic strategies, as well as CAR macrophages, TAMs-based vaccines and TAMs nanobiotechnology. These research advances support that targeting TAMs combined with conventional therapy might be used as effective therapeutics for gynecological and breast cancers in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13045-021-01198-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3208099334", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Women with a histological diagnosis of struma ovarii who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination were identified from the databases of five ultrasound centers. The tumors were characterized on the basis of ultrasound images, ultrasound reports and research protocols (when applicable) using the terms and definitions of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group. In addition, four authors reviewed all ultrasound images and described them using pattern recognition. Results Of 31 patients identified, 16 had pure struma ovarii (one malignant), whereas in 15 patients the struma ovarii were ‘impure’, constituting the major part of a dermoid cyst (all benign, bilateral in one case). Median age was 40 (range, 18–80) years and 22 (71%) patients were of fertile age. Thirteen patients (42%) were asymptomatic, nine (29%) presented with pain, six (19%) with bloating, two (6%) with irregular bleeding and one (3%) with thyreotoxicosis. Most pure struma ovarii (11/16 cases, 69%) contained solid components, but cystic components were always present. The color content at Doppler examination varied from none to abundant. Four patients had ascites. Using pattern recognition the most specific feature of pure struma ovarii was the ‘struma pearl’, i.e. a smooth roundish solid area, similar, but not identical, to the ‘round white ball’ seen in dermoid cysts. ‘Struma pearls’ were present in six cases of pure struma ovarii. Most (10/16, 63%) cases of impure struma ovarii manifested ultrasound features compatible with a dermoid cyst, but six manifested ultrasound features similar to those of pure struma ovarii, ‘struma pearls’ being seen in three of these. Conclusions The sonographic features of struma ovarii vary. Struma ovarii may be suspected when a ‘struma pearl’ is seen. Whether ‘struma pearls’ are indeed a specific ultrasonographic feature of struma ovarii needs to be determined in a prospective study. Copyright © 2008 ISUOG.

In cervical cancer, p53 is inactivated by degradation through the complex with human papilloma virus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 and E6-associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. In endometrial cancer, overexpression of p53 in immunohistochemistry is a significant prognostic factor. A discrepancy between p53 overexpression and TP53 mutations is observed in endometrioid endometrial cancer, indicating that the accumulation of p53 protein can be explained by not only gene mutations but also dysregulation of the factors such as ERβ and MDM2. Furthermore, the double-positive expression of immunoreactive estrogen receptor (ER) β and p53 proteins is closely associated with the incidence of metastasis and/or recurrence. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) arises from secretary cells in the fallopian tube. The secretary cell outgrowth (SCOUT) with TP53 mutations progresses to HGSC via the p53 signature, serous intraepithelial lesion (STIL), and serous intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), indicating that TP53 mutation is associated with carcinogenesis of HGSC. Clinical application targeting p53 has been approved for some malignant tumors. Gene therapy by the adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer system is performed for head and neck cancer. A clinical phase III trial using MDM2/X inhibitors, idasanutlin (RG7388) combined with cytarabine, is being performed involving relapse/refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients.

Recent findings Recent studies have shown the impact of radiotherapy on sexual function in cervical cancer and have highlighted differences in the levels and duration of sexual problems in women with early stage compared with advanced, recurrent, or persistent disease. Qualitative studies in cervical and endometrial cancer have highlighted women’s concerns in relation to femininity, fears of sexual relations, and the importance of communication with the woman’s partner. Similar findings have been obtained in studies of ovarian cancer. Predictors of sexual function in ovarian cancer have been suggested by a recent study, with risk factors for poorer sexual functioning being age, treatment, time since treatment, poor self esteem/body image, physical symptoms, poor performance status, depression, and anxiety. Similar risk factors have been highlighted in vulval cancer. Communication issues have been discussed, with some preliminary exploration of the benefits of group therapy and psychosexual counseling. Summary Recent research is helping us to understand more about the impact of the different types of gynecological cancer and its treatment on sexual functioning, with information being provided about key risk factors and predictors of sexual dysfunction that can be used to guide appropriate advice and support.

Among 328 patients with gynecologic cancer the serum CEA concentration was elevated over the normal background level of 5 ng/ml in 32 cases (9.8%), and the frequency of elevated CEA levels increased with advancing clinical stage. Among 84 patients with benign tumors CEA was elevated in 5 cases (6%). Elevated levels were most commonly seen in patients with ovarian cancer (20%). In squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix elevated levels occurred in 10%, and in cervical adenocarcinoma CEA elevation took place in 19% of the cases. In endometrial cancer CEA became less frequently elevated (7%). After radical surgery the CEA concentration decreased and remained low in 20 of 24 cancer patients (83%). Fifteen of these remained clinically tumor free during the follow-up period of 4–24 months. Three of four patients whose CEA concentration did not significantly decrease after operation were found to have residual tumor. Radiotherapy resulted in an increased CEA concentration in 3 of 5 patients with advanced cancer. Immunoperoxidase staining of CEA was carried out in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of 64 tumors and 33 specimens from normal genital tract. Tissue CEA was demonstrable in early as well as in advanced stages of malignant tumors. All normal tissue specimens from the genital tract were CEA-negative, but the brushborder of normal colon was CEA-positive. CEA activity in tissue was found in 11 of 14 squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix (79%) and in 7 of 9 cervical adenocarcinomas (78%). By contrast, endometrial adenocarcinoma showed CEA staining in one of 11 tumors only, and in ovarian adenocarcinoma positive CEA staining was never seen. CEA reactions were sometimes found in benign mucinous cystadenomas of the ovary, but not in serous cysts. The serum CEA concentration was normal or sometimes slightly elevated in cases where the tumor was CEA-negative, whereas normal or even highly elevated serum CEA concentrations were seen in CEA-positive tumors. On the basis of these results the following conclusions can be made: 1) Serum CEA measurement is likely to be more effective in cervical and ovarian than in endometrial cancer for the detection of recurrent CEA-positive tumors. 2) It is possible by immunoperoxidase technique to identify certain CEA-positive cervical carcinomas before the serum CEA concentration becomes elevated. 3) Some benign ovarian tumors apparently produce high amounts of CEA without any clinical evidence of malignancy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(197808)42:2<581::aid-cncr2820420226>3.0.co;2-g", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991516191", "source": "openalex"}

The development of chemoresistance after initial rounds of chemotherapy contributes to tumor relapse and death due to gynecologic malignancies. In this regard, cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of stem cells with the ability to undergo self-renewal and clonal evolution, play a key role in tumor progression and drug resistance. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) are a group of enzymes shown to be robust CSC markers in gynecologic and other malignancies. These enzymes also play functional roles in CSCs, including detoxification of aldehydes, scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and retinoic acid (RA) signaling, making ALDH an attractive therapeutic target in various clinical scenarios. In this review, we discuss the critical roles of the ALDH in driving stemness in different gynecologic malignancies. We review inhibitors of ALDH, both general and isoform-specific, which have been used to target CSCs in gynecologic cancers. Many of these inhibitors have been shown to be effective in preclinical models of gynecologic malignancies, supporting further development in the clinic. Furthermore, ALDH inhibitors, including 673A and CM037, synergize with chemotherapy to reduce tumor growth. Thus, ALDH-targeted therapies hold promise for improving patient outcomes in gynecologic malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12040961", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3015218076", "source": "openalex"}

Despite this, many clinical departments still grapple with how to initiate their ERAS® program, particularly as it relates to translating the guidelines into an actual protocol. To date there have been few programs that have fully implemented a structured ERAS® program in gynecologic oncology – remembering that a formal program requires three elements: i) an ERAS® protocol, ii) an audit system (database) to review protocol compliance and clinical outcomes, and iii) an ERAS® team that iterates towards improved compliance and outcomes [4Kalogera E.

In order to address the growing demand for assistance in initiating an ERAS® program, we describe below a series of recommendations to serve as a primer for program development. While these recommendations are primarily aimed at patients undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic cancer, the majority of the recommendations are equally applicable to those undergoing minimally invasive surgery. Some protocol recommendations are quite prescriptive and include dosages and timing of administration, while others are more general and will require discussion among the ERAS® team prior to implementation. In rare instances, no standard of care exists and more than one option is provided. All patients should undergo extensive counseling by the surgeon, advanced practice provider, clinical nurse, and anesthesiologist regarding anticipated expectations of the patient and the healthcare team. An informational brochure that addresses patient expectations and provides education regarding the ERAS® protocol should be provided in each patient's preoperative information package. The use of preoperative bowel preparation continues to be an area of controversy in which no standard of care exists. A multitude of randomized trials have demonstrated that mechanical bowel preparation alone has no impact on rates of surgical site infection (SSI) or enteric leak, but may result in electrolyte imbalances and dehydration, and interfere with maintenance of euvolemia [[7]Guenaga K.F. Matos D. Wille-Jorgensen P. Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery.Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2011; : CD001544PubMed Google Scholar]. Retrospective data has shown that combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is associated with reduced rates of SSI and enteric leak [[8]Scarborough J.E. Mantyh C.R. Sun Z. Migaly J. Combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation reduces incisional surgical site infection and anastomotic leak rates after elective colorectal resection: an analysis of colectomy-targeted ACS NSQIP.Ann. Surg. 2015; 262: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar]. However, some gynecologic oncology practices have published very low rates of SSI and enteric leak despite omission of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics [[9]Johnson M.P. Kim S.J.

Thus, the decision for bowel preparation must be made according to the stance taken at each institution and, if included, should contain an oral antibiotic component. Eliminating prolonged fasting prior to surgery remains an obstacle at many institutions.

At a minimum, the database should record each of the compliance elements and also importantly length of hospital stay (LOS), readmissions, and complications until 30 days post-discharge. It is well established that improved overall compliance is associated with reductions in both complications and hospital stay [[28]ERAS Compliance Group The impact of enhanced recovery protocol compliance on elective colorectal cancer resection: results from an international registry.Ann. Surg. 2015; 261: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar]. Audit allows the establishment of baseline compliance, LOS and complications pre-ERAS® implementation such that following formal implementation of the ERAS® program, efforts can be focused on areas where compliance is less than ideal and therefore iterate towards improved outcomes. A critical component for any successful ERAS® program is the development of a multi-disciplinary team that facilitates input from varying expertise and perspectives with the ultimate goal of reviewing ERAS® element compliance (obtained from audit) and iterating towards improved perioperative outcomes. In order to establish such a team, the following members should be considered:•Gynecologic oncology surgeons•Anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists•Residents, fellows, advanced practice providers (NP/PAs)•Preoperative nursing team•Operating room nursing team•Recovery room nursing team•Outpatient and inpatient nursing team•Outpatient and inpatient pharmacist•Preoperative and postoperative dietitian•Research data coordinators•Data manager and statistician It is highly recommended that the team meet consistently (at minimum every two weeks) to ensure that there is continuity of flow in addressing critical issues regarding implementation, compliance, and growth of the ERAS® program. Team members should also be leaders in their respective disciplines in order to communicate practice changes back to each stakeholder group to facilitate implementation and troubleshooting. The initiation of an ERAS® program requires steadfast effort from the entire team along the surgical care continuum. The benefits of such efforts are well established with the majority of clinical units now consistently reporting reductions in LOS and complications [[29]Ljungqvist O. Scott M. Fearon K.C.

Articles were reviewed for applicability to the topic of interventions for sexual difficulties related to radiation therapy. A limited number of articles were found on the topic. Very little attention has been paid to the sexual difficulties women experience after radiation to the sexual organs. There are a limited number of interventions for the woman who has been treated for gynecological cancer with radiation. These focus on the provision of information and some specific suggestions related to treating vaginal dryness, the need for vaginal dilatation after radiation therapy, and management of fatigue.

Recent findings Retrospective data collected from many institutions support the use of robotic surgery in the management of cervical, endometrial, and early-stage ovarian cancer. Benefits to robotic surgery include decreased blood loss, fewer perioperative complications, and decreased length of hospital stay, especially when compared to an open cohort. Disadvantages include costs associated with the robotic system and disposable equipment, accessibility to robotic surgical systems, loss of haptic sensation with the device, and lack of prospective trials validating its use in gynecologic oncology. Summary Current evidence establishes a role for the use of robotic surgery in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies. Further research should be implemented to validate the use of robotic surgery in gynecologic malignancies and to compare its outcomes to those of open and laparoscopic surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0b013e328354e572", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112994271", "source": "openalex"}

The most noteworthy hereditary gynecologic cancer syndromes include hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, wherein BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutations have been identified, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) of the Lynch syndrome II variant, wherein hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 germ-line mutations have been identified. DNA testing for specific cancer-associated germ-line mutations is now available for HBOC and HNPCC syndrome family members who are in the direct line of inheritance. Genetic counseling is mandatory prior to DNA testing and at the time of disclosure of findings. A patient found to be negative for the family's particular cancer-associated germ-line mutation can revert to general population screening recommendations. When a deleterious mutation is identified, the physician is able to predict a patient's lifetime susceptibility to breast and ovarian carcinomas in the HBOC syndrome or the cancers which characterize the Lynch syndrome II variant of HNPCC, particularly carcinomas of the colon, endometrium, and ovary. Management strategies can be offered which are designed to take advantage of the natural history of that distinct hereditary cancer syndrome. We discuss the unfolding developments concerning familial and heritable susceptibilities, molecular genetics, and possible carcinogenic co-factors of the three most common gynecologic cancers: carcinomas of the uterine cervix, endometrium, and ovary.

Using these data to identify which medical students are likely to become successful residents in an academic residency program in obstetrics and gynecology is difficult and to date, not well studied.To determine whether objective information in medical students' applications can help predict resident success.We performed a retrospective cohort study of all residents who matched into the Johns Hopkins University residency program in obstetrics and gynecology between 1994 and 2004 and entered the program through the National Resident Matching Program as a postgraduate year-1 resident. Residents were independently evaluated by faculty and ranked in 4 groups according to perceived level of success. Applications from residents in the highest and lowest group were abstracted.

Methods: Women who had major gynecologic surgery for benign conditions were randomly allocated to early feeding of low residue diets 6 hours postoperatively or traditional dietary management of clear liquids with normal bowel sounds, and regular diet with passage of flatus. Demographic and perioperative data were collected, and patients answered questionnaires on their perception of bowel function and pain using the McGill Pain Scale. Power analysis found that 130 women were needed to find a twofold greater incidence of ileus in the early feeding group with 80% power and α = .05. Results: Complete data were available for 139 women, 67 allocated to the early feeding group and 72 to the late feeding group. The incidence of postoperative ileus for the study population was 4.4% and did not differ between groups (early 3% versus late 5.8%, P = .68). There were no differences in patient demographics, surgical procedures, anesthesia used, and intraoperative complications between groups. With the exception of more complaints of nausea in the late feeding group (23% versus 13%, P = .04), there were no differences in other postoperative variables, including other perioperative complications, pain medicine requirements, fluid and caloric intake, median pain scores, and gastrointestinal function.

Previously, they were considered transcription byproducts without biological functions. Further studies have shown that lncRNAs are involved in multiple biological and pathological processes, including regulation of epigenetic, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional events. Long non-coding RNA expression patterns in various malignant tumors differ from those of benign tumors and normal tissue, and such alterations may promote or suppress tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The expression profiles of lncRNAs are abnormal in gynecological cancers, such as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and endometrial cancer, suggesting an important role for lncRNAs in tumorigenesis/progression of these cancers. Here, we summarized the research progress on identifying the biological functions of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis in gynecological cancers. We provide references for exploring the clinical applications of lncRNAs as early diagnostic biomarkers or ideal therapeutic targets in gynecological cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000212", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2315649231", "source": "openalex"}

It is produced in immature Sertoli cells in male embryos and binds to MIS/AMH receptors in primordial Müllerian ducts to cause regression of female reproductive structures that are the precursors to the fallopian tubes, the surface epithelium of the ovaries, the uterus, the cervix, and the upper third of the vagina. Because most gynecologic tumors originate from Müllerian duct-derived tissues, and since MIS/AMH causes regression of the Müllerian duct in male embryos, it is expected to inhibit the growth of gynecologic tumors. Purified recombinant human MIS/AMH causes growth inhibition of epithelial ovarian cancer cells and cell lines in vitro and in vitro via MIS receptor-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that MIS/AMH inhibits proliferation in tissues and cell lines of other MIS/AMH receptor-expressing gynecologic tumors such as cervical, endometrial, breast, and in endometriosis as well. These findings indicate that bioactive MIS/AMH recombinant protein should be tested in patients against tumors expressing the MIS/AMH receptor complex, perhaps beginning with ovarian cancer because it has the worst prognosis. The molecular tools to identify MIS/AMH receptor expressing ovarian and other cancers are in place, thus, it is possible to select patients for treatment. An MIS/AMH ELISA exists to follow administered doses of MIS/AMH, as well. Clinical trials await the production of sufficient supplies of qualified recombinant human MIS/AMH for this purpose.

This study set out to identify risk factors for SSI in patients undergoing Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries in an Indian rural hospital. Patients who underwent a surgical procedure between September 2010 to February 2013 in the 60-bedded ward of Obstetric and Gynecology department were included. Surveillance for SSI was based on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) definition and methodology. Incidence and risk factors for SSI, including those for specific procedure, were calculated from data collected on daily ward rounds. A total of 1173 patients underwent a surgical procedure during the study period. The incidence of SSI in the cohort was 7.84% (95% CI 6.30–9.38). Majority of SSI were superficial. Obstetric surgeries had a lower SSI incidence compared to gynecological surgeries (1.2% versus 10.3% respectively). The risk factors for SSI identified in the multivariate logistic regression model were age (OR 1.03), vaginal examination (OR 1.31); presence of vaginal discharge (OR 4.04); medical disease (OR 5.76); American Society of Anesthesia score greater than 3 (OR 12.8); concurrent surgical procedure (OR 3.26); each increase in hour of surgery, after the first hour, doubled the risk of SSI; inappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis increased the risk of SSI by nearly 5 times. Each day increase in stay in the hospital after the surgery increased the risk of contacting an SSI by 5%. Incidence and risk factors from prospective SSI surveillance can be reported simultaneously for the Obstetric and Gynecological surgeries and can be part of routine practice in resource-constrained settings.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were randomized to receive doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) with or without cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks for eight drug courses. All patients had received prior therapy with progestins with subsequent progression of disease. No patients had received prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs. Of 356 patients, 300 had measurable disease. RESULTS Among 132 patients treated with doxorubicin alone, there were seven complete responses (5%), 22 partial responses (17%), 73 with stable disease (55%), and 30 with increasing disease within 2 months of study entry (23%). For the 144 patients who received the combination, there were 18 complete responses (13%), 25 partial responses (17%), 75 with stable disease (52%), and 26 with increasing disease (18%). The median progression-free interval for those patients who received doxorubicin alone was 3.2 months, while it was 3.9 months for those who received the combination. The median survival duration for doxorubicin patients was 6.7 months, while it was 7.3 months for the combination patients. None of the unadjusted estimates of treatment differences are statistically significant. Prognostic features that had an impact on outcome included one factor associated with an increased likelihood of response (presence of measurable lung metastases) and four features associated with a poorer survival (poor performance status [PS] of 2 or 3, high pathologic grade, and presence of liver metastases or other intraabdominal disease). If these features are taken into account in multivariate analyses, there is no statistically significant evidence for differences in response rates (relative odds of response, 1.58; P = .06, one-tailed test), and survival duration is slightly longer in the combination regimen (17% reduction in death rate; P = .048).

A standardized mean difference of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. When compared with usual clinical practice, the use of patient decision aids reduced decisional conflict (standardized mean difference -0.23; 95% CI -0.36, to -0.11; 19 trials; 4,624 women) and improved patient knowledge (standardized mean difference 0.58; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.71; 17 trials; 4,375 women). There was no difference in patient anxiety (standardized mean difference -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06; 12 trials; 2,714 women) or satisfaction (standardized mean difference 0.17; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24; 6 trials; 2,718 women).Patient decision aids are effective in facilitating shared decision making and can be helpful in clinical practice to support patient centered care informed by the best evidence.PROSPERO International Register of Systematic Reviews, www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/89953, CRD42018089953.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003664", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2999927524", "source": "openalex"}

The problem to date has been mesh intolerance. History. The first meshes were made with silver filigrees or stainless steel. Non-metallic and non-absorbable synthetic prostheses include nylon, silastic, polytetrafluoroethylene as well as expansive polyester and polypropylene forms. Most of the absorbable prostheses are made of polyglycolic acid and polyglactine 910. Classification. Four groups of biomaterials can be described according to pore size. Mechanical and biological properties. The mechanical properties of meshes have been tested industrially for resistance, pliability, elasticity and ductile qualities. These properties depend on type of tissue structure (woven or knitted) and the type of fiber used (mono and multi-filaments). The goal is to obtain a \"silent\" material, i.e. a material which does not trigger a host tissue reaction. Introducing the foreign body induces a \"scarring\" response. This fibroblastic reaction replaces the inflammatory reaction, leading to progressive colonization of the prosthesis. The major risk is infection caused by a disturbance of the inflammatory phase and bacterial development. Bacteria can be trapped in fibrotic tissue, with the risk of delayed infection. Immunological reactions may have an additive effect. These problems are not encountered with absorbable meshes. An ideal implant material must: not undergo physical modification by tissue fluids, be chemically inert, not trigger inflammatory or foreign body cell response in body tissues, be noncarcinogenic and nonallergenic, be capable of resisting mechanical stress and sterilization, and be able to be manufactured in the necessary shape. Polyester, polypropylene and expansive polytetrafluoroethylene fulfill these criteria. The ideal mesh. Eleven criteria are proposed. Complications for hernia repair. Infection and seroma are the most frequent complications with micro-porous meshes. Macro-porous meshes can cause erosive phenomena and adhesions. Retraction of synthetic tissues is observed in 20 to 30% of cases. Meshes in gynecology. In gynecology surgery, meshes made their first appearance in trans-abdominal sacrocolpopexy and slings. A detailed review of complications found in 32 articles studying slings and 22 studying sacrocolpopexy with approximately 10 types of meshes shows that intolerance of slings has oscillated between 1% with Prolene and 31% with Gore-Tex; for abdominal sacrocolpopexy the rate was between 1.7% with Prolene and 20% with Teflon. Rejection phenomena appear during the first year and are proportional to the surface area of the synthetic tissue and the proximity of the vaginal scar. New materials have been proposed over the last ten years for prolapse surgery, notably for cystocele, which accounts for 70% of all repair procedures. Nearly fifteen studies have reported a level of intolerance reaching 6%, the large majority of the meshes used being Prolene meshes. Our personal experience with 87 repair procedures has led us to the conclusion that Prolene is the most adapted mesh, allowing free tension between the bladder and the anterior vaginal wall.Continuous evaluation is needed to study these replacement materials which should in theory, improve the rate of recurrence, which is at present 20% with classic procedures not using a mesh.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2240519452", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the performance of a laparoscopic bilateral midsegment salpingectomy. Residents were randomized to either traditional teaching (no simulation) or faculty-directed sessions in a simulation laboratory. A sample size of at least 44 lower-level residents (postgraduate year [PGY] 1 or 2) and 66 upper-level (PGY 3 or 4) were necessary to demonstrate a 50% improvement in performance assuming an α error of 0.05 and β error of 0.20 for each group independently. The primary outcomes were the final total normalized simulation score and the operating room performance score. Paired t test and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to evaluate the differences within and between cohorts. Our final model involved a multiple linear regression analysis for the main effects of a priori--specified variables. RESULTS: We enrolled 116 residents from eight centers across the United States. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline simulation or operative performances. Although both groups demonstrated improvement with time, the trained group improved significantly higher normalized simulation scores (378 ± 54 compared with 264 ± 86; P<.01) and higher levels of competence on the simulated tasks (96.2% compared with 61.1%; P<.01). The simulation group also had higher objective structured assessment of technical skills scores in the operating room (27.5 compared with 30.0; P=.03). CONCLUSION: We found that proficiency-based simulation offers additional benefit to traditional education for all levels of residents. The use of easily accessible, low-fidelity tasks should be incorporated into formal laparoscopic training. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NTC00555243.

Eighty patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy participated. Confounding variables that could influence the incidence of postoperative emesis were controlled. Patients received either fentanyl 100 micro g (Group I) or ketorolac 60 mg (Group II) intravenously (IV) at the time of anesthetic induction. No further analgesic supplements were given intraoperatively. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with propofol-nitrous oxide. Atracurium was used for muscle relaxation and reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Postoperative pain during early recovery was treated with IV fentanyl 25-50 micro g (Group I) or IV ketorolac 15-30 mg (Group II). Subsequent breakthrough pain in both groups was treated with IV fentanyl 25 micro g increments as needed (rescue analgesia). Eighty-four percent of patients in Group I required analgesics during early recovery versus 56% of patients in Group II (P < 0.05). Maintenance dose of propofol was significantly lower in Group I (129 +/- 35 micro g [centered dot] kg-1 [centered dot] min-1) than in Group II (170 +/- 63 micro g [centered dot] kg-1 [centered dot] min-1). Immediate recovery (emergence) in the two groups was comparable, despite different propofol requirements. Although the incidence of emetic sequelae in the postanesthesia care unit was not significantly different between the two treatment groups, a significantly larger number of patients in Group I (fentanyl group) had emetic sequelae that required therapeutic intervention (Group I 29% versus Group II 10%). Patients in Group I also took a significantly longer time to ambulate and meet criteria for home discharge. These results indicate that, in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy, the practice of administering a small dose of fentanyl at the time of anesthetic induction reduces maintenance propofol requirement, but fails to provide effective postoperative analgesia. Fentanyl administration at anesthetic induction increased the need for rescue antiemetics. The relative severity of emetic sequelae could have contributed to delay in ambulation and discharge.

Apart from host genetics, infections, changes in diet, life-style and hygiene status are known to affect this delicate state of equilibrium. More importantly, the gonadal hormones strongly influence the overall structure and function of vaginal microbiota. Several studies have attempted to understand (a) the composition of vaginal microbiota in specific stages of women's reproductive cycle (b) their association with gonadal hormones, and their potential role in manifestation of specific health conditions (from the perspective of cause/ consequence). However, a single study that places, in context, the structural variations of the vaginal microbiome across the entire life-span of women's reproductive cycle is currently lacking. With the objective to obtain a holistic overview of the community dynamics of vaginal micro-environment 'across' various stages of women’s reproductive life-cycle, we have performed a meta-analysis of approximately 1000 vaginal microbiome samples representing various stages of the reproductive cycle. Objectives of this analysis included (a) understanding temporal changes in vaginal community taxonomic structure and composition as women pass through various gynaecological/ reproductive stages (b) exploring correlations between the levels of female sex hormones with vaginal microbiome diversity (c) analysing changes in the pattern of community diversity in cases of infection (i.e. vaginosis) and viewing the analysed changes in the context of a healthy state. Results reveal interesting temporal trends with respect to vaginal microbial community diversity and its pattern of correlation with host physiology. Results indicate significant differences in alpha-diversity and overall vaginal microbial community members in various reproductive phases. In addition to reinforcing the known influence/ role of gonadal hormones in maintaining gynaecological health, results indicate how hormonal level perturbations cause/ contribute to imbalances in the vaginal microbiome. The nature of resulting dysbiotic state and its influence on disease susceptibility is also analysed and discussed. Results also suggest that elevated vaginal microbiome diversity in pregnancy does not necessarily indicate a state of bacterial infection. The study puts forward a hormone-level driven microbiome diversity hypothesis for explaining temporal patterns in vaginal microbiome diversity during various stages of women’s reproductive cycle.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00551", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3014797552", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of vulnerable populations, such as those with gynecologic cancer who develop COVID‐19 infections, is limited. Methods Patients from 6 NYC‐area hospital systems with known gynecologic cancer and a COVID‐19 diagnosis were identified. Demographic and clinical outcome data were abstracted through a review of electronic medical records. Results Records for 121 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID‐19 were abstracted; the median age at the COVID‐19 diagnosis was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 51.0‐73.0 years). Sixty‐six of the 121 patients (54.5%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients, 45 (68.2%) required respiratory intervention, 20 (30.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 9 (13.6%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen patients (14.0%) died of COVID‐19 complications. No patient requiring mechanical ventilation survived.

Two main types of AI have been applied in medicine: symbolic AI (eg, knowledge base and ontologies) and nonsymbolic AI (eg, machine learning and artificial neural networks). Consequently, AI has also been applied across most obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) domains, including general obstetrics, gynecology surgery, fetal ultrasound, and assisted reproductive medicine, among others.The aim of this study was to provide a systematic review to establish the actual contributions of AI reported in OB/GYN discipline journals.The PubMed database was searched for citations indexed with \"artificial intelligence\" and at least one of the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms between January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2020: \"obstetrics\"; \"gynecology\"; \"reproductive techniques, assisted\"; or \"pregnancy.\" All publications in OB/GYN core disciplines journals were considered. The selection of journals was based on disciplines defined in Web of Science. The publications were excluded if no AI process was used in the study. Review, editorial, and commentary articles were also excluded. The study analysis comprised (1) classification of publications into OB/GYN domains, (2) description of AI methods, (3) description of AI algorithms, (4) description of data sets, (5) description of AI contributions, and (6) description of the validation of the AI process.The PubMed search retrieved 579 citations and 66 publications met the selection criteria. All OB/GYN subdomains were covered: obstetrics (41%, 27/66), gynecology (3%, 2/66), assisted reproductive medicine (33%, 22/66), early pregnancy (2%, 1/66), and fetal medicine (21%, 14/66). Both machine learning methods (39/66) and knowledge base methods (25/66) were represented. Machine learning used imaging, numerical, and clinical data sets. Knowledge base methods used mostly omics data sets. The actual contributions of AI were method/algorithm development (53%, 35/66), hypothesis generation (42%, 28/66), or software development (3%, 2/66). Validation was performed on one data set (86%, 57/66) and no external validation was reported. We observed a general rising trend in publications related to AI in OB/GYN over the last two decades. Most of these publications (82%, 54/66) remain out of the scope of the usual OB/GYN journals.In OB/GYN discipline journals, mostly preliminary work (eg, proof-of-concept algorithm or method) in AI applied to this discipline is reported and clinical validation remains an unmet prerequisite. Improvement driven by new AI research guidelines is expected. However, these guidelines are covering only a part of AI approaches (nonsymbolic) reported in this review; hence, updates need to be considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2196/35465", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220850650", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate QoL and identify its associated factors in Turkish women with gynecologic cancer.The study included 119 women diagnosed with endometrial, cervical, ovarian or vulvar cancer and treated at the Gynecologic Oncology Department of Celal Bayar University Faculty of Medicine. The data were collected between January and June 2011. QoL was measured with EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0. Relationships between clinical and socio- demographic characteristics and QoL scores were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis and t-tests.Global health status, physical and role function scores were found higher in women under the age of 60 years. Role function scores were found lower, and emotional and social scores were found to be higher in single women than in married women. Physical scores were found higher in women who had graduated from secondary school or above. Women with ovarian cancer had the highest while women with cervical cancer had the lowest global health score (65.3 ± 24.7 and 43.0 ± 24.1, respectively). Women with endometrial cancer were found to have better role function, and social well being than those with vulvar, cervical or ovarian cancer. Global, physical, role function, cognitive and social scores were found higher in women who had been treated with surgery.Gynecological cancer and treatment processes cause significant problems that have negative effects on physical, emotional, social and role function aspects of QoL. Health care providers play a key role in the identification and treatment of the complications of cancer therapy.

The creation of a pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position, both of which are used to improve visualization, are associated with cephalad movement of the diaphragm. This may increase the risk of endobronchial intubation. We studied the change in the distance from the tip of the endotracheal tube (ETT) to the carina with a fiberoptic bronchoscope in 30 patients aged 21-40 yr who were undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation (n = 28) or hysterectomy (n = 2). Measurements were taken in the supine and Trendelenburg positions before and after pneumoperitoneum. The average distance from the ETT to the carina in the supine position was 2.1 +/- 0.8 cm and in the Trendelenburg position was 1.8 +/- 0.8 cm (P = not significant). After insufflation of the abdominal cavity, the mean distance decreased to 0.7 +/- 1.4 cm in the supine position (P < 0.05) and was associated with endobronchial intubation in eight patients. The addition of the Trendelenburg position to an established pneumoperitoneum resulted in minimal displacement (0.54 +/- 1.4 cm, P < 0.05) and one additional endobronchial intubation. We conclude that the insufflation of gas in the abdominal cavity, and not the change in patient position, is the main risk factor for endobronchial intubation in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.This study demonstrated that in anesthetized women, the insufflation of gas into the abdomen during laparoscopy for gynecologic surgery is the main risk factor for migration of the endotracheal tube into a bronchus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/00000539-199802000-00016", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039113501", "source": "openalex"}

It affects women more than men and causes symptoms in multiple organs. It is associated with chronic pain, skin fragility and abnormal bleeding. These characteristics may hamper reproductive life. We conducted a study to evaluate the gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in women with hEDS. We also explored a possible hormonal modulation of the hEDS symptoms. The gynecologic and obstetric history of 386 consecutive women diagnosed with hEDS was collected by a standardized questionnaire and a medical consultation performed by a senior gynecologist in an expert centre for hEDS between May 2012 and December 2014. We observed a high frequency of gynecologic complaints, specifically: menorrhagia (76 %), dysmenorrhea (72 %) and dyspareunia (43 %). Endometriosis was not highly prevalent in this population. The obstetric outcomes were similar to those of the general French population for deliveries by cesarean section (14.6 %) and premature births (6.2 %) but the incidence of multiple spontaneous abortion (13 %) and spontaneous abortion (28 %) were significantly higher. A subset of women were sensitive to hormonal fluctuations with more severe symptoms occurring during puberty, prior to menstruation, during the postpartum period as well as on oral contraception. Increased awareness of the gynecological symptomatology in women with hEDS can help discriminate between endometriosis and thus prevent useless, and potentially dangerous, surgery. This study also suggests that hormonal modulation may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of women with hEDS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-016-0511-2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2520247297", "source": "openalex"}

This article describes the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of women in Brazil affected with GC between the years of 2000 and 2017. METHODS Incidence, morbidity, and mortality data from patients with a diagnosis of one out of the five most common GC, cervical (CC), uterine (UC), ovarian (OC), vulvar (VvC), and vaginal (VgC), were obtained from three governmental sources of data. RESULTS From 2000 to 2015 CC, OC, and VgC incidence rates (IRs) decreased, whereas the IRs for UC and VvC remained relatively stable. Data from 382,932 women with GC were analyzed. Most patients presented with locally advanced or advanced disease at diagnosis: 60.1% of patients with CC, 31.2% of patients with UC, 67.2% of patients with OC, 45.2% of patients with VvC, and 67.0% of patients with VgC. Time from diagnosis to first treatment was ≥ 60 days in 58.0% of patients with CC, 58.5% of patients with UC, 27.0% of patients with OC, 55.3% of patients with VvC, and 52.7% of patients with VgC. Regarding mortality rates (MRs), with the exception of CC, UC, and VvC, which showed a slight decrease, MRs remained stable between 2000 and 2017. CONCLUSION A comparison with international data indicates that Brazilian patients are diagnosed with more advanced disease and face a longer delay between diagnosis and first treatment. Despite advances in screening and treatment, GC mortality has not decreased satisfactorily in this country.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00099", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3097551677", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: A screening questionnaire on pelvic floor dysfunction was administered as part of the baseline health questionnaire to 549 consecutive new patients presenting to a gynecologic oncology practice. Patients were asked whether they felt a bulge from their vagina or experienced loss of urine associated with activity or urge to urinate. The prevalence of urinary incontinence, POP, or both was determined for each malignancy and benign conditions. χ2 analyses and logistic regression were used to assess significance of differences. RESULTS: Among the 347 women with a gynecologic malignancy, 49.9% women had uterine, 21.0% ovarian, and 14.4% cervical cancer. More than half of the patients with cancer reported baseline urinary incontinence (UI) and 10.9% felt a bulge from their vagina. Approximately 19% of these women had moderate-to-severe symptoms. The prevalence of baseline UI (P=.86) and POP (P=.08) did not differ by gynecologic cancer nor did they differ compared with women with benign gynecologic conditions (UI P=.89, POP P=.20). Logistic regression demonstrated an association between incontinence symptoms and increased age and body mass index (BMI). CONCLUSIONS: Women with gynecologic cancer show high prevalence of symptomatic POP and UI. Age and BMI are risk factors for UI. Coordinated surgical intervention to address both the malignancy and pelvic floor dysfunction could be considered in select patients to enhance postoperative quality of life and to reduce the economic and quality-of-life costs of multiple surgeries.

Gynecological cancers, such as ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers, considerably contribute to global cancer burden, leading to $5,862.6, $2,945.7, and $1,543.9 million of annual costs of cancer care, respectively. Thus, the development of effective therapies against gynecological cancers is still a largely unmet medical need. One of the novel therapeutic approaches is to induce anti-cancer immunity by the inhibition of the immune checkpoint pathways using monoclonal antibodies. The molecular targets for monoclonal antibodies are cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The rationale for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with gynecological cancers was based on the immunohistological studies showing high expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in those cancers. Currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab. The efficacy and safety of these inhibitors, used as monotherapy and with combination with chemotherapy, is being currently evaluated in several clinical studies. As the results are promising, more clinical trials are being planned, which may lead to the development of efficient therapies for gynecological cancer patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20194705", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2973962355", "source": "openalex"}

Antibiotic prophylaxis malpractices are common in obstetrics and gynecology settings and antibiotic stewardship is used to correct such malpractice. Objective To evaluate the impact of antibiotic stewardship interventions on compliance with surgical antibiotic prophylaxis practice in obstetrics and gynecology surgeries. Method A prospective pre- and post-intervention study was conducted in two tertiary hospitals between May and December 2016. The duration of the each period was 3 months. Antibiotic stewardship interventions including development of a protocol, educational meeting and audit and feedback were implemented. Data were collected using the patient records and analyzed with SPSS version 23. Results A total of 226 and 238 surgical procedures were included in the pre- and post-intervention periods respectively. Age, length of stay and estimated blood loss were similar between the two groups. However, specialty and surgical procedures varied significantly. There was a significant increase in compliance with timing (from 14.2% to 43.3%) and duration (from 0% to 21.8%) of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis after the interventions. The interventions significantly reduced the prescription of third generation cephalosporin (-8.6%), redundant antibiotic (-19.1%), antibiotic utilization (-3.8 DDD/procedure) and cost of antibiotic prophylaxis (-$4.2/procedure). There was no significant difference in the rate of surgical site infection between the two periods. Post-intervention group (OR: 5.60; 95% CI: 3.31–9.47), elective surgery (OR: 4.62; 95% CI: 2.51–8.47) and hospital attended (OR: 9.89; 95% CI: 5.66–17.26) were significant predictors of compliance with timing while elective surgery (OR: 12.49; 95% CI: 2.85–54.71) and compliance with timing (OR: 58.55; 95% CI: 12.66–270.75) were significantly associated with compliance to duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.

However, recent studies have suggested an increased rate of complications compared with urethral catheterization. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing suprapubic catheterization and urethral catheterization in gynecologic populations.PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and trial registries were searched from 1966 to March 2012 for eligible randomized controlled trials comparing postoperative suprapubic catheterization and urethral catheterization in gynecologic patients. We used these search terms: \"catheter,\" \"supra(-)pubic catheter,\" \"urinary catheter,\" \"gyn(a)ecological,\" \"catheterization techniques gyn(a)ecological surgery,\" \"transurethral catheter,\" and \"bladder drainage.\" No language restrictions were applied. METHODS AND STUDY SELECTION: The primary outcome was urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes were the need for recatheterization, duration of catheterization, catheter-related complications, and duration of hospital stay. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated using the random effects model from DerSimonian and Laird.In total, 12 eligible randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis (N=1,300 patients). Suprapubic catheterization was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative urinary tract infections (20% compared with 31%, pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.185-0.512, P<.01) but an increased risk of complications (29% compared with 11%, pooled OR 4.14, 95% CI 1.327-12.9, P=.01). Complications were mostly related to catheter tube malfunction with no visceral injuries reported. No differences in the rate of recatheterization or hospital stay were demonstrated. Robust patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness data are lacking.Based on the best available evidence, no route for bladder drainage in gynecologic patients is clearly superior. The reduced rate of infective morbidity with suprapubic catheterization is offset by a higher rate of catheter-related complications and crucially does not translate into reduced hospital stay. As yet, there are insufficient data to determine which route is most appropriate for catheterization; therefore, cost and patient-specific factors should be paramount in the decision. Minimally invasive surgery may alter the requirement for prolonged postoperative catheterization.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e3182657f0d", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118001326", "source": "openalex"}

Tru-cut biopsy was performed either transvaginally or transabdominally, using an automatic biopsy gun with disposable needle and needle guide attached to the probe. The adequacy, i.e. obtaining a sample sufficient for identification of the origin of the tumor and performance of immunohistochemistry; accuracy, i.e. agreement between biopsy and final postoperative histology; and safety, as determined by complication rate, were assessed. Variables potentially influencing adequacy were analyzed using the orthogonal projections to latent structure method.A total of 195 biopsies were performed on 190 patients. An adequate sample was obtained in 178 (91.3%) biopsies. The final histology was not in agreement with the result from tru-cut biopsy in two out of 118 patients who underwent subsequent surgery (accuracy 98.3%). There were complications in two cases out of the 195 biopsies performed (1.0%). Ascites, elevated CA 125, primary suboptimal operable tumor, serous epithelial ovarian cancer histology, carcinomatosis and vaginal approach were significant positive predictors for the achievement of an adequate sample, while recurrence as an indication, non-serous and non-ovarian histotypes and transabdominal approach were negative predictors.Ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy is an efficient, minimally invasive, accurate and safe diagnostic method in the management of advanced, recurrent or atypical abdominal and pelvic tumors of probable non-genital origin, where unnecessary laparotomy or laparoscopy can be avoided. The adequacy of tru-cut biopsy is mainly influenced by indication group, histology, site of biopsy and approach. Our analysis can help in counseling the patient before the procedure and helps to explain the possible causes of failure of the procedure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.8803", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140200430", "source": "openalex"}

The comparison focuses on operative times, surgical outcomes, and surgical complications associated with the various surgical techniques. PubMed was the main search engine utilized in search of study data. The review included studies of various designs that included at least 25 women who had undergone robotic gynecologic surgery. Fifty-five studies (42 comparative and 13 non-comparative) met eligibility criteria. After careful analysis, we found that robotic surgery was consistently connected to shorter post-surgical hospitalization when compared to open surgery, a difference less significant when compared to laparoscopic surgery. Also, it seems that robotic surgery is highly feasible in gynecology. There are quite a few inconsistencies regarding operative times and estimated blood loss between the different approaches, though in the majority of studies estimated blood loss was lower in the robotic surgery group. The high variance in operative times resulted from the difference in surgeon's experience. The decision whether robotic surgery should become mainstream in gynecological surgery or remain another surgical technique in the gynecological surgeon's toolbox requires quite a few more randomized controlled clinical trials. In any case, in order to bring robotic surgery down to the front row of surgery, training surgeons is by far the most important goal for the next few years.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5041/rmmj.10296", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2609122573", "source": "openalex"}

Because children are frequently sent to gynecologists, traumatized by a rectal examination as the first part of the evaluation, or sent for an x-ray of the vagina with the hope of excluding a radiopaque foreign body, we believed it would be useful to present our approach to the gynecologic evaluation of the prepubertal child in which the kneechest position is used for visualizing the vagina. METHODS The evaluation of a prepubertal child with vulvovaginitis in the Gynecology Clinic of Children's Hospital is done in the following order: (1) history; (2) inspection of the perineum with the child supine; (3) visualization of the vagina and cervix in kneechest position; (4) cultures; and (5) a rectal examination in girls with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. The knee-chest position (Figure) provides a particularly good view of the vagina and cervix without instrumentation.

Before surgery, pelvic ultrasound examination was performed and serum levels of tumor marker CA 125 were measured in all women. Adnexal masses were classified according to the IOTA ADNEX model. Histopathological diagnosis was the gold standard. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the model to classify tumors into different histological types.Of 131 women, 63 (48.1%) had a benign ovarian tumor, 16 (12.2%) had a BOT, 17 (13.0%) had Stage I OC, 24 (18.3%) had Stage II-IV OC and 11 (8.4%) had ovarian metastasis.

The two FDA‐approved LBP currently in use include ThinPrep (TP), (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA) and SurePath (SP), (BD Diagnostic, Burlington, NC). Split‐sample and direct‐to‐vial studies have shown that LBPs show an overall improvement in sample collection and processing, reduce artifacts that interfere in diagnosis, are more sensitive, can be utilized for ancillary tests and are a cost‐effective replacement for CPS. Comparative analyses of diagnostic accuracy indicate that LBPs perform at least as well as CPS. However, the added advantages of standardized, automated preparations and screening, reduced unsatisfactory rate, improved specimen adequacy and ability to perform human papillomavirus (HPV) test, are enough to continue use of LBP. The cytologic features in LBP are similar to CPS with subtle differences, particularly in background information. There are also subtle differences between the two LBPs, SP and TP, which are reflective of different sampling devices, collection media, and processing techniques. Architecturally, LBP shows smaller cell clusters and sheets and more dyscohesion. Cytologically, enhanced nuclear features and smaller cell size are more prominent. Advances in liquid‐based Papanicolaou's (Pap) test have lead to well‐defined patient management guidelines by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.

This prospective study investigated whether the intermediate or definite stages of BV are risk factors for postoperative infection after major gynecologic surgery. Methods Vaginal cultures were obtained preoperatively from 175 women undergoing gynecologic surgery. The diagnostic criteria for BV were based on Nugent's standardized method of Gram stain interpretation. Postoperative fever was defined as at least one temperature equal to 101.0°F or greater, or two or more temperatures more than 6 hours apart equal to 100.4°F or greater. Results Thirty-six percent of the positive-BV group developed a postoperative fever, compared with 20% of the Lactobacillus-predominant group and 12% of the intermediate-BV group (P = 0.017). The differences between the positive-BV group and the Lactobacillus-predominant group, and between the positive-BV group and the intermediate-BV group, with respect to postoperative fever, were statistically significant (P = 0.045 and P = 0.007, respectively). The difference between the intermediate-BV group and the Lactobacillus-predominant group was not statistically significant (P = 0.28). Conclusions Although the association between BV and postoperative febrile morbidity could be a spurious result of confounding with other variables, it may be prudent for the surgeon to identify patients with BV and treat them preoperatively.

Vulvodynia is represented by pain, or an unpleasant altered sensation, in the vulva. Women with vestibulodynia are likely to have other additional pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic fatigue syndrome. Recent data reported that vestibulodynia affects 25% of women with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. Conclusions Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is a complex pathology often associated with vulvodynia, endometriosis and pelvic floor dysfunctions. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to obtain an accurate evaluation ruling out confusable disease, such as pudendal neuropathy. The optimal approach is a combined treatment oriented not only to treat the bladder, but also the other components responsible for the pain disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12379", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1639075133", "source": "openalex"}

Participation in research studies can have many benefits for patients. In randomized and controlled clinical studies, they can receive the best possible medical care currently available. However, only a small proportion of patients nowadays are treated within the framework of medical research. The primary endpoint of this study was to discover what level of knowledge patients have about clinical studies and how they currently perceive them, in order to identify ways of optimizing the information provided about studies from the patients' point of view. The study included 2546 patients (breast cancer 21.6 %, gynecological cancer 8.3 %, obstetrics 32.7 %, endometriosis 7.8 %, fertility treatment 3.2 %, other benign gynecological illnesses 19.2 %, no information for 7.2 %) in the outpatient clinic (45.2 %) and in the in-patient sector (54.8 %) at the Department of Gynecology at Erlangen University Hospital and associated centers. In the single-center study, conducted between January 2011 and January 2012, the patients were asked about their level of knowledge regarding the background to medical research studies and the ways in which they are carried out and used. The patients were also asked how they perceived medical studies and how they thought study conditions might be optimized. The three-page questionnaire was included in the feedback sheet received by patients as part of the hospital's quality management system. As a whole, the group only had moderate knowledge about clinical studies. A majority of the respondents considered that studies were valuable (91.6 %), but only a few were also willing to take part in them (58.4 %). Knowledge and willingness to participate strongly depended on age (P < 0.001), educational level (P < 0.001) and patient group (P < 0.001). Most patients would prefer to decide about participating in studies through a discussion with their outpatient physicians. The information that patients have about clinical studies affects whether they participate in them. It is therefore extremely important for patients to be well informed, for their anxieties about participation to be relieved, and for the benefits of participation to be explained to them.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-015-1584-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099065855", "source": "openalex"}

The primary gynecologic NENs constitute 2% of gynecologic malignancies, and the cervix is the most common site of NEN in the gynecologic tract. The updated WHO classification of gynecologic NEN is based on the Ki-67 index, mitotic index, and tumor characteristics such as necrosis, and brings more uniformity in the terminology of NENs like other disease sites. Imaging plays a crucial role in the staging, triaging, restaging, and surveillance of NENs. The expression of the somatostatin receptors on the surface of neuroendocrine cells forms the basis of increasing evaluation with functional imaging modalities using traditional and new tracers, including 68Ga-DOTA-Somatostatin Analog-PET/CT. Management of NENs involves a multidisciplinary approach. New targeted therapies could improve the paradigm of care for these rare malignancies.

Pain score at rest assessed by a numerical rating scale at 0.5 h after surgery was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included pain score at 1 and 24 h post‐operatively, duration of post‐anesthesia care units stay ( PACU ), incidence of post‐operative nausea and vomiting, incidence of shivering, and post‐operative quality of recovery score ( QoR ‐40) within the first 24 h post‐operatively. Results No patients received rescue analgesia. The pain score at 0.5 h post‐operatively was less in group PR when compared with group SR (0.7 ± 1.4 vs. 2.1 ± 1.8; P = 0.010) or group SPR (0.7 ± 1.4 vs. 2.1 ± 2.2; P = 0.008).

Data for Dade County were analyzed in this study, which was based on the tumor registry data from the Florida Cancer Data System from 1981–1989. The stages at diagnosis were classified as in situ, local, regional, and distant according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology coding rules. Results. The percentage of early stage diagnoses (in situ and local stage) was significantly lower among blacks and Hispanic whites than among non-Hispanic whites, but only for breast and cervical cancer. There was a significant increase in the percentage of early stage diagnoses of breast cancer among all three groups during 1981–1989, whereas this increase was found only in Hispanic whites for cervical cancer. The percentage of in situ cervical cancers was much lower in women older than age 45, especially among women older than age 65, in all three groups. Conclusions.

Although determining the site of origin of a pelvic disease process can be difficult, several imaging signs can help differentiate an intra- from an extraperitoneal mass. These signs include displacement of the pelvic ureter, effacement or encasement of external iliac vessels, effacement of pelvic sidewall musculature, and displacement of the rectum. Depending on its exact location, an extraperitoneal mass can displace the pelvic ureter medially or anteriorly (compared with the lateral or posterolateral displacement caused by an ovarian mass), encase and obliterate the external iliac vessels, efface and compress the external iliac vein, abut and eventually efface the obturator internus muscle, or displace the rectum anteriorly or anterolaterally.

A link between alterations of microbiota composition (dysbiosis) and cancer development has been recently demonstrated. In particular, the composition and the oncogenic role of intestinal bacterial flora has been extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies focusing on gastrointestinal tumors. Overall, the development of gastrointestinal tumors is favored by dysbiosis as it leads to depletion of antitumor substances (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) produced by healthy microbiota. Moreover, dysbiosis leads to alterations of the gut barrier, promotes a chronic inflammatory status through activation of toll-like receptors, and causes metabolic and hormonal dysregulations. However, the effects of these imbalances are not limited to the gastrointestinal tract and they can influence gynecological tumor carcinogenesis as well. The purpose of this Review is to provide a synthetic update about the mechanisms of interaction between gut microbiota and the female reproductive tract favoring the development of neoplasms.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigate the association between FGM/C and painful gynecologic and obstetric complications in women affected by the practice.We performed a comprehensive literature search from inception to December 19, 2019 of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, The Cochrane Library (Wiley), and POPLINE (prior to its retirement) for studies mentioning FGM/C. Two reviewers independently screened studies reporting prevalences of painful gynecologic and obstetric sequelae resulting from FGM/C. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) for outcomes obtained from cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control designs. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess and control for effect differences introduced by study design. Validated appraisal tools were utilized to assess quality and risk of bias. Our study was registered with PROSPERO. Two reviewers independently screened 6,666 abstracts. Of 559 full-text studies assessed for eligibility, 116 met eligibility criteria, which included studies describing the incidence or prevalence of painful sequelae associated with FGM/C. Pooled analyses after adjustment for study design found that FGM/C was associated with dyspareunia (6,283 FGM/C and 3,382 non-FGM/C participants; pooled OR: 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-4.21; I2: 79%; p-value < 0.01), perineal tears (4,898 FGM/C and 4,229 non-FGM/C participants; pooled OR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.35-5.11; I2: 67%; p-value = 0.01), dysuria (3,686 FGM/C and 3,482 non-FGM/C participants; pooled OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.17-1.75; I2: 0%; p-value = 0.01), episiotomy (29,341 FGM/C and 39,260 non-FGM/C participants; pooled OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.26-2.82; I2: 96%; p-value < 0.01), and prolonged labor (7,516 FGM/C and 8,060 non-FGM/C participants; pooled OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.27-3.28; I2: 90%; p-value < 0.01).

Objective.—In this study, the performance of participants in interpreting ThinPrep (TP) preparations was compared with participants' performance on conventional Papanicolaou tests in the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Cervicovaginal Cytology (PAP). Design.—The results of the PAP from the year 2002 were reviewed, and the discordancies to series and exact-match error rates for the 2 cytologic methods were compared. Results.—For this study, a total of 89 815 interpretations from conventional smears and 20 886 interpretations from TP samples were analyzed. Overall, interpretations of TP preparations had both significantly fewer false-positive (1.6%) and false-negative (1.3%) rates than those of conventional smears (P = .001 and P = .02, respectively) for validated or validated-equivalent slides, as assessed by concordance with the correct diagnostic series. In this assessment of concordance to series, interpretations of educational TP and conventional preparations were similar, except for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, in which the performance was significantly worse for educational TP preparations (false-negative rate of 8.1% vs 4.1% for conventional smears, P &amp;lt; .001). When interpretations were matched to the exact diagnosis, validated-equivalent TP preparations were generally more accurate for diagnoses in the 100 series and 200 series than were conventional smears. Notably, for the reference diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, the exact-match error rate on validated equivalent TP slides was significantly greater than that of conventional slides (44.5% vs 23.1%, P &amp;lt; .001). Interpretations of educational TP preparations also had a significantly higher error rate in matching to the exact reference diagnosis for squamous cell carcinoma (33.7% vs 22.8%, P = .007). Conclusions.—Overall, TP preparations in this program were associated with significantly lower error rates than conventional smears for both validated and educational cases. However, unlike the negative for intraepithelial lesion and malignancy, not otherwise specified, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and adenocarcinoma cytodiagnostic challenges, participants' responses indicated some difficulty in recognizing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and squamous cell carcinoma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5858/2004-128-17-copoca", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4229935186", "source": "openalex"}

Favorable prognostic factors for a prolonged survival were good performance status of the patients, long disease-free interval, absence of other systemic disease, and the resectability, preferably with a clear margin. These factors should be considered as the criteria for surgery. In well-selected patients, survival could be extended from the surgical procedure with minimal complications.

METHODS A prospective, multi‐institutional cooperative group trial was performed in women with recurrent, measurable ovarian stromal tumors. Patients were allowed to have unlimited prior therapy, excluding bevacizumab. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg was administered intravenously on day 1 of every 21‐day cycle until patients developed disease progression or adverse effects that prohibited further treatment. The primary endpoint was the response rate (RR). Inhibin A and B levels were measured before each cycle, and the values were examined in relation to response and progression. RESULTS Thirty‐six patients were enrolled, and all were eligible and evaluable. Patients received a median of 9 cycles of treatment (range, 2‐37 cycles). Six patients (16.7%) had partial responses (90% confidence interval, 7.5%‐30.3%), 28 patients (77.8%) had stable disease, and 2 patients (5.6%) had progressive disease. This met the criterion for declaring the regimen active. The median progression‐free survival was 9.3 months, and the median overall survival was not reached in during reporting period. Two grade 4 toxicities occurred, including hypertension and proteinuria; and the most common grade 3 toxicities were hypertension (n = 5) and pain (n = 5). Inhibin A and B values were lower in patients who responded to treatment. CONCLUSIONS Bevacizumab has activity in the treatment of recurrent sex cord‐stromal tumors of the ovary, and its toxicity is acceptable. Further investigation is warranted.

Hormone treatment for gynecological cancers involves the use of medications that reduce the level of hormones or inhibit their biological activity, thereby stopping or slowing cancer growth. Hormone treatment works by preventing hormones from causing cancer cells to multiply. Aromatase inhibitors, anti-estrogens, progestin, estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists, GnRH agonists, and progestogen are effectively used as therapeutics for vulvar cancer, cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, uterine cancer, and ovarian cancer. Hormone replacement therapy has a high success rate. In particular, progestogen and estrogen replacement are associated with a decreased incidence of gynecological cancers in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). The activation of estrogen via the transcriptional functionality of ERα may either be promoted or decreased by gene products of HPV. Hormonal treatment is frequently administered to patients with hormone-sensitive recurring or metastatic gynecologic malignancies, although response rates and therapeutic outcomes are inconsistent. Therefore, this review outlines the use of hormonal therapy for gynecological cancers and identifies the current knowledge gaps.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14030759", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210659779", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the current use of antibiotic prophylaxis, the rate of postoperative infections, and risk factors for postoperative infections in patients undergoing elective hysterectomy for non‐malignant pathology. Methods. The study was performed during the time period July 2000 to 1 January 1 2003, using data from the Swedish National Register for Gynecologic Surgery, covering 26 of 49 clinics and approximately 50% of the Swedish population. During this time period, 3267 women undergoing elective hysterectomy for non‐malignant pathology (mainly dysfunctional bleeding and fibromas) and with complete data on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and postoperative follow up were included. A postoperative infection was considered to have developed if patients or the physician reported an infection related to the surgical site, together with reported use of antibiotic treatment. Results. Among the 3267 patients, 341 (10.4%) were considered to have developed a postoperative infection. In cases where antibiotic prophylaxis had not been given, total abdominal hysterectomies and vaginal hysterectomies were associated with the highest frequency for postoperative infections P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively. Notably, also women undergoing subtotal hysterectomy reported significantly lower rates of postoperative infections if prophylactic antibiotics had been given, P &lt; 0.05. Risk factors for postoperative infection were non‐use of antibiotic prophylaxis, hospital, age less than 40 years, and BMI &gt; 30 kg/m 2 . Conclusions. The study results have indicated the need of prospective clinical trials on antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing supravaginal abdominal hysterectomy. Also, a need to further evaluate the current prophylactic antibiotic protocols used for obese patients and younger women undergoing any kind of hysterectomy is warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00609.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037860868", "source": "openalex"}

Gray scale findings were recorded as either \"diagnostic\" or \"nondiagnostic.\" Color flow assessment was performed on intratumor vessels or ovarian and/or uterine arteries. Flow was recorded as either \"absent\" or \"present.\" Spectral analysis allowed determination of the systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities and calculation of the pulsatility and resistance indices. Malignancy was then predicted based upon color flow findings alone, with malignant tumors demonstrating increased color flow and a pulsatility index of at most 1.0 or a resistance index of at most 0.4. Color flow Doppler findings were then recorded as \"giving additional useful information\" that either confirmed questionable gray scale findings or changed the gray scale sonographic diagnosis, or as \"not giving additional information\" over the gray scale diagnosis.Two hundred thirty-one patients had gray scale sonography, and 167 also had color flow Doppler performed. Gray scale sonographic findings were sufficient to make a diagnosis in 156 (93%) of the scans. Color flow Doppler findings added useful information in 49 scans (30%). Increased color flow was highly significant (P < .0001), as was the calculated pulsatility index (P < .02) and resistance index (P < .008), in distinguishing benign from malignant tumors. Ovarian and uterine artery and intratumor assessments of the systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities were not significantly different between the benign and malignant tumors. Regression analysis confirmed the presence or absence of color flow as an independent predictor of malignancy or benignity (P < .0001).Our large study confirms the overall accuracy of gray scale scanning. When used alone, color flow Doppler--although specific--lacks sensitivity and predictive value as an independent predictor of malignancy. When findings were combined with those obtained from gray scale scanning, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were improved to acceptable levels. Significant differences existed between benign and malignant tumors for calculated pulsatility index and resistance index, but neither was sufficiently sensitive, specific, or predictive to be used alone as sole criteria of malignancy prediction. Other flow indices studied (systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities) in general did not differ significantly between groups. Physicians should be cautioned against using color flow findings alone for clinical decision making.

Methods: A model was constructed to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with the use of external pneumatic compression, unfractionated heparin, and low molecular weight heparin in women with cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. We estimated cost per DVT prevented, per fatal pulmonary embolus (PE) prevented, and per life-year saved. Probability estimates for various outcomes and efficacies were obtained from the literature, using data specific for gynecologic patients when available. Results: Cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from $27 per life-year saved for a 55-year-old endometrial cancer patient to $5132 per life-year saved for a 65-year-old with ovarian cancer. Although low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin were cost-effective compared with no prophylaxis, each was less effective than external pneumatic compression in the base case. The results of the analysis were sensitive to assumptions about the relative risk of DVT, the life expectancy of the patient, the costs of future treatment, and the relative effectiveness of the different strategies: If unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin is at least 2–3% more effective than external pneumatic compression, then the incremental cost per life-year of either would be less than $50,000 compared with external pneumatic compression. Conclusion: Prophylaxis of DVT is cost-effective in terms of life-years gained even for patients with relatively short life expectancies, such as ovarian cancer patients. External pneumatic compression appears to be the most cost-effective strategy under our baseline assumptions, but further studies in gynecologic cancer are needed to validate our conclusions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(99)00563-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145708493", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the availability of transvaginal sonography at the time of initial assessment of the emergency gynecology patient. Methods This was a prospective observational study carried out over a 5‐month period in the acute gynecology unit of an inner London teaching hospital. Women were assessed in the routine manner by history‐taking and clinical examination and questionnaires were completed by the doctors, including details of the intention to treat. Transvaginal ultrasound examinations were then performed and a second diagnosis and management plan were made utilizing the extra information from the scan. The plans for clinical management before and after the ultrasound examination were compared. Results We originally recruited 1000 consecutive women to the study. The mean age was 31.1 (SD, 9.81) years. Complete data were available for 920 (92%). 84 (9.1%) women did not require a scan. Of the 521 women with a positive pregnancy test, 75.6% were reassured immediately that their pregnancy was intrauterine. 143 women (27.4%) were given the diagnosis of a suspected ectopic pregnancy before sonography, compared with 29 (5.6%) after. Following the ultrasound examination there was a change in clinical management in 54.1% of the women with a positive pregnancy test and a reduction in admissions (including inpatient theater admissions) (from 40.3% to 17.1%) and outpatient follow‐up examinations (from 41.1% to 35.5%). In 90 (23.8%) non‐pregnant women a significant ovarian cyst (&gt; 5 cm) was suspected clinically; 28/90 (31.1%) were confirmed on sonography. Following the ultrasound examination there was a change in clinical management for 38.1% of non‐pregnant women and a reduction in admissions (from 37.1% to 19.4%) and outpatient follow‐up examinations (from 25.7% to 18.1%). Conclusion It appears that the availability of transvaginal sonography at the time of initial assessment of emergency gynecology patients improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces unnecessary admissions and follow‐up examinations.

Many gynecologic procedures may benefit from the use of real-time ultrasonography. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current use of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecologic procedures.Evaluation and assessment of the value of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecological procedures is essentially non-existent. The role of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecology is in its infancy, with anecdotal experience and literature involving predominantly case reports. Intraoperative ultrasound is helpful in laparoscopic myomectomy, particularly when the uterine contour is normal. It is also useful in defining pelvic anatomy in cases of complex reproductive procedures. Intraoperative ultrasound improves precision in characterizing ovarian lesions, particularly in the setting of endometriomas or dermoid cysts. It has been shown to decrease both operative time and complication rates in dilation and curettage procedures. Intraoperative ultrasound reduces recurrence and re-operation rates after hysteroscopy by facilitating more-complete resection of uterine myomas. Ultrasound guidance improves the efficiency of embryo transfer in in-vitro fertilization and could potentially be beneficial in other 'blind' gynecological procedures.Intraoperative ultrasound appears to be a safe and valuable tool for the gynecologic surgeon. Ultrasound improves visualization of anatomy, reduces complication and re-operation rates, and facilitates completion of more cases via less-invasive endoscopic approaches.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.gco.0000175349.10684.e8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980658418", "source": "openalex"}

The differentially expressed lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) were also analyzed to predict their functions in disease development. Genome-wide profiling of lncRNA expression patterns revealed that many lncRNAs were abnormally expressed between sera and tissuesof the patient samples. A set of aberrant differentially expressed lncRNAs were further validated in a validation cohort of 110 serum and 24 tissue samples. Functional analysis predicted that differentially expressed lncRNAs may participate in disease development through crosstalk between the ceRNAs of miRNAs and may be involved in a range of cellular pathways including steroid or hormone responses. We also found a unique set of lncRNAs that were associated with disease severity and progression and their diagnostic values were also investigated.

We sought to determine whether tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) typing along with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MLH1 methylation analysis can help identify women with LS. Patients and Methods ECs from GOG210 patients were assessed for MSI, MLH1 methylation, and mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression. Each tumor was classified as having normal MMR, defective MMR associated with MLH1 methylation, or probable MMR mutation (ie, defective MMR but no methylation). Cancer family history and demographic and clinical features were compared for the three groups. Lynch mutation testing was performed for a subset of women. Results Analysis of 1,002 ECs suggested possible MMR mutation in 11.8% of tumors. The number of patients with a family history suggestive of LS was highest among women whose tumors were classified as probable MMR mutation (P = .001). Lynch mutations were identified in 41% of patient cases classified as probable mutation (21 of 51 tested). One of the MSH6 Lynch mutations was identified in a patient whose tumor had intact MSH6 expression.

Conclusion Combined MSI, methylation, and IHC analysis may prove useful in Lynch screening in EC. Twenty-four percent of mutation carriers presented with ECs at age &gt; 60 years, and one carrier had an MSI-positive tumor with no IHC defect. Restricting Lynch testing to women diagnosed at age &lt; 60 years or to women with IHC defects could result in missing a substantial fraction of genetic disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2015.63.9518", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165092254", "source": "openalex"}

This may reflect the fact that the main tumor types—ovarian, uterine, and cervical—are a highly heterogeneous group of cancers with variable response to standard chemotherapies and the lack of models in which to study the diversity of these cancers. Cancer-derived cell lines fail to adequately recapitulate molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subsets and complex microenvironments, which may be critical for sensitivity to targeted therapies. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from fresh human tumor without prior in vitro culture, combined with whole genome expression, gene copy number, and sequencing analyses, could dramatically aid the development of novel therapies for gynecologic malignancies. Gynecologic tumors can be engrafted in immunodeficient mice with a high rate of success and within a reasonable time frame. The resulting PDX accurately recapitulates the patient's tumor with respect to histologic, molecular, and in vivo treatment response characteristics. Orthotopic PDX develop complications relevant to the clinic, such as ascites and bowel obstruction, providing opportunities to understand the biology of these clinical problems.

One of the most studied angiogenic growth factors is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is overexpressed in several cancers. It has been recently described that neurotrophins could regulate angiogenesis through direct and indirect mechanisms. Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) and neurotrophins 3 and 4/5 (NT 3, NT 4/5). These molecules and their high affinity receptors (TRKs) regulate the development, maintenance and plasticity of the nervous system. Furthermore, it was recently described that they display essential functions in non-neuronal tissues, such as reproductive organs among others. Studies have shown that several types of cancer overexpress neurotrophins such as NGF and BDNF, which might contribute to tumor progression and angiogenesis. Besides, in recent years the FDA has approved the use of pharmacologic inhibitors of pan-TRK receptors in patients with TRKs fusion-positive cancers. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which neurotrophins stimulate tumor progression and angiogenesis, with emphasis on gynecological cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2019.00913", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2972235392", "source": "openalex"}

EMLA (an eutectic mixture of the local anesthetics, lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%), which is the best-studied topical anesthetic, produces effective analgesia for superficial surgical procedures after application for 5 to 10 minutes and has been extensively studied in various procedures including removal of genital warts, vulval biopsy, laser treatment of CIN lesions, and hysteroscopy. EMLA is well tolerated and provides good pain relief for procedures involving the surface tissues such as removal of genital warts and hysteroscopy. For procedures involving deeper tissues, EMLA reduces the pain of local anesthetic injection. Other topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine gel and spray, benzocaine 20% gel, mepivacaine solution, tetracaine solution, and cocaine spray, have been less extensively studied in these indications, and benefits seem to be limited.

Randomization was well balanced for age, performance status, and prior therapy. Both platinum analogs were given every 28 days with starting doses of 400 mg/m2 for carboplatin (340 mg/m2 if the patient underwent prior radiation) and 270 mg/m2 for iproplatin (230 mg/m2 if the patient underwent prior radiation). These doses are equivalent to cisplatin doses of 75 to 100 mg/m2. Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting, among which thrombocytopenia was slightly more common than leukopenia. Gastrointestinal toxicity was also prominent with both agents; however, iproplatin was significantly more toxic than carboplatin (P less than .001). Renal, otic, and peripheral nervous system toxicities were absent or infrequent with both analogs. No electrolyte abnormalities were observed. The percentage of planned dosages that were actually administered was 100% of carboplatin doses and 85% of iproplatin doses (P less than .0001). The reduction in iproplatin dose was apparently due to gastrointestinal toxicity.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4210281247", "title": "Medical Cannabis for Gynecologic Pain Conditions", "text": "OBJECTIVE: The endocannabinoid system is involved in pain perception and inflammation. Cannabis contains delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which are cannabinoids that bind to endocannabinoid system receptors. A fatty acid amide called palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) enhances endogenous cannabinoids. Given that use of medical cannabis is increasing, we sought to characterize patterns of cannabis use for gynecologic pain and its effectiveness as an analgesic. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov using terms for “woman,” “cannabis,” and “pain” or “pelvic pain” or “endometriosis” or “bladder pain” or “cancer.” The search was restricted to English-language articles published between January 1990 and April 2021 and excluded animal studies. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The initial search yielded 5,189 articles with 3,822 unique citations. Studies were included if they evaluated nonpregnant adult women who used cannabinoids for gynecologic pain conditions (eg, chronic pelvic pain, vulvodynia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, malignancy). Study types included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies. Covidence systematic review software was used. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies were considered for full review, and 16 met inclusion criteria. Prevalence of cannabis use ranged from 13% to 27%. Most women ingested or inhaled cannabis and used cannabis multiple times per week, with dosages of THC and CBD up to 70 mg and 2,000 mg, respectively. Sixty-one to 95.5% reported pain relief. All six prospective cohort studies and one RCT of PEA-combination medications reported significant pain relief, and the average decrease in pain after 3 months of treatment was 3.35±1.39 on the 10-point visual analog scale. However, one fatty acid amide enzyme inhibitor RCT did not show pain reduction. CONCLUSION: Survey data showed that most women reported that cannabis improved pain from numerous gynecologic conditions. Cohort studies and an RCT using PEA-combination medications reported pain reduction. However, interpretation of the studies is limited due to varying cannabis formulations, delivery methods, and dosages that preclude a definitive statement about cannabis for gynecologic pain relief.

Gynecological disorders can have adverse effects on a woman’s quality of life. Most hysterectomies are thus performed to enhance women’s quality of life rather than to save life. This study aims at evaluating the long‐term impact of hysterectomy on this outcome variable. Methods. The quality of life in 111 women undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons was tested before, and six and twelve months after, the operation. A control‐group of non‐hysterectomized women from the normal population was tested once. Ferrans &amp; Powers’ Quality of Life Index, consisting of four life domains, was used. This index has a pre‐set highest possible obtainable score. For the subjects with a high pre‐test score, there was little scope for further measurable improvement after hysterectomy, which gives a false stability in the material. A method for calculating the relative differences was introduced. Results. The health and functioning domain of the quality of life among women awaiting hysterectomy is significantly lower compared to that of the control‐group ( p &lt;.01) Both six and twelve months after the hysterectomy, the patients have reached the same level of their health and functioning as the control‐group.

One-hundred fifty-eight women received either ondansetron (4 mg) or droperidol (20 micro g/kg) intravenously during induction of anesthesia. Nausea was measured at three intervals: at admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 1 h after admission to the PACU, and on Postoperative Day 1. The incidence of vomiting was tabulated in the PACU and on Postoperative Day 1. Sedation was assessed 1 h after admission to the PACU. No differences in nausea, sedation, or number of patients vomiting in the PACU were found. More patients in the ondansetron group reported vomiting on Postoperative Day 1 than subjects in the droperidol group (25 vs 11). No difference in opiate use was found among patients who vomited. We conclude that droperidol is equivalent to ondansetron for the prophylactic treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy, and that significant cost savings can be appreciated if droperidol is used. Implications: Either ondansetron or droperidol, frequently used antiemetics, was given to women before they underwent gynecologic laparoscopy. No difference in the number of women experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting or their level of sedation was found.

Factors influencing access to treatment for adverse effects were analyzed qualitatively.Survivors sought care through specialty clinic visits when regular post-treatment gynecological follow-ups were inadequate or when symptoms seemed to be non-treatment related. Information provided by hospital staff during initial treatment influenced patients' understanding and response to adverse effects. Lack of knowledge and inaccurate symptom interpretation delayed help-seeking, exacerbating symptoms. Gynecologists' attitudes during follow-ups frequently led survivors to cope with symptoms on their own. Information from mass media, Internet, and support groups helped patients understand symptoms and facilitated care seeking.Post-treatment adverse effects are often untreated during follow-up visits.

The data indicate that analysis of single cell cycle stimulating or inhibiting proteins partly produces unexpected, apparently paradoxical results, and cell‐cycle regulatory pathways should be regarded as a whole in order to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to abnormal tumor cell proliferation.

PD-1- and PD-L1-targeting antibodies are being combined with many novel agents including anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, PARP inhibitors, targeted agents, and traditional chemotherapy in promising studies with the hopes of increasing the immune response and overcoming resistance by targeting other pathways. Novel immune techniques including vaccines and adoptive cell therapies are also being implemented in gynecological cancers.

Several reports in the literature, however, have described such expression in a variable proportion of nonmammary and nongynecologic carcinomas. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of ER and PR on tissue microarray sections representing 348 nonbreast or gynecologic and nongynecologic tumors of lung, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, colonic, renal, or bladder origin. We also performed a pooled analysis of the published literature in this regard. Except for 1 (2.5%) out of 40 pancreatic adenocarcinomas that expressed PR, there was no ER or PR expression in any of the other tumors evaluated by immunohistochemistry. A pooled literature review demonstrated that most of the evaluated tumors express ER and/or PR in up to 3% of cases, whereas some lung and bladder carcinomas showed such expression in around 10% of cases. This literature review also demonstrated that the frequency of ER and PR expression was dependent on the antibody clone used. Given that ER and PR expression can occasionally be seen in carcinomas of nonmammary/nongynecologic origin, we conclude that the diagnosis of metastatic breast, ovarian or endometrial carcinoma in a carcinoma of unknown primary should not be based solely on such expression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pai.0b013e31819faa07", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979932106", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Fifteen focus groups were conducted with women aged 40–60 years in Miami, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Results: Most participants said they had heard of cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers but were unfamiliar with vaginal and vulvar cancers. The misconception that the Pap test screens for multiple gynecologic cancers was prevalent and engendered a false sense of security in some women. An annual Pap screening interval was most familiar to participants; some mentioned a shorter screening interval for high-risk women; few mentioned an extended screening interval. A few participants thought the pelvic examination could detect a variety of conditions, including ovarian cancer. Some knew that the human papillomavirus (HPV) could cause cervical cancer, but no other risk factors for specific cancers were mentioned with any consistency. Although some recognized unexplained vaginal bleeding as a symptom of cervical cancer, participants generally were unfamiliar with gynecologic cancer symptoms. Participants reported learning about the discussion topics from a variety of sources, including the mass media. Conclusions: Participants lacked critical knowledge needed to understand their gynecologic cancer risk and seek appropriate care. Pap tests and routine examinations offer ideal opportunities to educate women about the purpose of the Pap test as well as risk factors and symptoms associated with various gynecologic cancers.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with platinum-pretreated advanced ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to two arms: 41 received paclitaxel at 175 mg/m 2 over 3 hours every 3 weeks, and 45 received oxaliplatin at 130 mg/m 2 over 2 hours every 3 weeks. For inclusion, patients had to have a performance status of 0 to 2 and to have received at least one and no more than two prior cisplatin- and/or carboplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens within the last 12 months. RESULTS: Seven confirmed responses were observed in each arm, for an overall response rate in the total treated population of 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7% to 32%) in the paclitaxel arm and 16% (95% CI, 7% to 29%) in the oxaliplatin arm.

For uterine cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is employed for high risk epithelial subtypes with early disease, such as uterine papillary serous carcinomas, uterine carcinosarcomas and leiomyosarcomas, advanced stage cases, as well as recurrent disease. The review then proceeds to further discuss the appropriate treatment based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics prognostic scoring system for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Finally, chemotherapy is utilized in cervical cancer as neo‐adjuvant therapy prior to surgery or radiation, as a sensitizer concomitantly with radiation therapy or for the treatment of advanced and recurrent disease.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W196136494", "title": "The role of colposcopy in modern gynecology.", "text": "The purpose of this review is to demonstrate that colposcopy, introduced in 1925--which is, notably before the development of great technological advances in modern gynecology--continues to be a valid technique without essential innovations to the original method described at the beginning of the last century. Colposcopy was developed in Germany during the rise of Nazism with the Second World War being an important barrier for the spread and diffusion of the technique. Colposcopy, however, continued to progress in a few countries such as Spain, Italy, Brazil, France and Switzerland. When colposcopy was introduced in the United States during the 70s, its use was mostly restricted to specialists who were almost exclusively dedicated to cervical pathology and knowledgeable about cytopathology, anatomic pathology, and colposcopy and who were competent both in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical lesions. These circumstances were completely different from what happened in the majority of European countries where colposcopists were trained as gynecologists and their histocytological knowledge, which was focused on the lower genital tract, was somewhat more extensive than that acquired by specialists in gynecology. There are two clearly different trends in relation to the use of colposcopy with characteristic geographic distribution: countries with an Anglo-Saxon influence in which colposcopy is performed selectively, and countries with a German medical inheritance in which colposcopy is carried out routinely during a standard general gynecological consultation. However, this difference is not restrictive and by no means can it be stated that colposcopy is systematically being used by all European or Latin American gynecologists for reasons related to training in the colposcopic technique. In 1977, we introduced the concept of dynamic colposcopy with the aim of differentiating it from the descriptive immobility of the original classification of Hinselmann (1954) that had remained almost unchanged by his immediate followers. Briefly, the objective was to turn colposcopy into a diagnostic tool able to identify the pathological substrate corresponding to traditional colposcopic images. We established ten differential signs that allow us to classify an ATZ area as subsidiary or not to be biopsied. The classification system proposed in Rome (International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy [IFCPC], 1990) supports our original concept because by identifying major or minor changes in the original images, a diagnosis of the severity of the lesion can be established. With regard to specificity, the figures range between 48% and 10% with 96% for sensitivity. Obviously, a wide range of colposcopic specificity must be related to the expected efficacy of the method. When after biopsy of an atypical colposcopic image, only a low-grade lesion is detected, should this be considered a false positive colposcopic result? Although histopathologic findings are accepted as the \"gold standard\"...it is well known that a certain degree of subjectivity can be present. Inter- and intra-observer differences (when the same pathologist is reviewing the diagnosis after a certain time lapse) may be present. It has been argued that microbiopsy under colposcopic control gives rise to a wide error range and that it cannot be considered representative of the lesion. It is likely that this situation may occur when colposcopy-guided biopsy is performed by inexperienced hands or when biopsy is limited to small and insufficient sampling. A very important colposcopic sign, such as complete visual inspection of the squamocolumnar junction is frequently missed. Any lesion with boundaries in the endocervix, cannot be simply assessed by means of microbiopsies from the ectocervix unless there is no doubt regarding the severity of the lesions. Microcolpohysteroscopy (MCH) may be of great value in these cases by showing the limits of endocervical involvement.According to the evidence presented here, it can be concluded that \"colposcopy is in good health\" and that probably the popularity of this technique in the field of gynecology would increase if cytopathologists and gynecologists' tasks were limited to their own fields rather than turning them into improvised specialists for their counterpart disciplines. The coordinating role of the gynecologist as a specialist for integral women's health should continue to be defended and in this respect, colposcopy should be considered a routine technique in daily practice.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W196136494", "source": "openalex"}

This article examines the reproductive and gynecological aspects of selecting, training, medically certifying, and flying women in space. Gynecological data from the astronaut selection cycles in 1991 to 1997 are reviewed. In addition, the reproductive implications of delaying childbearing for a career as an astronaut and the impact of new technology such as assisted reproductive techniques are examined. The reproductive outcomes of U.S. female astronauts after spaceflight are also presented. Because women have gained considerable operational experience on the Shuttle and Mir, the unique operational considerations for preflight certification, menstruation control and hygiene, contraception, and urination are discussed. Medical and surgical implications for women on long-duration missions to remote locations are still evolving, and enabling technologies for health care delivery are being developed. There has been considerable progress in the development of zero-gravity surgical techniques, including laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, and laparotomy. The concepts of prevention of illness, conversion of surgical conditions to medically treatable conditions, and surgical intervention for long-duration spaceflights are explored in detail.

Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader will be able to describe the various gynecological and reproductive issues for women involved in space travel and to explain how these issues can be managed, and also to be able to describe the appropriate evaluation for a woman entering the astronaut training program.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006254-200002000-00025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026713352", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2135024929", "title": "Antiprogestins in gynecological diseases", "text": "Antiprogestins constitute a group of compounds, developed since the early 1980s, that bind progesterone receptors with different affinities. The first clinical uses for antiprogestins were in reproductive medicine, e.g., menstrual regulation, emergency contraception, and termination of early pregnancies. These initial applications, however, belied the capacity for these compounds to interfere with cell growth. Within the context of gynecological diseases, antiprogestins can block the growth of and kill gynecological-related cancer cells, such as those originating in the breast, ovary, endometrium, and cervix. They can also interrupt the excessive growth of cells giving rise to benign gynecological diseases such as endometriosis and leiomyomata (uterine fibroids). In this article, we present a review of the literature providing support for the antigrowth activity that antiprogestins impose on cells in various gynecological diseases. We also provide a summary of the cellular and molecular mechanisms reported for these compounds that lead to cell growth inhibition and death. The preclinical knowledge gained during the past few years provides robust evidence to encourage the use of antiprogestins in order to alleviate the burden of gynecological diseases, either as monotherapies or as adjuvants of other therapies with the perspective of allowing for long-term treatments with tolerable side effects. The key to the clinical success of antiprogestins in this field probably lies in selecting those patients who will benefit from this therapy. This can be achieved by defining the genetic makeup required – within each particular gynecological disease – for attaining an objective response to antiprogestin-driven growth inhibition therapy.

The aim of this study is to report the incidence and survival rates of the main gynecologic sarcomas using national English cancer registration data.Records of gynecologic sarcomas diagnosed between 1985 and 2008 were extracted from the English National Cancer Data Repository. ICD-O3 morphology codes were used to assign tumor records to specific histologic subgroups. Incidence and 5-year relative survival rates were calculated.There were 5316 new cases of gynecologic sarcoma diagnosed in England between 1985 and 2008. Incidence rates increased significantly in the early 1990s, probably due to coding changes. Age-specific incidence rates were highest in women aged between 45 and 64 years. In the most recent period studied (2001-2008), incidence rates fluctuated between 8 and 9.6 per million. The most common anatomical site was the uterus (83% of all diagnoses), and the most common histologic diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma (52% of all diagnoses). Overall 5-year relative survival increased significantly between 1985-1989 and 2000-2004, from 34% to 48%.Gynecologic sarcoma incidence rates have varied little since 1993, whereas survival has improved significantly. These results are consistent with previously published small series and case studies, and provide a more complete picture of gynecologic sarcoma incidence and survival patterns in England.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000443", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2332208369", "source": "openalex"}

There are many practical obstacles in teaching narrative skills and reflection to residents in surgical subspecialties. We aimed to assess the feasibility of designing and implementing a writing workshop series within an obstetrics and gynecology curriculum. Materials and Methods Between 2008 and 2009, a reflective writing workshop series was introduced into the didactic curriculum of an obstetrics and gynecology residency program. The course included reading fiction and creative writing. Workshops focused on topics residents identified. Residents answered a subjective questionnaire and also completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Interpersonal Reactivity Index to assess burnout and empathy. Results Six 1-hour reflective writing workshops took place within the dedicated didactic time for residents. Of the 20 residents in the program, 10 junior residents and 8 senior residents evaluated the workshops. Ten residents participated in more than one workshop, an average of 3.6 workshops. Residents felt that the workshops were enjoyable, and some felt that they influenced their experience of residency, but few felt that it affected their work with patients. Trends in Maslach Burnout Inventory and Interpersonal Reactivity Index scores did not show statistical significance. Conclusion A practical curriculum for introducing reflective practice to obstetrics and gynecology residents is described. This model may be useful to educators looking to incorporate reflective practice into residency curricula and lead to collaborative work that may assess the impact of this work on the experience of residents and their patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4300/jgme-d-10-00019.1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2050242189", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: The Society of Gynecologic Surgeons formed a work group to develop evidence-based guidelines. Published data from 1950 to November 27, 2007, from the companion systematic review were reviewed to develop guidelines on biologic and synthetic graft use compared with native tissue repair in vaginal prolapse repair. The work group formulated guidelines based on its overall assessment of the evidence. The approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations was based on a modification of the Grades for Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. RESULTS: It is suggested that native tissue repair remains appropriate when compared with biologic graft use. Nonabsorbable synthetic graft use may improve anatomic outcomes of anterior vaginal wall repair, but there are trade-offs in regard to additional risks. The group suggests issues that should be included in the preoperative counseling of patients in whom clinicians propose to use a vaginally placed graft. CONCLUSION: Based on the overall low quality of evidence, only weak recommendations could be provided. This highlights the need for practitioners to fully explain the relative merits of each alternative and carefully consider patients' values and preferences to arrive at an appropriate decision. Future research is likely to change the estimates in the net benefit and risk and the confidence around these assessments. Clinical practice guidelines for the potential use of transvaginal grafts compared with native tissue repairs for pelvic organ prolapse are provided.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e318189a8cc", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077455597", "source": "openalex"}

Sexually violent assaults alter a woman's affective as well as her gynecologic and physiologic life. The author determined the frequency of sexual dysfunction in 100 women: 30 rape victims, 35 abuse victims, and 30 case-matched controls. The sexual inventory evaluated for sexual fears, sexual desire, sexual arousal, and orgasm. To evaluate the impact of the abuse on the gynecologic health of the victims, the gynecologic examination and interview focused on pain, dyspareunia, vaginismus, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, vaginitis, and pelvic surgery. Over a period of two to four years after the violent event, 61% of the raped and abused women had some sexual dysfunction. Almost the same percentage had gynecologic problems. Studies of this nature are difficult because the victims are reluctant to participate and resistant to cooperate. Only 45% of the victims in the rape-crisis centers were willing to cooperate, while only 25% of those in the shelter for abused women were willing to provide a sexual history and consent to an interview and pelvic examination. Such factors need to be kept in mind when interpreting the data.This paper presents a longitudinal study on the sexuality and gynecologic health of abused women in the US. The study was conducted among 30 rape victims, 35 abuse victims, and 30 case-matched controls. All subjects underwent sexual and gynecologic evaluations, which was repeated every 6 months over a 4-year period. The sexual evaluations covered issues on sexual fears, desires, arousal, and orgasm, while gynecological evaluations examined disorders such as dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and vaginismus. Data analysis revealed that 61% of the abused women had sexual dysfunctions and gynecological problems over a period of 2-4 years after a violent event. On the other hand, a lesser percentage (31%) of sexual dysfunction and gynecological problems were noted among the control group. Study concludes that there is a need to explore the possibility of sexual abuse or partner-intimacy abuse for all women with a history of sexual dysfunction.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2147846408", "source": "openalex"}

We designed three concurrent randomized, open-label, multicenter, identical trials (with the exception of tumor type criteria of breast, gynecologic, or lung cancer) of darbepoetin alfa and epoetin alfa in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia to validate the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire for Anemia (PSQ-An) treatment tool and to compare the efficacies and safety profiles of these two agents. In each trial, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either darbepoetin alfa at a dose of 200 μg Q2W or epoetin alfa at a dose of 40,000 U QW for up to 16 weeks. The PSQ-An was assessed for validity, feasibility, and reliability. Secondary clinical endpoints were analyzed using the primary analysis set. Both individual trial analyses and a protocol-specified combined analysis of data from all three trials were conducted. Overall, 312 patients (157 darbepoetin alfa; 155 epoetin alfa) were randomized and received study drug. Baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment groups in each trial and overall. The PSQ-An was valid, feasible, and reliable. In general, no difference between treatment groups was observed for hemoglobin- and transfusion-based endpoints in each individual trial or in the combined analysis. From exploratory analyses, achievement and maintenance of a hemoglobin target range (11–13 g/dl) were similar in both groups. No differences in safety were observed. With the PSQ-An, formal comparisons of the impact of anemia therapies on patients and caregivers can be made in future prospective studies. Further, darbepoetin alfa (200 μg Q2W) and epoetin alfa (40,000 U QW) appear to achieve comparable clinical and hematologic outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.9-6-696", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125044142", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of CD44v6 expression in gynecologic malignancies.Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of CD44v6 in samples from a series of 65 cases of early cervical cancer, 76 cases of endometrial samples and 57 cases of serous epithelial ovarian tumors. We analyzed the expression of CD44v6 and correlated the findings with clinicopathological factors.In the cervical series, CD44v6 was detected in 60 cases of cervical cancer (92.3%). The immunoreactivity was decreased when stromal invasion reached a depth of more than 5 mm (P < 0.05). However, it was not correlated with other clinicopathological factors. In the endometrial series, CD44v6 was detected in one endometrial hyperplasia (6.7%) and in 24 endometrial cancers (100%), while it was not detected in the proliferative endometrium (P < 0.05). Immunoreactivity was decreased in grade 2 and 3 endometrial cancers compared with grade 1 (P < 0.05).

Women with an initial diagnosis of gynecologic cancer within 7 months of completing primary treatment (N = 34) completed the QOL-Cancer Survivor tool and the Cancer Survivors' Unmet Needs Survey. Fear of cancer recurrence was a repetitive theme for both tools. The lowest ranking QOL items were distress from diagnosis and treatment, family distress, and uncertainty about the future. Commonly reported needs included help to reduce stress, manage side effects, cope with fears of cancer recurrence, and gain reassurance that providers were communicating, and providing the very best medical care. Appreciating QOL and needs can facilitate the development of support services specifically tailored to gynecologic survivors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0193945919846901", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2946424050", "source": "openalex"}

We sought to determine the perception of preparedness of incoming gynecologic oncology fellows for advanced surgical training in gynecologic oncology. An online survey was sent to gynecologic oncologists involved in fellowship training in the United States. They were asked to evaluate their most recent incoming clinical fellows in the domains of professionalism, level of independence/graduated responsibility, psychomotor ability, clinical evaluation and management, and academia and scholarship using a standard Likert-style scale. The response rate among attending physicians was 40% (n = 105/260) and 61% (n = 28/46) for program directors. Of those who participated, 49% reported that their incoming fellows could not independently perform a hysterectomy, 59% reported that they could not independently perform 30 min of a major procedure, 40% reported that they could not control bleeding, 40% reported that they could not recognize anatomy and tissue planes, and 58% reported that they could not dissect tissue planes. Fellows lacked an understanding of pathophysiology, treatment recommendations, and the ability to identify and treat critically ill patients. In the academic domain, respondents agreed that fellows were deficient in the areas of protocol design (54%), statistical analysis (54%), and manuscript writing (65%). These results suggest that general Ob/Gyn residency is ineffective in preparing fellows for advanced training in gynecologic oncology and should prompt a revision of the goals and objectives of resident education to correct these deficiencies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gore.2015.03.004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2091361293", "source": "openalex"}

Hypotension immediately after administration of metoclopramide was observed in two patients and four patients given ondansetron developed profound systolic hypotension at induction of anesthesia. Twenty-two percent of patients receiving droperidol became sedated. Postoperatively, patients developing severe nausea, retching, or vomiting, defined as severe emetic sequelae (SES), were deemed to have failed antiemetic prophylaxis and received antiemetic rescue. A significantly larger number of patients who received IV ondansetron (63%), droperidol (76%), and perphenazine (70%) were free of SES when compared to placebo (43%); P < 0.05. Metoclopramide was ineffective. Although ondansetron, droperidol, and perphenazine were effective in providing antiemetic prophylaxis, only IV perphenazine was free of side effects.

The purpose of the workshop is to offer a direct experience of practical anatomy despite a shortage of cadavers. It is designed for six residents who work in three teams on three specimens. The anatomical specimens are unembalmed, unfixed, female pelvic visceral blocs that are harvested from the cadavers 24 hr after death. They are stored at −12°C and removed from the freezer 12 hr before the workshop. The workshop is 3 hr in length and has two parts: one on theory and one practical. In the theoretical section (30 min), the teacher presents the topographical anatomy of the specimens and the residents analyze a clinically oriented worksheet. In the practical section (2 hr), the residents identify viscera, vessels, and nerves through inspection and palpation, and then a step‐by‐step dissection is carried out. In the last section (30 min), the workshop includes presentations on the three specimens that illustrate anatomical variability and assess knowledge of topographical anatomy. For many residents, this is the first practical experience of the anatomy of the female pelvic viscera because the anatomical courses for medical students do not include direct dissection by students. The unfixed viscera preserves the natural characteristics of the different tissues that exhibit the aspects of living organs, such as color, softness, and pliability, enhancing the knowledge of anatomy. The worksheet is structured as a guide to the anatomical basis of physical examination through inspection and palpation of the viscera. It also introduces the residents to the surgical anatomy of the female pelvis through a brief and selective dissection focused on the relationship between the different regional systems. Clin.

Strategies for managing pain and other clinical features have limited efficacy; however, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) may be an effective option for some patients. Methods: In a systematic review of the literature, the Ovid medline, embase, Cochrane Library, National Guidelines Clearinghouse, and Canadian Medical Association Infobase databases were searched to June 2009 for clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, or other relevant evidence. Studies that did not evaluate soft tissue necrosis, cystitis, proctitis, bone necrosis, and other complications were excluded. Results: Two randomized trials, eleven nonrandomized studies, and five supporting documents comprise the evidence base. In addition, information on the harms and safety of treatment with HBO2 were reported in three additional sources. There is modest direct evidence and emerging indirect evidence that the use of HBO2 is broadly effective for late radiation tissue injury of the pelvis in women treated for gynecologic malignancies. Conclusions: Based on the evidence and expert consensus opinion, (1) HBO2 is likely effective for late radiation tissue injury of the pelvis, with demonstrated efficacy specifically for radiation damage to the anus and rectum; (2) the main indication for HBO2 therapy in gynecologic oncology is in the management of otherwise refractory chronic radiation injury; (3) HBO2 may provide symptomatic benefit in certain clinical settings (for example, cystitis, soft-tissue necrosis, and osteonecrosis); (4) and HBO2 may reduce the complications of gynecologic surgery in patients undergoing surgical removal of necrosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3747/co.v18i5.767", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118022003", "source": "openalex"}

The information accured was compared with corresponding information supplied by the mothers of these girls. The material was classified on the basis of both the chronological and gynecological age. The objective was to obtain the incidence figures for various aspects of menstruation per age group and to compare the oldest age group of girls with adult women. Cycle . The incidence of short cycles of 14‐21 days in the first gynecological year was 11 per cent and long cycles exceeding 31 days 11 per cent. After 5 years of menstruation the frequency of both types was about 8 per cent. In the mothers the incidence of short cycles was 12 and long cycles 3 per cent. Duration . 92 per cent of the girls had menstrual flows lasting 4‐7 days. Changes in duration with advancing age were small. The incidence of a duration of 2‐3 days in the 1st gynecological year was 8.8 and after the 5th 3.7 per cent. Long durations exceeding 7 days occurred 2.2 per cent of the girls in the first and in 1.5 per cent after the 5th year. For mothers, the incidence of short durations was 12.2 and long durations 2.4 per cent. Regularity . The incidence of irregular menstrual periods in the first year was 43 per cent and in the 6th 20 per cent, against only 9.4 per cent among the mothers. Dysmenorrhoea . Pain accompanied menstrual periods regularly in only about 8 per cent of the girls under 14 and in 7.2 per cent in the first gynecological year. Subsequently the incidence rose steadily until, after the 5th year, it was 26 per cent. Of the girls with dysmenorrhoea, 75 per cent reported an onset during the first year, and 90 per cent of these during the first menstrual flows. There was no correlation between the girls' social groups and dysmenorrhoea, but the mothers of Social Group III reported an incidence 3 per cent higher than the others. Premenstrual tension . The incidence in girls was 68 per cent and in mothers 73 per cent. In the very first gynecological year the incidence of fatigue and nervous symptoms was 58 per cent, and after 5 year of menstruation 59 per cent. Syndromes with oedema, on the other hand, increased during this time from 3 to 16 per cent. Premenstrual tension combined with dysmenorrhoea occurred in 42 per cent of the girls and 62 per cent of the mothers. The constitutional type was correlated with the menstrual pattern. The pyknic type had an increased incidence of continuous dysmenorrhoea and short cycles, the asthenics one of oligomenorrhoea and menorrhagia. The incidence of durations exceeding 6 days was 45 per cent for the asthenics against 31 per cent for the pyknic subjects. For a comparison of changes between age groups distribution by gynecological age proved to give clear‐cut results, especially as regards the duration, regularity and dysmenorrhoea of the menstrual periods. A girl who has menstruated for 5 years cannot generally be considered to have reached her full endocrine maturity, a fact to be borne in mind when oral contraceptives are prescribed. Effect of parity on the menstrual pattern of mothers . The mean number of children per mother in the total series was 3.12, and there was no correlation between the menarcheal age of the mother and her fertility. Nor was any correlation noted between cycle, duration and parity. The frequency of dysmenorrhoea was highly significantly smaller in the multiparous group.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00016347109155077", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964275070", "source": "openalex"}

Determining the most effective approach to counsel patients about coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination is challenging. We address the professionally responsible counseling of 3 groups of patients—those who are pregnant, those planning to become pregnant, and those breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. We begin with an evidence-based account of the following 5 major challenges: the limited evidence base, the documented increased risk for severe disease among pregnant coronavirus disease 2019-infected patients, conflicting guidance from government agencies and professional associations, false information about coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines, and maternal mistrust and vaccine hesitancy.

Methods: Members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology were electronically surveyed regarding their practice of incorporating palliative care services and to identify barriers for consultation. Descriptive statistics were used, and two-sample z-tests of proportions were performed to compare responses to related questions. Results: Of the 145 respondents, 71% were attending physicians and 58% worked at an academic medical center. The vast majority (92%) had palliative care services available for consultation at their hospital; 48% thought that palliative care services were appropriately used, 51% thought they were underused, and 1% thought they were overused. Thirty percent of respondents thought that palliative care services should be incorporated at first recurrence, whereas 42% thought palliative care should be incorporated when prognosis for life expectancy is ≤ 6 months. Most participants (75%) responded that palliative care consultation is reasonable for symptom control at any stage of disease. Respondents were most likely to consult palliative care services for pain control (53%) and other symptoms (63%). Eighty-three percent of respondents thought that communicating prognosis is the primary team’s responsibility, whereas the responsibilities for pain and symptom control, resuscitation status, and goals of care discussions were split between the primary team only and both teams. The main barrier for consulting palliative care services was the concern that patients and families would feel abandoned by the primary oncologist (73%). Ninety-seven percent of respondents answered that palliative care services are useful to improve patient care. Conclusion: The majority of gynecologic oncologists perceived palliative care as a useful collaboration that is underused. Fear of perceived abandonment by the patient and family members was identified as a significant barrier to palliative care consult.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.2017.021048", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2742968366", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Using population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau and incidence and mortality rates from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results surveys, we estimated the annual number of new gynecologic cancer cases through 2050; the effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was included in cervical cancer estimates. The number of practicing gynecologic oncologists was projected through 2050 using data from the 2005 Society of Gynecologic Oncologists Practice Survey, current Society of Gynecologic Oncologists membership information, American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Gynecologic Oncology oral examination results, and mortality estimates from U.S. life tables. Projected time in practice was sex-dependent based on Society of Gynecologic Oncologists Practice Survey. For sensitivity analyses, we varied annual number and sex distribution of fellowship graduates, HPV vaccination coverage rates, and future incidence of overweight and obesity. RESULTS: At constant training rates, the annual number of new cancer cases per practicing gynecologic oncologist will rise from 112 in 2010 to 133 in 2050, a 19% increase. If the annual number of fellowship graduates increases by 25%, the ratio of cancer cases per gynecologic oncologist will decrease to 106, a 5% decrease. Projections are more sensitive to changes in physician demographics than to changes in HPV vaccination coverage rates. CONCLUSION: The gynecologic cancer caseload of practicing gynecologic oncologists will increase by almost 20% over the next 40 years at constant training rates. Changes in the projected sex distribution of fellowship graduates and their time in practice affect these projections. The gynecologic cancer case load of practicing gynecologic oncologists will increase by up to 20% over the next 40 years if training rates remain constant.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e3181fc3a22", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2024772609", "source": "openalex"}

All procedures were performed by two surgical teams, each composed of a high-volume surgeon experienced in robotic surgery, gynecologic oncology, and pelvic sidewall surgery, and one bedside assistant. Three main gynecological surgical scenarios were identified: standard pelvic surgery, pelvic sidewall surgery, and para-aortic/upper abdominal surgery. Concerning the port placement, the chosen options were called “straight” and “bridge”; instead, the so-called “compact” and “butterfly” configurations were identified for the arm cart positioning. Four cadavers were used to perform total hysterectomy, radical hysterectomy, pelvic exenteration, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and omentectomy. We performed several tests, identifying the best system configurations to draw the proper efficiency from the flexibility of the system in all gynecological surgical scenarios. The straight port placement seems to be adequate for standard pelvic surgery. The bridge trocar position is best to reach the deeper and lateral anatomical regions of the female pelvis. The compact and butterfly arm cart allocations are adequate for both straight and bridge port placement. When deep pelvic surgery was performed, the bedside assistant became more proficient by working with a standard laparoscopic instrument from an ancillary port placed in the left iliac fossa. The arm carts needed to be moved in an open manner, like for the proposed butterfly configuration. On the contrary, the compact disposition left enough space to assist from Palmer’s point port. Several basic and advanced gynecological surgical procedures were performed and completed successfully without encountering any technical or surgical issue, the results obtained were judged sufficient to proceed with the clinical experience in daily practice. The HUGO™ RAS system is flexible and highly performative in various surgical scenarios.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.898060", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4285744445", "source": "openalex"}

The low proportion with detectable levels and the accompanying low titers have limited the use of hCG as a tumor marker. hCG is a glycoprotein composed of two noncovalently linked subunits (alpha and beta), which are the products of separate genes. With the intent of expanding the use of hCG as a tumor marker we investigated levels of hCG free beta-subunit and asialo free beta-subunit and its core glycopeptide (composed of beta-subunit residues 6-40 disulfide-linked to 55-92), collectively called urinary gonadotropin fragments (UGF), in healthy and cancer patients. An immunoradiometric assay was developed, using the core glycopeptide-directed antibody B204, that similarly measures the hCG free beta-subunit and the asialo free beta-subunit and its core glycopeptide. Parallel urine and serum samples were collected from 87 women with active gynecological cancer and hCG and UGF were measured. Just 18% of the women tested had detectable serum levels of hCG (greater than 0.2 ng/ml); none had elevated serum levels in the UGF assay (greater than 0.2 ng/ml). Of the same group, 32% had detectable urine hCG levels (mean titer, 0.50 ng/ml) and 74% exhibited elevated urinary levels in the UGF assay (mean titer, 2.0 ng/ml). In a control group (urines from 50 nonpregnant healthy women), 47 negative and three borderline positive results (0.30, 0.35, and 0.48 ng/ml) were observed in the UGF assay. These results suggested a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 92% for the UGF test for gynecological cancers. By disease, 70% of those with cervical, 73% of those with ovarian, and 77% of those with endometrial cancers had detectable UGF levels (greater than 0.2 ng/ml). By stage, 50, 62, 75, 86, and 100% of those with stage 1, 2, 3, 4, or recurrent disease, respectively, had positive results.

Although there are some reports in the literature about management of Jehovah's Witness patients in obstetrics and gynecology, most of them are case reports, and a comprehensive review about these patients including ethicolegal perspective is lacking. Objective This review outlines the medical, ethical, and legal implications of management of Jehovah's Witness patients in obstetrical and gynecological settings. Evidence Acquisition A search of published literature using PubMed, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted about physiology of oxygen delivery and response to tissue hypoxia, mortality rates at certain hemoglobin levels, medical management options for anemic patients who refuse blood transfusion, and ethical/legal considerations in Jehovah's Witness patients. Results Early diagnosis of anemia and immediate initiation of therapy are essential in patients who refuse blood transfusion. Medical management options include iron supplementation and erythropoietin. There are also some promising therapies that are in development such as antihepcidin antibodies and hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. Options to decrease blood loss include antifibrinolytics, desmopressin, recombinant factor VII, and factor concentrates. When surgery is the only option, every effort should be made to pursue minimally invasive approaches. Conclusion and Relevance All obstetricians and gynecologists should be familiar with alternatives and “less invasive” options for patients who refuse blood transfusions.

It is unclear to what degree ERAS is implemented in hospitals globally. This international survey investigated the status of ERAS protocol implementation in open gynecologic oncology surgery to provide a worldwide perspective on peri-operative practice patterns. Methods Requests to participate in an online survey of ERAS practices were distributed via social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, and Social Link). The survey was active between January 15 and March 15, 2020. Additionally, four national gynecologic oncology societies agreed to distribute the study among their members. Respondents were requested to answer a 17-item questionnaire about their ERAS practice preferences in the pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods. Results Data from 454 respondents representing 62 countries were analyzed. Overall, 37% reported that ERAS was implemented at their institution. The regional distribution was: Europe 38%, Americas 33%, Asia 19%, and Africa 10%. ERAS gynecologic oncology guidelines were well adhered to (&gt;80%) in the domains of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, early removal of urinary catheter after surgery, and early introduction of ambulation. Areas with poor adherence to the guidelines included the use of bowel preparation, adoption of modern fasting guidelines, carbohydrate loading, use of nasogastric tubes and peritoneal drains, intra-operative temperature monitoring, and early feeding. Conclusion This international survey of ERAS in open gynecologic oncology surgery shows that, while some practices are consistent with guideline recommendations, many practices contradict the established evidence. Efforts are required to decrease the variation in peri-operative care that exists in order to improve clinical outcomes for patients with gynecologic cancer globally.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001683", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3047044861", "source": "openalex"}

There were no restrictions on publication dates. Sixteen original investigations were identified and analyzed for this review.Results: The available evidence for PBT in treating gynecologic cancers is of both low quantity and quality. The most studied scenarios for PBT include treatment of para-aortic lymph nodes, re-irradiation, and as an alternative to brachytherapy, and these also represent indications with the greatest opportunity for demonstrating as yet unproven toxicity reductions. Dosimetric studies have shown significantly decreased dose to OARs, such as the rectum, bladder, bowel, kidneys, BM, and femoral heads. This dose reduction to OARs with PBT is more pronounced within the low-dose volumes than the higher dose volumes, which radiobiologically could be expected to lower second malignancy rates. Clinical data, though no level 1 evidence, show appropriate stage-specific tumor control and outcomes with PBT treatment, along with low toxicity rates.Conclusion: The existing data, albeit limited, warrant and can help guide larger scale and higher quality studies addressing whether PBT could provide clinically meaningful differences in toxicities and outcomes in women with gynecologic neoplasms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2016.1205218", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2511615034", "source": "openalex"}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of folliculogenesis, which are expressed in the cumulus–oocyte complex and in granulosa cells and some can also be found in the bloodstream. These circulating miRNAs are intensively studied and used as diagnostic/prognostic markers of many diseases, including gynecological and pregnancy disorders. In addition, serum contains small amounts of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), presumably resulting from the release of genetic material from apoptotic/necrotic cells. The quantification of nucleic acids in serum samples could be used as a diagnostic tool for female infertility. An overview of the published literature on miRNAs, and particularly on the use of circulating miRNAs and cfDNA as non-invasive biomarkers of gynecological diseases, was performed (up to January 2014). In the past decade, cell-free nucleic acids have been studied for potential use as biomarkers in many diseases, particularly in gynecological cancers, ovarian and endometrial disorders, as well as in pregnancy-related pathologies and fetal aneuploidy. The data strongly suggest that the concentration of cell-free nucleic acids in serum from IVF patients or in embryo culture medium could be related to the ovarian hormone status and embryo quality, respectively, and be used as a non-invasive biomarker of IVF outcome. The profiling of circulating nucleic acids, such as miRNAs and cfDNA, opens new perspectives for the diagnosis/prognosis of ovarian disorders and for the prediction of IVF outcomes, namely (embryo quality and pregnancy).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmu031", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020366044", "source": "openalex"}

In this review, we assess the scanty data from literature and the perspectives of clinical research about the use of ICPI in gynecological cancers. These agents have obtained objective response rates ranging from 5.9% to 15% in early phase Ib-II trials, including patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whereas only anecdotal data are available for patients with recurrent, heavily pretreated endometrial cancer. Several ongoing trials are investigating ICPI alone or in combination with chemotherapy or with other biological agents in untreated and recurrent ovarian cancer, advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer, as well as advanced and recurrent cervical cancer. Breast cancer (BRCA)-mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancers, clear cell ovarian cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), POLE ultramutated and MSI hypermutated endometrial cancers are likely to be sensitive to programmed cell death (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway blockade, since these tumors show increased neoantigen load, increased CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL number and PD-1 and PD-L1 overexpression. ICPI could have a role as maintenance treatment in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in response after chemotherapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.12042", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2787768242", "source": "openalex"}

Many people diagnosed with cancer report a negative impact on sexual identity, sexual functioning, and their sexual relationship. Gynecologic cancer survivors are often the most severely affected. These cancers involve cancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, and vulva. The impact of these cancers on sexual health results not only from the disease process itself, but may also be due to the necessary treatments required. These can have a profound impact on psychological, physiological, and social well‐being both in the short and long term, which may result in negative impact on the quality of life of the patient as well as her partner. Although most patients express that they would like to be more informed about sexual health and would like to have the opportunity to discuss these issues with their therapeutic team, sexual health is often not discussed with the patient.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.12623", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2896274010", "source": "openalex"}

The author wished to examine gynecologists' knowledge and attitudes towards them.Following a pilot study, a questionnaire concerning eating disorders was designed covering aspects of diagnosis, characteristic gynecological manifestations, treatment, and attitudes. All gynecologists and obstetricians with more than 1 year of experience from four teaching hospitals in Australia and the United Kingdom were sent the anonymous, confidential postal questionnaire. One hundred and fifteen doctors replied, with a response rate of 86%.Only 20% of respondents were confident of diagnosing eating disorders. Various diagnostic misconceptions were revealed; for example, 42% overestimated weight loss in anorexia nervosa by 20% or more, and 28% wrongly believed that a sense of strict dietary control' was a feature of bulimia nervosa. Clinicians had least knowledge of bulimia nervosa, underestimating its treatment response. Surprisingly, the greatest deficits in knowledge were of endocrinology and gynecological sequelae. For example, 79% underestimated amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa by 25%, and 85% wrongly believed that regular menses was characteristic of bulimia nervosa at normal weight. Consultants demonstrated significantly more knowledge than junior grades. Thirty-one percent of respondents held pejorative attitudes to eating disorders, which over-represented men (p=0.045) who were also more likely than women to see bulimia nervosa as untreatable (p=0.01).The author suggests that these deficits might be addressed by development of simpler screening questionnaires for non-specialists, and elucidation of the interface between eating disorders and reproductive physiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0412.1999.780311.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105644615", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Combined radiation and hyperthermia should be considered an alternative to chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced cervix cancer and be the first treatment of choice for these patients when radiation cannot be combined with chemotherapy. Several randomized trials have shown an improvement by adding hyperthermia to radiation that is comparable to the improvement found with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation. Hyperthermia does not seem to add to treatment-induced toxicity and the results of hyperthermia are consistent even at 12 years follow-up and could be reproduced in a large, unselected group of cervix cancer patients. A novel indication for combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia is vaginal cancer. Recently, a cohort study showed that the addition of hyperthermia to radiation seems to improve overall survival for patients with vaginal cancer International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III. Summary Combined radiation and hyperthermia should be considered for patients with locally advanced cervix cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIb and upwards) as an alternative to chemoradiation for patients with a contraindication for chemotherapy.

Factors other than cancer and its treatment may have significant effects on QoL and affect assessment of treatments. Baseline data from longitudinal studies of women with endometrial or ovarian cancer or adnexal mass determined at surgery to be benign were analyzed to determine the degree to which QoL is affected by baseline differences in demographic variables and health.This study examined the effect of independent variables on domains of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) pre-operatively in gynecologic oncology patients undergoing surgery for pelvic mass suspected to be malignant or endometrial cancer. Patients also completed the Short Form Medical Outcomes Survey (SF-36) questionnaire (a generic health questionnaire that measures physical and mental health). Independent variables were surgical diagnosis (ovarian or endometrial cancer, benign mass), age, body mass index (BMI), educational level, marital status, smoking status, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) summary scores of the SF-36. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the influence of these variables on FACT-G domain scores (physical, functional, social and emotional well-being).Data were collected on 157 women at their pre-operative visit (33 ovarian cancer, 45 endometrial cancer, 79 determined at surgery to be benign). Mean scores on the FACT-G subscales and SF-36 summary scores did not differ as a function of surgical diagnosis. PCS, MCS, age, and educational level were positively correlated with physical well-being, while increasing BMI was negatively correlated. Functional well-being was positively correlated with PCS and MCS and negatively correlated with BMI. Social well-being was positively correlated with MCS and negatively correlated with BMI and educational level. PCS, MCS and age were positively correlated with emotional well-being. Models that included PCS and MCS accounted for 30 to 44% of the variability in baseline physical, emotional, and functional well-being on the FACT-G.At the time of diagnosis and treatment, patients' QoL is affected by inherent characteristics. Assessment of treatment outcome should take into account the effect of these independent variables. As treatment options become more complex, these variables are likely to be of increasing importance in evaluating treatment effects on QoL.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7525-5-25", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102408568", "source": "openalex"}

We compared a strategy of no routine testing with a strategy involving the use of routine cultures or the use of less expensive rapid tests for chlamydial infection (the direct fluorescent assay or the enzyme immunoassay). We used different assumptions for the costs and operating characteristics of the diagnostic tests, complications of undetected infection, and the cost of false-positive test results. We found that using one of the rapid tests would reduce overall costs if the prevalence of infection was 7% or greater. The use of routine cultures would reduce costs if the frequency of infection was 14% or greater. We conclude that testing for cervical infection with C. trachomatis in women seeking routine gynecologic care may reduce overall costs. The choice of diagnostic test should depend on the expected prevalence of infection, local cost considerations, and laboratory expertise in the execution of these tests.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-107-2-188", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049002808", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: A discrete actuarial supply model was developed, and practice patterns were analyzed. Supply projections under different scenarios, distributions, and practice profiles were examined. Results: Women are expected to become the majority of practitioners by 2014. Continuation of current residency output will result in slow to no growth in obstetrician-gynecologist–to-female population ratios over the next 20 years. A minor (10%) reduction in specialty training would slow specialty growth over the next decade, followed by a slight reduction in supply. Services provided chiefly involve ambulatory reproductive health care, pregnancy, and surgical correction of conditions specific to the female genitourinary system. Even though the proportion of deliveries performed by midwives has increased and family practitioners have maintained their share, obstetrician-gynecologists provide the vast majority of obstetric care and virtually all services for perinatal complications. Generalist services represent relatively minor aspects of their practices. Care of the aged female population is highly fragmented among specialties; more than 50% of all aged Medicare beneficiaries who saw an obstetrician-gynecologist at least once failed to receive a majority of services from any one physician specialty.

Interventions: After induction of general anesthesia by routine methods, the patients were randomly divided into two groups. In the bupivacaine (B) group (n = 15), patients were injected with 5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine at each incisional area (four sites, total of 20 ml) approximately 15 minutes before skin incision. In the control (C) group (n = 13), the surgical field was injected with an equal volume of physiologic saline solution (four sites, total of 20 ml). Outcome Measures: Postsurgical wound pain at rest was evaluated by a 10-cm visual analog pain scale at 1, 10, 24, and 72 hours and 1 month after surgery. The patients were interviewed via telephone 1 month after hospital discharge for reevaluation of resting pain. Results: The results indicated that the incidence of postsurgical wound pain for up to 10 hours after surgery in group B was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in group C. Pain intensity ranged from mild to moderate (2-5 cm). In addition, the mean visual analog pain scale pain intensity was significantly less for group B (0.31 ± 0.85 cm) than for group C (2.62 ± 2.06 cm) for up to 10 hours after surgery (p < 0.05). The number of patients who requested analgesics and complained of sleep disturbances was significantly higher in group C (p < 0.05).

Improved survival in patients with genital cancers predominantly reflects early diagnosis and not improved treatments. Even cancers for which there are effective screening and satisfactory treatments are seen more often than is acceptable. It is paramount that those entrusted with the health of women be knowledgeable about all cancer screening techniques and be able to identify the patient at risk for gynecologic malignancy. The provider's obligation to be vigilant about the signs and symptoms of cancer must be matched by the patients' responsibility to her own health. Regular gynecologic examinations, Papanicolaou (Pap) tests, and immediate reporting of unusual signs and symptoms are requirements that cannot be dismissed by patients. Education directed toward patients and health care providers can optimize survival. The Pap test for cervical cancer remains a universally accepted screening procedure.

In this study, we document folic acid supplement use among a sample of women receiving routine gynecologic care. METHODS: A short questionnaire was administered to 322 women aged 18–45 years who were seeking routine gynecologic care at participating clinics in Little Rock, Arkansas. Questions covered knowledge and use of folic acid supplements, pregnancy intention, and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Primary study outcomes were self-reported folic acid awareness, daily or weekly use of folic acid supplements, and intention to begin taking folic acid. Factors affecting study outcomes were examined individually by computing crude odd ratios and adjusted for other covariates using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Although 61.8% of women reported awareness of the association between folic acid and birth defects prevention, only 27.1% of these women, and 22.7% of all study participants, reported daily use of a folic acid supplement. Substantially more women (39.8%) were taking a folic acid supplement at least once per week. Age, race, educational level, folic acid awareness, marital status, pregnancy intent, and other preventive health behaviors were the most important predictors of compliance. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a need for targeted interventions directed toward minority women, young women, and those of lower socioeconomic and educational status. The routine gynecologic visit is an ideal opportunity to counsel women of reproductive age to take folic acid daily. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Daily folic acid supplement use among a sample of women receiving routine gynecologic care is lower than that reported nationally for other populations of women.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000117084.02395.a0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123287507", "source": "openalex"}

Women aged 30 to 54 years receiving a first hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilization between 2010 and 2014 were included and were followed up through December 2015. <h3>Exposures</h3> Hysteroscopic sterilization vs laparoscopic sterilization. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Risks of procedural complications (surgical and medical) and of gynecological (sterilization failure that includes salpingectomy, second sterilization procedure, or pregnancy; pregnancy; reoperation) and medical outcomes (all types of allergy; autoimmune diseases; thyroid disorder; use of analgesics, antimigraines, antidepressants, benzodiazepines; outpatient visits; sickness absence; suicide attempts; death) that occurred within 1 and 3 years after sterilization were compared using inverse probability of treatment–weighted Cox models. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 105 357 women included (95.5% of eligible participants; mean age, 41.3 years [SD, 3.7 years]), 71 303 (67.7% ) underwent hysteroscopic sterilization, and 34 054 (32.3%) underwent laparoscopic sterilization. During the hospitalization for sterilization, risk of surgical complications for hysteroscopic sterilization was lower: 0.13% for hysteroscopic sterilization vs 0.78% for laparoscopic sterilization (adjusted risk difference [RD], −0.64; 95% CI, −0.67 to −0.60) and was lower for medical complications: 0.06% vs 0.11% (adjusted RD, −0.05; 95% CI, −0.08 to −0.01). During the first year after sterilization, 4.83% of women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization had a higher risk of sterilization failure than the 0.69% who underwent laparoscopic sterilization (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 7.11; 95% CI, 5.92 to 8.54; adjusted RD, 4.23 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.40 to 5.22).

Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a lower risk of pregnancy within the first year of the procedure but was not significantly associated with a difference in risk of pregnancy by the third year (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.30; adjusted RD, 0.01 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.07). Risks of medical outcomes were not significantly increased with hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic sterilization. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Among women undergoing first sterilization, the use of hysteroscopic sterilization was significantly associated with higher risk of gynecological complications over 1 year and over 3 years than was laparoscopic sterilization. Risk of medical outcomes was not significantly increased over 1 year or over 3 years.

Recent findings COX-2 overexpression has been reported in most gynecological neoplasms, including breast, cervix, endometrial and epithelial ovarian cancers. COX-2 expression promotes tumor cell proliferation, reduces apoptosis and induces angiogenesis. As a result, tumors expressing COX-2 are reported to exhibit a more aggressive phenotype and clinical behavior. Women whose tumors over-express COX-2 tend to have a lower response to standard therapy and shorter survival times. In-vitro studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors can inhibit tumor cell growth and reduce angiogenesis.

In addition, the hand placement a woman exhibited as the speculum was inserted was recorded, as were the reasons for her visit, reports of any symptoms, performance of any special procedures (e.g., colposcopy) and whether the pelvic examination was her first.Five behaviors observed during speculum insertion--holding hands/eyes covered or shut, hands on shoulders, hands covering pelvis, hands on legs, hands holding table--indicated increased anxiety. Together these behaviors were exhibited by one of every four patients and were found to be associated with high levels of anxiety. Greater anxiety was related to colposcopy, a less positive first pelvic examination experience, overall less positive experiences with examiners and performance of the first gynecologic examination at the present visit.Easily recognizable behaviors reflecting high anxiety in gynecologic patients were identified. Upon recognizing these behaviors, examiners can take necessary measures to reduce patient anxiety and prevent delays in and avoidance of gynecologic examinations.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W131596703", "source": "openalex"}

We further investigated the adequacy of hospital records in documenting infection rates as well as the timing of presentation of wound infections.The records of 115 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery at our institution were reviewed. Patients were further subdivided based on route of surgery. We analyzed the importance of antibiotic prophylaxis, route of surgery, smoking, diabetes, and body mass index (BMI).The overall wound infection rate was 12.17% with no significant difference in the subgroups by route of surgery. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased infection rates (P = 0.0118), but the route of surgery, BMI, smoking, and diabetes were not significant predictors of infection. Only one case of infection was detected during the initial hospital stay (6.1%). Fifty percent of the patients with infection required readmission, and of these 35.7% required an additional surgical procedure. The average length of hospital stay was 2.4 days longer in patients with infection.Antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in the management of patients undergoing abdominal gynecologic surgery. In today's environment of cost containment, an increased hospital stay and the added likelihood of additional surgical intervention associated with wound infection are important targets for prevention. Most patients with wound infection were diagnosed after discharge from the hospital. In our population, among whom transportation problems and remote residence are prevalent, strategies for infection surveillance should be integral to discharge planning.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/s1064744900000338", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097160177", "source": "openalex"}

The augmented rank-order coefficient (ra) values were excellent (0.95–1.00). When scales were used to detect true changes over time, there was no clear indication of responsiveness, mostly because of statistically significant random individual changes. However, the individual changes were much smaller for magnitude matching than for VAS. In conclusion, we would recommend the use of perceptual matching by Pain Matcher for pain assessment, because in this study it was a reliable and powerful in test-retest situations and had smaller individual changes than VAS after intervention.

Using ICIs for advanced gynecological cancers has yielded good results, especially for endometrial cancer. In ovarian or cervical cancer, combining ICIs with other established agents has shown some promise. Concurrently with the clinical development of ICIs, biomarkers that predict responses to such therapy have been discovered and used in clinical trials. The translation of these biomarkers to clinical practice was somewhat hampered by lacking assay standardization and non-comprehensive reporting of biomarker status in trials often performed on a small number of gynecological cancer patients. We can expect increased use of ICIs combined with other agents in gynecological cancer in the near future. This will create a need for reliable response prediction tools, which we believe will be based on biomarker, clinical, and tumor characteristics.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2083351644", "title": "Basic European ultrasound training in obstetrics and gynecology: where are we and where do we go from here?", "text": "More than with any other imaging modality, the medical use of ultrasound is highly operator-dependent. The potential for diagnostic error is magnified by the ongoing development of increasingly sophisticated equipment with extended applications. A gap is appearing between the sophistication of the most advanced machines and techniques and the skills of those expected to use them and interpret the images produced, due to a lack of training. Whilst many obstetricians and gynecologists in training attend courses addressing the finer points of, for example, cardiac Doppler, central nervous system posterior fossa imaging or three-dimensional endometrial visualization, relatively few are willing to attend courses on basic theoretical and practical ultrasound techniques. There are a few exceptions, for example in Scandinavia, where basic courses are mandatory. Are there steps missing in the training of doctors in the specialty? The impression we have is that there exists a relatively small number of talented and skilled ultrasound practitioners seeking to hone their skills ever more precisely, whilst many perfectly competent clinicians are perhaps less enthusiastic and more fearful of ultrasound as they have simply not been taught the basics. The answer should be yes. Modern obstetrics and gynecology practice is virtually impossible without the use of ultrasound. That does not mean that all obstetricians and gynecologists need to be experts in ultrasound. Certain aspects of the specialty require specific skills that are more important than ultrasound—for instance, gynecological oncology and urogynecology require surgical expertise, whilst maternal medicine requires specific medical knowledge. Nevertheless, it is clearly desirable for all obstetricians and gynecologists to have been trained robustly in basic sonographic skills so that their scanning in antenatal and gynecological clinics and on the labor ward is both safe and reproducible. Moreover, in order to gain maximum clinical benefit and to achieve optimal use of resources, there is a need for all ultrasound operators to have appropriate skills to perform and interpret ultrasound examinations. The European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (EBCOG) has developed guidelines for basic education in obstetrics and gynecology (approved in June 2005). For ultrasound, the basic competence levels are defined only in broad terms. With respect to obstetric ultrasound, the trainee should have 'detailed theoretical knowledge of the normal and abnormal anatomy of the fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid compartment, estimation of gestational age, fetal biometry, fetal growth and behaviour, [and] of the evaluation of fetal and uteroplacental blood flow'1. In gynecological ultrasound the trainee should have 'detailed theoretical knowledge of ultrasonic aspects of normal pelvic anatomy; gynaecological disease; infertility and ultrasound guided invasive procedures'1. In addition, each trainee should have a log book listing 200 antenatal obstetric scans and 100 gynecological scans2. The European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) is more detailed in its minimum training recommendations for the practice of medical ultrasound3. For Level 1 (basic competence level) in gynecological ultrasound, EFSUMB recommends that trainees should perform a minimum of 300 examinations under supervision and keep an illustrated log book of 20 documented cases. They should receive a minimum of 20 hours of theoretical tuition, preferably at the beginning of the training period. For Level 1 in obstetric ultrasound the recommendations are that the trainee performs a minimum of 500 examinations under supervision, producing a log book listing the types of examinations, and receives 30 hours of theoretical tuition3. In 1996, ISUOG (the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology) Education Committee produced the most ambitious proposal in their 'Update on proposed minimum standards for ultrasound training for residents in Ob/Gyn'4. This document describes the contents of a basic theory course and required practical skills. It recommends that for certification a trainee should have 100 hours of supervised scanning including 100 gynecological and 200 obstetric scans. A log book with 30 cases with ultrasound images (including 15 fetal anomalies) should be included. Theoretical (multiple choice or written exam of three or four cases) and practical (transvaginal and fetal anomaly scan—30 min for both) examinations were recommended. ISUOG may decide to update this proposal, but in the meantime its Clinical Standards Committee has provided practical advice in the form of guidelines for individual types of exam. The difficulty in creating consistency in training standards throughout Europe has led to the separate and independent development of ultrasound training approaches in individual countries. We have, through contact with colleagues in other countries, performed an informal survey comparing ultrasound training in obstetrics and gynecology in some European countries. The results are presented in Table 1, which demonstrates that European countries differ in their formal definitions and requirements for basic obstetric and gynecological ultrasound training. Theoretical knowledge is taught in basic and intermediate ultrasound courses. Some countries test the theoretical knowledge in course exams, whilst in the UK, membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG) requires an 'overall' exam including all subject areas, of which only a small fraction will include ultrasound. Some do not assess theoretical knowledge among trainees at all. Whilst most systems require formalized theoretical teaching, 'hands-on' practical supervision is rarely formalized. Yet, this is the most critical aspect of basic training. Most hands-on supervision for trainees is probably ad hoc in an opportunistic, unstructured way in clinics and wards, rather than being arranged in advance with clear educational goals. Log books and check lists are frequently used to document a certain number of scans, and the quality of images can be checked by a supervisor. However, achieving a particular number of scans does not equate to a certain level of competence. We suggest that four aspects should be discussed and decided upon: This has been proposed previously by EBCOG, EFSUMB and ISUOG. However, a problem is that definitions vary and do not seem to be implemented uniformly in European countries (Table 1). In the UK, basic ultrasound training for obstetric ultrasound (though not gynecological ultrasound) has recently become mandatory and comprises two modules. The goal of training is that each trainee should be able to carry out a dating scan at 8–12 weeks and to undertake some aspects of late pregnancy scanning, for example amniotic fluid index assessment, fetal presentation, placental site and aspects of basic fetal biometry. While these may appear to be modest goals for basic training, they are a marked improvement: now all UK trainees will be expected to achieve at least basic competence. Training must be offered and standards maintained, for which a robust assessment process is critical. However, the assessment process in European countries is variable (Table 1) and only a few countries have nationally applied assessment guidelines or tools. There are specific national considerations. In the UK, for example, objective and reproducible assessments are evidenced by RCOG (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists) workplace-based assessments, which may be completed by medical or non-medical training supervisors. These include Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), Case Based Discussions (CBDs) and mini-CEXs (Clinical Examinations). Web-based resources to support trainers are available on the RCOG website5, along with the RCOG curriculum, assessment tools and information6. Both sonographers and obstetricians/gynecologists may, where appropriately qualified, perform assessments7. This is important because in the UK, the majority of obstetric ultrasound examinations are carried out by sonographers. Indication for ultrasound investigations, the sonographic appearance of normal anatomy in the standard planes, the correct settings of an ultrasound system as well as safety issues can easily be taught in conventional ways (lectures, books, videos), but the practical usage of an ultrasound system and, in particular, handling of the ultrasound probes (positioning, insonation angle) and adjustments for fetal movements and positional changes must be taught on a one-to-one basis. Once these basic abilities have been mastered, however, there are some other potentially useful educational tools: Online lectures. Several societies and dedicated individuals offer educational lectures on the Internet, ranging from basic to very advanced topics. ISUOG, for example, offers the contents of several ultrasound courses, covering both obstetric and gynecological topics, in full-media format (audio and video). While many of these lectures cover advanced topics, some also address concepts such as the fetal cardiac screening exam. These lectures are available for all members from ISUOG's website (www.isuog.org). In several European countries, trainees are able to access the ISUOG website through a free membership program. Multimedia-based self-study, using offline material (CD ROM). CD ROMS have been produced by various authors, including ISUOG, who offer an educational series of CD ROMS, some produced jointly with The Fetal Medicine Foundation, London (downloadable from ISUOG's website). Ultrasound simulators. Ultrasound simulators in basic obstetric and gynecological ultrasound training have been studied, but only sparsely, and their applicability for basic training has been disputed8, 9. However, once basic abilities (use of the ultrasound system, handling of the probes, acquisition of standard images) have been achieved by a trainee, there may be a possible role for digitally preserved pathological specimens both in basic and advanced training10, 11. EBCOG has representatives from all European countries and could agree on a structure for basic and intermediate ultrasound training, allowing harmonization between different European countries. The potential for putting together a joint course curriculum and for combining and sharing existing teaching material and expertise between the national societies is unarguable. ISUOG has come a long way in advanced women's imaging education, arranging well-attended, high-quality conferences, producing a top-ranked journal and providing a large and growing body of media-rich lectures and other tools on its website. The focus so far has, however, been on developing the skills of already competent ultrasound practitioners. We therefore suggest that the time is right to team up in order to craft a basic training program for ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology that is geared towards residents' training. Without doctors being taught the basics, they are unlikely to become confident and competent advanced ultrasound practitioners. It is unrealistic to expect an overall and unified European ultrasound training scheme, though with increasing movement of doctors and patients within Europe this might be desirable. But there is no reason why a template for basic, intermediate and advanced training, both theoretical and practical, cannot be developed jointly between national bodies and supranational organizations. How this training is provided and assessed will differ from country to country, but a template may at least guide national societies to improve ultrasound education for all obstetricians/gynecologists. This will be rewarded by safer and more confident clinical management of patients in both obstetrics and gynecology.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were chemotherapy-naive. Doxorubicin was administered as a brief infusion, paclitaxel for 3 hours, and cisplatin for 60 minutes. Treatments were repeated every 3 weeks. For most dose levels, the cisplatin and doxorubicin were fixed at 60 mg/m 2 and 45 mg/m 2 , whereas the paclitaxel was escalated in successive cohorts from 90 to 250 mg/m 2 . Patients who had received previous radiotherapy to the whole pelvis were escalated separately from those who had not. RESULTS: Eighty patients received 320 cycles of therapy. When G-CSF was not used, myelosuppression prevented escalation beyond the starting dose for patients with or without previous pelvic radiotherapy. When G-CSF was added, neurotoxicity became dose-limiting for both groups. Ten patients were removed from the study for asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction, but no symptomatic congestive heart failure was observed. Major antitumor responses occurred in 46% of patients (six of 13) with measurable endometrial carcinoma and 50% of patients (eight of 16) with measurable cervical carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The combination of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin at relevant single-agent doses is active and feasible with the addition of G-CSF. A regimen of cisplatin 60 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 45 mg/m 2 , and paclitaxel 160 mg/m 2 with G-CSF support is recommended for further testing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2001.19.4.1021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963078177", "source": "openalex"}

Thoracic metastases exhibit various imaging patterns and are usually associated with locally invasive primary neoplasms with intra-abdominal spread. However, thoracic involvement may also occur many months to years after initial diagnosis or as an isolated finding in patients without evidence of intra-abdominal neoplastic involvement. Thoracic metastases from endometrial carcinoma typically manifest as pulmonary nodules and lymphadenopathy. Thoracic metastases from ovarian cancer often manifest with small pleural effusions and subtle pleural nodules. Thoracic metastases to the lungs, lymph nodes, and pleura may also exhibit calcification and mimic granulomatous disease. Metastases from fallopian tube carcinomas exhibit imaging features identical to those of ovarian cancers. Most cervical cancers are of squamous histology, and while solid pulmonary metastases are more common, cavitary metastases occur with some frequency. Metastatic choriocarcinoma to the lung characteristically manifests with solid pulmonary nodules. Some pulmonary metastases from gynecologic malignancies exhibit characteristic features such as cavitation (in squamous cell cervical cancer) and the \"halo\" sign (in hemorrhagic metastatic choriocarcinoma) at computed tomography (CT). However, metastases from common gynecologic malignancies may be subtle and indolent and may mimic benign conditions such as intrapulmonary lymph nodes and remote granulomatous disease. Therefore, radiologists should consider the presence of locoregional disease as well as elevated tumor marker levels when interpreting imaging studies because subtle imaging findings may represent metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography/CT may be helpful in identifying early locoregional and distant tumor spread. ©RSNA, 2014", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.346140052", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080393346", "source": "openalex"}

The main findings of this review are that there are benefits within elective gynecological surgery, but studies of quality of life, patient satisfaction and health economics in elective surgery are needed. Studies of fast-track within the field of non-elective gynecological surgery are lacking. Widespread education is needed to improve the rate of implementation of fast-track. Close involvement of the entire surgical team is imperative to ensure a structured perioperative care aiming for enhanced postoperative recovery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01525.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1936752683", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty-eight adult outpatients undergoing elective gynecological surgery of >30 min were randomized to two groups: fluid warming at 42[degree sign]C or control (room temperature fluids at approximately 21[degree sign]C). All patients received general anesthesia with isoflurane, tracheal intubation, standard operating room blankets and surgical drapes, and passive humidification of inspired gases. Tympanic membrane (core) temperatures were measured at baseline and at 15-min intervals after induction. The incidence of shivering and postoperative requirement for meperidine and/or radiant heat were evaluated. Core temperatures were lower in the control compared with the warm fluid group at the end of surgery (35.6 +/- 0.1[degree sign]C vs 36.2 +/- 0.1[degree sign]C; P < 0.05). More patients had final core temperature <35.5[degree sign]C in the control compared with the warm fluid group (35% vs 0%; P < 0.05). There were no differences in time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit or the incidence of shivering between the groups. We conclude that fluid warming, in conjunction with standard heat conservation measures, was effective in maintaining normothermia during outpatient gynecological surgery; however, there was no improvement in patient outcome. Implications: Women who received IV fluid at body temperature had significantly higher core temperatures during and after outpatient gynecological surgery compared with women who received IV fluids at the temperature of the operating room.

Gynecologic malignancies are complex, heterogeneous diseases, and despite extensive research efforts, the molecular mechanisms underlying their development and pathology remain largely unclear. Currently, mechanistic and therapeutic research in cancer is largely focused on protein targets that are encoded by about 1% of the human genome. Our current understanding of 99% of the genome, which includes noncoding RNA, is limited. The discovery of tens of thousands of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), possessing either structural or regulatory functions, has fundamentally altered our understanding of genetics, physiology, pathophysiology, and disease treatment as they relate to gynecologic malignancies. In recent years, it has become clear that ncRNAs are relatively stable, and can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as guide therapy choices. Here we discuss the role of small non-coding RNAs, i.e., microRNAs (miRs), P-Element induced wimpy testis interacting (PIWI) RNAs (piRNAs), and tRNA-derived small RNAs in gynecological malignancies, specifically focusing on ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13051085", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3133839288", "source": "openalex"}

Low-grade malignancies could be distinguished from reactive mesothelium by evaluating subtle cytologic criteria and by comparing the cells to those of the tumor on histologic section. The differentiation of low-grade epithelial malignancies from benign epithelial lesions caused difficulties that could only be resolved by evaluating the histologic material. Positive peritoneal washings increased the stage in 8 of 110 patients undergoing initial surgery for gynecologic malignancy. Two of 76 patients undergoing a second-look laparotomy had positive washings without histologic evidence of tumor.

Eighty patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy participated. Confounding variables that could influence the incidence of postoperative emesis were controlled. Patients received either fentanyl 100 micro g (Group I) or ketorolac 60 mg (Group II) intravenously (IV) at the time of anesthetic induction. No further analgesic supplements were given intraoperatively. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with propofol-nitrous oxide. Atracurium was used for muscle relaxation and reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Postoperative pain during early recovery was treated with IV fentanyl 25-50 micro g (Group I) or IV ketorolac 15-30 mg (Group II). Subsequent breakthrough pain in both groups was treated with IV fentanyl 25 micro g increments as needed (rescue analgesia). Eighty-four percent of patients in Group I required analgesics during early recovery versus 56% of patients in Group II (P < 0.05). Maintenance dose of propofol was significantly lower in Group I (129 +/- 35 micro g [centered dot] kg-1 [centered dot] min-1) than in Group II (170 +/- 63 micro g [centered dot] kg-1 [centered dot] min-1). Immediate recovery (emergence) in the two groups was comparable, despite different propofol requirements. Although the incidence of emetic sequelae in the postanesthesia care unit was not significantly different between the two treatment groups, a significantly larger number of patients in Group I (fentanyl group) had emetic sequelae that required therapeutic intervention (Group I 29% versus Group II 10%). Patients in Group I also took a significantly longer time to ambulate and meet criteria for home discharge. These results indicate that, in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy, the practice of administering a small dose of fentanyl at the time of anesthetic induction reduces maintenance propofol requirement, but fails to provide effective postoperative analgesia. Fentanyl administration at anesthetic induction increased the need for rescue antiemetics. The relative severity of emetic sequelae could have contributed to delay in ambulation and discharge.

Recent literature found benefits of using lower pressures, but the safety of doing abdominal surgery with low peritoneal pressures needs to be assessed. This systematic review compares low with standard pneumoperitoneum during gynecologic laparoscopy.Database:We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing intraperitoneal pressures during gynecologic laparoscopy. Two authors reviewed references and extracted data from included trials. Risk ratios, mean differences, and standard mean differences were calculated and pooled using RevMan5. Of 2251 studies identified, three were included in the systematic review, for a total of 238 patients. We found a statistically significant but modest diminution in postoperative pain of 0.38 standardized unit based on an original 10-point scale (95% confidence interval [CI], –0.67 to –0.08) during the immediate postoperative period when using low intraperitoneal pressure of 8 mm Hg compared with ≥12 mm Hg and of 0.50 (95% CI, –0.80 to –0.21) 24 hours after the surgery. Lower pressures were associated with worse visualization of the surgical field (risk ratio, 10.31; 95% CI, 1.29–82.38). We found no difference between groups over blood loss, duration of surgery, hospital length of stay, or the need for increased pressure.Conclusion:Low intraperitoneal pressures during gynecologic laparoscopy cannot be recommended on the behalf of this review because improvement in pain scores is minimal and visualization of the surgical field is affected.

Thrombocytopenic patients were divided into six groups according to platelet counts, and major or minor bleeding manifestations were documented. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count less than 100,000/microL. RESULTS Thrombocytopenia occurred in 182 (36.3%) patients over 808 of 1,546 chemotherapy cycles (52%). No intracranial or life-threatening bleeding occurred in any patient. The majority of patients (139 [76.4%]) had no clinical bleeding. Minor bleeding, such as purpura, occurred in 34 patients (18.7%) and 44 cycles (5.4%). Major bleeding occurred in nine patients (4.9%) and 10 cycles (1.3%). Five major bleeding events occurred in 49 patients with platelet counts between 0 and 10,000/microL. Forty-three of these patients received platelet transfusions. Thirty-eight of 43 transfused patients (88.3%) had no bleeding. Of the remaining five patients, two were transfused prophylactically with no effect. Three major bleeding events occurred in patients with platelet counts that ranged from 11,000 to 20,000/microL, but these were due to chronic instrumentation or trauma. In patients with platelet counts more than 20,000/microL, major bleeding occurred only from necrotic metastatic lesions. Random-donor platelet transfusions provided inconsistent increments in platelet counts. Overall, 27.5% of patients achieved the expected increase in platelet number based on units of platelet concentrate transfused. The use of single-donor or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched platelets did not provide greater increments in those patients who were refractory to random-donor platelets. CONCLUSION Platelet counts &gt; or = 10,000/microL are not associated with spontaneous major bleeding. Prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients with gynecologic malignancies and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia should be limited to those with platelet counts &lt; or = 10,000/microL, provided they are not bleeding and have no major anatomic or pathophysiologic precursors of bleeding.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1994.12.11.2317", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1886010324", "source": "openalex"}

However, risk factors of gynecologic cancers have not been fully clarified in Japan. To investigate common and site-specific risk factors among gynecologic cancers, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study. The cases, i.e., 151 cervical, 103 endometrial and 141 ovarian cancer cases and the controls (n = 2016) were selected from female patients aged 30 and over, who were admitted to a single hospital in Miyagi Prefecture from 1997 to 2003. Information on reproductive factors, exogenous hormone use, and lifestyles including smoking was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. A dose-response relationship with the number of cigarettes per day was also observed (p for trend = 0.004). Older age at menarche was associated with a decreased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers. For these cancers, the decreased risk was detected with increasing parity number (endometrium, p for trend = 0.0001; ovary, p = 0.0002). There was no significant association between exogenous hormone use and gynecologic cancer risk. The results indicate that smoking is a major risk factor of cervical cancer. In addition, hormonal factors, which are related to early onset of menarche and low parity, are common risk factors for endometrial and ovarian cancers. The increase in female smokers and the decrease in fertility rate may contribute to the increase in gynecologic cancer incidence in Japan.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.216.297", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070534150", "source": "openalex"}

The disruption of DNA methylation patterns and covalent histone marks has been associated with cancer development. Until recently, microRNA (miRNA) gene silencing was not well understood. In particular, miR-125b1 has been suggested to be an miRNA with tumor suppressor activity, and it has been shown to be deregulated in various human cancers. In the present study, we evaluated the DNA methylation at the CpG island proximal to the transcription start site of miR-125b1 in cancer cell lines as well as in normal tissues and gynecological tumor samples. In addition, we analyzed the association of CTCF and covalent histone modifications at the miR-125b1 locus. Methods To assess the DNA methylation status of the miR-125b1, genomic DNA was transformed with sodium bisulfite, and then PCR-amplified with modified primers and sequenced. The miR-125b1 gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR using U6 as a control for constitutive gene expression. CTCF repressive histone marks abundance was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Results The disruption of CTCF in breast cancer cells correlated with the incorporation of repressive histone marks such H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 as well as with aberrant DNA methylation patterns. To determine the effect of DNA methylation at the CpG island of miR-125b1 on the expression of this gene, we performed a qRT-PCR assay. We observed a significant reduction on the expression of miR-125b1 in cancer cells in comparison with controls, suggesting that DNA methylation at the CpG island might reduce miR-125b1 expression. These effects were observed in other gynecological cancers, including ovarian and cervical tumors. Conclusions A reduction of miR-125b1 expression in cancers, correlated with methylation, repressive histone marks and loss of CTCF binding at the promoter region.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-12-40", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134634618", "source": "openalex"}

In response, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American College of Srugeons, and other surgical professional societies recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges have particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand.

In addition, the organizational analysis included a nationwide questionnaire survey among all relevant hospital departments, and the operating costs were calculated.None of the identified studies supported a survival benefit from hospital-based follow-up after completion of primary treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer. The methods for follow-up were of low technology (gynecologic examination with or without ultrasound examination). Other technologies had poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting recurrence. Small changes in applied technologies and organization lead to substantial changes in costs. Substantial differences especially in frequency and applied methods were found between departments. The literature review did not find evidence that follow-up affects the women's quality of life.The main purpose of follow-up after treatment of cancer is improved survival. Our review of the literature showed no evidence of a positive effect on survival in women followed up after primary treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer. The conception of follow-up among physicians, patients, and their relatives therefore needs revision. Follow-up after treatment should have a clearly defined and evidence-based purpose.

We conducted this study to evaluate the chemosensitivity of GAS compared with that of usual-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (UEA) in patients who had been enrolled in our previous study.Of 52 patients from our previous phase 2 study (SGSG005) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin for stage IB2 to IIB nonsquamous cervical cancer, 47 (stage IB2, 12; stage IIA2, 7; stage IIB, 28) were enrolled in this study with written informed consent. The biopsy specimens before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical specimens after chemotherapy were centrally reviewed based on the updated World Health Organization classification (2014).Of 47 patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma, 20 (42.6%) were diagnosed with UEA, 13 (27.7%) with GAS, 12 (25.5%) with adenosquamous carcinoma, and 1 patient each (2%) with small cell carcinoma and serous carcinoma.

Patients and Methods: An unbiased bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes in 31 ovarian cases due to chemotherapy was used to identify altered master regulators. Phosphorylated Smad2 was determined in 30 paired cervical cancer using IHC. Furthermore, the effects of chemotherapeutics on TGFβ signaling and function, and the effects of RER on chemotherapy-induced TGFβ signaling were determined in gynecologic cancer cells. Results: Chemotherapy-induced transcriptome alteration in ovarian cancer was significantly associated with TGFβ signaling activation. Chemotherapy was found to activate TGFβ signaling as indicated by phosphorylated Smad2 in paired cervical tumor samples (pre- and post-chemotherapy). Similar to TGFβ1, chemotherapeutics were found to stimulate Smad2/3 phosphorylation, cell migration, and markers related to epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSC). These TGFβ-like effects were due to the stimulation of TGFβ1 expression and secretion, and could all be abrogated by TGFβ inhibitors including a novel TGFβ trap protein called RER both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, combination treatment with RER and cisplatin showed a higher tumor inhibitory activity than either agent alone in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. Conclusions: Chemotherapeutics can stimulate TGFβ1 production and consequently enhance TGFβ signaling, EMT, and CSC features resulting in reduced chemo-sensitivity. Combination therapy with a TGFβ inhibitor should alleviate this unintended side effect of chemotherapeutics and enhance their therapeutic efficacy.

Approximately one half of adolescents with bulimia nervosa also have hypothalamic dysfunction and oligomenorrhea or irregular menses. Generally, these abnormalities do not impact bone density and can be regulated with interval dosing of progesterone or regular use of oral contraceptives. In contrast, the obese adolescent with menstrual irregularity frequently has anovulation and hyperandrogenism, commonly referred to as polycystic ovary syndrome. Insulin resistance is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition.

Overall, recurrence rates after FSS are reassuring and therefore, these conservative procedures seem oncologically safe in the current selection of patients with low-stage and low-grade disease. However, generalized conclusions should be made with caution due to the methodology of available studies, i.e., mostly retrospective cohort studies with a heterogeneous patient population, inducing selection bias.

Increasing epidemiological data and experimental results indicate that the presence of MetS increases the incidence of common malignancies and related mortality. Epidemiological studies have previously reported an association of endometrial cancer occurrence with MetS. Aromatization of androstenedione to estrogen, insulin resistance, and diabetes can cause increased levels of free estrogen, and the detrimental effect of elevated estrogen as a carcinogen is well studied in endometrial cancer. Medications used to manage MetS such as metformin and statins are suggested to reduce endometrial cancer risk and improve survival. Some large population-based epidemiological studies have suggested that the MetS is related to an increased risk of cervical carcinoma. MetS may contribute to viral-host interactions, which lead to persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, although limited epidemiological data are available. Specific effects of obesity and diabetes on the occurrence of ovarian cancer have been suggested. However, the direct correlation between MetS and ovarian cancer is still lacking. Previous retrospective studies reported that the use of metformin, statins, and beta-blockers could be associated with cancer prevention or better prognosis. Proper diagnosis and management of the MetS should be a part of the strategies undertaken to prevent and treat gynecologic cancer. So far, only limited data is available on this subject, and further clinical and fundamental research is required to further clarify the effect of these therapies on gynecologic cancer treatment.

Unfortunately, while high-quality ultrasound can be beneficial, low quality ultrasound may harm29; therefore it is necessary to devote more time and effort to education in gynecological ultrasound both at the ISUOG World Congress and in our Journal. For this reason, a new series of papers under the banner ‘Imaging in Gynecological Disease’ is planned for the Journal. The articles in the series, the first of which is published in this issue30, will present original peer-reviewed imaging data on the typical ultrasound findings of specific gynecological conditions and will be supplemented by a broader educational component. They will have a common format, with a structured abstract, followed by background information from the literature summarized according to epidemiology, macroscopic and microscopic appearances, clinical symptoms and prognosis. The methods section will describe how data were collected, then results will be presented, and finally a discussion will highlight the existing and new information on imaging features of rare gynecological diseases. The broader term ‘imaging’ has been chosen because imaging techniques other than ultrasound, which might provide complementary information in some cases, may be discussed as well. We hope that this initiative will promote both research and education in imaging in gynecology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.4025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125153831", "source": "openalex"}

In addition, the I-gel, much like the Proseal LMA (PLMA), has a gastric drainage tube associated with an upper tube for decompression of the stomach, thereby avoiding acid reflux and decreasing the risk of pulmonary absorption. The purpose of this study was to compare PLMA and I-gel devices in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy based on sealing pressure before and during pneumoperitoneum, insertion time, and gas exchange. Methods Following Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, 30 adult patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups (the PLMA or I-gel group). In each case, insertion time and number of attempts were recorded. After successful insertion, airway leak pressure was measured. Results Successful insertion and mechanical ventilation with both supraglottic airway devices was achieved on the first attempt in all 30 patients, and there were no significant differences with respect to insertion time. Likewise, leak pressure did not vary significantly either between or within groups after CO2 insufflation. In addition, differences between leak volume and leak fraction between groups were not significant. Conclusions The results of our study indicate that the I-gel is a reasonable alternative to the PLMA for controlled ventilation during laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

From the large database, the prognostic value of current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for ovarian carcinoma was re-examined.Data was collected from 25 consecutive ovarian carcinomas diagnosed in 1983 and 1988 at 904 hospitals with cancer programs. Among a total of 12,316 cases, 5156 patients had long-term survival data.The overall 5-year survivals were 88.9 +/- 0.9%; 57.1 +/- 2.4%; 23.8 +/- 1.3%; and 11.6 +/- 0.9% for Stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Pairwise survival comparisons using Lee-Desu statistic confirmed the prognostic value of current staging system (P < 0.00001). When survival data was substratified further to substage division, the 5-year survivals were: IA, 92.1 +/- 0.9%; IB, 84.9 +/- 3.4%; IC, 82.4 +/- 2.0%; IIA, 69.0 +/- 4.3%; IIB, 56.4 +/- 3.6%; IIC, 51.4 +/- 4.5%; IIIA, 39.3 +/- 2.8%; IIIB, 25.5 +/- 2.6%; IIIC, 17.1 +/- 1.4%; and IV, 11.6 +/- 0.9%. As the disease process becomes more advanced, patients' survival reduces proportionally. However, the survival reduction is relatively small between IB-IC and IIB-IIC divisions. Survival comparisons revealed significant prognostic value for most substage divisions (P = 0.03-0.0002) except for IB-IC and IIB-IIC combinations (P > 0.33). Further analyses revealed no significant differences between IB-IC and IIB-IIC patients in several prognostic parameters such as age, histologic grade, cell type, and amount of residual disease.These data support the current FIGO staging system. However, Substages IB-IC and IIB-IIC should be combined to respective single substages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19931115)72:10<3007::aid-cncr2820721024>3.0.co;2-n", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010318242", "source": "openalex"}

However, they often go unnoticed and undocumented and therefore unresolved. For women, one of every five years of healthy life lost because of injury, disease, or premature death is attributable to violence. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of domestic violence in women attending three obstetric and gynecologic clinics in Tehran, and to determine the association between domestic violence and demographic factors.One thousand women, 15-64 years old, attending three obstetric and gynecologic clinics affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey with self-administered questionnaire. The association between demographic factors (age, level of education, religious believes, annual income, job, husband's employment status, drug and alcohol abuse, previous custody of husbands) and domestic violence was assessed by questionnaire.Five hundred and ninety out of the 1000 women had experienced at least one form of violence (physical, mental, not sexual) from their husbands, 196 women had experienced some forms of controlling behavior and mental violence, and 361 women had been physically threatened. Low level of education in women, nongovernmental job, previous custody, psychiatric disorders of men, and coercive marriage for women were associated with an increased risk of domestic violence.With the high prevalence of domestic violence, health workers should not ignore the seriousness of domestic violence. Health and social personnel should be appropriately trained before \"asking all cases\" becomes a policy within health and social services.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157830170", "source": "openalex"}

We studied 6 patients with involvement of various gynecologic (GYN) sites and detailed natural history and pathologic features. Four patients initially presented with bladder lesions, including 1 high-grade pTa tumor, 2 pT1 tumors, and 1 pT2 tumor; 1 patient presented with pT2 disease of the renal pelvis and 1 with GYN involvement in the form of vulvar Paget's disease. For the 5 patients presenting with UC, time to GYN involvement was 2 to 8 years; vaginal bleeding (n=4) was the main presenting symptom, and the first site of involvement was the vagina (n=4) or cervix (n=1). GYN sites displayed an array of morphologies and growth patterns that may be seen in both UC and GYN primary tumors. The presence or absence of invasion in the original UC did not dictate whether GYN sites would exhibit invasive disease or whether disease would present as continuous or \"skip\" lesions. Immunohistochemistry for at least 1 GYN site per patient revealed diffuse, strong CK7 and focal to diffuse strong CK20 positivity in all cases, as well as at least focal p16 positivity in 5 of 6 cases. HPV in situ hybridization was negative in all cases. At last follow-up, 3 patients had died from UC and 3 were alive with recurrent disease/documented metastasis. Our findings highlight the morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap between primary GYN squamous lesions and GYN involvement by UC and hence the importance of clinical history in ensuring an accurate diagnosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pas.0b013e318251eade", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087620166", "source": "openalex"}

This population was divided into group 1 (n = 50) in which retrograde stent placement was successful, and group 2 (n = 25) in which stent placement failed and subsequent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement was required. Multivariate analysis was done to identify predictors of the failure of ureteral stent insertion.Multivariate analysis revealed that mean preprocedureal serum cystanin C greater than 2.5 mg/L and length of the ureteral obstruction greater than 3 cm were significant predictors of stent failure. Neither the causes nor location of obstruction predicted the need for percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). No statistical significance was detected among the subgroups of patients with different degrees of hydronephrosis. Statistical significant differences were found between the 2 groups in procedural time, average cost, and mean interval of stent/catheter replacement. However, no statistically significant difference was found in the median survival time and overall stent-related or catheter-related complications between the 2 groups.Retrograde ureteral stenting is a first-line option for managing ureteral obstruction caused by gynecologic malignancies. However, in cases where the preprocedureal mean serum cystanin C is greater than 2.5 mg/L and the length of the ureteral obstruction segment is greater than 3 cm, these patients may be better served by percutaneous drainage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e318243b475", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051765930", "source": "openalex"}

This study was conducted to evaluate the association between hypertension and genitourinary and gynecologic cancers in Taiwan. In this study, we conducted a populated-based retrospective cohort study by using data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance program. The study period was from 2000 to 2011, and the cohort comprised 111,704 insurants: 57,961 patients with hypertension and 53,743 patients without hypertension. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the effects of hypertension on genitourinary and gynecologic cancers risk. Among the patients with hypertension, the risks of developing renal and uterine corpus cancers were significantly higher in the hypertension group than they were in the nonhypertension group. Further stratified analyses by sex, age, and hypertension duration revealed distinct cancer-specific patterns.

The maintenance of myometrial integrity during myomectomy allows the facilitation of uterine healing and is of benefit for future reproductive outcome.The benefits of intracapsular myomectomy are evident, because it preserves myometrial integrity and allows for restoration of the uterine musculature. This correct myomectomy, if done by laparoscopy, confers significant advantages in less intraoperative blood loss, short duration of hospital stay, few therapeutic antibiotic administration and better future fertility.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590903015502", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078502361", "source": "openalex"}

The enhanced soft-tissue contrast provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) makes it a valuable imaging modality for diagnosing and treating these cancers. However, in contrast to computed tomography (CT) imaging, the appearance of the brachytherapy catheters, through which radiation sources are inserted to reach the cancerous tissue later on, is often variable across images. This paper reports, for the first time, a new deep-learning-based method for fully automatic segmentation of multiple closely spaced brachytherapy catheters in intraoperative MRI. Represented in the data are 50 gynecologic cancer patients treated by MRI-guided HDR brachytherapy. For each patient, a single intraoperative MRI was used. 826 catheters in the images were manually segmented by an expert radiation physicist who is also a trained radiation oncologist. The number of catheters in a patient ranged between 10 and 35. A deep 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed and trained. In order to make the learning process more robust, the network was trained 5 times, each time using a different combination of shown patients. Finally, each test case was processed by the five networks and the final segmentation was generated by voting on the obtained five candidate segmentations. 4-fold validation was executed and all the patients were segmented. An average distance error of 2.0 ± 3.4 mm was achieved. False positive and false negative catheters were 6.7% and 1.5% respectively. Average Dice score was equal to 0.60 ± 0.17. The algorithm is available for use in the open source software platform 3D Slicer allowing for wide scale testing and research discussion. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, fully automatic segmentation of multiple closely spaced catheters from intraoperative MR images was achieved for the first time in gynecological brachytherapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab2f47", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2954191198", "source": "openalex"}

The clinical use of color Doppler sonography has been demonstrated within many organ systems. Color Doppler sonography has become an integral part of cardiovascular imaging. Significant improvements have recently occurred, improving the visualization and evaluation of intraorgan vascularity, resulting from enhancements in delineation of tissue detail through electronic compounding and harmonics, as well as enhancements in signal processing of frequency- and/or amplitude-based color Doppler sonography. Spatial representation of vascularity can be improved by utilizing 3D and 4D (live 3D) processing. Greater sensitivity of color Doppler sonography to macro- and microvascular flow has provided improved anatomic and physiologic assessment throughout pregnancy and for pelvic organs. The potential use of contrast enhancement is also mentioned as a means to further differentiate benign from malignant ovarian lesions. The rapid development of these new sonographic techniques will continue to enlarge the scope of clinical applications in a variety of obstetric and gynecologic disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1586/17434440.2.5.605", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171937056", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Obstetrics and gynecology MeSH terms were searched in the Apple iTunes Store. A master list of unique apps was created and the apps were divided into categories and subcategories. RESULTS: A total of 1,816 unique apps using 55 different obstetrics and gynecology MeSH terms were found. Of these unique apps, 242 apps (13.3%) were considered potentially useful to ob-gyns. The MeSH terms that yielded the highest number of potentially useful apps were \"gynecology\" (23%), \"breast cancer\" (17%), \"obstetrics\" (14%), and \"pregnancy\" (12%). CONCLUSION: Less than 15% of apps found were considered potentially useful to ob-gyns. Thus, the obstetrics and gynecology community is in need of an organized effort to identify, review, and determine the accuracy of apps that can potentially improve the performance of health care providers and lead to better patient outcomes. We propose the formation of a committee to guide in this important task.

The rate of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in the overall population of patients receiving carboplatin has been reported to increase after multiple doses of the agent. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence, clinical features, management, or outcome of carboplatin-related HSRs in 113 Japanese patients with gynecologic malignancies and the possibility of rechallenge with the drug. We intravenously administered carboplatin after paclitaxel or docetaxel. Mild HSRs are resolved by temporary interruption of carboplatin infusion, an additional antihistamine, and/or a corticosteroid. If HSRs arose, carboplatin was diluted, not exceeding 1 mg/mL, and slowly infused over 2 hours in subsequent cycles. Ten patients experienced carboplatin HSRs, with an overall incidence of 8.85%. The first HSR episode was mild in all cases. When retreated with carboplatin, 4 exhibited severe HSRs. More than 9 cycles and/or more than 5000 mg of carboplatin administration significantly increased the incidence of HSRs. In particular, carboplatin treatment beyond 15 cycles and/or 8000 mg increased the risk of severe HSRs (P < 0.0001). The incidence of HSRs in the ovarian carcinoma group was significantly greater than that in the uterine carcinoma group (P = 0.0046). Careful attention should be paid to HSRs during carboplatin treatment beyond 9 cycles and/or 5000 mg. The rate of severe HSRs greatly increases beyond 15 cycles and/or 8000 mg. Further studies are needed to identify potential risk factors that may contribute to the development of carboplatin HSRs and to decrease the risk of reactions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/igc.0b013e3181a1bf2e", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038998118", "source": "openalex"}

There is a high risk of postoperative bacteriuria and urinary tract infection after gynecologic surgery. Postoperative asymptomatic bacteriuria often disappears without treatment, but 15–20% of patients still require treatment for postoperative urinary tract infection. This study was carried out to assess the value of prophylactic treatment with methenamine hippurate after routine gynecologic surgery. Methods. This was a prospective, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial comprising 145 patients undergoing routine gynecologic laparotomy or vaginal plastic surgery using a Foley catheter for 24 h. Antibiotics were not used. Subjects received 1 g Hiprex or placebo twice daily for 5 days. Urine was cultured preoperatively, at catheter removal, and 2 days later. Patients with positive cultures were not given antibiotics unless they were symptomatic. The follow‐up period was 1 month. Statistics. The chi‐square test, Fisher exact test, and t ‐test were used with level of significance at 0.05, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was diagnosed in 36 cases (50.0%) in the placebo group and 22 cases (30.1%) in the methenamine group ( p = 0.02).

Due to recent changes in graduate medical education, new tools are needed to provide faculty with reliable and individualized feedback on their teaching qualities. This study validates two instruments underlying the System for Evaluation of Teaching Qualities (SETQ) aimed at measuring and improving the teaching qualities of obstetrics and gynecology faculty. Methods and Findings This cross-sectional multi-center questionnaire study was set in seven general teaching hospitals and two academic medical centers in the Netherlands. Seventy-seven residents and 114 faculty were invited to complete the SETQ instruments in the duration of one month from September 2008 to September 2009. To assess reliability and validity of the instruments, we used exploratory factor analysis, inter-item correlation, reliability coefficient alpha and inter-scale correlations. We also compared composite scales from factor analysis to global ratings. Finally, the number of residents' evaluations needed per faculty for reliable assessments was calculated. A total of 613 evaluations were completed by 66 residents (85.7% response rate). 99 faculty (86.8% response rate) participated in self-evaluation. Factor analysis yielded five scales with high reliability (Cronbach's alpha for residents' and faculty): learning climate (0.86 and 0.75), professional attitude (0.89 and 0.81), communication of learning goals (0.89 and 0.82), evaluation of residents (0.87 and 0.79) and feedback (0.87 and 0.86). Item-total, inter-scale and scale-global rating correlation coefficients were significant (P<0.01). Four to six residents' evaluations are needed per faculty (reliability coefficient 0.60–0.80). Conclusions Both SETQ instruments were found reliable and valid for evaluating teaching qualities of obstetrics and gynecology faculty. Future research should examine improvement of teaching qualities when using SETQ.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019142", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142841260", "source": "openalex"}

One hundred and twelve healthy women served as controls. Preoperatively, mean plasma viscosity (pv) was significantly higher in cancer patients as compared to patients with the corresponding benign tumor disease (breast cancer: n = 261; pv = 1.32 vs. 1.27 mPa s; p = 0.023; ovarian cancer: n = 68; pv = 1.39 vs. 1.31 mPa s; p < 0.001; endometrial cancer: n = 70; pv = 1.37 vs. 1.25 mPa s; p < 0.001; cervical cancer: n = 52; pv = 1.33 vs. 1.26 mPa s; p = 0.004). RBC aggr. was significantly lower in controls compared to the preoperative values in cancer patients but mean (median) values (RBC aggr. stasis < 21) were within the normal range in all. Preoperatively, plasma viscosity was a significant risk factor for the overall survival in ovarian cancer patients (p = 0.02) and for subsequent thrombosis in ovarian (p = 0.02) and cervical cancer patients (p = 0.007). In the multivariate analysis plasma viscosity was an independent prognostic marker for the overall survival of breast cancer patients (r = 99.45; 95% CI: 7.32-980.2; p < 0.0001). An optimized preoperative cut-off value above 1.40 mPa s (Log-Rank-test) was significantly associated with poor outcome in the Kaplan-Mayer survival estimates, even in node-negative breast cancer. In gynecologic cancer patients the combination of an increase in RBC aggregation and plasma viscosity impairs blood-flow-properties and may induce hypoxia in the microcirculation that favors thrombosis, settlement of tumor-cells and thus metastasis. Improvement of blood fluidity and thus oxygen transfer in the tumor-vascular-microcirculation may increase susceptibility of systemic anti-cancer therapy.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1867485048", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Higher surgical volume is directly associated with improved surgical outcomes, denoted by consistently lower rates of complications for commonplace procedures such as hysterectomy. As a result, expert opinion on prevention of iatrogenic urologic injury suggests a real need for improved education and training of gynecologic surgeons. Discontinued manufacturing of indigo carmine has led to the utilization of alternative methods to assess ureteral patency during cystoscopy, such as phenazopyridine or sodium fluorescein. Intraoperative cystoscopy has been shown to detect approximately 50% of urinary tract injuries during hysterectomy, but has limited accuracy and does not necessarily decrease delayed postoperative complications. When identified, most urologic injuries can be managed in a minimally invasive fashion.

They have biologically similar risks to other women for developing all cancers, including gynecologic malignancies. Unfortunately, barriers to comparable cancer screening include lack of knowledge by women themselves, lack of awareness on the part of health care providers about special health concerns clinicians might encounter, and physical access barriers. Together, these factors conspire to delay diagnosis and treatment of many common gynecologic malignancies. Additionally, medications taken by some women with chronic disease states may adversely affect their risk for developing certain types of cancer, and they may be at increased risk for contracting underdiagnosed sexually transmitted diseases linked to cervical cancer. This article describes some important issues regarding incidence and screening for gynecologic malignancies in women with disabilities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.1998.7.281", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995342380", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2147670856", "title": "Ultrasound simulators in obstetrics and gynecology: state of the art", "text": "Ultrasound is the primary method of imaging in obstetrics and gynecology1. Its use encompasses screening as well as expert examination of normal and abnormal cases2. It has become an essential part of practice in obstetrics, including maternal–fetal medicine, as well as in gynecology, often irrespective of the ability, competence and experience of the operators3, 4; the lack of standardization in training and assessment of skill has become a matter of concern worldwide. The majority of international institutions have set criteria and a minimum number of procedures that are required to perform obstetric and gynecological ultrasound in clinical settings5. These, however, vary between institutions and there is a wide range in skill level of both trainees and practitioners. For instance, the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) has suggested a minimum of 200 obstetric scans for residents in obstetrics and gynecology6. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) has defined standards for training to be applied to sonologists. They also require specific ultrasound training for at least 3 months or the performance of at least 300 ultrasound examinations as part of an accredited residency or fellowship program. Their determination of competency for trainees is, however, based on residency review-committee standards, which do not define specific numbers of scans for trainees, but require competency assessment by program directors and faculty7. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) requires specific ultrasound training for at least 3 months for completion of a fellowship graduate medical education of maternal–fetal medicine8. Training standards and assessment of competency are likewise not standardized across the different European countries. Performance of a minimum number of scans is required in Germany, Switzerland and Denmark, while no formal curriculum for ultrasound teaching is provided nor is any minimum number of scans required in Italy and Sweden. Attending a dedicated course and achieving a certificate of competency is mandatory in France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK9. In the UK, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)10 and in France, the National College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (CNGOF)11 require that trainees should be assessed on their ability rather than through any given number of examinations. In both countries, candidates also sit both a theoretical and a practical examination10. To date, teaching and training have been mostly patient-centered5. Theoretical knowledge is not sufficient, and practical training can either be achieved on actual patients or on volunteers. However, this conventional patient-centered approach involves numerous difficulties and disadvantages. It puts the trainees in an uncomfortable situation, especially during the initial phase of training, when the interaction with the patient may distract them from becoming familiarized with handling and manipulation of the ultrasound probe and with interpretation of the ultrasound images12. Furthermore, developing competency in ultrasound is largely dependent upon the variety and number of cases encountered during clinical practice and there is a great diversity of opportunities among different students13. Often, the concept of trainees practicing on them is also stressful for the patient12, particularly in cases undergoing transvaginal sonography or in the presence of a fetal malformation. Even for volunteers, repeat examination by inexperienced and often stressed trainees can be uncomfortable and has the potential to cause anxiety. The limited availability of ultrasound machines dedicated to training is an additional limiting factor even for motivated trainees who are willing to train after hours, and the presence of trainees during working hours interferes significantly with the normal activity of the unit. We view as unacceptable the process of inexperienced trainees practicing on actual patients as the very first step of their learning process, which may be characterized by a significant number of errors and extensive time requirements. The increased focus on medical errors and patient safety also calls for development of alternative methods of continuous education and assessment of skills14. This has, understandably, led to insurance companies becoming involved in the development of simulation in medicine. For example, the patient safety and medical malpractice company of the Harvard medical community, 'CRICO', decided to offer premium incentives not only to anesthesiologists but also to obstetricians and gynecologists who participated in simulation-based courses, after proving that training with simulators results in reduced costs from malpractice claims12, 15-17. Moreover, patients are more likely to allow students to perform procedures on them following prior simulation training18. These changes in the context of medical education and training have paved the way for a new concept of learning, focused mainly on student's needs and the protection of patients, in which virtual reality and simulation can find important and complementary roles19. In this Editorial we review the current literature to provide an overview regarding the use of simulation in ultrasound in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. According to the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH), simulation can be defined as the 'imitation or representation of one act or system by another'20. David Gaba, a pioneer in medical simulation, has defined it as a 'technique to replace or amplify real experiences with guided experiences that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive manner' and he has underlined that standardization, reproducibility and safety are some important aspects made possible by simulation21. Simulation and virtual reality were first introduced into the field of education by the military and the aviation and nuclear power industries. Their aim was to find an effective and safe method of training, considering that training a team and system testing in the real world were dangerous and expensive22. The introduction of simulators into medical education followed, the first being Resusci AnneTM, developed for the teaching of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the 1950s by the Norwegian toy-maker Åsmund Laerdal, in cooperation with a group of anesthesiologists23. Then came 'Sim One'24, created in the 1960s by Abrahamson and Denson, which was followed in the 1980s by two similar high-fidelity anesthesia simulators, CASETM 25 and GASTM 26. Since then, simulation has been used in multiple medical fields and specialties, and its development has continued in various areas, including anesthesiology25, emergency care27, 28, cardiology29, obstetrics30-32 and surgery33, 34. Simulation offers the possibility of making errors without risk of negative patient outcomes, such as death, misdiagnosis, complaints and claims19. Additionally, the negative emotions generated by failure or error, which are considered to be critical to the medical learning process, are experienced more constructively in a simulation context than they are in real life12. Simulation presents, therefore, the possibility of shifting the perspective of education from the conventional patient-centered approach to a newer and more innovative learner-centered approach5. Several authors have demonstrated the importance of integrating simulation technology into medical education, not only for skills training, but also for assessment of competency12, 19, 35, particularly in the fields of internal medicine, anesthesiology36 and minimally-invasive surgery37, as well as in obstetrics with the widely used maternal birthing simulators (CAE Fidelis Maternal Fetal Simulator; Gaumard's NOELLE® Maternal Birthing Simulator). Ultrasound simulators are integrated simulators, generally composed of a human mannequin, a mock probe and a computer. Usually, the mock probe is connected directly to the computer, whose screen displays the ultrasound image depending upon the probe's position and movements. Most of these simulators use electromagnetic tracking systems to define the probe's position. The mock probe usually contains a three-dimensional (3D) sensor, capable of acquiring virtual position data instantaneously. As these data are transferred to the computer, it evaluates the location and position of the probe on the mannequin and displays the related two-dimensional (2D) images38-43. A haptic device can be used instead of a mannequin, allowing measurement of the pressure applied to the probe and providing realistic feedback on this force44, 45. This, however, is limited in that it allows a lower range of movements to the probe, while lacking a simulated environment in the absence of a mannequin or a 'patient-look-alike' structure. Furthermore, variations in the pressure applied to the probe do not show differences in the force-feedback nor in image quality (in contrast to live scanning)46. Most of these systems provide a 3D animated illustration of the anatomy surrounding the probe and its position and relations with the different organs and systems44. This option is particularly useful in the first phases of training, in order to help the trainees to become familiar with ultrasound scanning ergonomy and improve their hand–eye coordination and to locate the insonation planes within the examined structure. This animated illustration can be hidden on demand or in the subsequent steps of training. Ultrasound simulators have been applied mainly to teach the basic skills of cardiac ultrasound examination to students and residents in emergency and internal medicine (Table 1). Over the last few years, several studies have investigated the effectiveness of simulation-based echocardiography training compared with conventional methods such as theoretical lectures and hands-on training on patients. Most of these studies have been underpowered, with limited sample size, but they suggest significant improvements among simulation-trained students with regards to anxiety levels, performance, efficiency, competence and recognition of clinical scenarios, as well as a high level of compliance and satisfaction4. Findings of these studies include, for example, that the use of echocardiographic simulators gave very positive results regarding motivation and a decrease in anxiety compared with examination of real patients47, while use of transesophageal echocardiographic simulation proved not only to be realistic and helpful50, but also to be superior to conventional methods of teaching48, 49. Simulation has also been found to be helpful for introducing to surgery residents the use of ultrasound in trauma cases51. CAE Vimedix Ultrasound Simulator System (CAE Healthcare, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) 12 third- or fourth-year medical students or physicians currently in their first 3 years of residency training CAE Vimedix Ultrasound Simulator System (CAE Healthcare, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) It has been established that there is improvement in knowledge and better recognition of clinical scenarios after training sessions on the simulator52, however, the necessity of supervised training even in simulation situations is still under debate. A study by Cawthorn et al.53 underlines the importance of supervised training, stating the necessity of combining both teaching methods. Simulators in the field of obstetric ultrasound appeared at the beginning of this century38. In 2003, Newey and colleagues50 used the virtual ultrasound scanner 'VirUS' to assess inter- and intraoperator repeatability of nuchal translucency thickness measurements among expert ultrasound operators and suggested its potential in operator training (Table 2). Comparison of training in first- and second-trimester screening by only theoretical lectures vs theoretical lectures & practical sessions on simulator In 2004, Maul et al.38 evaluated the SonoTrainerTM system for training in first- and second-trimester ultrasound screening. They divided 45 certified obstetricians into two groups, the first receiving theoretical and practical training on the SonoTrainerTM, and the second receiving only theoretical teaching. The results were significantly better in the former group, suggesting the utility of practical phantom training. However, the study did not demonstrate whether the improvement was related to the simulation training specifically or, more generally, to the fact that these operators had undergone hands-on training (Table 2). Staboulidou et al.54, in 2010, aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of simulation integrated into obstetric ultrasound training courses over 100 courses held with 1266 participants over 2 years. Each participant answered a questionnaire for evaluation of knowledge before and after the course. The results suggested a significant improvement of knowledge after completion of the course (P < 0.0001), although the specific contribution of simulation to any improvement was not clear (Table 2). Nitsche and Brost5, in 2013, underlined the utility of simulation training and proposed a 'fetal pig ultrasound training model' as an alternative to the expensive and still limited commercial models. This simulator consisted of a fetal pig heat-sealed within a formalin-filled plastic bag. While offering economic benefits, this model presents various limitations, including obvious anatomical differences from the human fetus (Table 2). A recent study by Burden and colleagues52 evaluated the trend of improvement among 26 participants, including 18 trainees and eight certified experts in obstetric ultrasound using virtual-reality ultrasound simulation. Participants performed five sequential modules measuring crown–rump length and three repetitions of a late-pregnancy growth scan. Outcome measures included mean percentage deviation from target measures and time needed to complete a scan. Even with the small sample size, results showed significant improvement over subsequent scans, particularly among the trainee group (Table 2). However, only five scans may be insufficient to demonstrate any real improvement in the participants' ultrasound technique. Transvaginal ultrasonography is particularly difficult to teach within a clinical setting, requiring extensive training time, experienced tutors with plenty of available time and a wide variety of compliant patients, both with normal and with pathological findings, who are willing to undergo examination on multiple occasions55. The transvaginal probe is a dedicated one, and displays anatomical structures in a way that is unique to this approach56, with ergonomy different from that of the transabdominal probe. Clearly these are limiting factors both for training and even more so for assessment of skills13, when the patient is usually a volunteer undergoing a supplementary scan, thus necessitating a search for complementary methods to implement in ultrasound educational programs44. Heer and colleagues13, in 2004, developed a software-based training system, with cases previously recorded during a normal pelvic examination defining interpolative model-based simulation (Table 3). In the first phase of the study, they evaluated the congruence of the actual gynecological scan with the virtual one, submitting three virtual cases to 25 sonologists experienced in gynecological ultrasound. Secondly, they tested the simulator on 24 fourth-year medical students with no experience in ultrasound. Following a 6-min presentation, the students were able to perform a basic pelvic scan on the simulator, including measurements of endometrial thickness comparable to the ones measured by expert sonographers. Training with this technique suggested that standardized ultrasound teaching and learning with the model was comparable to performing a live gynecological ultrasound scan. However, it could be argued that these conclusions might not be relevant in clinical practice as the judgment criteria used for assessment (uterus position, presence or absence of pathology, endometrial thickness measurement, demonstration of ovaries and pouch of Douglas) might have been too simple. Blue Phantom (Redmond, WA) female pelvis models 16 final-year medical students (ultrasound novices) + 12 Ob/Gyn consultants (experienced US practitioners) A prospective randomized controlled trial56 conducted on 134 medical students compared the effectiveness of transvaginal ultrasound training delivered using an ultrasound simulator with that delivered using volunteers. This study found that simulators did not perform as well as did live models, concluding that they should be regarded as an adjunct to, rather than a substitute for, live models. In a recent experimental study, Madsen et al.44 explored trainees' learning curves using a high-fidelity transvaginal ultrasound simulator, and tested the validity and reliability of the different metrics used. They compared results obtained by a group of 16 novices with those obtained by 12 consultants in obstetrics and gynecology, determining 48 metrics which could discriminate the level of expertise, and established the validity and reliability of the simulator in assessment of skill. Furthermore, they observed the trend of improvement of novices, finding them to reach a level considered suitable for clinical practice after 3–4 hours of virtual training. Whenever a new training method is implemented, ideally it should create a chain of impact at several levels. The most credible and most widely used training evaluation methodology in the world is the evaluation model that emerged from the work by Donald Kirkpatrick and Jack Phillips57, 58. It measures training outcomes at five levels, starting at reaction/planned action and ending with return on investment (ROI). The five levels are summarized as follows: Level 1 – Reaction and Satisfaction: of the participants to the training, usually measured in surveys, and their Planned Action (their plans to use what they have learned); Level 2 – Learning: assesses how much participants have learned (with pre- and post-tests); Level 3 - Behavior, Application and Implementation: assesses whether the skills and knowledge gained in training are applied and practiced in the workplace or have changed learners' behavior; Level 4 - Results: measures the extent to which the institutions' measures (output, quality, costs and time) have improved after training; although this can be considered as the goal of a strategy, it is important to go beyond this level of evaluation to verify that the program's costs do not outweigh its benefits; Level 5 - Return on Investment (ROI): the ultimate level of evaluation, this compares the benefits from the program with its cost59, 60. The evaluation of simulation in obstetric and gynecological ultrasound has until now remained mainly at Levels 1 and 2 of the Kirkpatrick and Phillips model. Most studies have evaluated reaction, satisfaction54 or learning38, 52. Although several ultrasound simulators currently available include measurement of time to complete tasks and accuracy of measurement, most studies have not yet evaluated the transfer to clinical practice of knowledge acquired during simulation training61. In addition to the measurable benefits, most training programs will have intangible benefits, including stress reduction and increased commitment of trainees, improved patient satisfaction, reduction of patient complaints as well as reduction or avoidance of conflict62. According to Phillips63: 'In some programs, the intangible (non monetary) benefits can be more important than tangible (monetary) measures. Consequently, these measures should be monitored and reported as part of the overall evaluation. The challenge is to efficiently identify and report them.' These benefits should also be addressed in the future. The best or most effective method of training students in obstetric and gynecological ultrasound has yet to be defined. The importance of hands-on repeat-training until proficiency is reached is well known, and has superseded the previous, no longer acceptable principle of 'see one, do one, teach one'46. So far, standardization of the teaching of ultrasound among different institutions and countries has been achieved neither for educational purposes nor for assessment of practitioners' skills and accreditation. In particular, given the high variability between people in the time and training needed to gain proficiency, it is unlikely that a minimum set number of scans can reflect adequately candidates' skills; some trainees reach a level of competency that is suitable for clinical practice after a few scans, while others need more time to reach the same level64. Thus, assessment of skill should be based on practical tests during which the candidate demonstrates their abilities, as in the 'competency-based' method proposed by RCOG10, 54. There is broad consensus on the utility of integrating virtual reality into ultrasound education and training programs6, 10, 12-14, 19, 21, 22, 38, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52-54, 61, 64-72. It has been proposed as a valid and reliable method for assessment of skills, implying its potential for use in accreditation procedures44. However, simulation might never replace completely clinical training and there will always be a need for tutor supervision53. It could be useful as a method for introducing students to ultrasound practice, allowing them to become familiar with image optimization and probe orientation, without being confronted with a clinical setting that might be stressful and disturbing44. Whilst the number of commercially available ultrasound simulators continues to increase (Table 4), they remain expensive devices which require maintenance and adequate training for their use. These factors may limit the widespread adoption of the technology. Some distributors claim that acquisition of simulators can be economically benefical45, by allowing trainees to improve their performance without monopolising ultrasound machines required in the clinical setting. However, not only do such claims need to be verified, but evaluation studies on their efficacy need to be performed, both of which rely on constructive interaction between clinicians and engineers.

The intent of the following list, therefore, is to aid future studies by demonstrating the range of material available and by describing the texts more fully than has yet been done. Additionally, to give the reader a sense of the wealth of information these texts contain relating to medieval views of the female body, childbirth, and generation, I also include as an appendix an anno­ tated transcription of a short treatise from London, British Library, manu­ script Egerton 827. In the few notices that have appeared of the Middle English obstetrical and gynecological texts, considerable confusion has been engendered owing to a lack of information about the Latin writings upon which English trans­ lators drew. Thus both Hallaert and Rowland incorrectly identified their texts as an English translation of one of the few Latin gynecological texts with which they were familiar, the ensemble of twelfth-century treatises attributed to the healer Trota, or Trotula, of Salerno.7 The three Salernitan gynecological and cosmetic works were indeed the most popular and widely disseminated texts on women's medical concerns in medieval Europe,8 but they were by no means the only Latin source from 6 I havebeen greatly aided in this research by the series ofnotecards compiled by Dorothea Waley Singer, \"Handlist ofWestern Scientific Manuscripts in Great Britain and Ireland Dating from Before the Sixteenth...", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1353/sac.1992.0002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2782015000", "source": "openalex"}

In total, 2158 patients with pathologically proven stage IB–IIA cervical cancer with any intermediate-risk factor after radical hysterectomy were randomly assigned to two groups, a development group and a validation group, at a ratio of 3 : 1 (1620 patients:538 patients). To predict recurrence, multivariate models were developed using the development group. The ability of the models to discriminate between groups was validated using the log-rank test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Four factors (histology, tumour size, deep stromal invasion (DSI), and lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI)) were significantly associated with disease recurrence and included in the models. Among the nine possible combinations of the four variables, models consisting of any two of the four intermediate-risk factors (tumour size ⩾3 cm, DSI of the outer third of the cervix, LVSI, and adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma histology) demonstrated the best performance for predicting recurrence. This study identified a 'four-factor model' in which the presence of any two factors may be useful for predicting recurrence in patients with cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2013.716", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2093079199", "source": "openalex"}

Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) have emerged as a valuable treatment option for hormone dependent conditions like uterine fibroids, which have a major impact on women's quality of life. SPRMs offer potential for longer term medical treatment and thereby patients may avoid surgical intervention.The authors have reviewed the functional role of the progesterone receptor and its isoforms and their molecular mechanisms of action via genomic and non-genomic pathways. The current knowledge of the interaction of the PR and different SPRMs tested in clinical trials has been reviewed. The authors focused on pharmacological effects of selected SPRMs on the endometrium, their anti-proliferative action, and their suppression of bleeding. Potential underlying molecular mechanisms and the specific histological changes in the endometrium induced by SPRMs (PAEC; Progesterone receptor modulator Associated Endometrial Changes) have been discussed. The clinical potential of this compound class including its impact on quality of life has been covered.Clinical studies indicate SPRMs hold promise for treatment of benign gynecological complaints (fibroids, heavy menstrual bleeding; HMB).

The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not vaginal elasticity or lack of lubrication is associated with deep or superficial dyspareunia. We investigated gynecological cancer survivors treated with radiation therapy.Methods. In a population-based study with 616 women answering a questionnaire (participation rate 78%) and who were treated with radiotherapy for gynecological cancer, we analyzed information from 243 women (39%) who reported that they had had intercourse during the previous six months. Analyses included log-binomial regression (relative risks) and multiple imputations by chained equations in combination with Bayesian Model Averaging, yielding a posterior probability value. Age range of this cancer recurrent-free group of women was 29–80.Results. Dyspareunia affected 164 of 243 of the women (67%). One hundred thirty-four women (55%) reported superficial pain, 97 women (40%) reported deep pain, and 87 women (36%) reported both types of dyspareunia. The relative risk (RR) of deep dyspareunia was 1.87 (CI 1.41–2.49) with impaired vaginal elasticity compared to normal vaginal elasticity. Age and lower abdominal swelling were separate risk factors for deep dyspareunia. However, effects remain after adjusting for these factors.Conclusion. The relative risk of deep dyspareunia was almost twice as high with impaired vaginal elasticity compared to normal vaginal elasticity. If we wish to treat or even prevent deep dyspareunia in women with gynecological cancer, we may use our knowledge of the pathophysiology of deep dyspareunia and increasingly provide dilators together with instructions on how to use them for stretching exercises in order to retain vaginal elasticity. Results highlight the need for studies with more precise questions distinguishing superficial from deep dyspareunia so that in the future we may be able to primarily try to avoid reduced vaginal elasticity and secondarily reduce the symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/0284186x.2014.1001036", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001396785", "source": "openalex"}

Computerized tomography images at the third lumbar vertebra were used to assess SM. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated in the range from -29 to +150 Hounsfield Units; reduced muscle attenuation (range, -29 to +29 HU) was classified as low-radiodensity skeletal muscle index (LRSMI). By subtracting the LRSMI area from total SMI, high-radiodensity skeletal muscle index (HRSMI) was created. Sarcopenia was defined when SMI was less than 38.9 cm/m. Multiple logistic regression evaluated predictors of surgical complications.Patients in lower HRSMI quartiles and in the highest quartiles of LRSMI had more postoperative surgical complication and had prolonged hospital stay. Both sarcopenia and the quality indicators of SM were predictors of increased risk of surgical complication, HRSMI being the strongest predictor. However, in a combined adjustment with sarcopenia, only HRSMI remained in the model as an independent predictor for surgical complication. In addition, HRSMI was the only indicator associated with early mortality (<30 days).The indicators of SM quality were the most significant predictors of surgical complications. Classifying muscle quality in terms of low-radiodensity or high-radiodensity area is a promising strategy to understand the impact of SM quality on unfavorable surgical outcomes in cancer patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000001157", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2778172366", "source": "openalex"}

Cyclin D1 has been reported as a diagnostic immunomarker for high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma with an YWHAE-FAM22 rearrangement. YWHAE-FAM22 endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) represent a clinically aggressive subtype of ESS classified as high-grade endometrial sarcomas, and its distinction from the usual low-grade ESS with JAZF1 rearrangement and from HGUS with no identifiable molecular aberration may be important in guiding clinical management. Median age of the patients is between 55 and 60 years. The most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and increasing abdominal girth.Disease is usually advanced with approximately 70% of the patients staged III to IV according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification. Preferential metastatic locations include peritoneum, lungs, intra-abdominal lymph nodes, and bone. Median progression-free survival ranged from 7 to 10 months, and median overall survival ranged from 11 to 23 months. There is no clear prognostic factor identified for HGUS, not even stage. The standard management for HGUS consists of total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Systematic lymphadenectomy is not recommended.

METHODS: All original papers published in 2005 and 2006 in four leading obstetrics and gynecology journals were manually searched for the use of logistic regression. One hundred four articles that used logistic regression were randomly selected (13 from each journal and each year) and evaluated according to previously established criteria for reporting logistic regression analyses. Rates of compliance with these criteria were calculated separately for each journal and weighted according to the number of articles using logistic regression in each of the journals in the same period to obtain an overall estimate. RESULTS: Logistic regression was used in 34.2% of all original research articles (724 of 2,234) in the four journals for the study period. Statistical significance of estimates was reported in 96% of examined articles. Criteria of variable selection for the logistic regression model were reported in 76% of articles, and coding of variables was described in 83%. Overfitting (models with too many variables for the number of outcome events) occurred in 57% of studies. The majority of examined articles insufficiently reported information for the remaining criteria—testing for interactions (18%), conformity to a linear gradient of continuous variables (9%), goodness of fit (3.6%), assessment of multi-collinearity (0.46%), and validation of the model (0%). CONCLUSION: Logistic regression has become a standard statistical method in obstetrics and gynecology literature. Although some standards are mostly fulfilled, there is still considerable room for improvement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Logistic regression is commonly used in the obstetrics and gynecology literature, but its reporting is often inadequate.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e318160f38e", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2050546713", "source": "openalex"}

Gynecologists then began to employ minimally invasive surgery for adhesiolysis and obtaining biopsies but then expanded its use to include procedures such as tubal sterilization (Clyman (1963), L. E. Smale and M. L. Smale (1973), Thompson and Wheeless (1971), Peterson and Behrman (1971)). With advances in instrumentation, the first laparoscopic hysterectomy was successfully performed in 1989 by Reich et al. At the same time, minimally invasive surgery in gynecologic oncology was being developed alongside its benign counterpart. In the 1975s, Rosenoff et al. reported using peritoneoscopy for pretreatment evaluation in ovarian cancer, and Spinelli et al. reported on using laparoscopy for the staging of ovarian cancer. In 1993, Nichols used operative laparoscopy to perform pelvic lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer patients. The initial goals of minimally invasive surgery, not dissimilar to those of modern medicine, were to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with surgery and therefore improve patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. This review will summarize the history and use of minimally invasive surgery in gynecologic oncology and also highlight new minimally invasive surgical approaches currently in development.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/312982", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2033889428", "source": "openalex"}

In light of the fact that human papillomavirus (HPV) is a prerequisite for virtually every case of cervical cancer and genital warts occurring worldwide, vaccination may be the most effective mechanism to prevent HPV infection and HPV-associated disease. HPV vaccines are created from noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid protein, L1, that closely mimic natural HPV virions. Proof-of-principle trials of monovalent vaccines that protect against high-risk HPV types such as HPV 16 or 18 have confirmed that intramuscular injection with VLPs induces the production of HPV type-specific neutralizing antibodies. A bivalent vaccine incorporating oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 was shown to be safe, well tolerated, and 100% efficacious in preventing persistent HPV infection. A quadrivalent vaccine that protects against genital wart-causing HPV types (HPV 6 and 11) and oncogenic HPV types (HPV 16 and 18) demonstrated 100% efficacy in preventing clinical disease.

AIMS In this best practice document, we propose recommendations for the use of LASER for gynecologic and urologic conditions such as vulvovaginal atrophy, urinary incontinence, vulvodynia, and lichen sclerosus based on a thorough literature review. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS This project was developed between January and September 2018. The development of this document followed the ICS White Paper Standard Operating Procedures. RESULTS Most of the available studies are limited by their design; for example they lack a control group, patients are not randomized, follow up is short term, series are small, LASER is not compared with standard treatments, and studies are industry sponsored. Due to these limitations, the level of evidence for the use of LASER in the treatment of these conditions remains low and does not allow for definitive recommendations for its use in routine clinical practice. Histological evidence is commonly reported as proof of tissue regeneration following LASER treatment. However, the histological changes noted can also be consistent with reparative changes after a thermal injury rather than necessarily representing regeneration or restoration of function. The use of LASER in women with vulvodynia or lichen sclerosus should not be recommended in routine clinical practice. There is no biological plausibility or safety data on its use on this population of women. DISCUSSION The available clinical studies do not present convincing data regarding the efficacy of LASER for the treatment of vaginal atrophy or urinary incontinence. Also, while short‐term complications seem to be uncommon, data concerning long‐term outcomes are lacking. CONCLUSION At this point, LASER is not recommended for routine treatment of the aforementioned conditions unless part of well‐designed clinical trials or with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.23931", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2913870812", "source": "openalex"}

LSD1 is highly expressed in numerous human malignancies and has recently emerged as a target for anticancer drugs. Owing to the presence of several functional domains, we speculated that LSD1 could have additional functions other than histone demethylation. P62 &ndash; also termed sequestasome 1 (SQSTM1) &ndash; plays a key role in malignant transformation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Here, we show that a high LSD1 expression promotes tumorigenesis in gynecologic malignancies. Notably, LSD1 inhibition with either siRNA or pharmacological agents activates autophagy. Mechanistically, LSD1 decreases p62 protein stability in a demethylation-independent manner. Inhibition of LSD1 reduces both tumor growth and p62 protein degradation in vivo . The combination of LSD1 inhibition and p62 knockdown exerts additive anticancer effects. We conclude that LSD1 destabilizes p62 and inhibits autophagy in gynecologic cancers. LSD1 inhibition reduces malignant cell growth and activates autophagy. The combinations of LSD1 inhibition and autophagy blockade display additive inhibitory effect on cancer cell viability. A better understanding of the role played by p62 will shed more light on the anticancer effects of LSD1 inhibitors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.20158", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2743431531", "source": "openalex"}

The therapeutic impact of concurrent ± maintenance BEV with standard chemotherapy (CT) was evaluated in an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Methods: Eligible patients had newly diagnosed, previously untreated EOC, PPC or FTC following abdominal surgery for staging and maximal effort at tumor debulking; stage III (macroscopic residual disease) or stage IV disease. The randomly allocated regimens were (1) CT (IV paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 + carboplatin AUC 6 cycles 1-6) + placebo cycles (C)2-22 (R1) (2) CT + concurrent BEV (15 mg/kg) C2-6 + placebo C7-22 (R2) (3) CT + concurrent BEV C2-6 + maintenance BEV C7-22 (R3) Infusions were administered d1 of a 21d cycle. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) (radiographic, CA125, clinical criteria or death); secondary endpoints include overall survival, safety, and QoL. Results: 1,873 patients, median age 60, were enrolled from 9/05 - 6/09. Stage III optimally debulked (34%), stage III sub-optimally debulked (40%), and stage IV (26%) patients were similarly distributed in each treatment group. Grade 3 - 4 hypertension was reported in 1.6% (R1), 5.4% (R2), and 10.0% (R3). Grade ≥ 3 GI perforation, hemorrhage or fistula occurred in 0.8% (R1), 2.6% (R2) and 2.3% (R3). Relative to R1, the hazard of first progression or death for R2 was 0.908 (95% CI: 0.795 – 1.04, p=0.16) and for R3 was 0.717 (95% CI: 0.625 – 0.824, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that front-line treatment of EOC, PPC, and FTC patients with CT plus concurrent and maintenance BEV prolongs PFS.

Addressing the learner's source of anxiety and discomfort can ease the learning experience and lead to better outcomes. The aim of this study was to find out the effect of a simulation-based course, using simulated patients and simulated gynecologic models on student anxiety and comfort while practicing to provide intrauterine device (IUD) services. Methods Fifty-six eligible midwifery students were randomly allocated into simulation-based and traditional training groups. They participated in a 12-hour workshop in providing IUD services. The simulation group was trained through an educational program including simulated gynecologic models and simulated patients. The students in both groups then practiced IUD consultation and insertion with real patients in the clinic. The students' anxiety in IUD insertion was assessed using the \"Spielberger anxiety test\" and the \"comfort in providing IUD services\" questionnaire. Results There were significant differences between students in 2 aspects of anxiety including state (P < 0.001) and trait (P = 0.024) and the level of comfort (P = 0.000) in providing IUD services in simulation and traditional groups. \"Fear of uterine perforation during insertion\" was the most important cause of students' anxiety in providing IUD services, which was reported by 74.34% of students. Conclusions Simulated patients and simulated gynecologic models are effective in optimizing students' anxiety levels when practicing to deliver IUD services. Therefore, it is recommended that simulated patients and simulated gynecologic models be used before engaging students in real clinical practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/sih.0b013e31826064b7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978090671", "source": "openalex"}

These energy sources include monopolar electrosurgery, bipolar electrosurgery (including \"advanced bipolar\" devices that incorporate tissue feedback monitoring), and various types of laser and ultrasonic technologies. Gynecologists using these tools should be aware of the potential benefits and potential dangers of these instruments. Objective This review provides an overview of the biophysics of these energy sources, their tissue effects, and the complications that may arise. It aims to highlight any potential advantages or disadvantages of various energy sources, as reported by clinical and laboratory studies. Evidence Acquisition Literature relating to energy sources used in gynecologic laparoscopy was reviewed. Results While laboratory-based studies have reported differences between various energy sources, these differences may not be clinically significant. The choice of instrumentation may depend on the nature of the surgical task being performed, but other factors, such as the surgeon's training/experience, cost, and industry marketing, may also influence the decision. Conclusions An awareness of the pros and cons of each energy modality and their relative efficacy profiles is paramount. Relevance: It is important that surgeons have an understanding of the biophysics of these technologies in order to understand their limitations and potential dangers and to utilize the most appropriate energy source(s) in the appropriate clinical setting, in order to both minimize the risk of inadvertent injuries during gynecologic laparoscopy and to maximize cost-efficient delivery of health care. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians Learning Objectives After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to analyze the principle biophysics of electrosurgery and its application to surgery, evaluate the types of injuries that can occur when using energy sources in gynecologic laparoscopy and how these injuries can be minimized, and compare the properties of different laparoscopic energy sources, highlighting the potential advantages and disadvantages of each device.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0000000000000130", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068238757", "source": "openalex"}

Sanger sequencing of cancer cell lines, primary tumors, and matched normal tissues confirmed the JAK1 mutations and showed that these mutations are somatic. JAK1 mediates interferon (IFN)-γ-regulated tumor immune surveillance. Functional assays show that JAK1 deficient cancer cells are defective in IFN-γ-induced LMP2 and TAP1 expression, loss of which inhibits presentation of tumor antigens. These findings identify recurrent JAK1 truncating mutations that could contribute to tumor immune evasion in gynecologic cancers, especially in endometrial cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep03042", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039164450", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to compare the costs and clinical outcomes of conventional laparoscopy vs robotic-assisted laparoscopy in the gynecologic oncologic indications.Between 2007 and 2010, 312 patients referred for gynecologic oncologic indications (endometrial and cervical cancer), including 226 who underwent conventional laparoscopy and 80 who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopy, were included in this prospective multicenter study. The direct costs, operating theater costs, and hospital costs were calculated for both surgical strategies using the microcosting method.Based on an average number of 165 surgical cases performed per year with the robot, the total extra cost of using the robot was €1456 per intervention. The robot-specific costs amounted to €2213 per intervention, and the cost of the robot-specific surgical supplies was €957 per intervention. The cost of the surgical supplies specifically required by conventional laparoscopy amounted to €1432, which is significantly higher than that of the robotic supplies (P < 0.001). Hospital costs were lower in the case of the robotic strategy (€2380 vs €2841, P < 0.001) because these patients spent less time in intensive care (0.38 vs 0.85 days). Operating theater costs were higher in the case of the robotic strategy (€1490 vs €1311, P = 0.0004) because the procedure takes longer to perform (4.98 hours vs 4.38 hours).The main driver of additional costs is the fixed cost of the robot, which is not compensated by the lower hospital room costs. The robot would be more cost-effective if robotic interventions were performed on a larger number of patients per year or if the purchase price of the robot was reduced. A shorter learning curve would also no doubt decrease the operating theater costs, resulting in financial benefits to society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000458", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2333531372", "source": "openalex"}

The vagina is a clean–contaminated environment, and it is not possible to insert polypropylene mesh devices without bacterial contamination, despite standard antibiotic usage. Once inserted, the host tissue immediately attaches to the polypropylene and attempts to defend it from bacterial invasion, but if the bacteria have already reached the surface of the device, then dislodgement is difficult. The devices with larger surface areas result in greater bacterial contamination, more polypropylene degradation, increased inflammatory response, fibrous tissue stimulation, and erosion. Noninert polypropylene degrades into potentially toxic compounds that would be expected to stimulate a greater inflammatory reaction leading to erosion. If the physician does not place the mesh below full-thickness vaginal epithelium, penetrates the epithelium during insertion, or if there is hematoma formation near the vaginal incision, then defective healing and erosion may result. Scar tissue causes contraction to less than 50% of the implanted size, which results in dyspareunia and tension on the pelvic mesh attachments. Such contraction may cause pelvic pain and subsequent erosion into adjacent organs. An individual response in fibrosis also exists, with some individuals being \"high responders.\" Manufacturers need encouragement to develop meshes that are inert and incorporate without contraction along with routine clinical tests to detect \"high responders\" to avoid complications. Polypropylene is not inert within the human body. Host reaction to noninert polypropylene mesh determines whether erosion or incorporation into tissue occurs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e3181f39b20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2326444148", "source": "openalex"}

Several epidemiological studies observed an association between T2D and increased risk of many types of cancer, such as gynecologic neoplasms (endometrial, cervical, ovarian and vulvar cancer). Insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and high free ovarian steroid hormones are considered the possible mechanisms behind this complex relationship. A higher risk of endometrial cancer was observed in T2D, even though this association largely attenuated after adjusting for obesity. A clear relationship between the incidence of cervical cancer (CC) and T2D has still not be determined; however T2D might have an impact on prognosis in patients with CC. To date, studies on the association between T2D and ovarian cancer (OC) are limited. The effect of pre-existing diabetes on cancer-specific mortality has been evaluated in several studies, with less clear results. Other epidemiological and experimental studies focused on the potential role of diabetes medications, mainly metformin, in cancer development in women.

Recent studies have confirmed the presence of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification on mammalian mRNAs, mainly modified by NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2), but little is known about the underlying functions of m5C. Gynecologic cancers are malignancies starting from women's reproductive organs. The prevalence of gynecologic cancers leads to a massive economic burden and public health concern. In this study, we investigated the potential biological functions of NSUN2 in common gynecologic cancers including cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. Remarkably, distinct scenarios were found. The levels of NSUN2 did not show alteration in endometrial cancer, and in ovarian cancer, depletion of upregulated NSUN2 did not reduce carcinogenesis in cancer cells, suggesting that the upregulated NSUN2 might be an incidental effect. On the contrary, NSUN2 played a role in tumorigenesis of cervical cancer; depletion of upregulated NSUN2 notably inhibited migration and invasion of cancer cells, and only wild-type but not catalytically inactive NSUN2 rescued these malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Mechanistically, NSUN2 promoted migration and invasion by leading to m5C methylation on keratin 13 (KRT13) transcripts, and methylated KRT13 transcripts would be recognized and stabilized by an m5C reader, Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1). Collectively, these results not only displayed the nature of diversity among human malignancies, but also demonstrated a novel NSUN2-dependent m5C-YBX1-KRT13 oncogenic regulatory pathway.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.786266", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4214577980", "source": "openalex"}

Multiple linear regression models were used to explore the effect that amount of time spent in specialized ultrasound units and clinical experience had on trainees' confidence in performing ultrasonography independently. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify factors that contributed to trainees' confidence in performing ultrasonography. Trainees' ultrasound confidence was finally compared with their expected levels of performance . Results Of the 682 respondents (response rate 70.1%), 621 met the inclusion criteria. Clinical experience and time spent in specialized ultrasound units were predictors of trainees' confidence in performing ultrasonography independently ( P &lt; 0.001). Trainees required more than 24 months of clinical experience and 12–24 days of training in specialized ultrasound units in order to feel confident about performing transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound scans independently. Three factors were related to ultrasound confidence: technical aspects, image perception and integration of scan into patient care.

The potential longer-term effects on these and other domains of functioning have received little empirical attention. The purpose of this study was to follow up patients who had received general anesthesia plus epidural fentanyl and lidocaine before (group 1) or after (group 2) incision or general anesthesia plus a sham epidural (group 3). Methods Patients were contacted approximately 3 weeks and 6 months after surgery. A follow-up pain questionnaire and the McGill Pain Questionnaire were administered by telephone. The Mental Health Inventory and Pain Disability Index were mailed to patients, completed, and mailed back. Results One hundred thirty-one of the 141 patients (93%) were reached 3 weeks after surgery (n = 41, n = 48, and n = 42 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively), and 109 (77%) were reached at 6 months (n = 35, n = 37, and n = 37 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that that even after controlling for age and presence or absence of preoperative pain, Pain Disability Index scores (mean +/- SD) at the first follow-up were significantly lower in group 1 (17.3 +/-12.8) and group 2 (18.1 +/-17.0) compared with group 3 (26.3 +/- 18.3). McGill Pain Questionnaire and Mental Health Inventory scores did not differ significantly among the groups. There were no significant differences at the 6-month follow-up.

Next-generation sequencing of plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers less invasive, more convenient collection, and a more real-time representation of a tumor and its molecular heterogeneity than tissue. However, little is known about the clinical implications of ctDNA assessment in gynecologic cancer. We describe the molecular landscape identified on ctDNA, ctDNA concordance with tissue-based analysis, and factors associated with overall survival (OS) in gynecologic cancer patients with ctDNA analysis. We reviewed clinicopathologic and genomic information for 105 consecutive gynecologic cancer patients with ctDNA analysis, including 78 with tissue-based sequencing, enrolled in the Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (NCT02478931) trial at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center starting July 2014. Tumors included ovarian (47.6%), uterine (35.2%), cervical (12.4%), vulvovaginal (2.9%), and unknown gynecologic primary (1.9%). Most ovarian and uterine cancers (86%) were high grade. 34% (N = 17) of ovarian cancers had BRCA alterations, and 22% (N = 11) were platinum sensitive. Patients received median 2 (range 0-13) lines of therapy prior to ctDNA collection. Most (75.2%) had at least one characterized alteration on ctDNA analysis, and the majority had unique genomic profiles on ctDNA.

Patients and Methods Patients with locally advanced cervix cancer were randomly assigned to CIS chemoradiotherapy versus CIS/TPZ chemoradiotherapy. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and tolerability. Results PFS was evaluable in 387 of 402 patients randomly assigned over 36 months, with enrollment ending in September 2009. Because of the lack of TPZ supply, the study did not reach its original target accrual goal. At median follow-up of 28.3 months, PFS and OS were similar in both arms. Three-year PFS for the TPZ/CIS/RT and CIS/RT arms were 63.0% and 64.4%, respectively (log-rank P = .7869). Three-year OS for the TPZ/CIS/RT and CIS/RT arms were 70.5% and 70.6%, respectively (log-rank P = .8333). A scheduled interim safety analysis led to a reduction in the starting dose for the TPZ/CIS arm, with resulting tolerance in both treatment arms. Conclusion TPZ/CIS chemoradiotherapy was not superior to CIS chemoradiotherapy in either PFS or OS, although definitive commentary was limited by an inadequate number of events (progression or death). TPZ/CIS chemoradiotherapy was tolerable at a modified starting dose.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2013.51.4265", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2161891567", "source": "openalex"}

Methods A total of 60 patients undergoing gynecologic surgery were randomized to one of five groups. Patients received 15 mg bupivacaine plus 2 ml of the test drug intrathecally (saline, 100 microg morphine, or 1-5 microg neostigmine). The control group received spinal saline as the test drug. The morphine group received spinal morphine as test drug. The morphine + 1 microg neostigmine group received spinal morphine and 1 microg neostigmine. The morphine + 2.5 microg neostigmine group received spinal morphine and 2.5 microg neostigmine. Finally, the morphine + 5 microg neostigmine group received spinal morphine and 5 microg neostigmine. Results The groups were demographically similar. The time to first rescue analgesic (minutes) was longer for all patients who received intrathecal morphine combined with 1-5 microg neostigmine (median, 6 h) compared with the control group (median, 3 h) (P &lt; 0.02). The morphine group (P &lt; 0.05) and the groups that received the combination of 100 microg intrathecal morphine combined with neostigmine (P &lt; 0.005) required less rescue analgesics in 24 h compared with the control group. The incidence of perioperative adverse effects was similar among groups (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions The addition of 1-5 microg spinal neostigmine to 100 microg morphine doubled the duration to first rescue analgesic in the population studied and decreased the analgesic consumption in 24 h, without increasing the incidence of adverse effects. The data suggest that low-dose spinal neostigmine may improve morphine analgesia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200302000-00031", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077593805", "source": "openalex"}

However, there is discrepancy regarding the spaces and their limits between clinical anatomy and gynecologic surgery, as not every avascular space described in literature is delimited by at least two fasciae. Moreover, new spaces and surgical planes have been developed after the adoption of laparoscopy and nerve-sparing gynecological procedures. Avascular spaces are useful anatomical landmarks in retroperitoneal anatomic and pelvic surgery for both malignant and benign conditions. A noteworthy fact is that for various gynecological diseases, there are different approaches to the avascular spaces of the female pelvis. This is a significant difference, which is best demonstrated by dissection of these spaces for gynecological, urogynecological, and oncogynecological operations. Thorough knowledge regarding pelvic anatomy of these spaces is vital to minimize morbidity and mortality. In this article, we defined nine avascular female pelvic spaces—their boundaries, different approaches, attention during dissection, and applications in obstetrics and gynecology. We described the fourth space and separate the paravesical and pararectal space, as nerve-sparing gynecological procedures request a precise understanding of retroperitoneal spaces.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051460", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3024781940", "source": "openalex"}

Data from 313 patients were collected. Twenty patients with pre-existing edema or missing information were excluded before analysis. Time-to-LLL was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate and potential risk factors were evaluated by a Cox regression model.Estimated prevalence of LLL one year after surgery was 32%, increasing to 58% eight years after surgery. Median time to diagnosis of LLL was 5.2 years. The number of removed lymph nodes was significantly associated with time-to-LLL. Diagnosis of postoperative lymphocysts and local infections were accompanied by a significantly elevated risk for the development of LLL. Furthermore, time-to-LLL decreased with a higher body mass index (BMI) of the patient. In contrast, chemo- and radiotherapy, age, positive LNs, site of lymphadenectomy, and type of cancer were not observed to be associated with the occurrence of LLL.LLL is a frequent postoperative complication in patients undergoing lymphadenectomy for gynecological malignancies. It is thus imperative to sufficiently educate patients about the risk and symptoms of LLL prior to surgery. The data clearly show an association between time-to-LLL and number of dissected LNs, stressing the need to prospectively analyze the prevalence of LLL and carefully plan LN sampling as increasing knowledge is gained regarding the therapeutic benefit of sentinel and systemic lymphadenectomy in patients with different stages of gynecological malignancies.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1606366511", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, surgical management regarding LNE worldwide is very heterogeneous. Methods: Prospective randomized trial including patients with newly diagnosed AOC FIGO IIB-IV with macroscopic complete resection and pre- and intra-operatively clinical negative LN were randomized intra-operatively to LNE versus no-LNE. All centers had to qualify regarding surgical skills before participation in this trial. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Results: 647 patients were randomized between 12/08 and 1/12 to LNE (n=323) or no-LNE (n=324). The median number of removed LN in patients randomized to LNE was 57 (pelvic 35 and para-aortic22). Post-op platinum-taxane based chemotherapy was applied in 85% of the patients in the no-LNE arm and 80% in the LNE arm. Microscopic metastases were diagnosed in 56% of the pts in the LNE arm. Median OS in the no-LNE arm was 69 months and 66 months in the LNE arm (HR 1.06, 95%CI 0.83-1.34, p=0.65) and the median PFS was 26 months in both arms (HR 1.11, 95%CI 0.92-1.34 p=0.30). Surgery in the LNE arm was 64 minutes longer (means: 352 vs 288 min), resulted in a higher median blood loss (650 vs 500 ml), and a higher transfusion rate (67% vs 59%).

Materials and Methods From 2009 to 2015, 47 lesions from 28 patients were treated with SABR and retrospectively analyzed. All patients had oligometastatic (93%) or oligoprogressive (7%) disease. Primary cancer diagnoses were 15 ovarian, 8 endometrial, 2 cervical, 2 vaginal, and 1 uterine carcinosarcoma. Treatment was delivered using a median of 5 fractions to a median total dose of 40 Gy. Targets were grouped by treatment site and assessed for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. Mean biologically effective dose and pre-SABR tumor size were compared with response. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and toxicity outcomes were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Results Median follow-up was 12.8 months. Target locations were 17% liver, 21% lung, 17% paraaortic node, 26% other node, and 19% pelvic soft tissue. After treatment, 34% of targets were stable (SD), 32% had a partial response (PR), 17% had a complete response (CR), and 17% had progressive disease (PD). No failures occurred in lung or nodal targets. Mean ± standard deviation pre-SABR tumor diameter was 24 ± 22 mm. There was a significant difference in mean size between lesions that had a favorable (SD, PR, and CR) versus unfavorable response (PD) (17.2 vs 57.6 mm, P = 0.0044).

In ovarian cancer, many reports combine the assessment of medical images with the multi‐omics analysis of clinical and genomic data using artificial intelligence. However, few study results can be implemented in clinical practice, and further research is needed in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14818", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3160498810", "source": "openalex"}

Preservation of fertility should be discussed with premenopausal women with early-stage gynecologic cancer shortly after diagnosis and, for women who desire to preserve fertility, during treatment planning. Many authors have investigated both oncologic and reproductive outcomes following fertility-sparing therapy, and there is ongoing development of assisted reproduction techniques available to cancer patients and survivors. Women with early-stage (IA1-IB1) cervical cancer may be candidates for fertility-sparing cervical conization, simple trachelectomy, or radical trachelectomy. In women with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer, fertility-sparing surgery appears safe overall, although controversy remains in patients with high-risk features (eg, high pathologic grade, clear cell histology, or stage IC disease). In women with low-grade, early-stage endometrial cancer, hormonal therapy has emerged as a viable option. Criteria for patient selection for fertility-sparing therapy are not well defined, thus patients and providers must carefully discuss potential risks and benefits. In general, in carefully selected patients, survival outcomes do not appear to differ significantly between radical and fertility-sparing approaches. Women who undergo fertility-sparing therapies may experience a number of fertility and obstetric complications. Preconception counseling with high-risk obstetric specialists is important to optimize health before a woman attempts to conceive. Identifying appropriate candidates for fertility-sparing treatments, assessing fertility potential, and helping women conceive after cancer treatment is best accomplished through multidisciplinary collaboration between gynecologic oncologists and fertility specialists.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001328", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3036057900", "source": "openalex"}

Our findings may be useful in future cancer patient management. The study introduces a size-based enrichment (MetaCell(®)) method for the separation of viable CTCs, followed by CTCs culturing in vitro and gene expression characterization. It is based on the observation of CTCs and DTCs (Disseminated Tumor Cells) in several case studies of ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancer by means of cytomorphology and gene expression profiling. The viability of the enriched CTCs was estimated using vital and lethal fluorescence nuclear staining. This type of staining may be predictive for the success rate of subsequent CTC growth in vitro. To identify CTCs in the enriched CTC fraction, cytomorphological evaluations based on vital fluorescence staining were followed by gene expression analysis of tumor-associated (TA) genes. Cytokeratin expression (KRT7, KRT19) was analyzed in combination with MUC1, MUC16, CD24, CD44 and ALDH1. Gene expression analysis has shown that short-term in vitro culture enhanced the differentiation process of the captured CTCs growing on a membrane. On the other hand, redundant white blood cells captured on the membrane were eliminated during a short-term culture. The most frequently elevated genes in ovarian cancer (serous type) are EPCAM, KRT19 and MUC1. It has been demonstrated that CTC presence revealed by cytomorphological evaluation may be usefully complemented by TA-gene expression analysis, to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1628107544", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma registered in the Swedish Quality Registry for Gynecologic Cancer 2010-2017 with FIGO stages I-III and verified nodal status were identified (n = 1587). LVSI together with established risk factors, namely DNA ploidy, FIGO grade, myometrial invasion and age, were included in multivariable regression analyses with lymph node metastases as the dependent variable. Associations between the risk factors and overall and relative survival were included in multivariable models. Estimates of risk ratios (RR), hazard ratios (HR), excess mortality rate ratios (EMR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.Results: The presence of LVSI presented the strongest association with lymph node metastases (RR = 5.46, CI 3.69-8.07, p < .001) followed by deep myometrial invasion (RR = 1.64, CI 1.13-2.37). In the multivariable survival analyses, LVSI (EMR = 7.69, CI 2.03-29.10,) and non-diploidy (EMR = 3.23, CI 1.25-8.41) were associated with decreased relative survival. In sub-analyses including only patients with complete para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy and negative lymph nodes (n = 404), only LVSI (HR = 2.50, CI 1.05-5.98) was associated with a worsened overall survival.Conclusion: This large nationwide study identified LVSI as the strongest independent risk factor for lymph node metastases and decreased survival in patients with endometrioid adenocarcinomas.

This study examines the direct and/or indirect pathways among acculturation, social support, depressive symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) for Korean immigrant breast and gynecological cancer survivors. Design. The QOL-Cancer Survivor measure was translated and then administered to 51 survivors. This tool measured acculturation by assessing westernization, language barriers, and length of stay. In addition, the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 was used to assess depressive symptoms. Social support components were conceptualized as comprising both functional social support and social network structures. Results. Structural equation modeling identified significant relationships among acculturation, social support, depressive symptoms, and QOL. Higher acculturation was associated with positive network structures (larger network size, diversity, and closer social ties) and lower depressive symptoms, which in turn contributed to better QOL. Simultaneously, positive social network structures strongly correlated with better emotional support and, thus, influenced lower depressive symptoms. Conclusions. The evidence that acculturation influences QOL through social support for Korean immigrant cancer survivors should serve as a rationale for developing psychosocial interventions that enhance immigrant cancer survivors' social participation and adjustment in the unfamiliar US environment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13557850802009488", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072658180", "source": "openalex"}

There has been a corresponding increase in the number of ART-related procedures such as hysterosalpingography (HSG), saline infusion sonography (SIS), hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, oocyte retrieval, and embryo transfer (ET). While performing these procedures, the abdomen, upper vagina, and endocervix are breached, leading to the possibility of seeding pelvic structures with microorganisms. Antibiotic prophylaxis is therefore important to prevent or treat any procedure-related infections. After careful review of the published literature, it is evident that routine antibiotic prophylaxis is generally not recommended for the majority of ART-related procedures. For transcervical procedures such as HSG, SIS, hysteroscopy, ET, and chromotubation, patients at risk for pelvic infections should be screened and treated prior to the procedure. Patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or dilated fallopian tubes are at high risk for postprocedural infections and should be given antibiotic prophylaxis during procedures such as HSG, SIS, or chromotubation. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended prior to oocyte retrieval in patients with a history of endometriosis, PID, ruptured appendicitis, or multiple prior pelvic surgeries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/4698314", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2293015188", "source": "openalex"}

Further research has revealed that they are not produced via random tRNA degradation, but through degradation by specific nuclease cleavages, such as Elac Ribonuclease Z 2 (ELAC2)/RNase Z, RNase L, Dicer, and angiogenin (ANG), the tsRNAs can be classified into the following types based on the location from which they have been derived from the parental tRNA: tRF-1s, tRF-3s, tRF-5s, tiRNA, and tRF-2s/i-tRFs. Moreover, tsRNAs are a type of small RNAs with diverse functions, including gene expression regulation, anti-apoptosis, translation inhibition, participation in epigenetic regulation, initial virus reverse transcription, promote virus replication and cell-to-cell communication. Certain types of tsRNAs are overexpressed in cancer tissues, but are underexpressed in normal tissues. Therefore, the relationship between tsRNAs and the occurrence and development of cancer has attracted significant research attention. Research advancements have contributed to further discoveries of the biological activities of tsRNAs, but the mechanisms of their biogenesis and functions have not been fully elucidated.

Recent findings Lateral recurrences, positive pelvic node status, age and high body mass index should be abandoned as contraindications for pelvic exenteration. F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography is a valuable imaging tool, especially for the detection of enlarged lymph nodes and for distinguishing fibrosis from recurrence. Combined omental plus vertical rectus abdominis myocutaenous flaps give significant reduction in complications, whereas fascia sparing (myo)cutaneous flaps seem promising in decreasing donor-site complications. Summary Pelvic exenteration is indicated when curative alternatives are inferior or exhausted for advanced primary or locally gynecological recurrent cancer confined to the pelvis. Palliative pelvic exenteration should only be considered when disease-related morbidity is uncontrollable with other therapeutic modalities. Modifications in different surgical steps are still evolving to decrease the pelvic exenteration associated high morbidity.

Primary outcomes included (1) missed gynecology appointments and (2) receipt of a Pap smear in the previous year. Independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics, child care responsibilities, substance use, depressive symptoms, social support, interpersonal violence, CD4 count, and HIV-1 RNA. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between independent variables and outcomes. We then held two focus groups designed to gather opinions on and increase our understanding of the key findings from the survey.Of 200 women, 69% missed at least one gynecology appointment, and 22% had no Pap smear in the past year. In logistic regression, moderate (odds ratio [OR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-6.7) and severe (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.5) depressive symptoms and past-month substance use (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.3) were associated with missing an appointment in the prior year.

In a comprehensive cancer care model, palliative care, including symptom management, is offered concurrently with anticancer therapies throughout the disease course, not just at the end of life and not only once curative attempts have been abandoned. Good symptom management begins with routine symptom assessment and use of a standardized screening tool can help identify patients with high symptom burden. Literature regarding epidemiology, assessment and management of pain, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, lymphedema, ascites, depression, anxiety and sexual dysfunction in gynecologic oncology patients will be reviewed in this article.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1586/era.11.83", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084673972", "source": "openalex"}

It has long been known that obese women have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer, but recent studies suggest this association is strongest for the most common low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancers and weaker for the other histologic subtypes. There are insufficient data to assess whether obesity affects endometrial cancer-specific survival or whether the relation with all-cause mortality is similar to that seen in the general population. Recent data suggest obesity also increases risk of ovarian cancer, although it may not influence risk of the high-grade serous cancers that account for the majority of ovarian cancer deaths, and that it is also associated with poorer outcomes. There is currently insufficient evidence to draw any clear conclusions regarding the relation between obesity and risk of/survival from other gynecologic cancers although there are suggestions that obesity may increase risk of cervical cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, and perhaps vulvar cancer. Possible mechanisms whereby obesity might influence gynecologic cancer risk and survival include: its strong association with endogenous estrogen levels among postmenopausal women, its effects on glucose metabolism, its effects on the wide range of adipocytokines and inflammatory mediators that are produced by adipose tissue and altered in concentration among obese individuals, and its potential effects on patient management, particularly with regard to chemotherapy dosing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/edbook_am.2013.33.e222", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090943341", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: During a 20-month period, 254 gynecologic oncology patients undergoing intraabdominal surgery were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a clear liquid diet compared with a regular diet as the first postoperative meal. All patients received their first meal on the first postoperative day in the absence of nausea, vomiting, or symptomatic abdominal distension. Standard criteria for discharge were used for all study patients. RESULTS: The clear liquid and the regular diet groups were similar in age, disease, surgical procedure distribution, surgery length, and estimated blood loss. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, frequency and duration of nasogastric tube use, passage of flatus before discharge, and percentage of patients who tolerated their diets on the first attempt were comparable for both groups. For those patients who were intolerant of the first attempt at either a clear liquid or regular diet, the time to tolerance was comparable for both groups. The time to development of bowel sounds, passage of flatus, and hospital stay were comparable for both groups. Febrile morbidity, pneumonia, wound complications, and atelectasis occurred equally in both groups. There were no known anastamotic complications or aspirations in either group.

Method: The study was a two-site randomized controlled trial with an 18-month follow-up. Women were recruited who screened positive (a score of at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire–9) and met criteria for major depression or dysthymia. The authors tested whether insurance status had a differential effect on continuous depression outcomes between the intervention and usual care over 18 months. They also assessed differences between the intervention and usual care in quality of depression care and dichotomous clinical outcomes (a decrease of at least 50% in depressive symptom severity and patient-rated improvement on the Patient Global Improvement Scale). Results: The treatment effect was significantly associated with insurance status. Compared with patients with commercial insurance, those with no insurance or with public coverage had greater recovery from depression symptoms with collaborative care than with usual care over the 18-month follow-up period. At the 12-month follow-up, the effect size for depression improvement compared with usual care among women with no insurance or with public coverage was 0.81 (95% CI=0.41, 0.95), whereas it was 0.39 (95% CI=–0.08, 0.84) for women with commercial insurance.

A dose-ranging/cohort expansion trial of monalizumab for recurrent gynecologic malignancies was conducted to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and to explore clinical activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and immunogenicity. Patients and Methods: Participants (and part 2 expansion cohorts) included (i) platinum-sensitive ovarian, (ii) platinum-resistant ovarian, (iii) squamous cervical (CX), and (iv) epithelial endometrial (END) carcinomas. Part 1 assessed monalizumab at 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In part 2, ≥4 patients/cohort underwent pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies. Preset criteria determined cohort expansion. Results: A total of 58 participants were evaluable. The RP2D was 10 mg/kg i.v. every 2 weeks. Dose proportionality and 100% NKG2A saturation were observed. Related adverse events were mild: headache, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade 3 related adverse events were nausea (1), vomiting (1), dehydration (1), fatigue (2), anorexia (1), dyspnea (1), and proctitis (1). Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed. Hematologic and biochemical changes were mild and not dose related. Best response was SD: part 1, 7 of 18 (39%) [3.4 months (1.4–5.5)], and part 2, 7 of 39 (18%) [1.7 months (CX) to 14.8 months (END)]. Neither a predictive biomarker for SD nor evidence of pharmacodynamic effects was identified. There was a trend to significance between a reduction in lymphocyte HLA-E total score and pharmacodynamics.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 National Inpatient Sample, the largest national all-payer database of hospital discharges. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for any type of hysterectomy performed for gynecologic malignancy were used to abstract pertinent observations. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and mode of hysterectomy by cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: In 2012, there were an estimated 46,450 hysterectomies for gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Of these, 28,285 (61%) were performed for uterine, 4,275 (9%) for cervical, 12,370 (27%) for ovarian cancer, and 1,520 (3%) for other gynecologic malignancies. Minimally invasive hysterectomy was used in 50% of uterine, 43% of cervical, and 8.5% of ovarian cancer cases. Black women had decreased odds of undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for uterine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.0.63, P<.001) and cervical (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.96, P=.03) cancers.

Methods Methodologic criteria for reporting logistic regression analyses were developed to identify problems affecting accuracy, precision, and interpretation of this approach to multivariable statistical analysis. These criteria were applied to 193 articles that reported multivariable logistic regression in the issues of four generic obstetrics and gynecology journals in 1985, 1990, and 1995. Rates of compliance with the methodologic criteria and their time trends were analyzed. Results The proportion of articles using logistic regression analysis increased over time: 1.7% in 1985, 2.8% in 1990, and 6.5% in 1995 (P < .001 for trend). Violations and omissions of methodologic criteria for reporting logistic models were common. The research question, in terms of dependent and independent variables, was not clearly reported in 32.1%. The process of variable selection was inadequately described in 51.8% of the articles. Among articles with ranked independent variables, 85.1% did not report assessment of conformity to linear gradient. Tests for goodness of fit were not given in 93.2% of articles. The contribution of the independent variables could not be evaluated in 36.2% of the articles because of a lack of coding of the variables. Interactions between variables were not assessed in 86.4% of articles. Analysis of variations in the quality of logistic regression analyses over time showed no increase in reporting of the criteria concerning variable selection and goodness of fit. However, the proportion of articles reporting one quality criterion concerning interpretation of the substantive significance of independent variables showed a trend toward improvement: 42.3% in 1985, 73.6% in 1990, and 75.4% in 1995 (P = .004 for trend).

Understanding the evidence and mechanisms of these associations can lead to novel preventive and therapeutic interventions.This article discusses the evidence and the potential mechanisms mediating the association between CMRFs and benign gynecologic disorders.We reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases to obtain plausible clinical and biological evidence, including hormonal, immunologic, inflammatory, growth factor-related, genetic, epigenetic, atherogenic, vitamin D-related, and dietary factors.Cardiometabolic risk factors appear to contribute to uterine leiomyoma pathogenesis. For example, obesity can modulate leiomyomatous cellular proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition through hyperestrogenic states, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and adipokines. On the other hand, endometriosis has been shown to induce systemic inflammation, thereby increasing cardiometabolic risks, for example, through inducing atherosclerotic changes.Clinical implications of these associations are 2-fold. First, screening and early modification of CMRFs can be part of a preventive strategy for uterine leiomyomas and hysterectomy.

Twenty patients had a primary ovarian dysgerminoma (including the one with bilateral masses) and one patient had a recurrence of dysgerminoma in her retained ovary. One of the 21 patients was pregnant. All tumors except one were pure dysgerminomas, one being a mixed germinal cell tumor with 30% dysgerminoma component. Median age was 20 (range, 16-31) years.

Design: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients: 248 ASA physical status I and II adult female patients scheduled for elective hysterectomy or myomectomy. Interventions: General anesthesia was administered that consisted of thiopental sodium for induction, enflurane or isoflurane in nitrous oxide-oxygen for maintenance, and small doses of fentanyl and midazolam. Patients were randomized into three groups to receive toradol/placebo on a dosing schedule of dose 1 given one-half hour prior to expected end of surgery, dose 2 given on awakening in the postanesthesia care unit, and doses 3, 4, and 5 given at 6, 12, and 18 hours, respectively, after dose 2; Group 1 patients received placebo (saline) for dose 1, ketorolac 60 mg IV for dose 2, and ketorolac 30 mg IV for doses 3, 4, and 5. Group 2 patients received ketorolac 60 mg IV for dose 1, placebo for dose 2, and ketorolac 30 mg IV for doses 3, 4, and 5. Group 3 patients received placebo for all doses. All patients were given IV morphine PCA postoperatively, and morphine usages, visual analog pain intensity (VAS) scores, as well as adverse events and median times to recovery milestones were recorded. Measurements and Main Results: VAS scores (mean) before dose 2 were significantly lower in Group 2 than Group 1, as were at-rest evaluations at 15 minutes and one hour.

The association between the expression of certain markers and clinical outcome was investigated. Patients and Methods Primary measure of clinical efficacy was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Mutational analysis of KIT, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for markers (KIT, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF] receptor [-R], AKT2, phosphorylated AKT [p-AKT], stem cell factor [SCF], and PDGF) were performed. Results Fifty-six eligible patients were evaluated. Nine patients were progression free for at least 6 months including one complete responder. The median PFS and survival were 2 and 16 months, respectively. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities were neutropenia, GI, dermatologic effects, pain, and electrolyte disturbances. At least one target of imatinib (KIT, PDGFR-α, or PDGFR-β) was expressed in all tumors, and most tumors expressed all three receptors. Higher expression of p-AKT and PDGFR-β were associated with shorter PFS, and higher IHC scores (% immunopositive cells × staining intensity) of SCF and p-AKT were associated with decreased overall survival. No sequence mutations were detected in the KIT gene. Higher pretreatment plasma concentrations of PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were individually associated with shorter PFS and survival. Conclusion Imatinib mesylate was well tolerated but had minimal single-agent activity in patients with recurrent ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

Surgical treatment is aimed at removing the primary tumor and adequately staging the regional lymph nodes. As morbidity of regional lymphadenectomy is high, sentinel node biopsy is a technique with potential for adequate staging with less treatment-related morbidity. This manuscript reviews its current role in vulvar, cervical and endometrial cancer. Recent findings In early-stage vulvar cancer, level 3 evidence indicates that it appears to be safe to omit inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in case of a negative sentinel node. However, false-negative results with fatal consequences do occur and are often attributable to procedural failures. For early-stage cervical cancer, level 3 evidence points to an acceptable false-negative rate of a negative sentinel node; clinical utility and safety remain to be established. The optimal technique of the sentinel node biopsy in endometrial cancer is currently unclear. Summary In early-stage vulvar cancer, data suggest that sentinel node biopsy could be offered as a treatment option instead of routine inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. However, more (long-term follow-up) data are needed to further appreciate real clinical benefits. It is emphasized that the procedure should be performed by a skilled multidisciplinary team, centralized in oncology centers and preferably within the protection of clinical trials. For cervical cancer, data are promising, but routine application cannot be recommended due to lack of data on clinical utility and safety. For endometrial cancer, studies on the sentinel node biopsy are still in feasibility stage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0b013e32832f3d53", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037380623", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS The authors independently reviewed 125 cell blocks prepared from material remaining after the ThinPrep smear was diagnosed, with a concentration on those cases demonstrating abnormal results. RESULTS The majority of cases were easy to diagnose on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. The addition of a cell block preparation increased the detection of an endocervical cell component compared with the use of ThinPrep alone. Of the 125 cell blocks studied, 15 were interpreted as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 70 were interpreted as low-grade SILs, 24 were interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and 16 were determined to be within normal limits. Eighty-six of the cell blocks (69%) were found to be in agreement with the ThinPrep diagnosis, 29 (23%) demonstrated a lesser degree of abnormality on the cell block compared with the ThinPrep slide, and 10 (8%) demonstrated changes that were more severe than those diagnosed on the corresponding ThinPrep slide. Of the 54 cases for which histopathologic follow-up was available (e.g., punch biopsy, cone biopsy, or hysterectomy), the biopsies, cytologies, and cell blocks were concordant in 15 cases (28%). Biopsy results were found to agree more closely with the cell block preparation than the ThinPrep slide in eight cases, and were found to identify more closely with the ThinPrep slide in four cases. Biopsy showed changes that were less severe than those found on either cytology or cell block in 23 cases (43%). Biopsy demonstrated changes that were more severe than those observed on either cytology or cell block in 4 cases (7%).

Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed. After closure of the fascia, flexible soaker catheters were placed in the deep subcutaneous space. The infusion pump was filled with 290 mL of either 0.5% bupivacaine or normal saline, to infuse over 72 hours. Daily assessments of pain scores utilized the Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory. All patients received intravenous narcotics via patient-controlled devices. Results: Eighty surgeries were evaluated in a total of 79 women (40 per arm). Mean age was 56 years, with 79% having invasive gynecologic pathology. The two groups were not significantly different in terms of type of surgery, length of incision, estimated blood loss, operative time, or medical history. Postoperative outcomes, including wound toxicity, time to flatus, and hospital stay, did not differ. Study patients averaged 75 mg intravenously and 107 mg total narcotic use (morphine equivalent), whereas controls averaged 60 mg intravenously and 86 mg total (P = .40 intravenously; P = .25 total). Acetaminophen and intravenous ketorolac consumption were equal between groups. The Brief Pain Inventory score for \"current pain\" was 2.84 for bupivacaine patients and 3.14 for controls (P = .46; least = 0, most = 10). There was no individual postoperative day when \"current pain\" BPI scores differed. \"Worst pain\" and \"least pain\" Brief Pain Inventory scores showed similar results.

According to Globocan estimates, the top most common cancers in both sexes are breast, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, esophagus, and colorectum. This review is the first of four papers that focuses on cancer, its distribution and trend as well as the risk factors most common in Sudan. It is expected that cancer will increase in Sudan as a result of migration of people from rural areas to urban cities in the pursuit of a better standard of living, which has resulted in lifestyle and behavioral changes that include tobacco chewing and smoking, unhealthy dieting, and a lack of physical activity. These changes are further exacerbated by the aging population and have made the country vulnerable to many diseases including cancer. These reviews are meant to provide a better understanding and knowledge required to plan appropriate cancer‐control and prevention strategies in the country.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.378", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2069813771", "source": "openalex"}

Apart from reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus) that are normally removed during surgical therapy of ovarian or endometrial cancer, pituitary gonadotrophs also express GnRH receptors. The signal transduction pathway in tumor cells is basically different from the classic GnRH receptor signal transduction, which is known to operate in the pituitary gonadotrophs and can therefore be considered tumor specific. Other organs and hematopoetic stem cells do not express GnRH receptors. We have recently shown specific activation of nucleus factor kappaB in ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers after treatment with GnRH agonists. Based on this tumor-specific signaling pathway and the distribution pattern of GnRH receptors, we have developed and successfully tested a gene therapy concept by using a GnRH analogue as an inducer for the transcription of a therapeutic gene in cell culture and in nude mice.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2261440151", "source": "openalex"}

Research has demonstrated that PSM is associated with significant morbidity and poor outcome. The exact pathogenesis of PSM in gynecologic patients is not clear. Several preventive measures of PSM have been addressed in the relevant literature, and novel approaches to prevent this uncommon complication keep emerging. In this review, we summarized the potential mechanisms of PSM and discuss the controversies and merits of proposed preventive measures of PSM in gynecologic oncology. We undertook a literature search using the Medline database to identify studies on the pathogenesis and prevention of laparoscopic PSM. Hypotheses of PSM pathogeneses center on the immune response, pneumoperitoneum, wound contamination, and surgical method. Cogent evidence of effective prevention of PSM after laparoscopic surgery is lacking. Traditional preventive actions such as irrigation and tumor manipulation should be taken individually. Insufflation of hyperthermic CO 2 and humidified CO 2 leads to a better outcome in patients with a malignant tumor who undergo a laparoscopic procedure compared with normal CO 2 pneumoperitoneum. Port-site resection shows no advantage in survival and results in more wound events. PSM prevention plays a crucial part in the overall care of patients with gynecologic malignancies who undergo laparoscopic procedures.

We further investigated the adequacy of hospital records in documenting infection rates as well as the timing of presentation of wound infections. Methods The records of 115 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery at our institution were reviewed. Patients were further subdivided based on route of surgery. We analyzed the importance of antibiotic prophylaxis, route of surgery, smoking, diabetes, and body mass index (BMI). Results The overall wound infection rate was 12.17% with no significant difference in the subgroups by route of surgery. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased infection rates (P = 0.0118), but the route of surgery, BMI, smoking, and diabetes were not significant predictors of infection. Only one case of infection was detected during the initial hospital stay (6.1%). Fifty percent of the patients with infection required readmission, and of these 35.7% required an additional surgical procedure. The average length of hospital stay was 2.4 days longer in patients with infection. Conclusions Antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in the management of patients undergoing abdominal gynecologic surgery. In today's environment of cost containment, an increased hospital stay and the added likelihood of additional surgical intervention associated with wound infection are important targets for prevention. Most patients with wound infection were diagnosed after discharge from the hospital. In our population, among whom transportation problems and remote residence are prevalent, strategies for infection surveillance should be integral to discharge planning. Infect. Dis. Obstet.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was made in the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Bibliotek.dk, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SveMed+. We searched the period 1995-2012 for English-language literature. The search was made during July 2011 to February 2012. When possible, the search was made using MeSH terms. Additional reports were collected by systematically viewing the reference lists of the retrieved articles. RESULTS: Overall studies indicate that survivors after gynecologic cancer do not have impaired QoL in the long term. In general, the patients are highly satisfied with the follow-up program. The patients' greatest concern is fear of recurrence. The most frequent reported unmet need is help in dealing and living with the fear of recurrence. It seems that psychosocial status at time of diagnosis is determining for QoL and well-being in the long term. Association has been found between coping style and QoL, risk of depression, and anxiety in the long term after cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Even though long-term QoL does not seem to be impaired, the patients are struggling with fear of recurrence, and the way of coping with this fear is a possible predictor for long-term QoL after cancer. However, there is a lack of evidence on QoL, needs, and preferences regarding follow-up of the survivors after gynecologic cancer. The quality of the follow-up regimen is questionable, and it is not evidence based. Thus, it is extremely important to optimize the follow-up program and move focus to life quality.

Proteomic analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of the primary tumors and brain metastases, which were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Thereafter, candidate proteins were identified by the Scaffold system and Mascot search program, and were analyzed using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. As a result, a total of 129 proteins were identified. In endometrial and ovarian cancers, western blotting revealed that the expression of alpha-enolase (ENO1) and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI-1) was higher and the expression of Transgelin-2 (TAGLN2) was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors. On the other hand, the expression of TPI-1 and TAGLN2 was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors in cervical cancer. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that ENO1 expression was elevated in the metastatic tumors compared with the primary tumors.

One pelvic sidewall was covered by Interceed(TC7) and the other was left uncovered. The deperitonealized areas (N = 205) of all sidewalls were divided into three groups: less than 100 mm2, N = 72; 100-1000 mm2, N = 95; and more than 1000 mm2, N = 38. The effectiveness of Interceed(TC7) was evaluated at laparoscopy 10-98 days after laparotomy. Significantly more adhesions were observed at laparoscopy on the control pelvic sidewalls (48 of 63, 76%) than on the treated sides (26 of 63, 41%) (P less than .0001). The Interceed(TC7)-treated sidewalls also had significantly less area involved with adhesions at laparoscopy (P less than .05, P less than .001, and P less than .001 in the three groups, respectively). Twenty-eight women with severe endometriosis also had significantly more adhesions on the control side (23 of 28, 82%) than on the treated side (14 of 28, 50%) (P less than .05).

In 2002 it came to the attention of clinicians that this technique could be used to discover new biomarkers. However, the first reports were hampered by technical and methodological flaws. Since these first reports, proteomics has matured and the technical abilities have grown enormously. An in-depth analysis of fluid or tissue specimens is now possible. We reviewed recent literature to see whether proteomics has changed our clinical practice in the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological cancers. Recent findings In ovarian cancer a great effort has been put into discovering new diagnostic and screening markers. Several proteins have been put forward as possible candidates to fulfill this task. However, none of the proteins turned out to be better than CA125 alone. In endometrial cancer many of the presumed tumor markers are not specific for endometrial cancer but are more tumor markers for cancer in general. The same problem was noticed in cervical cancer.

An important recent development was optimization and validation of p53 IHC, where 3 abnormal IHC patterns (nuclear overexpression, complete absence, cytoplasmic) were shown to predict underlying TP53 mutations with high accuracy in ovarian carcinomas. p53 IHC now helps in distinguishing high-grade serous from low-grade serous carcinomas. Thereafter, the new interpretation of p53 IHC was quickly adapted for other purposes and similar accuracies were shown in endometrial carcinomas, vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, and ovarian mucinous tumors. However, it required further refinement of the p53 IHC interpretation criteria for each tumor site. A proportion of endometrial endometrioid carcinomas shows an ultramutated or hypermutated genotype due to underlying POLE mutations or mismatch repair deficiency sometimes causing subclonal TP53 mutations, and their distribution can be visualized by p53 IHC. Squamous cell carcinomas and ovarian mucinous tumors show a phenomenon called terminal differentiation where basal cells demonstrate an abnormal pattern of p53 IHC but apical cells do not despite an underlying TP53 mutation. High-grade progression of adult granulosa cell tumors due to a subclonal TP53 mutation has been recently described. Another use of p53 IHC is triaging gynecological sarcomas for molecular testing based on the assumption that TP53- mutated gynecological sarcomas do not harbor cancer driving translocations. Therefore, familiarity with interpretation of p53 IHC is becoming increasingly important for the practicing gynecological pathologist. Furthermore, local optimization of the p53 IHC assay using validated protocols including appropriate low expressing control tissues (eg, tonsil) is vital in order to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, especially for abnormal staining patterns such as complete absence or cytoplasmic, and interlaboratory concordance. p53 IHC is a reliable diagnostic adjunct for histotyping and molecular subtyping of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas, and it paves the way for large-scale studies to validate the prognostic value of p53 IHC in several gynecological tumor types. The technical advances, validated interpretation criteria, and its growing versatility in identifying high-risk neoplasms paired with its widespread availability in pathology departments make p53 IHC perhaps the single most useful IHC stain in gynecological pathology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0000000000000725", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3112053888", "source": "openalex"}

Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality. Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care. Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes. As physician–leaders enact new policies to respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, it is important to consider the potential for exacerbating existing health inequities and to be proactive in creating policies that promote equity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003933", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3021239966", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3024529657", "title": "Pedagogy in a pandemic – COVID‐19 and virtual continuing medical education (vCME) in obstetrics and gynecology", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic will go down in history as a global health crisis that caused significant loss of life and massive economic and social disruption. Many countries have enforced physical distancing and reduced social movement to minimise community spread. The greatly increased service demands and the initiation of team segregation to ensure continuity of care has resulted in both Specialty Trainee [ST] postgraduate training and wider academic congregation being cancelled.1 For Asia-Pacific nations, such as Singapore, this is reminiscent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] outbreak in 2003. At that time, specialty training was completely halted for six months, with resources prioritized for the outbreak.2-4 When our first case of COVID-19 was detected in late January 2020, we looked to lessons learned5, 6 and moved our ST educational delivery from face to face didactic learning to a virtual domain. Our Obstetrics and Gynecology (OG) STs work on the frontline and need to be equipped with the knowledge to care for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 OG cases. With predictions that this pandemic may stretch into 2021, we share the promises, practices and pitfalls of our experience thus far. Regardless of the security features, all patient identifiers need to be removed. The text and icon components can be used to to pose and answer questions, agree or disagree with fellow participants, poll responses and extend appreciation. Asking the audience at the beginning of the session to mute their microphones will prevent our early experiences of children, pets and taxi drivers joining the session. Participants' backgrounds can be covered to maintain privacy. A program coordinator is invaluable to deal with operational issues, leaving the speaker, audience and senior to concentrate on the learning. While COVID-19 may be seen as a major disruptor to postgraduate education, it is also an opportunity to refine existing distance learning techniques into a Virtual Continuing Medical Education [vCME] program. A vCME programme needs flexibility and must meet national and institutional requirements relevant to each system's educational needs. Acutely, COVID-19 related education covering critical care, workflows and \"just-in-time\" training for infection control skills such as Personal Protective Equipment [PPE] demonstrations, assumed high priority.7 Looking forward, as specialty examinations were postponed, we chose to blueprint several sessions to cover key components of our examination syllabi. Every country has a different degree of team segregation depending on manpower resources and COVID-19 caseload. In Italy and China, high case numbers required a greater degree of segregation involving designation of entire sections of hospitals to the care of COVID-19 patients with many disciplines contributing HCPs to a dedicated manpower pool. Our department has been able to retain most staff, but they are segregated into teams looking after geographically separate care areas such as inpatient wards, operating theaters, clinics and delivery wards. These teams are further subdivided into shifts, thereby prohibiting the continuation of our daily, face-to-face, department-wide, education program. Finding a common time to reinstate the program was challenging but we settled on 0730hrs as STs are either pre-shift handover, in commute or awake off-duty. However, it is actually impossible to find a time when all STs are available due to service needs, secondment, rest-cycles or illness. Uploading recorded videos of vCME sessions on an accessible, secure cloud server allows for both easy access by absent STs and future revision for exams. This way, even seconded STs remain attached to their core discipline and the wider Department can view at a time of convenience. Peer-teaching is a recognized and powerful tool in pedagogy8 and is useful for both examination preparedness and knowledge retention. Each ST selects one to two pre-assigned topics per month, reflecting personal knowledge gaps. Senior staff moderate each 30-minute presentation, with attendance and education hours tracked for accreditation purposes. Directed questions and case-based teaching enhance the quality of group discussion. Some presenters incorporate pre- and post-session quizzes to assess learner understanding, with scores later released to individual participants. E-learning material and videos published online by academic institutions and professional societies are also highlighted to enable parallel self-learning. We were interested to find that 88% of our STs felt more comfortable raising questions through videoconferencing compared to traditional didactics. Reasons include increased comfort in the virtual environments,9 less public-speaking fear,10 peer support, less senior intimidation and a dismantlement of the traditional classroom physical space. While some imagination is needed, most educational material can be adapted to the videoconferencing medium. For example, examination skills can be honed by virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination [OSCE] stations and distribution of exam-style questions through Google Forms®. An area of universal concern amongst the trainees is loss of procedural training opportunities1 due to the deferment of non-urgent surgical cases11 and team segregation of sonographic units. While the loss of this hands-on experierence is not easily substituted, we have tried to address this through the use of archived videos12 and live telementoring13 by experienced staff. Instead of one or two trainees benefiting by being in the right place at the right time, a larger group gains simultaneously, akin to the operating theater viewing galleries of the past. Furthermore, the taped sessions have future utility as a pre-procedural orientation tool. Methods such as high and low fidelity simulators and complementary self-learning via Youtube®-based skill exercises eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjNDYILnxAM can be used to continue hands-on practical work. Despite the reduction in procedures, we acknowledge that COVID-19 has opened other developmental opportunities in the areas of infection control, critical care management, public health, healthcare systems, health economics and leadership. These lessons are hard-learned but may make better STs in the long run. The COVID-19 pandemic exploded exponentially in many countries and the early days were often characterized by confusion with frequent evidence updates and guideline changes.14 The regularity of our vCME programme served a dual purpose as a forum to disseminate operational information and obtain feedback on-the-ground which helped coordinate departmental action, especially where STs may be dispersed to distant locations. Mental health support for STs can also be embedded into a virtual CME program. Prolonged segregation and isolation can reduce the effectiveness of each ST's coping strategies. Anxiety, stress, mood disorders3 and even post-traumatic stress disorder15 were psychological impacts faced by HCPs during SARS. About 80% of our STs felt these sessions provided solidarity amongst fellow STs and a major source of peer support. Educational supervisors have used the videoconferencing platforms to meet-up with their STs and complete formative assessments of this unprecedented \"rotation.\" We featured online resources supporting self-help during traumatic events (https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/project-ares/preventingptsd/) and our hospital offers in depth pastoral care through this modality. The COVID-19 pandemic will eventually conclude and we will awake to a new post-COVID-19 era. The hard lessons learned from this experience should be incorporated into the everyday work of STs- hand hygiene, correct PPE usage, the civic responsibility of staying home when ill and the vital role of public health. The experience of adaptability and working together for the collective benefit of healthcare provision will mould the next generation of specialists in preparation for the next global pandemic. This pandemic will also highlight the benefits of digital hyperconnectivity as a tool to solve problems and enhance education delivery. These include distance learning techniques to increase the reach of medical educators, re-evaluating how academic conferences are organized and transferring the learning of how to care to virtual platforms. It is the realization of finding a digital way to \"keep in touch\". The COVID-19 pandemic is a stress test that is uncovering traditional areas of neglect in each nation's healthcare systems. It is our opinion that when postgraduate education takes a backseat during a crisis, the downstream effect may not be immediately appreciable but significant in the long run. Increased use of distance learning techniques may help mitigate this and have complementary value in non-pandemic settings. A well-considered vCME programme may enhance knowledge and skills, whilst simultaneously supporting STs during an unprecedented, difficult period (Table 1). It remains for medical educators to gather evidence as to whether this approach is better, complementary or worse than traditional ways, in guiding future pedagogy. Our own experience suggests that vCME is an important strategy in the prolonged campaign against COVID-19, and may allow our STs to emerge on the other side of this pandemic, at the very least unscathed, and hopefully stronger.

In total, 117 patients with gynecologic cancers were included in this study. Both tumor DNA and paired blood cell genomic DNA were isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and blood samples, and next-generation sequencing was performed to identify somatic mutations. TP53, PTEN, ARID1A, and PIK3CA alterations were significantly different in various types of gynecologic cancers (p = 0.001, 1.15E-07, 0.004, and 0.009, respectively). The median TMB of all 117 gynecologic tumor specimens was 0.37 mutations/Mb, with a range of 0-41.45 mutations/Mb. Despite the lack of significant difference, endometrial cancer cases had a higher median TMB than cervical and ovarian cancer cases. Younger gynecologic cancer patients (age <40 years) had a significantly lower TMB than older patients (age ≥40 years) (p = 0.04). In addition, TMB was significantly increased with increasing clinical stage of disease (p = 0.001).

The use of bladder drainage to avoid urinary retention after gynecological surgery is more or less custom based, and duration of drainage varies considerably. In this paper the use of 1‐day drainage by transurethral Foley catheter was investigated with regard to impaired voiding, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and urinary tract infection. Furthermore, the use of methenamine hippurate was studied with regard to postoperative asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection. Methods. This summary is based on six published papers totaling 917 patients. In three case series, 1‐day catheterization was used in women undergoing gynecological laparotomy, colposuspension, or vaginal plastic surgery. To compare 1‐ and 3‐day Foley catheterization, two open, randomized trials were performed on women undergoing vaginal plastic surgery or colposuspension. The last study was a double‐blind trial between methenamine hippurate and placebo as prophylaxis against urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria using 1‐day catheterization. Results. Postoperative voiding problems and urinary tract infection occurred infrequently with 1‐day catheterization, and no more frequently than with catheterization for three days. Methenamine hippurate decreased the incidence of urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria by 80 and 40%, respectively. Conclusions. One‐day bladder drainage by transurethral Foley catheter may be used routinely in common gynecological surgery with a low rate of voiding problems, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and urinary tract infection. Methenamine hippurate prophylaxis effectively reduces postoperative urinary tract infection.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00016340500409877", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2077025025", "source": "openalex"}

Design and Setting.—Retrospective identification of patients with abnormal cervicovaginal cytology and identification of the initial clinical follow-up activity during the 12 months following the cytologic diagnosis. Main Outcome Measure.—Percentage of women receiving follow-up. Results.—Three hundred six laboratories reported follow-up information on 16 132 patients with gynecologic cytology diagnoses of carcinoma, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or glandular intraepithelial lesion. The following percentages of women received follow-up within 1 year: 85.6% of patients with cytologic diagnoses of carcinoma, 87.2% with diagnoses of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 82.7% with diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 84.9% with diagnoses of glandular intraepithelial lesion.

While there are many etiologies of AUB, the one most likely among otherwise healthy adolescents is dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), which is characterizing any AUB when all possible underlying pathologic causes have been previously excluded. The most common cause of DUB in adolescence is anovulation, which is very frequent in the first 2–3 post-menarchal years and is associated with immaturity of the hypothalamic – pituitary – ovarian axis. Management of AUB is based on the underlying etiology and the severity of the bleeding and primary goals are prevention of complications, such as anemia and reestablishment of regular cyclical bleeding, while the management of DUB can in part be directed by the amount of flow, the degree of associated anemia, as well as patient and family comfort with different treatment modalities.

It has resulted in worldwide increases in the incidence of endometrial cancer and a change in patient demographics, resulting in more diagnoses than ever before being made in pre-menopausal women, who are often keen to pursue fertility-sparing treatments. Obesity increases the risk of gynecological cancers by creating a pro-carcinogenic environment of unopposed estrogen, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic inflammation. It can present both a diagnostic challenge and strongly influence management decisions, including the practicalities of performing surgery, increase anesthetic risks, and alter response rates to adjuvant and medical therapies. Obesity may also influence endometrial cancer mortality and certainly contributes to poorer overall survival due to an excess of deaths related to cardiovascular disease.

Social support may contribute positively to the health of cancer patients, playing a role in coping with stress.The aim of this study was to determine whether ways of coping are related to social support given to women with gynecologic cancer.The study was performed as a cross-sectional design in a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, with 221 women with gynecologic cancer; the data were collected via 3 questionnaires, the first with sociodemographic and clinical features, the second with multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the third with the scale of ways of coping with stress.Women with gynecologic cancer who were employed and declared their incomes as balanced and reported more years of education were more likely to perceive higher social support and to use the ineffective coping ways with stress at a lower rate (P < .05) than other participants. Based on correlational analysis, effective coping ways with stress increase as perceived social support from family, friends, significant other, and total increases (P < .05).Social support from family members is the mainstay of coping with stress by women with gynecologic cancer.Nurses are indispensable in increasing social support required by women with gynecologic cancer. Well-trained clinical nurses via in-service programs should be experienced and aware of women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer in need of social support during hospital visits and provide necessary guidance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0000000000000186", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2329908538", "source": "openalex"}

Within this population of patients, there is an increased risk of gonadal tumor formation. CASES: In this case series of three patients, two with Swyer's syndrome (complete gonadal dysgenesis) and one with mosaic Turner's syndrome, three separate histologic subtypes of tumors were identified: dysgerminoma, seminoma, and gonadoblastoma. The patients with dysgerminoma and seminoma had regular menses and were without recurrent disease. We recommend that the patient with gonadoblastoma start on hormone therapy. CONCLUSION: Once the diagnosis of gonadal dysgenesis is made, prophylactic gonadectomy should be performed owing to the probability of malignant transformation. These patients illustrate the potential different presentations with gonadal dysgenesis and the importance of complete evaluation of patients with primary amenorrhea. Gonadal dysgenesis should be remembered in the evaluation of patients to prevent the occurrence of cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e3181e4bfe9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059461827", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Between August 1997 and January 2001, 73 patients with advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were entered onto this study. Eligible patients had received no prior therapeutic chemotherapy, except when administered concurrent with primary radiation therapy. The initial doses administered were cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks and vinorelbine 30 mg/m 2 weekly. Subsequent doses were unchanged, reduced, escalated, or omitted according to observed toxicity and protocol guidelines. Patients were evaluated for response and toxicity using standard Gynecologic Oncology Group criteria. Results Of 73 patients, 67 were eligible and assessable. The overall response rate was 30% (five complete and 15 partial responses). The overall median response duration was 5.5+ months. The major toxicity was neutropenia, with 16% grade 3 and 67% grade 4 reported. Gastrointestinal and neurotoxicity were infrequent and mild.

The nasogastric group had significantly longer times to first passage of flatus and tolerance of a clear liquid diet than did the orogastric group. However, both groups were similar in time to tolerance of a regular diet and hospital stay. On average, the nasogastric tube was maintained for 3.2 +/- 2.1 days (range 1-8) after surgery. The average daily nasogastric output was 440 +/- 283 mL (range 68-1565). No patient in the orogastric group required a nasogastric tube postoperatively, but one patient in the nasogastric group had a nasogastric tube reinserted for recurrent nausea and vomiting. Use of a nasogastric tube led to significantly more subjective complaints, eg, ear pain, painful swallowing, and nasal soreness, but did not significantly reduce the incidence of abdominal distention or nausea and vomiting. Major complications, eg, pneumonia, atelectasis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and wound breakdown or infection, occurred equally in both groups. However, the incidence of febrile morbidity was significantly greater in the nasogastric group. There were no known anastamotic complications or aspirations in either group. Postoperative changes in hematological indices and electrolytes were comparable in both groups.Postoperative nasogastric tube decompression in gynecologic oncology patients undergoing extensive intra-abdominal surgery does not appear to provide any substantial benefit but significantly increases patient discomfort.

Basic descriptive statistics were applied. Analytics of survey-diffusion and generated-interest (visualizations, engagement rates, response rate) were analyzed. Results The survey received 20 836 visualizations, generating an average engagement rates by reach of 4.7%. The response rate was 30%. A total of 86% of respondents completed the survey, for a total of 187 physicians surveyed across 49 countries. The majority (143/187; 76%) were gynecologic oncologists, and most were ≤50 years old (146/187; 78%). A total of 49.7% (93/187) were facing the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, while 26.7% (50/187) and 23.5% (44/187) were in the peak and plateau phases, respectively.

The majority of respondents did not alter indications of treatment if patients were COVID-19-negative, while treatments were generally postponed in COVID-19-positive patients. Treatments were considered priority for: early stage high-risk uterine cancers (85/187; 45%), newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer (76/187; 41%), and locally advanced cervical cancer (76/187; 41%). Treatment of early stage low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer was deferred according to 49% (91/187) of respondents, with hormonal treatment as the option of therapy (31%; 56/178).

Consequently, a large population of Pakistan turns toward ethno-medicinal healthcare systems due to accessibility, affordability, availability and an inherent trust in this method. The present review was framed by searching different search engines for the collection of fragmented literature on indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants used by Pakistani women to treat gynecological complaints and STIs. In total, 116 plant species used in Pakistan to treat a variety of gynecological complaints and STIs. The dominant plant families used for the preparation of herbal remedies are Asteraceae and Amaranthaceae. Majority of the plants were reportedly found to be used against menses (46 plant species) followed by gonorrhea (30 plant species). The frequency of citation was also found higher for these two complications, which might be due to the higher prevalence of these problems in Pakistan. The highest number of plant species (59) was reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan due to more cultural resistance as compared to other provinces. Sørensen similarity index showed the highest consensus between Pashtun and Punjabi cultures of Pakistan in terms of plants and parts usage for species Convolvulus arvensis, Justicia adhatoda, Achyranthes aspera, Berberis lycium, Punica granatum and Withania somnifera. Interestingly, these plants were also reported to treat multiple reproductive problems indicating their high bioactivity. Thirteen plants including A. aspera and P. granatum have also been reportedly evaluated pharmacologically and found active confirming the efficacy of traditional medicines.

Currently, no standardized laparoscopy curriculum exists for gynecology residents. OBJECTIVE: To design a structured laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents using Delphi consensus methodology. METHODS: This study began with Delphi methodology to determine expert consensus on the components of a gynecology laparoscopic skills curriculum. We generated a list of cognitive content, technical skills, and nontechnical skills for training in laparoscopic surgery, and asked 39 experts in gynecologic education to rate the items on a Likert scale (1-5) for inclusion in the curriculum. Consensus was predefined as Cronbach α of ≥0.80. We then conducted another Delphi survey with 9 experienced users of laparoscopic virtual reality simulators to delineate relevant curricular tasks. Finally, a cross-sectional design defined benchmark scores for all identified tasks, with 10 experienced gynecologic surgeons performing the identified tasks at basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. RESULTS: Consensus (Cronbach α=0.85) was achieved in the first round of the curriculum Delphi, and after 2 rounds (Cronbach α=0.80) in the virtual reality curriculum Delphi. Consensus was reached for cognitive, technical, and nontechnical skills as well as for 6 virtual reality tasks. Median time and economy of movement scores defined benchmarks for all tasks.

Valspodar, a nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporine D analogue that reverses P-glycoprotein–mediated multidrug resistance, in combination with paclitaxel might be active in paclitaxel-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received valspodar 5 mg/kg orally qid × 12 doses. Paclitaxel (70 mg/m 2 intravenously for 3 hours) was administered on day 2, 2 hours after the fifth or sixth dose of valspodar. This treatment was repeated every 21 days. One blood sample was collected before the sixth dose of valspodar for the first three cycles to evaluate valspodar trough concentration. Tumor tissue was obtained from patients for immunohistochemical staining of P-glycoprotein. RESULTS: Of 60 patients entered, 58 were assessable for response. There were five partial responses (8.6%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 3.8 to 20.0; median duration of response, 5.0 months [range, 1.9 to 10.5 months]). Median progression-free survival was 1.5 months (90% CI, 1.4 to 2.4). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed were neutropenia, anemia, nausea and vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar ataxia. The trough concentrations of valspodar were ≥ 1,000 ng/mL in all but two of 40 patients in the first cycle. Immunohistochemical staining for P-glycoprotein was positive for one of two responding patients. CONCLUSION: Valspodar in combination with paclitaxel has limited activity in patients with paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma. An international randomized clinical trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without valspodar as first-line therapy in advanced ovarian cancer is underway.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2001.19.12.2975", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1857799540", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment outcomes are dictated by a multitude of factors, including stage at diagnosis, tissue type, and overall health of the patient. Current therapeutic options include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, although significant unmet medical needs remain in regard to side effects and long-term survival. The efficacy of chemotherapy is influenced by cellular events such as the overexpression of oncogenes and downregulation of tumor suppressors, which together determine apoptotic responses. Phytochemicals are a broad class of natural compounds derived from plants, a number of which exhibit useful bioactive effects toward these pathways. High-throughput screening methods, rational modification, and developments in regulatory policies will accelerate the development of novel therapeutics based on these compounds, which will likely improve overall survival and quality of life for patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/890141", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160945991", "source": "openalex"}

Endometriosis most often involves the anterior wall of the rectosigmoid colon, adjacent to the pouch of Douglas, and typically produces extrinsic mass effect on the serosa, with the overlying mucosa left intact. Direct extension of ovarian cancer to the colon through the subperitoneal space produces mass effect with serosal spiculation, tethering, and fixation; annular constriction; or partial or complete obstruction. Intraperitoneal seeding of ovarian carcinoma most frequently involves the colon and is seen as extrinsic masses, often with serosal spiculation and tethering. Cervical carcinoma, which most commonly spreads by direct invasion of the pelvic side wall and adjacent structures, produces serosal spiculation and circumferential narrowing. Benign ovarian or uterine tumors are purely extrinsic and have a smooth interface with the colonic wall. Tubo-ovarian abscesses are difficult to differentiate from cystic ovarian neoplasms or endometriomas. Radiation colitis causes narrowing of the rectum with intact mucosa and can be differentiated from recurrent tumor, unlike radiation-induced injury of the small bowel, which may be difficult to distinguish.

The statistical analysis was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. The study was based on the 9 cancer registries of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 20 142 female patients with rectal cancer in localized and regional stage were included. <h3>Exposure</h3> Receipt of neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The development of an SGMN defined as any type of GMN occurring more than 5 years after the diagnosis of rectal cancer. The cumulative incidence of SGMNs was estimated by Fine-Gray competing risk regression. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the radiotherapy-associated risk for SGMNs in patients undergoing radiotherapy vs patients not undergoing radiotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the survival outcomes of patients with SGMNs. <h3>Results</h3> Of 20 142 patients, 16 802 patients (83.4%) were White and the median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 54-74 years). A total of 5310 (34.3%) patients were treated with surgery and radiotherapy, and 14 832 (65.7%) patients were treated with surgery alone. The cumulative incidence of SGMNs during 30 years of follow-up was 4.53% among patients who received radiotherapy and 1.53% among patients who did not. In competing risk regression analysis, undergoing radiotherapy was associated with a higher risk of developing cancer of the uterine corpus (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.14-4.37;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and ovarian cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.22-3.56;<i>P</i> = .007) compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy.

The 10-year overall survival among patients with radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus was significantly lower than that among matched patients with primary cancer of the uterine corpus (21.5% vs 33.6%;<i>P</i> = .01). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Radiotherapy for rectal cancer was associated with an increased risk of cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer.

Their milieu acquires specific properties thanks to intense crosstalk between stromal and cancer cells, leading to a vicious circle. Fibroblasts, pericytes, lymphocytes and tumor associated-macrophages orchestrate most of the biological pathways. In epithelial ovarian cancer, high rates of activated pericytes determine a poorer prognosis, defining a common signature promoting ovarian cancer proliferation, local invasion and distant spread. Mesenchymal cells also release chemokines and cytokines under hormonal influence, such as estrogens that drive most of the endometrial cancers. Interestingly, the architecture of the cervical cancer milieu is shaped by the synergy of high-risk Human Papilloma Virus oncoproteins and the activity of stromal estrogen receptor α. Lymphocytes represent a shield against cancer cells but some cell subpopulation could lead to immunosuppression, tumor growth and dissemination. Cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can be eluded by over-adapted cancer cells in a scenario of immune-tolerance driven by T-regulatory cells.

Two hundred female patients (ASA physical status I) were randomly allocated to one of five groups (n = 40 for each): saline (as a control), granisetron 2 micro g/kg, granisetron 5 micro g/kg, granisetron 10 micro g/kg, and granisetron 20 micro g/kg. Saline or granisetron was given intravenously immediately after induction of anesthesia. PONV was assessed 24 h after surgery. The percentage of emesis-free patients was significantly greater in the 5- to 20-micro g/kg granisetron groups than in the control and 2-micro g/kg granisetron groups (18%, 23%, 68%, 78%, and 75% of patients receiving saline or granisetron 2 micro g/kg, 5 micro g/kg, 10 micro g/kg, and 20 micro g/kg, respectively). Granisetron doses of 5 micro g/kg or larger were also superior to the saline and 2-micro g/kg granisetron treatment for the prevention of nausea over the 24-h study period (nausea visual analog scales 24 h after surgery: 49, 41, 18, 16, and 14 mm in the control and granisetron 2 micro g/kg, 5 micro g/kg, 10 micro g/kg, and 20 micro g/kg groups, respectively).

The antiemetic effect of granisetron was similar among the groups who received 5-micro g/kg or larger doses. In conclusion, we suggest that the optimal dose of granisetron is 5 micro g/kg for the prevention of PONV after gynecological surgery.

However, therapeutic strategies targeting ARID1A -mutant cancer cells remain limited. In this study, we aimed to identify drugs sensitivities in ARID1A -mutant cancer cell lines. By analyzing the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we found that ARID1A -mutant cancer cell lines were more sensitive to treatment with the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing agent elesclomol. In a panel of 14 gynecologic cancer cell lines, treatment with elesclomol inhibited growth and induced apoptosis more potently in ARID1A -mutant cells. Knockdown of ARID1A in RMG1 and OVCA432 ovarian cancer cells resulted in increased sensitivity to elesclomol, whereas restoration of ARID1A expression in TOV21G ovarian cancer cells resulted in increased resistance to elesclomol. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of ARID1A expression resulted in increased intracellular ROS levels. In ovarian clear cell carcinoma patient samples, low expression of ARID1A correlated with high expression of 8-hydroxyguanosine, a marker for oxidative stress. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that loss of ARID1A leads to accumulation of ROS and suggest that elesclomol may be used to target ARID1A -mutant gynecologic cancer cells.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.10921", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2498133151", "source": "openalex"}

As new regulations on specialist gynecologic training in Germany are currently being drawn up, this overview provides basic information on gynecologic infectiology and summarizes clinically relevant aspects of recent microbiological findings on the physiology and pathology of vaginal flora. The clinical signs and symptoms of aerobic vaginitis, the pathogenesis of which is still not completely understood, are also reviewed. Finally, the symptoms, indications and risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are presented. In contrast to the above-listed infections, PID requires immediate culture of the pathogen from samples (e.g. obtained by laparoscopy) with microbiological diagnostic procedures carried out by specialist laboratories. A schematic summary of all pathologies discussed here is presented.Die überwiegende Zahl unkomplizierter vulvovaginaler Beschwerden (z. B. bakterielle Vaginose, Vulvovaginalkandidose, Trichomoniasis) lässt sich durch eine einfache, infektiologische Basisuntersuchung abklären und ohne weitergehende Diagnostik meist auch effektiv behandeln. Zu dieser Untersuchung gehören die Messung des vaginalen pH-Wertes, die Anfertigung und Beurteilung eines Nativpräparats aus vaginalem bzw. zervikalem Fluor sowie die korrekte Einordnung der erhobenen Befunde in das klinische Bild und den mikrobiologischen Kontext. Zumindest in Deutschland wird dies seit Jahren zu wenig gelehrt und praktiziert. Die vorliegende Übersicht vermittelt deshalb auch im Hinblick auf die kommende neue Weiterbildungsordnung grundlegende Kenntnisse dazu und fasst gleichzeitig den klinisch relevanten Teil der aktuellen mikrobiologischen Erkenntnisse zur Physiologie und Pathologie der Vaginalflora zusammen. Ferner wird das pathogenetisch nach wie vor unvollständig verstandene Krankheitsbild der aeroben Vaginitis diskutiert. Letztlich werden auch Symptome, Zeichen und Risikofaktoren einer Entzündung des kleinen Beckens („Pelvic Inflammatory Disease“, PID) vorgestellt, da diese Erkrankung im Gegensatz zu den obengenannten einen unverzüglichen kulturellen und/oder molekularen Erregernachweis durch entsprechende Materialgewinnung (z. B. mittels Laparoskopie) und mikrobiologische Labordiagnostik erfordert. Für alle dargestellten Krankheitsbilder werden Schemata zum therapeutischen Vorgehen präsentiert.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1545909", "url": "https://openalex.org/W578089805", "source": "openalex"}

The postoperative quality of recovery (QOR) should be considered one of the principal endpoints after ambulatory surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with opioids is known to improve postoperative QOR after ambulatory surgery. However, opioids can be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative complications, which can affect postoperative QOR. The primary aim of this study was to compare the patient recovery using the QOR-40 at 24 h postoperative in ambulatory gynecological laparoscopy between opioid-free (OF) TIVA and opioid-based TIVA. Settings and Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, comparative study was conducted at the day surgery center. Patients and Methods: Eighty females were included in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups: OF TIVA group with dexmedetomidine and propofol or opioid-based TIVA (O) group with fentanyl and propofol. The primary outcome was QOR-40 at 24 h postoperative, and the secondary outcomes were postoperative numerical rating scale (NRS), time to first rescue analgesia, number of rescue tramadol analgesia, and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Results: A statistically significant difference in total QOR-40 score at 24 h postoperative was observed between the groups (median [range] QOR-40 of 182.0 [164.0–192.0] in the OF TIVA group and 170.0 [156.0–185.0] in the O group; P = 0.03). OF group had significantly lower time to first rescue analgesia, maximum NRS pain scores, number of rescue tramadol analgesia, and ondansetron use. Conclusions: OF TIVA significantly improves postoperative QOR in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecological laparoscopic surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/aer.aer_74_19", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2944344379", "source": "openalex"}

A review of 10 consecutive years of operative procedures produced 63 patients who underwent combined gynecological and plastic surgical procedures. Thirty-three of the combined surgery patients could be suitably matched with 2 control patients each to compare complications and length of hospital stay. The requirement for transfusion was significantly greater (p = 0.01) in the combined-surgery versus the paired-control groups. No other complications, however, were increased in the combined-surgery patients. There was a significant reduction (p = 0.005) in hospital stay of 1.92 postoperative days for two groups of combined-surgery patients versus the control groups. In all combined-surgery patients, patient response was favorable. Recommendations on preoperative planning and intraoperative and postoperative management are discussed. There is a perception in the surgical community that combining procedures unacceptably increases morbidity. For the past 12 years plastic and gynecological surgeons in our institution have offered combined procedures to our patients, with positive results and favorable patient response. A search of recent medical literature demonstrated several references to the planned combination of plastic and gynecological or general surgical procedures [2, 4, 5]. However, the only study with matched control patients dealt exclusively with abdominoplasty in association with one of five major gynecological procedures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000637-198806000-00009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2074315381", "source": "openalex"}

Recent studies have shown that EOC originates from the fallopian tube fimbriae rather than from epithelial cells lining the ovary. We have previously shown by immunohistochemistry a strong correlation between FRA expression in EOC and normal and fallopian adenocarcinoma. Folate receptor beta (FOLR2/FRB) has been described to be expressed by macrophages both in inflammatory disorders and certain epithelial cancers. Given the high sequence identity of these two folate receptor family members we sought to investigate the architectural and cell-specific expression of these two receptors in gynecologic tissues.RNA scope, a novel chromogenic in situ hybridization assay tool, was used to examine expression of the alpha (FOLR1) and beta (FOLR2) isoforms of folate receptor relative to each other as well as to the macrophage markers CD11b and CD68, in samples of normal fallopian tube and fallopian adenocarcinoma as well as normal ovary and EOC.We demonstrated expression of both FOLR1 and FOLR2 in EOC, normal fallopian tube and fallopian adenocarcinoma tissue while very little expression of either marker was observed in normal ovary. Furthermore, FOLR2 was shown to be expressed almost exclusively in macrophages, of both the M1 and M2 lineages, as determined by co-expression of CD11b and/or CD68, with little or no expression in epithelial cells.These findings further substantiate the hypothesis that the cell of origin of EOC is tubal epithelium and that the beta isoform of folate receptor is primarily restricted to macrophages. Further, macrophages expressing FOLR2 may represent tumor associated or infiltrating macrophages (TAMs) in epithelial cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-015-0156-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1937182682", "source": "openalex"}

Based on recent evidence, the detection of molecular changes in these genes could have clinical importance for the early detection and evaluation of tumor grade, as well as the selection of targeted treatment. Researchers have recently focused on cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the treatment of gynecologic cancer because of their ability to induce progression and recurrence of malignancy.

In the gynecologic tract it also serves a robust marker for mesonephric and trophoblastic tumors. However, expression has also been described in more common malignancies of gynecologic tract including ovarian, endometrial, and cervical carcinomas. Data on the distribution of GATA3 expression in gynecologic malignancies is somewhat limited, particularly across different histologic subtypes of ovarian, endometrial, and cervical carcinomas. To assess the rates of GATA3 expression among common gynecologic cancers of various histologic types, 100 ovarian carcinomas, 64 endometrial carcinomas/atypical hyperplasias, 16 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 14 endocervical adenocarcinomas were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for GATA3 positivity. Eight percent of endometrial carcinomas expressed GATA3, including 2 serous carcinomas, 1 carcinosarcoma, and 1 case of atypical hyperplasia. Six percent of ovarian carcinomas were GATA3-positive including 2 clear cell carcinomas, 2 mucinous adenocarcinomas, and 2 high-grade serous carcinomas. Thirty-eight percent of cervical SCCs showed weak to moderate staining in up to 50% of tumor cells. All endocervical adenocarcinomas were entirely negative for GATA3. In summary, GATA3 shows focal weak to moderate expression in a subset of endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. In contrast, usual-type endocervical adenocarcinomas are typically negative for GATA3, which can be helpful in differentiating them from mesonephric proliferations or carcinomas. A larger proportion of cervical SCCs express GATA3, therefore caution should be exercised when using this stain in the setting of a lower genitourinary carcinomas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0000000000000541", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2883465049", "source": "openalex"}

FCR is associated with psychological distress, lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources. Despite its prevalence, FCR is poorly addressed in clinical care. To address this problem, we first developed, and pilot tested a 6-week, 2 h, Cognitive-existential group intervention therapy that targeted FCR in survivors of breast or gynecological cancer. Following the positive outcome of the pilot, we are now testing this approach in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Goal and hypotheses: This multicenter, prospective RCT aims to test the efficacy of the intervention. The study hypotheses are that, compared to a control group, cancer survivors participating in the intervention (1) will have less FCR, (2) will show more favorable outcomes on the following measures: cancer-specific distress, quality of life, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, and coping skills. We further postulate that the between-group differences will persist three and 6 months post-intervention. Sixteen groups of seven to nine women are being allocated to the intervention or the control group. The control group receives a 6-week, 2 h, structurally equivalent support group. We are recruiting 144 cancer survivors from four hospital sites in three Canadian cities. The sample size was based on the moderate pre/post-test changes found in our pilot study and adjusted to the drop-out rates. Measurements: The primary outcome, FCR, is measured by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory. Secondary outcomes measured include cancer-specific distress, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, coping, and quality of life. We use reliable and recognized valid scales. Participants are to complete the questionnaire package at four times: before the first group session (baseline), immediately after the sixth session, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Analysis: In the descriptive analysis, comparison of group equivalent baseline variables, identification of confounding/intermediate variables and univariate analysis are planned. Each participant's trajectory is calculated using Generalized Estimating Equation models to determine the time and group effects, after considering the correlation structures of the groups. An intent-to-treat analysis approach may be adopted. Our Fear of Recurrence Therapy (FORT) intervention has direct implications for clinical service development to improve the quality of life for patients with breast (BC) and gynecological cancer (GC). Based on our pilot data, we are confident that the FORT intervention can guide the development of effective psychosocial cancer survivorship interventions to reduce FCR and improve psychological functioning among women with BC or GC.

Two weeks after discharge, 10% and 32% of women after vaginal and abdominal surgery, respectively, required narcotic pain medications (P<.01). By 6 weeks, approximately half of the women in either group reported they felt recovered and two-thirds felt \"back to normal.\"Pain control after hospital discharge is suboptimal for many women after both vaginal and abdominal surgery. The time to full recovery is longer than 6 weeks for half of women.

Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) represent such an opportunity. Herein, we describe our successful creation of 43 tumor organoid cultures and nine adjacent normal tissue organoid cultures derived from patients with endometrial or ovarian cancer. From an initial set of 45 tumor tissues and seven ascites fluid samples harvested at surgery, 83% grew as organoids. Drug sensitivity testing and organoid cell viability assays were performed in 19 PDOs, a process that was accomplished within seven days of obtaining the initial surgical tumor sample. Sufficient numbers of cells were obtained to facilitate testing of the most commonly used agents for ovarian and endometrial cancer. The models reflected a range of sensitivity to platinum-containing chemotherapy as well as other relevant agents. One PDO from a patient treated prior to surgery with neoadjuvant trastuzumab successfully predicted the patient's postoperative chemotherapy and trastuzumab resistance. In addition, the PDO drug sensitivity assay identified alternative treatment options that are currently used in the second-line setting. Our findings suggest that PDOs could be used as a preclinical platform for personalized cancer therapy for gynecologic cancer patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13122901", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3171335529", "source": "openalex"}

This review outlines the dysregulated stemness-related genes or transcription factors in gynecological cancers. Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch signaling are important pathways in tissue pattern programming and cell fate determination during embryonic development. Hyperactivation of these two pathways was frequently observed in gynecological malignancies such as ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers. In contrast, the expression profiles of pluripotency-regulating core transcriptional circuitry: Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 appear heterogeneous. Among these transcription factors, overexpression of Nanog was found to exert a prominent effect in gynecological tumorigenesis, while dysregulations of Oct4 and Sox2 may vary in a context dependent manner. On the other hand, the isolation of putative CSC illustrates a hierarchy model of tumor heterogeneity, in which only a subset of cells among biologically distinct populations can initiate tumor growth. Re-activation of these pluripotent transcription factors (Nanog, Oct4 and/or Sox2) in association with distinct tumorigenic properties could be found in clones isolated from gynecological tumors using various approaches. Recent understanding on the roles of Hh and Notch signaling in enhancing CSC survival may help to better understand the mechanism of carcinogenesis and identify new pharmaceutical targets for gynecological malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-27.1121", "url": "https://openalex.org/W171595586", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Patients with a histological diagnosis of borderline tumor (BOT), non‐invasive and invasive low‐grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) and high‐grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination, were retrospectively identified from two ultrasound centers. The masses were described using the terms of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis Group. Results Sixty‐four (15.8%) women had a serous BOT, 11 (2.7%) a non‐invasive LGSC, 31 (7.6%) an invasive LGSC and 300 (73.9%) had a HGSC. The vast majority of BOTs (82.3%) and non‐invasive LGSCs (90.9%) were Stage I according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification scheme, whereas most invasive LGSCs (74.2%) and HGSCs (74.0%) were FIGO Stage III. On ultrasound examination, most borderline lesions were described as unilocular‐solid (54.7%) or as multilocular‐solid (29.7%) cysts. Papillary projections were present in 52 (81.3%) BOTs. Most non‐invasive LGSCs (63.6%) were multilocular‐solid cysts and 81.8% had papillary projections. Invasive LGSCs were multilocular‐solid cysts in 54.8% of cases, and papillary projections were present in 32.3% of lesions. HGSCs were multilocular‐solid (32.7%) or solid (64.0%) masses, with papillary projections in only 7% of cases. Conclusions Papillary projections were the most typical ultrasound feature of non‐invasive (borderline and low‐grade) malignant serous tumors, while the presence of solid components but few, if any, papillations was the most representative feature of invasive (low‐grade and high‐grade) serous tumors.

Recent findings Major advances are made since the first description of pelvic exenteration and the operation is still under evolution. Explorative laparoscopy prior to exenteration is a valuable alternative to laparotomy to elect candidates for pelvic exenteration. There are considerable differences with respect to indications, contraindications, preoperative staging and adjuvant therapy after exenteration in different countries. Advances in laparoscopic instruments also led to the laparoscopic exenteration. The main limiting step of the operation is urinary diversion. New techniques of laparoscopic-assisted and robotic-assisted techniques of urinary diversion have been reported that decrease the operation time. Vascularized muscle flaps are preferred by many surgeons to fill the empty pelvis and provide an acceptable vaginal reconstruction. J-pouch seems to be a safer technique than end-to-end coloanal anastomosis for bowel reconstruction. Developments in the bioengineering tissue for pelvic reconstruction are required. Summary Laparoscopy has the advantages of decreased blood loss, improved convalescence, lower incidence of wound infection and incisional hernia, short recovery periods, rapid return of bowel function, better pain control and improved cosmetics compared with laparotomy for pelvic exenteration. Magnification and improved visualization permits en-bloc dissection of tumor and good anastomosis technique. New techniques of urinary diversion, orthotopic neobladder and coloanal are promising.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0b013e32831c8436", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1993239803", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1995598019", "title": "A Mathematical Model for Interpretable Clinical Decision Support with Applications in Gynecology", "text": "Background Over time, methods for the development of clinical decision support (CDS) systems have evolved from interpretable and easy-to-use scoring systems to very complex and non-interpretable mathematical models. In order to accomplish effective decision support, CDS systems should provide information on how the model arrives at a certain decision. To address the issue of incompatibility between performance, interpretability and applicability of CDS systems, this paper proposes an innovative model structure, automatically leading to interpretable and easily applicable models. The resulting models can be used to guide clinicians when deciding upon the appropriate treatment, estimating patient-specific risks and to improve communication with patients. Methods and Findings We propose the interval coded scoring (ICS) system, which imposes that the effect of each variable on the estimated risk is constant within consecutive intervals. The number and position of the intervals are automatically obtained by solving an optimization problem, which additionally performs variable selection. The resulting model can be visualised by means of appealing scoring tables and color bars. ICS models can be used within software packages, in smartphone applications, or on paper, which is particularly useful for bedside medicine and home-monitoring. The ICS approach is illustrated on two gynecological problems: diagnosis of malignancy of ovarian tumors using a dataset containing 3,511 patients, and prediction of first trimester viability of pregnancies using a dataset of 1,435 women. Comparison of the performance of the ICS approach with a range of prediction models proposed in the literature illustrates the ability of ICS to combine optimal performance with the interpretability of simple scoring systems. Conclusions The ICS approach can improve patient-clinician communication and will provide additional insights in the importance and influence of available variables. Future challenges include extensions of the proposed methodology towards automated detection of interaction effects, multi-class decision support systems, prognosis and high-dimensional data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034312", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995598019", "source": "openalex"}

All processes need a balance between sialylation by sialyltransferase (STs) and desialylation by sialidases (also known as neuraminidases, NEU). Although there is much in uncertainty whether the sialyation plays in cancer development and progression, at least four mechanisms are proposed, including surveillance of immune system, modification of cellular apoptosis and cell death, alteration of cellular surface of cancer cells and tumor associated microenvironment responsible carcinogenesis, growth and metastases. The current review focuses on the role of glycosylation in gynecologic organ-related cancers, such as ovarian cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer. Evidence shows that sialylation involving in the alternation of surface components of cells (tumor and cells in the microenvironment of host) plays an important role for carcinogenesis (escape from immunosurveillance) and dissemination (metastasis) (sloughing from the original site of cancer, migration into the circulation system, extravasation from the circulatory system to the distant site and finally deposition and establishment on the new growth lesion to complete the metastatic process). Additionally, modification of glycosylation can enhance or alleviate the aggressive characteristics of the cancer behaviors.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is an important element of cancer‐targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The programed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) and cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) pathways are the two main targets of ICB. In this study, we provide a comprehensive review of clinical evidence concerning ICB therapy in gynecological cancers and discuss future implications. All clinical trials of ICB therapy in gynecological cancers were reviewed. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov to collect data from completed and ongoing clinical trials. The clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of ICB agents in gynecological cancers were discussed. Six phase III clinical trials have reported their results of primary outcomes, and a total of 25 phase II clinical trials have been completed. As revealed in phase III trials, pembrolizumab (a PD‐1 antibody) improved the overall survival and progression‐free survival in endometrial cancer patients with mismatch repair deficiency and cervical cancer patients with expressions of PD‐L1. Based on these findings, pembrolizumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a cancer medication used to treat certain patients with endometrial cancer or cervical cancer. Other PD‐1 antibodies, including dostarlimab and cemiplimab, also showed antitumor efficacy in clinical trials. Dostarlimab treatment showed an encouraging response rate in endometrial cancer patients with mismatch repair deficiency. Cemiplimab treatment led to a longer overall survival and a lower risk of death than chemotherapy among patients with recurrent cervical cancer. Three completed phase III trials investigated anti‐PD‐L1 agents (atezolizumab and avelumab) in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The results were not encouraging. Other strategies of ICB therapy which had showed potential clinical benefit in the treatment of gynecological cancers in early‐phase trials need to be further evaluated in late‐stage trials. The antitumor efficacy of ICB therapy is promising, and the key to making further progress in the treatment of gynecological cancers is to identify more biomarkers and explore innovative combination treatments with other targeted therapies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14412", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4283513723", "source": "openalex"}

Each SSI increases the cost of a postoperative hospital stay by more than $10,000. Thus, SSI prevention has become the focus of health care systems and hospitals because it is a reducible health care cost. Objective The objective of this review was to better understand the guidelines and recommendations related to the prevention, diagnosis, and management of SSIs. Evidence Acquisition This study is a thorough review of the most up-to-date peer-reviewed articles and review articles as well as guidelines and recommendations of various professional organizations including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Results A review of the literature has identified several evidence-based recommendations that physicians should adhere to in an effort to decrease the incidence of SSIs. Conclusions and Relevance By adhering to clinical recommendations and evidence, we can correctly prevent, diagnose, and treat SSIs. In turn, this will improve health outcomes and decrease health care–related costs, thus increasing the value of health care that we provide to patients. Furthermore, we can gain improvements in the quality measures used by hospitals and insurers.

In addition, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide microsatellites were found to be highly unstable in single cell clones of two cell lines derived from a uterine mixed mesodermal tumor. Since such instability is characteristic of cells defective in postreplication mismatch repair, we examined mismatch repair activity in extracts made from these lines. Both extracts were repair deficient, while an extract of another gynecological sarcoma cell line not exhibiting microsatellite instability was repair proficient. The repair deficiency was complemented by a colon tumor cell extract that was defective in the hMLH1 protein but not by an extract defective in hMSH2 protein. This suggested that the defect in the uterine sarcoma line could be in hMSH2. Subsequent analysis of the gene revealed a 2-bp deletion in exon 14, leading to premature truncation of the hMSH2 protein at codon 796 and no detectable wild-type gene present. These data suggest that the microsatellite instability observed in these cell lines, and possibly in a significant number of gynecological sarcomas, is due to defective postreplication mismatch repair. There was no apparent correlation with microsatellite instability and clinical outcome.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1512439430", "source": "openalex"}

Women are more likely to experience worse cancer‐related financial outcomes than men. This study evaluated breast and gynecologic cancer patients' subjective experiences of financial toxicity and associations with distress and quality of life (QOL). Methods A cross‐sectional survey study included measures of financial toxicity (Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity [COST] Version 2), distress (Patient Health Questionnaire), and QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy). Chi‐square, t ‐tests, and ANOVAs examined bivariate relationships. Two regression models tested associations between financial toxicity and distress and QOL, controlling for covariates. Financial toxicity subgroups were compared based on a validated grading system. Results Participants ( N = 273; 74% breast cancer) averaged 54.65 years (SD = 12.08), were 3.42 years (SD = 4.20) post‐diagnosis, and 33% reported cancer‐related change in employment status. Financial toxicity was “mild” overall (COST M = 26.11, SD = 11.14); 32% worried about cancer‐related financial problems ( quite a bit/very much ; item‐level analysis). Worse financial toxicity related to younger age ( p &lt; 0.001), identifying as a non‐Asian minority ( p = 0.03) or Hispanic ( p = 0.01), being single ( p &lt; 0.001), lower education ( p = 0.004), lower income ( p &lt; 0.001), late‐stage disease ( p = 0.001), recurrent disease ( p = 0.004), and active treatment ( p &lt; 0.001). In separate multivariable models, greater financial toxicity related to greater distress ( β = −0.45 p &lt; 0.001) and worse QOL ( β = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). Financial toxicity subgroups reported clinically significant differences in distress and QOL ( p 's &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Cancer‐related financial burden is associated with pervasive negative effects and may impact subgroups differently. Future research should explore financial experiences across subgroups, aiming to better identify those at risk and build targeted interventions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5763", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3178974784", "source": "openalex"}

Many studies have had methodologic limitations. Recent studies that have overcome some of these limitations have not confirmed a link between drug use and invasive ovarian cancers, although there is still a lingering question as to whether borderline tumors might be increased. It is unclear whether this merely reflects increased surveillance. Investigations regarding breast cancer risk have produced inconsistent results. In contrast, an increasing number of studies suggest that fertility drugs may have a special predisposition for the development of uterine cancers, of interest given that these tumors are recognized as particularly hormonally responsive. Additional studies are needed to clarify the effects on cancer risk of fertility drugs, especially those used in conjunction with in vitro fertilization. Because many women who have received such treatments are still relatively young, further monitoring should be pursued in large well-designed studies that enable assessment of effects within a variety of subgroups defined by both patient and disease characteristics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1307421", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2079668748", "source": "openalex"}

The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity.An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials.COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained.The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care.

However, robotic surgery has been viewed as a development of, or alternative to, laparoscopic surgery and not necessarily as a superior technology. The advantages of MIS over open surgery apply to robotic-assisted surgery as well. Nevertheless, conflicting data have been published about the advantages and disadvantages of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic surgery. In the last few years, robotic-assisted surgery has been used for various gynecological procedures such as hysterectomy, lymphadenectomy, myomectomy, sacrocolpopexy or endometriosis operations. In the present review, we analyze the current use of robotic-assisted surgery and its efficiency in gynecology. Patient-based outcomes, such as quality of life and outcomes in morbidly obese patients are also addressed. The potential benefits of single-port robotic-assisted surgery are discussed. Most of the studies published so far state that robotic-assisted surgery does not essentially improve the surgical outcome compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2798182231", "title": "Predictors of Admission After the Implementation of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Pathway for Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery", "text": "BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways in gynecologic surgery have been shown to decrease length of stay with no impact on readmission, but no study has assessed predictors of admission in this population. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of admission after laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and robotic-assisted hysterectomy (RAH) performed under an ERAS pathway. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of women undergoing LH/RAH for benign indications within an ERAS pathway. Data collected included same-day discharge, reason for admission, incidences of urgent clinic and emergency room (ER) visits, readmissions, reoperations, and 9 postulated predictors of admission listed below. Patient demographics, markers of baseline health, and clinical outcomes were compared between groups (ERAS patients discharged on the day of surgery versus admitted) using Fisher exact and Student t tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the potential risk factors for being admitted, adjusting for age, race, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score, preoperative diagnosis indicative of hysterectomy, preoperative chronic pain, completion of a preprocedure pain-coping skills counseling session, procedure time, and compliance to the ERAS pathway. RESULTS: There were 165 patients undergoing LH/RAH within an ERAS pathway; 93 (56%) were discharged on the day of surgery and 72 were admitted. There were no significant differences in ER visits, readmissions, and reoperations between groups (ER visits: discharged 13% versus admitted 13%, P = .99; 90-day readmission: discharged 4% versus admitted 7%, P = .51; and 90-day reoperation: discharged 4% versus admitted 3%, P = .70). The most common reasons for admission were postoperative urinary retention (n = 21, 30%), inadequate pain control (n = 21, 30%), postoperative nausea and vomiting (n = 7, 10%), and planned admissions (n = 7, 10%). Increased ASA physical status, being African American, and increased length of procedure were significantly associated with an increased risk of admission (ASA physical status III versus ASA physical status I or II: odds ratio [OR], 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36–7.16; P = .007; African American: OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.02–5.96; P = .04; and length of procedure, assessed in 30-minute increments: OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.50; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: We were able to define predictors of admission for patients having LH/RAH managed with an ERAS pathway. Increased ASA physical status, being African American, and increased length of procedure were significantly associated with admission after LH/RAH performed under an ERAS pathway. In addition, the incidences of urgent clinic and ER visits, readmissions, and reoperations within 90 days of surgery were similar for patients who were discharged on the day of surgery compared to those admitted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000003339", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2798182231", "source": "openalex"}

In the present work 60 plants, species belonging to 40 families were collected and their medicinal uses were documented by interviewing both genders of the local population through semi-structured interviews and open-ended questionnaires. The results of the study were compared to 14 previously published articles. The result of this study indicates that Asteraceae was the dominant family with 4 species. Similarly, the dominant life form was herb (39 species) and the most used plant part was leaf (19 species). The highest RCF (Relative Citation Frequency) value was obtained for Acacia modesta Wall. 0.71. The highest UV (Use Value) was 0.91 for Trachyspermum ammi (L.) sprague and lowest UV was 0.50 for Ficus benghalensis L. The highest ICF (Informants Consensus Factor) value 1.0 was obtained for emmenagogue and vomiting and the lowest for leucorrhoea (0.67).Conclusions: The present study shows that the study area is rich in ethnomedicinal knowledge.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3084251625", "title": "Management of prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum obesity from the FIGO Pregnancy and Non‐Communicable Diseases Committee: A FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guideline", "text": "Obstetricians and gynecologists are well positioned to influence population health through maternity and women's health services. Obesity is common in women of reproductive age and the prevalence is rising in both low-/middle-income and high-income countries1. Obesity affects requirements for assessment, monitoring, and intervention and can impact maternal and child outcomes. Obstetricians and gynecologists require guidance on the care of women of reproductive age with obesity at all time points related to pregnancy, including how to address modifiable risk factors such as diet and physical activity. Many guidelines have been developed to date, although they vary in scope, methodology, and individual recommendations. FIGO's Committee Guideline for the Management of Prepregnancy, Pregnancy, and Postpartum Obesity (Table 1) reviews good clinical practice recommendations (Table 2–4) from previously published international documents. It serves as a practical resource to support obstetricians and gynecologists in the management of women with obesity. We emphasize the role of clinicians in preventing and managing obesity for women before, during, and after pregnancy, harnessing the increased contact with healthcare professionals during this period. FIGO expects that the recommendations in this guideline will inform the development of evidence-based, country-specific guidance on the management of obesity in member organizations, that are in line with local needs, practices, policies, and available resources. Conditional Conditional Conditional Conditional Strong Obesity has become the most common medical condition in women of reproductive age and the rise in prevalence of obesity is seen in both high-income countries and low-/middle-income countries (LMICs)1. It is predicted that by 2025 more than 21% of women in the world will have obesity2. In the USA, 2011–2012 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data indicate that the prevalence of obesity in women aged 20–39 years is at least 31.8% and is even higher in women of low incomes at 61%3. The prevalence of maternal obesity varies in different African nations, ranging from 17.9% in the first trimester and up to 6.5%–50.7% in the third trimester4. Routine surveillance of weight gain during pregnancy is not conducted in many countries. However, body mass index (BMI) among women in the reproductive age group is used often as an indicator of maternal obesity and its likely effect on pregnancy outcomes and subsequent health of the woman and her child1. Obesity increases the risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which contribute to over 70% of global deaths annually5, 6. This is especially important in LMICs where 86% of premature NCD deaths occur7. Increasing evidence from the developmental origins of health and disease paradigm suggests that obesity during pregnancy not only increases the mother's risk of later NCDs but can also transfer the risk to the offspring through epigenetic mechanisms, alterations in gut microbiome, and sociocultural factors8. In addition, excessive gestational weight gain during pregnancy can result in further elevated maternal BMI in subsequent pregnancies if weight loss is not achieved in the postpartum period, particularly in the first 6–12 months9, 10. Comorbidities such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are more common in pregnant women with obesity, and this not only increases the risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus for the mother but also leads to increased fetal growth, large-for-gestational-age babies, and metabolic compromise in the offspring11-14. These outcomes in offspring are further associated with long-term consequences such as childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life15. Other long-term consequences include poor cognitive performance in the child and neurodevelopmental disorders including cerebral palsy8. Pregnant women with obesity are also more likely to deliver by cesarean and have difficulties initiating breastfeeding and a reduction in duration of breastfeeding1, 16. Obesity in pregnant mothers is also associated with immediate adverse outcomes such as stillbirth with risk increasing with higher maternal BMI17. Finally, maternal obesity places women at a higher risk of infertility18. Women with obesity are more likely to have issues with ovulation or endometrial function, and weight loss in women with obesity is associated with improved fertility19, 20. The causes of maternal obesity are multifaceted, including societal, environmental, and other factors, calling for a multisystem, life course approach to obesity prevention and management. However, obstetricians and gynecologists are uniquely positioned to influence obesity risk and prevalence through lifestyle and other interventions with women of reproductive age, before, during, and after pregnancy. The preconception and postpartum periods are opportunities for intensive nutrition and weight optimization, while during pregnancy, the focus should be on appropriate gestational weight gain while meeting nutritional requirements. Postpartum weight retention can significantly alter the weight gain trajectory of a woman during childbearing years, especially in the case of multiple pregnancies. The preconception and postpartum periods are thus key time points for weight management strategies to delay or prevent the development or progression of obesity in women, promote the health of women in pregnancy, and reduce the risks passed to future generations9. Women with obesity during pregnancy require specialist care and recommendations for this are outlined in this article. Maternity costs are higher for women with obesity due to the increased and specialized requirements associated with care and increased use of healthcare services among women with obesity21. Such issues highlight the additional importance of nutrition and weight management in the preconception and postpartum periods and to increase awareness about optimal gestational weight gain among clinicians and the general population. While healthcare models and care pathways for women before, during, and after pregnancy vary internationally, obstetricians/gynecologists and midwives are well positioned to influence population health through maternity and women's health services. However, several barriers exist in delivering these preventive services during routine clinical practice. Often, time constraints during appointments can hamper effective discussions related to nutrition and weight management during antenatal visits22, 23. A recent review of midwives' and obstetricians/gynecologists' knowledge of gestational weight gain guidelines showed that, overall, healthcare professionals demonstrated inadequate knowledge of these guidelines24. Self-reported knowledge was higher than directly assessed knowledge and a pooled analysis was difficult owing to differences in guidelines between countries. In addition, cultural influences may determine the healthcare professional's subjective perception of body image and weight and, in the absence of anthropometric measurement and classification, this could result in underestimation and assessment of weight-related risks. Resources such as the FIGO Nutrition Checklist and guidance may assist obstetricians and gynecologists by increasing professional knowledge and time management when caring for women21, 22, 25-27. Considering the increasing global rates of obesity during pregnancy and their long-term effects for the health of the mother and the next generation, it is essential to address the issue of gestational weight gain. The authors reviewed existing clinical guidelines for the management of women with obesity before, during, and after pregnancy and identify key recommendations for global clinical practice. The Pregnancy Obesity and Nutrition Initiative (PONI) developed by FIGO's Pregnancy and Non-Communicable Diseases (PNCD) Committee emphasizes that management of obesity in pregnancy should be considered in the context of a life course approach, linking with preconception and postpartum and interconception services to prevent excess weight gain before and during pregnancy5. PONI also aims to support healthcare professionals such as obstetricians/gynecologists, midwives, nurses, dietitians, and endocrinologists to develop collaborative action to prevent and reduce the burden of maternal obesity. This guidance also outlines potential actions to address the barrier of ineffective communication of risks related to maternal obesity. To date, over 30 clinical practice guidelines have been published internationally, which focus specifically on or incorporate some guidance on the management of women with obesity during pregnancy28. These guidelines vary in scope, evidence quality, and international relevance. Therefore, this guidance for the management of prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum obesity consolidates recommendations from multiple practice guidelines and suggests a pragmatic approach for the management of obesity in women before, during, and after pregnancy. This guidance is directed at healthcare providers working with women with obesity, before, during, and after pregnancy. Obesity management may require and benefit from the involvement of a variety of professionals such as general practitioners/family physicians, midwives, nurses, community health workers, dietitians, nutritionists, physiotherapists, and others29. A multidisciplinary approach to obesity management before, during, and after pregnancy is therefore recommended. The guidance outlined here is relevant to individual practitioners providing primary care, gynecological care, and support to women during pregnancy and outside of pregnancy, and their respective professional organizations. This guidance is also relevant to healthcare delivery organizations and providers as it may guide and give insight into resource requirements for this group. This includes governments, legislators, healthcare or insurance organizations, and development agencies. The article focuses on three key time points, related to pregnancy: prepregnancy (time point A), pregnancy (time point B), and the postpartum period (time point C). For the purpose of this review, obesity is defined in terms of BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a BMI score greater than 30 is considered to indicate obesity30. Obesity is further divided into three classes of increasing severity: obesity class I 30–34.9; class II 35–39.9; and class III greater than 40. The potential influence of ethnicity on BMI, body fat percentage, and associated risk factors for chronic disease should be considered and the general cut-offs outlined above may not be the most suitable for all populations, including some Asian populations30. The WHO recommends that each country make a decision on risk and desired BMI cut-offs based on the characteristics of their specific population and have identified a number of points along the BMI continuum that may indicate elevated risk in Asian populations. In some cases, a BMI of 23 or 27.5 may be a relevant marker of risk, in comparison to BMI of 25 and 3030, 31. FIGO member states using this resource should consider the specific BMI cut-offs that are appropriate for their population to identify women with obesity. The recommendations in this guideline will likely be relevant to the management of women with obesity, regardless of which BMI cut-off is used to define this risk. While this article focuses on the management of women with obesity, several of the risks associated with obesity likely start to increase when BMI enters the overweight category (usually defined as BMI 25–29)32, 33. Therefore, the advice may also be useful for women with a BMI in the overweight category who are at increased risk of adverse health outcomes and who may benefit from the diet, physical activity, and other interventions outlined throughout33. Published clinical practice guidelines that focus specifically on obesity in pregnancy and include evidence grading were considered for this review. Sources include the recent systematic review on published clinical practice guidelines on obesity in pregnancy28, supplemented with an independent review of grey literature, including the Geneva Foundation for Medical Education and Research34. To be included in the current review, a guideline needed to originate from a FIGO member organization, focus primarily on the management of pregnancy obesity rather than associated comorbidities such as gestational diabetes mellitus, and include some form of evidence grading to qualify recommendations. The recommendations from included guidelines were extracted, along with their evidence grading. Further details of the methods involved in this review are included in supporting information S1. There was variance in the evidence grading systems used by the clinical practice guidelines, and evidence gradings were translated to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework for consistency, based on the information in each of the clinical practice guidelines (supporting information S2)35. The interpretation of this can be seen in Tables 5 and 6. The sources of recommendations are referenced throughout this article and should be consulted for more details on the individual studies involved in the generation of the level of evidence qualifier. The clinical practice guidelines were reviewed in order of publication. Where conflicting guidance or evidence grading was provided, the guidance from the most recently published clinical practice guideline is outlined. This approach was taken as it best reflects the most up-to-date evidence. Each recommendation or set of related recommendations is followed by a summary of the rationale and evidence and remarks or caveats for operationalizing it in diverse settings, where relevant. For full details of the list of recommendations and corresponding evidence in each of the guidance documents, the specific reference document should be reviewed. The final advice in this document was agreed upon through independent review by members of the FIGO PNCD Committee and consolidation within the committee. Recommendation A.1. All women should have their weight and height measured and their body mass index calculated at each contact. A.1.1. Primary care services should support women of childbearing age with weight management before pregnancy and BMI should be measured. Advice on weight and lifestyle should be given during periodic health examinations, preconception counselling, contraceptive consultations, or other gynecologic care prior to pregnancy. Conditional The preconception and interpregnancy periods are good opportunities for safe weight management interventions. As many women of childbearing age may not attend preconception health services, other health presentations such as regular health examinations, routine gynecological appointments, and other primary care services should be utilized to check and monitor weight36. Weight and height should be measured and BMI calculated for all women of childbearing age to encourage them, if needed, to optimize their weight before pregnancy37, 38In addition, women with obesity may experience higher rates of contraceptive failure and thus may not present to healthcare services for pregnancy planning38, 39. Consideration should be given to weight monitoring in routine health checks and clinical presentations so that the individual weight trajectory of a woman can be considered. Recommendation A.2. All women with a BMI of ≥30 should be advised of the effect of obesity on fertility, the immediate risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, and the subsequent long-term health effect of obesity including the higher risk of NCDs for them and their children. A.2.1. Women of childbearing age with obesity should receive information and advice about the effect of obesity on fertility and the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth. Conditional Women with obesity may be unaware of the extent of adverse health outcomes of pregnancy that are related to obesity and may hold misconceptions about the relationship between diet, weight, and health in pregnancy40-42. Advice should be given to women with obesity of the effect on their fertility and the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, which include neural tube defects, macrosomia, preterm delivery, stillbirth, shoulder dystocia, cesarean delivery, GDM, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, hypertension, and thromboembolic disorders37, 43-45. A.2.2. Assessment for sleep apnea and other conditions that could affect health during pregnancy, including those of the cardiac, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, and skin systems is warranted in the preconception period. Conditional Obesity influences many body systems. The preconception period is an ideal time to assess and manage conditions that could influence the health of the mother and fetus during pregnancy25, 43. According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), baseline preconception health screening in women with obesity, where available and indicated, could include renal, liver, and thyroid function, lipids, and diabetes screen. Additional considerations include cardiovascular health (e.g. blood pressure, echocardiogram) and pulmonary function tests (including sleep apnea where relevant). For further information see the FIGO position paper on preconception health25. Recommendation A.3. All women with obesity should be encouraged to lose weight through diet and adopting a healthy lifestyle including moderate physical activity. If indicated and available, other weight management interventions might be considered, including bariatric surgery. A.3.1. Weight management strategies prior to pregnancy could include dietary, exercise, medical, and surgical approaches. Diet and exercise are the cornerstone of weight management in preconception and pregnancy. Conditional Women should be encouraged to enter pregnancy with a BMI <30, and ideally in the healthy range36. There is evidence that preconception weight loss, achieved through one or more nonsurgical or surgical interventions, has the potential to improve maternal health and reduce risk of pregnancy complications, even when the weight loss is small43, 46. Losing weight before pregnancy can have positive effects such as the reduced risk of obesity in children and improved fertility8, 47. A realistic target is weight loss generally considered to be 5%–10% of original body weight over a period of 6 months43, 48, 49. Individualized counselling sessions that include dietary modifications for weight loss and optimizing nutritional status, combined with aerobic and strengthening exercises, should be considered as the first-line therapy for the management of obesity before conception46, 49. Diet and lifestyle advice should be practical, implementable, and communicated clearly using plain and simple language50. Techniques such as goal setting, social support, and self-monitoring may support the success of diet and lifestyle interventions for weight loss51. Women with obesity are more likely to have nutritional deficiencies such as in vitamin D, iron, and vitamin B12, when compared to women with lower BMIs37. This may be due to reduced diet quality52. Dietary advice for women with obesity before pregnancy should focus on achieving weight loss or preventing further weight gain through nutrient-dense foods, following local dietary practices and guidelines that are appropriate for age, medical history, and other characteristics of the woman e.g. dietary practices, allergies, intolerances, or other specific requirements. The specific foods to recommend will vary depending on national guidance, cultural practices, and other considerations25. Detailed information on diet before conception can be found in the FIGO recommendations on adolescent, preconception, and maternal nutrition38. Due to insufficient safety data, medications and surgery for weight loss are not recommended around the time of conception, though should be considered as part of the management of obesity in women who are planning a pregnancy in the future, especially for those with comorbidities and greater severity obesity33, 44, 53. The degree of weight loss achievable with different interventions varies and practitioners and pregnant women should be aware of this in managing expectations for weight management46. Despite this, health benefits such as improved fertility are likely even with small amounts of weight loss and therefore all weight loss should be encouraged, even when achieving a healthy BMI before pregnancy is not possible47. Finally, factors related to weight management, such as depression, should be considered and addressed where appropriate to support weight loss before conception44. If preconception weight loss interventions include bariatric surgery, where possible, women should wait at least 12–18 months after treatment to conceive54. This is to allow for body weight stabilization and the identification and treatment of any nutritional deficiencies, especially in the case of malabsorptive surgery44, 55. Therefore, appropriate contraceptive advice should be given55. Women after bariatric surgery have been found to have any of a variety of vitamin and mineral deficiencies in pregnancy including vitamins A, C, D, B1, B6, B12, and K, iron, calcium, selenium, and phosphorous56. In fact, long-term periodic screening for vitamin and mineral deficiencies is recommended for women after bariatric surgery along with prescribed multivitamin and mineral supplementation57. In cases of advanced maternal age, a shorter interval after surgery could be considered, including the effect of nutritional and other obesity-related issues that are associated with a reduced time to pregnancy54. Due to the associated complexities of nutritional requirements in addition to the usual preconception needs, where possible women with a history of bariatric surgery should be referred to a dietitian before pregnancy37, 49 Recommendation A.4. All women with obesity should be advised to take at least 0.4 mg (400 μg) and consider up to 5 mg folic acid supplementation daily for at least 1–3 months before conception. A.4.1. Women with a BMI ≥30 wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take a folic acid supplement daily, starting at least 1–3 months before conception and continuing during the first trimester of pregnancy. The dose should be at least 0.4 mg (400 μg) and consideration should be given to higher dose (5 mg) as obesity is a risk factor for neural tube defects. Strong Periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of neural tube defects across resource settings58. While there are some differences within published guidelines, FIGO's advice is that all women of childbearing age should consume at least 0.4 mg (400 μg) supplementary folic acid a day for at least 1 month before conception, continuing until at least the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of neutral tube defects33, 44, 59. Consideration should be given to the potential use of a higher dose (5 mg/d) for women with obesity, for example in those who may have other additional risk factors for neural tube defects, for example pregestational diabetes or family history, in line with local and national guidelines and resources37, 60, 61. Depending on the specific diets of the population, women who could become pregnant or are planning a pregnancy may require additional vitamin and mineral supplements. A daily iodine supplement of 150 mg per day, for example, is recommended by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) for women before conception44. Other guidelines suggest consideration of a daily vitamin D supplement43. Vitamin D supplementation may help ensure women with obesity are replete in Vitamin D; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether routine supplementation is required37. Dietary intakes, medical history, and other factors such as sun exposure should be considered. Recommendation B.1. All women should have their weight and height measured and their BMI calculated at the first anetanal visit. Consider ethnic differences. Advise on appropriate gestational weight gain. B.1.1. All pregnant women should have their height and weight measured at their first antenatal visit. This can be used to calculate BMI. Data should be recorded in the medical records. Conditional Weight and height should be measured and recorded at the first antenatal visit37. These measures should be used to calculate BMI. This helps give an indication of the pregnancy risks and management requirements. As outlined previously, prepregnancy or early-pregnancy BMI of ≥30 is considered to indicate obesity, however consideration should be given to the health and other risks for women of Asian ethnicity with lower BMIs30. The frequency of subsequent weight checks should be conducted in line with local policy and practices and in consideration of the individual needs and circumstances of the woman. B.1.2. Approaches to monitor and manage gestational weight gain should be integrated into routine antenatal care practices. Strong Recent evidence illustrates that gestational weight gain is an independent risk factor for adverse health outcomes and that it has a cumulative effect, whereby mothers with obesity who gain excessive weight during pregnancy have the greatest risk of pregnancy complications43, 46, 62, 63. B.1.3. Pregnant women with a BMI ≥30 should be advised to avoid high gestational weight gain. Weight gain should be limited to 5–9 kg. Strong While the amount of gestational weight gain considered \"normal\" will vary regionally, consider advising pregnant women with obesity and a singleton pregnancy to limit gestational weight gain to approximately 5–9 kg to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes43, 45, 64. This is based on the Institute of Medicine guidelines (IOM)65. Weight gain in excess of the IOM guidelines has been shown to increase risk of many pregnancy complications, including macrosomia, and cesarean delivery66. Some research suggests however, that the risk of pregnancy complications may be further reduced by limiting gestational weight gain to lower than 5–9 kg67. In addition, excessive gestational weight gain has been associated with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in offpring68. The IOM guidelines were developed based on the ethnic diversity in the USA in 1990 and 2009 and outline ranges of acceptable gestational weight gain according to weight definitions that are based on standard BMI cut-offs, used by the WHO65, 69. In the absence of country-specific recommendations based on individual population characteristics and trends, the IOM guidelines are used widely internationally, such as in Brazil, Malawi, Australia, and New Zealand44, 70, 71. The utility of the IOM guidelines for women of Indian and other Asian backgrounds has been questioned, mostly due to the variance in BMI cut-offs used for this group72. Despite this, a recent systematic review found that gestational weight gain in excess of the IOM guidelines in Asian women was associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes72. Some Asian countries have their own country-specific guidelines, such as Japan, where national guidelines recommend lower gestational weight gain ranges than the IOM (≤5 kg)73. It is therefore prudent that in the absence of suitable country-specific guidance, the IOM guideline of 5–9 kg gestational weight gain can be used for women with obesity. The classification of obesity should, however, be based on the BMI cut-offs most appropriate to that country. This supports the correct application and interpretation of the guidelines and makes them suitable for widespread use.73-75 Recently, high-quality large-scale randomized controlled trials have reported that lifestyle interventions during pregnancy that include diet and exercise advice and behavior change support can reduce excessive gestational weight gain and the frequency of large-for-gestational-age babies (LIMIT, UPBEAT, PEARS trials)76-78. Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy that include diet and physical activity have also been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, cesarean delivery, and respiratory distress in neonates79. Other interventions incorporating dietary counselling and low glycemic index dietary advice and supervised exercise have shown promise in preventing the transmission of risk factors for childhood obesity77, 80. Recommendation B.2. All women should receive information on diet and lifestyle appropriate to their gestation including nutrient supplements, weight management, and regular physical activity. B.2.1. The mainstay of weight management during pregnancy is diet and exercise. Health professionals should provide general nutrition information and advice on a healthy diet to manage weight during pregnancy. Where resources permit, individual plans for diet and exercise for weight management should be put in place. Conditional Diet and lifestyle interventions are clinically effective in reducing gestational weight gain and preventing pregnancy complications so should be offered to women with obesity. Women with obesity may have a higher prevalence of nutritional inadequacies, and intakes of certain micronutrients have been shown to correlate with BMI81. Dietary advice should therefore emphasize healthy dietary patterns that consist of nutrient-dense foods. This may be characterized by higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13334", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3084251625", "source": "openalex"}

Such drug discovery can be performed at low cost and in the short term based on the results of previous clinical trials. New drugs for gynecologic tumors may be found by drug repositioning. For example, PPAR ligands may be effective against ovarian cancer, since PPAR activation eliminates COX‐2 expression, arrests the cell cycle, and induces apoptosis. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is effective for endometrial cancer through inhibition of the PI3K‐Akt‐mTOR pathway by activating LKB1‐AMPK and reduction of insulin and insulin‐like growth factor‐1 due to AMPK activation. COX‐2 inhibitors for cervical cancer may also be examples of drug repositioning. PGE2 is induced in the arachidonate cascade by COX‐2. PGE2 maintains high expression of COX‐2 and induces angiogenic factors including VEGF and bFGF, causing carcinogenesis. COX‐2 inhibitors suppress these actions and inhibit carcinogenesis. Combination therapy using drugs found by drug repositioning and current anticancer drugs may increase efficacy and reduce adverse drug reactions. Thus, drug repositioning may become a key approach for gynecologic cancer in drug discovery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/341362", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976195986", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: A total of 160 patients, who underwent gynecologic laparoscopy from December 2015 to January 2017, were recruited. Half of the patients received standard postoperative nursing (i.e., the control group); while the other half received acupoint massage in addition to the standard care (i.e., the observation group). The recovery time of bowel sounds, the first anal exhaust time and the first defecation time were recorded.

Data on estimated blood loss (EBL), hemoglobin (Hb) drop, procedure time, length of hospital stay, uterine weight, pain-medication use, and complications were also extracted. Results: Two hundred and eighty-one patients underwent robotic operations. Types of procedures were total hysterectomy with or without adnexal excision, and total hysterectomies with lymphadenectomies. Eighty-four patients who were classified as morbidly obese (BMI>35) were compared with 197 patients who had a BMI of<35 (nonmorbidly obese). For patients with BMI<35, and BMI>35, the mean BMI was 27.1 and 42.5 kg/m2 (p<0.05), mean age was 49 and 50 (p=0.45), mean total operative time was 222 and 266 minutes (p<0.05), console time 115 and 142 minutes (p<0.05), closing time (from undocking until port-site fascia closure) was 30 and 41 minutes (p<0.05), EBL was 67 and 79 mL (p=0.27), Hb drop was 1.6 and 1.4 (p=0.28), uterine weight was 196.2 and 227 g (p=0.52), pain-medication use 93.7 and 111 mg of morphine (p=0.46), and mean length of stay was 1.42 and 1.43 days (0.9), all respectively. No statistically significant difference was noted between the 2 groups for EBL, Hb drop, LOS, uterine weight, pain-medication use, or complications. The only statistically significant difference was seen in operating times and included docking, console, closing, and procedure times. There were no perioperative mortalities. Morbidity occurred in 24 patients (8%). In the morbidly obese group, there were 6 complications (7%) and, in the nonmorbidly obese group, there were 18 complications (9%). Conclusions: Morbid obesity does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of morbidity in patients undergoing robotically assisted gynecologic surgery. Morbid obesity is associated with increased procedure time, but otherwise appears to have no difference in outcomes. Robotic surgery offered an ideal approach, allowing minimally invasive surgery in these technically challenging patients, with no significant increase in morbidity.

A review of the literature.", "text": "Computer-enhanced telesurgery, called robotic-assisted surgery, is the latest innovation in the minimal invasive surgery field. In gynecology, this machine has been applied in several applications, in the fields of benign gynecology, reproductive medicine, urogynecology, and oncology. The purpose of this paper was to review the published scientific literature regarding robotics and its application to gynecology thus far and summarize findings of this computer enhanced laparoscopic technique. Relevant sources were identified by a Pubmed/Medline search looking at databases from January 1950 to July 2009. A total of 29 papers in benign gynecology were identified, and a total of 44 articles were analyzed involving gynecologic oncology. The estimated blood loss, number of lymph nodes extracted, operating time, length of hospital stay and complications were noted among all the studies. The data shows comparable results between robotic and laparoscopic surgery in terms of estimated blood loss, operative time, length of hospital stay, and complications for gynecologic cancer. Overall, there were more wound complications in the laparotomy approach compared to laparoscopy and robotic assisted laparoscopy. There were more lymphocysts, lymphoceles, and lymphedema in the robotic assisted laparoscopic group compared to the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in cervical cancer patients. Infectious and lung-related morbidity, postoperative ileus, and bleeding/clot formation was more commonly reported in the laparotomy group compared the other two cohorts in endometrial cancer patients. Computer enhanced technology may enable more surgeons to convert their laparotomies to laparoscopic surgery with its associated benefits. It appears that in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, final outcomes are the same when using or not using the robot. There is good evidence that robotic surgery facilitates laparoscopic surgery, with equivalent if not better operative time and comparable surgical outcomes, shorter hospital stays, and fewer major complications than those surgeries utilizing the laparotomy approach.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W108728598", "source": "openalex"}

This Institutional Review Board-approved study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring on the ability of patients to successfully bypass the phase I recovery area following gynecologic laparoscopy during general anesthesia. Methods Ninety-nine consenting patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group one, in which the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA) was used, and group two, in which no BIS monitor was used. All patients received a standardized anesthetic that included 1 microg/kg sufentanil and sevoflurane in oxygen, titrated in group one to a BIS value of 50-60 and in group two to maintain vital signs within 20% of preoperative values. All patients received prophylactic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antiemetics. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated using the modified Aldrete scoring system, and those who achieved a score of 9 or higher within 10 min were permitted to bypass the phase I recovery area. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the number of patients who successfully bypassed the phase I recovery area, postoperative length of hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization. Conclusion With a standardized anesthetic regimen and a strict discharge scoring system, BIS monitoring does not have a significant effect on the ability to fast track outpatients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200304000-00010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969474807", "source": "openalex"}

Demographically the groups were similar: the majority of respondents were white, urban and well educated. A history of heterosexual coitus was common in both groups (bisexuals, 95%; lesbians, 77%). Bisexuals were more likely than lesbians to report an abnormal Papanicolaou smear, cystitis, genital herpes, gonorrhea and vaginal infections. When sexual orientation was controlled for, most, but not all, of these differences were associated with a difference in reported frequency of (prior) coitus. Despite the lower risk of certain problems, however, the lesbians who reported no previous coitus did report the occurrence of vaginitis, abnormal Papanicolaou smears and genital herpes. There were no differences in past oral contraceptive use, endometriosis, menstrual dysfunction or breast disease. The lesbian group reported a greater percentage of hysterectomies.

Computed tomographic examinations are often performed to evaluate the presence of appendicitis or renal stone disease. However, gynecologic abnormalities are frequently identified on these examinations. Although ultrasound remains the primary modality by which complaints specific to the pelvis are evaluated, in many instances, CT and MRI imaging occurs before sonographic evaluation. Historically, because of cost, radiation exposure, and relative ease of use, ultrasound examinations have preceded all other imaging modalities when evaluating pelvic disorders. However, as CT and MRI technology have improved, their use in diagnosing causes of pelvic pain has become equal to that of ultrasound. In some cases, primarily because of historic comfort with sonographic evaluation, gynecologic abnormalities originally diagnosed on CT or MRI may be immediately and unnecessarily reevaluated by ultrasound. For a woman in her reproductive years, the most common adnexal masses are physiological cysts, endometriomas, and cystic teratomas. Although lesions are often asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they can present with pain, and they increase the risk of ovarian torsion. Common causes of chronic pelvic pain in this population include leiomyomata and adenomyosis. In postmenopausal women, ovarian carcinoma, which often does not present clinically until a late stage, has to be included in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. If a gynecologic pathology is discovered on CT or MRI, an immediate follow-up ultrasound need not be pursued if the lesion can be characterized as benign, needing immediate surgical intervention, or a variant of normal anatomy. If, on the other hand, findings demonstrate a mass that either is uncharacteristic of a benign lesion, has an indeterminate risk for malignancy, or demonstrates suspicious characteristics for malignancy (such as enhancing mural nodules), further evaluation by serial ultrasound, biochemical marker, and/or CT or MRI is warranted. The purpose of this review is to present a series of commonly encountered gynecologic abnormalities with either CT or MR to make radiologists more familiar with gynecologic pathology on CT and MRI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ruq.0b013e31815202df", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010871896", "source": "openalex"}

Cases were identified by searching institutional Electronic Discharge Database. A comprehensive review of medical documentation was then performed to collect relevant data. The detection of VTE was symptom-triggered. A total of 155 VTE events were identified out of 7562 cases over the past 10-year period in our hospital. The incidence of clinically significant VTE was 2.0% in gynecologic malignancy, with vulvar cancer (3.7%) and ovarian cancer (2.5%) being the high-risk types (P = 0.01, Chi-square test). Perioperative period (35.1%) and preoperation (29.1%) were the 2 incidence peaks. Seventeen cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred prior to surgery. Ovarian cancer patients were more likely to present preoperative PE compared to other site of cancer (76.4%; P = 0.01, Chi-square test). More preoperative VTE cases were complicated by PE than those in the perioperative period (39.5% vs 17.3%, P = 0.02, Chi-square test). Bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) accounted for 32.6% and there existed a preponderance of left-sided DVT (47.5% vs 17.0%, ratio 2.79:1). Femoral vein (36.6%) was the most common location for DVT. About 2.0% of the Chinese patients with gynecologic carcinoma developed clinical VTE, mostly during perioperative period and the time of diagnosis.

Although risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) and various screening regimens are currently recommended to reduce ovarian cancer risk, the optimal management strategy has not been established nor have multiple additional issues been adequately addressed. We developed a collaboration among the Clinical Genetics Branch (National Cancer Institute's Intramural Research Program), the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), and the Cancer Genetics Network to address these issues. Methods: This is a prospective, international, two-cohort, nonrandomized study of women at genetic risk of ovarian cancer, who chose either to undergo RRSO or screening, at study enrollment. Primary study objectives include quantifying and comparing ovarian and breast cancer incidence in the two study groups, assessing feasibility and selected performance characteristics of a novel ovarian cancer screening strategy (the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm), evaluating various aspects of quality of life and nononcologic morbidity related to various interventions in at-risk women, and creating a biospecimen repository for subsequent translational research. Results: Study accrual is complete as of November 2006; 2,605 participants enrolled: 1,030 (40%) into the surgical cohort and 1,575 (60%) into the screening cohort. Five years of prospective follow-up ends in November 2011. Verification of BRCA mutation carrier status is under way, either through patient-provided reports from clinical genetic testing done before enrollment or through research-based genetic testing being conducted as part of the protocol. Patient eligibility is currently under evaluation and baseline, surgical, pathology, and outcome data are still being collected. The study design and selected baseline characteristics of cohort members are summarized. Conclusion: This National Cancer Institute intramural/extramural collaboration will provide invaluable prospectively collected observational data on women at high familial ovarian cancer risk, including substantial numbers of women carrying BRCA1/2 mutations. These data will aid in elucidating the effect of RRSO on breast/ovarian cancer risk and the effects of two management strategies, on quality of life and other issues that may influence patient care, as well as providing preliminary estimates of test specificity and positive predictive value of a novel ovarian cancer screening strategy.

Methods Women with a histological diagnosis of Sertoli cell tumor, Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor or Leydig cell tumor who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination were identified from the databases of each of three participating ultrasound centers. The tumors were characterized on the basis of ultrasound images, ultrasound reports and research protocols (when applicable) using the terms and definitions published by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group. In addition, all images were reviewed and described using pattern recognition. Results Of 22 patients identified, 15 had Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors, two had Sertoli cell tumors and five had Leydig cell tumors. Four patients were postmenopausal, one 48‐year‐old woman had undergone hysterectomy, 16 were of fertile age and one was a 4‐year‐old girl. Most patients (82%, 18/22) had endocrine symptoms, the most common being bleeding disturbance (64%, 14/22) and hirsutism (32%, 7/22). Twenty‐two (96%) of 23 tumors (one woman had bilateral tumors) contained a solid component; 16 (70%) were purely solid. Pattern recognition showed that the Leydig cell tumors were small solid tumors (four of five had a largest diameter of 1–3 cm) and the two Sertoli cell tumors were somewhat larger solid tumors (4 cm and 7 cm); the Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors were either small (3–4 cm) or medium‐sized (6–7 cm) solid tumors, or multilocular solid tumors of any size (3–18 cm) with purely solid areas mixed with areas of innumerable closely packed small cyst locules. Conclusions On the basis of endocrine symptoms, the woman's age and ultrasound findings, it should be possible to suggest a correct preoperative diagnosis of Sertoli cell, Sertoli–Leydig cell or Leydig cell tumors in many cases.

Distant metastases were the most common type of secondary involvement (64.8%), followed by direct extension (19.9%) and local recurrence (15.3%). Gastrointestinal tumors involved mostly the ovaries, endometrial tumors the vagina, ovarian tumors the myometrium, and urothelial tumors the cervix/vagina (P<0.0001). Vaginal lesions endometrial origin presented with only superficial invasion (P=0.0002). The primary tumor's features dictate a different pattern of secondary involvement of the gynecologic tract. Endometrial tumors produce mostly superficial vaginal recurrences, mucus-producing gastrointestinal tumors present with ovarian metastases, whereas breast tumors affect the entire gynecologic tract and present the tumors with the most late recurrences.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0000000000000516", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2801950480", "source": "openalex"}

Written informed consent was obtained before each examination. Thirty-four consecutive patients with a suspected recurrence of cervical (n = 18) or ovarian (n = 16) cancer were prospectively enrolled for an integrated PET/MRI examination, which comprised a diagnostic, contrast-enhanced whole-body MRI protocol including dedicated sagittal dynamic imaging of the pelvis. Two radiologists separately evaluated the data sets regarding lesion count, lesion detection, lesion characterization, and diagnostic confidence. Mean and median values were calculated for each rating. Statistical analyses were performed both per-patient and per-lesion bases using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to indicate potential significant differences among PET/MRI and MRI (alone) data sets.Malignant lesions were present in 25 of the 34 patients. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging offered correct and superior identification of all 25 patients with cancer recurrence, compared with MRI alone (23/25). A total of 118 lesions (malignant, 89; benign, 29) were detected. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified 88 (98.9%) of 89 malignant lesions, whereas MRI alone allowed for correct identification of 79 (88.8%) of the 89 malignant lesions. In addition, PET/MRI provided significantly higher lesion contrast and diagnostic confidence in the detection of malignant lesions (P < 0.001) compared with MRI alone.These first results demonstrate the high diagnostic potential of integrated PET/MRI for the assessment of recurrence of female pelvic malignancies compared with MRI alone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000086", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2029153154", "source": "openalex"}

Although the quality of data for robot-assisted surgery is still low to moderate, the use of robot-assisted surgery has rapidly increased since its approval, which highlights the need to develop effective and thoughtful strategies for its implementation. Reporting of adverse events currently is voluntary and nonstandardized; therefore, the true rate of complications is not known. Adoption of new surgical techniques should be driven by what is best for the patient and by evidence-based medicine, rather than external pressures. Although training in robot-assisted surgery increasingly is incorporated into obstetric and gynecologic residency programs, exposure to and training with robotic devices varies nationally. Obstetrician-gynecologists not previously trained in robot-assisted surgery can acquire the necessary skills through independent robot-assisted training programs and through courses offered and accredited by organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons, the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, and the American Urogynecologic Society. Ongoing quality assurance is essential to ensure appropriate use of the technology and, most importantly, patient safety.

Women with a history of surgically confirmed endometriosis were excluded.Prior to surgery, women completed standardized abuse questionnaires. Relative risk (RR) of incident endometriosis, uterine fibroids, adhesions or ovarian cysts by abuse history were estimated, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking, gravidity and recruitment site. We assessed whether a history of chronic pelvic pain, depression, or STIs explained any relationships via mediation analyses.43 and 39% of women reported experiencing sexual and physical abuse.

The focus of cancer treatment, in addition to curation, is improving the quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of Amharic version of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) among gynecological cancer patients in Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted using the Amharic version of EORTC QLQ-C30 on 153 gynecological cancer patients in Tikur Anbassa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multivariable linear regression were employed in statistical analysis. Results The Amharic version of EORTC QLQ-C30 had a Cronbach's α value of 0.81. The internal consistency for each domain of EORTC QLQ-C30 was also acceptable (Cronbach's α >0.7) except for cognitive function domain (Cronbach's α = 0.29). Stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis showed that emotional functioning (p<0.001), fatigue (p<0.001) and social functioning (p = 0.004) were the determinative scales of EORTC QLQ-C30 on global health status (GHS). The clinical validity test (Known group validity) showed that there were significant differences in score for twelve out of 15 domains, between surgery and radiation scheduled patients. All items of emotional function, role function, fatigue, and GHS meet the discriminate validity criterion. Conclusion The Amharic version of EORTC QLQ-C30 found to be reliable and had an acceptable validity to assess the QOL for gynecological cancer patients.

The present study aims to check the conservative treatments available for lymphedema after gynecological cancer in the context of evidence-based practice. Methods: The selection criteria included papers from May 1993 discussing treatment protocols used in LLL after treatment for gynecological cancer. The search was performed until October 2014 in MEDLINE, SciVerse, and PEDro using “rehabilitation,” “treatment outcome,” “therapeutics,” “clinical protocol,” “gynecologic surgery,” “lower extremity,” “lower limb,” and “lymphedema” as keywords, focused on women with a previous diagnosis of gynecological cancer who received radiation and/or chemotherapy and/or surgery and/or lymphadenectomy as part of their treatment. Results: From 110 studies found, 3 articles that used the complex decongestive therapy (CDT) as a treatment protocol were selected. There were no randomized clinical trials associated with the conservative treatment of LLL post-treatment of gynecological cancer. The three selected articles are retrospective, and had the same outcome – decreased volume of the affected limb lymphedema. Conclusions: Although LLL is more or as frequent and detrimental as upper limb lymphedema post-cancer treatment, there are only a few studies about this subject.

This review provides a summary of current literature that will help the clinician to correctly diagnose and treat patients with small-cell carcinomas of the cervix, ovary, uterus, vagina, and vulva. Recent findings Small-cell carcinomas of gynecologic sites are rare and carry a poor prognosis. Stage is an important prognostic factor in small-cell carcinoma of the cervix, uterus, and ovary. Early stage disease has varied treatment approaches based on the site of malignancy, but systemic chemotherapy with or without radiation plays a role in the adjuvant setting to mitigate the risk of recurrence. Advanced stage patients require treatment with chemotherapy and possibly radiation, usually in a manner analogous to small-cell lung cancer. The preferred chemotherapy regimen contains a platinum agent and etoposide. For small-cell ovarian carcinomas, it is important to differentiate those of the hypercalcemic type from those of the pulmonary type. The small-cell carcinomas of the vagina and vulva need to be distinguished from Merkel cell cancers. Summary The majority of small-cell tumors of the gynecologic tract will require systemic chemotherapy with a platinum agent and etoposide, both in the setting of early and advanced stage disease.

In this study, we compared the effects of oxycodone and fentanyl on postoperative pain in patients with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) after laparoscopic gynecological surgery. Methods Seventy-four patients undergoing elective total laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopic myomectomy were randomly assigned to the administration of either fentanyl or oxycodone using IV-PCA (potency ratio 1 : 60). The cumulative dose administered in the patient-controlled mode during the initial 48 hours after the operation was measured. Patients were also assessed for postoperative pain severity, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. Results No significant differences were observed in patient satisfaction with the analgesia during the postoperative period. Patients in the oxycodone group experienced significantly more dizziness compared to the fentanyl group. Patients in the oxycodone group showed significantly lower consumption of opioid in the patient-controlled mode (10.1 ± 8.5 ml vs. 16.6 ± 12.0 ml, P = 0.013). Conclusions Our data suggest that oxycodone and fentanyl demonstrated similar effects, and therefore oxycodone may be a good alternative to fentanyl in postoperative pain management.

Based on the relatively high tissue-specific expression pattern, it has been proposed that the mammaglobin A protein and/or its complex with lipophilin B could be used in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. In view of these clinical implications, the aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of both genes in a large panel of human solid tumors (n = 309), corresponding normal tissues (n = 309) and cell lines (n = 11), in order to evaluate their tissue specific expression and co-expression pattern. Methods For gene and protein expression analyses, northern blot, dot blot hybridization of matched tumor/normal arrays (cancer profiling arrays), quantitative RT-PCR, non-radioisotopic RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used. Results Cancer profiling array data demonstrated that mammaglobin A and lipophilin B expression is not restricted to normal and malignant breast tissue. Both genes were abundantly expressed in tumors of the female genital tract, i.e. endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer. In these four tissues the expression pattern of mammaglobin A and lipophilin B was highly concordant, with both genes being down-, up- or not regulated in the same tissue samples. In breast tissue, mammaglobin A expression was down-regulated in 49% and up-regulated in 12% of breast tumor specimens compared with matching normal tissues, while lipophilin B was down-regulated in 59% and up-regulated in 3% of cases. In endometrial tissue, expression of mammaglobin A and lipophilin B was clearly up-regulated in tumors (47% and 49% respectively). Both genes exhibited down-regulation in 22% of endometrial tumors. The only exceptions to this concordance of mammaglobin A/lipophilin B expression were normal and malignant tissues of prostate and kidney, where only lipophilin B was abundantly expressed and mammaglobin A was entirely absent. RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of mammaglobin A on a cellular level in endometrial and cervical cancer and their corresponding normal tissues. Conclusion Altogether, these data suggest that expression of mammaglobin A and lipophilin B might be controlled in different tissues by the same regulatory transcriptional mechanisms. Diagnostic assays based on mammaglobin A expression and/or the mammaglobin A/lipophilin B complex appear to be less specific for breast cancer, but with a broader spectrum of potential applications, which includes gynecologic malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-6-88", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149723023", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3119979733", "title": "Pyroptosis and inflammasomes in obstetrical and gynecological diseases", "text": "Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, takes an essential part in a wide variety of physiological activities, for instance, implantation, placentation and the body's defense against infection. However, once excessively activated, pyroptosis mediated by the activation of inflammasomes can be highly pathological. It can cause inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including a variety of obstetrical and gynecological diseases, such as endometriosis, gestational diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome, and multiple obstetric complications including preeclampsia. Although the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of the above mentioned diseases has not been fully elucidated, we try to tap its therapeutic potential by targeting pyroptosis signaling and inflammasome formation. Pyroptosis and inflammasomes are confirmed to be involved in endometriosis and gynecological malignant tumors, therefore, medical approachs inducing pyroptosis of the ectopic endometrium and tumor cells can be feasible treatments for endometriosis and gynecological cancers. On the maternal-fetal interface, although a certain level of the innate immune response activation is required for a successful implantation and placentation, maternal and fetal injury may occur once the inflammasomes are over-activated. Besides, since gestational diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome share common pathogenesis with metabolic diseases, this domain research sheds light on future study of some obstetrical and gynecological diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2021.1871893", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3119979733", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we sought to examine the safety and efficacy of ciprofol use for the induction of general anesthesia in individuals undergoing gynecological surgery. Methods Women between the ages of 18 and 60 years (ASA physical status 1 or 2) who were scheduled to undergo elective gynecological surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to two equally sized groups in which anesthesia induction was performed using either ciprofol or propofol. General anesthesia induction success rates were the primary outcome for this study, while secondary outcomes included changes in BIS during the 10 min following the first administration of the study drug, the duration of successful induction, and adverse event incidence. Results A total of 120 women were included in the study. A 100% rate of successful induction was achieved in both the ciprofol and propofol groups, with no significant differences between these groups with respect to the duration of successful induction (34.8 ± 15.5 s vs 35.4 ± 9.5 s, P = 0.832), the time to the disappearance of the eyelash reflex (33.7 ± 10.6 s vs 34.0 ± 6.5 s, P = 0.860), or tracheal intubation (58.2 ± 31.1 s vs 53.9 ± 25.4 s, P = 0.448). Adverse event rates, including intubation responses, were significantly lower in the ciprofol group as compared to the propofol group(20% vs 48.33%, P = 0.0019). Ciprofol was associated with reduced injection pain relative to propofol (16.7% vs 58.3%, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Ciprofol exhibits comparable efficacy to that of propofol when used for the induction of general anesthesia in individuals undergoing gynecological surgery and is associated with fewer adverse events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-022-01782-7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4289711996", "source": "openalex"}

The cost, lack of haptic feedback, and the bulky size of the equipment make robotics less attractive to others. Studies evaluating outcomes in robotic-assisted gynecologic surgery are limited. Multiple small retrospective studies demonstrate the safety and feasibility of robotic hysterectomy. With increased surgeon experience, operative times are similar to, or shorter than, laparoscopic cases. Robotic assistance can facilitate suturing in laparoscopic myomectomies, and is associated with decreased blood loss and a shorter hospital stay, although may require longer operative times.

Compared with other types of cancer patients, survivors of GC face greater challenges in terms of physical and psychological adaptations, and many of these do not receive sufficient assistance. An in-depth understanding of the lived experiences and demands of GC survivors is key to constructing comprehensive related healthcare services.The aim of this study was to understand the lived experience of GC survivors in Taiwan to help their return to a healthy life.This was a phenomenological study. Twenty-three survivors of GC participated in semistructured interviews that were held in a private environment. The transcripts were based on synchronous recordings from the interviews. Giorgi's phenomenology analysis was adopted for data analysis.Three themes with six subthemes were extracted from the data, including (a) the inner struggle of living with cancer and recurrence: repeatedly exploring the causes of cancer and treatment and facing a fear of cancer recurrence, (b) the interpretation and adjustment to cancer treatment: filled with fluctuating physical and mental distress and working to adopt a different perspective, and (c) the long passage of finding a desirable lifestyle: adjusting to long-term coexistence with side effects and realizing the strength of society, body, and mind.The journey of rehabilitation for GC survivors is very long. The participants in this study faced different respective challenges during the diagnosis, treatment, and adjustment phases. Conventional disease-oriented medical care cannot satisfy the requirements of cancer patients because of patient-decentralized services.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent gynecologic surgery from May 2006 to June 2015 at two tertiary care academic hospitals in Massachusetts. Billing and diagnosis codes were used to identify surgeries and cases of venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: A total of 43,751 surgical encounters among 37,485 individual patients were noted during the study. The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism is 0.2% for all gynecologic surgeries, 0.7% for hysterectomy, and 0.2% for myomectomy. Compared with patients undergoing laparotomy, patients who underwent minimally invasive gynecologic surgery were less likely to develop venous thromboembolism (laparoscopy risk ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.13–0.37; vaginal surgery risk ratio 0.07, 95% CI 0.04–0.12). This effect persisted when data were adjusted for other known venous thromboembolism risk factors such as age, race, cancer, medical comorbidities, use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, admission status, and surgical time. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive surgery is associated with a decreased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery, including hysterectomy and myomectomy. Although society guidelines and risk assessment tools do not currently account for mode of surgery when assessing venous thromboembolism risk and recommendations for prevention, there is a small but growing body of evidence in both general and gynecologic surgery literature that surgical approach affects a patient's risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Mode of surgery should be considered when assessing venous thromboembolism risk and planning venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000002918", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2897890349", "source": "openalex"}

This study aims to evaluate its capacity to improve surgical view and bowel handling in the deep pelvis. METHODS: A single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken with laparoscopic gynecologic surgical patients assigned to one of the following three groups: fasting only; minimal residue diet for 2 days; or minimal residue diet for 2 days plus mechanical bowel preparation with oral sodium picosulphate. Outcomes included intraoperative surgical view and bowel handling, preoperative patient symptomatology, hematologic and biochemical characteristics, and bowel function. RESULTS: Three hundred eight participants were randomized. The intraoperative surgical view and bowel handling was minimally but statistically better in the minimal residue plus mechanical bowel preparation group compared with the other groups with less than a 1-point difference on a 10-point visual analog scale (P<.01 and P<.04, respectively). Women were assessed at baseline and on the day of surgery for the difference in visual analog scale score in the fasting only, minimal residue diet, and minimal residue diet with mechanical bowel preparation groups for headache (2.2 compared with 10.5 compared with 21; P<.01), thirst (14.7 compared with 24.7 compared with 30.9; P<.01), weakness (−0.2 compared with 16.6 compared with 25; P<.01), tiredness (−4.5 compared with 8.1 compared with 15.4; P<.01), anxiety (12.5 compared with 10.1 compared with 10.3; P=.66), and discomfort (−8.2 compared with 8.7 compared with 6.6; P<.01), respectively. Hematologic parameters were not different among the groups, and there was no significant difference in bowel function between the groups. CONCLUSION: Minimal residue diet plus mechanical bowel preparation provides statistical improvement in surgical view and bowel handling, but the benefit is likely of little clinical significance given overall blinded ratings from surgeons. Given the significant symptoms and discomfort caused for patients undertaking minimal residue diet with or without mechanical bowel preparation, fasting only without any preoperative diet or bowel preparation is a preferable alternative for laparoscopic gynecologic surgery involving the posterior pelvic compartment.

It is vital that pretreatment nodal staging be accurate and reliable. Current imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have limitations because they rely almost exclusively on size criteria. MR lymphography uses a lymph node–specific contrast agent (ferumoxtran-10) composed of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. The contrast agent is taken up by macrophages within benign lymph nodes and allows differentiation from malignant nodes on the basis of alterations in signal intensity. This technique has been shown to increase the sensitivity and specificity of detection of lymph node metastases independent of nodal size.

Patients and Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we evaluated data of 215 patients (83 cases and 132 controls) undergoing extensive gynecological surgery (e.g. oncological procedures) with and without intraoperative HM application. Results: Cases and controls did not differ according to age, preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and Hb or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at discharge.

Participants responded to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer and Problem List measuring distress and problems. They also answered a questionnaire regarding physical endurance, muscle strength, and need for rehabilitation services.Of 114 eligible women, 92 (81%) agreed to participate. Mean time since last treatment was 7.6 months (range 0-24.5 months). A total of 57% of the participants reported distress. The four most common problems reported were fatigue (58%), tingling in hands/feet (54%), worry (53%), and problems with memory/concentration (50%). Problems associated with distress were: dealing with partner, all emotional problems (i.e. depression, fears, nervousness, sadness, worry, and loss of interest in usual activities), appearance, memory/concentration, pain, sex, sleep, and problems with physical endurance and muscle strength. Fifty-two percent reported unmet needs for rehabilitation services. Women with distress reported more unmet rehabilitation needs than those in the non-distressed group.The prevalence of distress in this population of women treated for gynecological cancer was high. Having a high number of problems and having unmet needs for rehabilitation services were both associated with distress.

The curriculum and competency assessment tools were developed based on existing national and international guidelines for the performance of obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound examinations and thus are intended to represent the minimum requirement for such training. By expert consensus, the curriculum was developed for each year of training, criteria for each competency assessment image were generated, the pass score was established at, or close to, 75% for each, and obtaining a set of 5 ultrasound images with pass score in each was deemed necessary for attaining each competency. Given the current lack of substantial data on competency assessment in ultrasound training, the task force expects that the criteria set forth in this document will evolve with time. The task force also encourages use of ultrasound simulation in residency training and expects that simulation will play a significant part in the curriculum and the competency assessment process.

Students' reflective writing assignments, guided by a series of six questions designed to elicit students' perceptions of moral conflicts they have encountered and their personal and professional ethical values, were collected from three successive cohorts of third-year medical students (n = 299) from July 2002 to January 2006 during an obstetrics-gynecology clerkship at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine. Content, thematic, and global narrative analyses of students' reflective writing were conducted, drawing on content analysis, grounded theory, and narrative methodologies.Values conflicts usually were patient centered (181; 60.5%) and student centered (172; 57.5%), without much regard for important contextual issues such as patients' socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, or culture. Common personal values included religious beliefs (82; 27.4%), respect (72; 24.1%), and the Golden Rule (66; 22.1%); frequent professional values were respect (72; 25.1%), beneficence (71; 23.7%), nonmaleficence (69; 23.1%), and autonomy (65; 21.7%).

All cases were immunostained using anti-CD31 antibody to delineate capillary endothelial cells. In parallel, all cases were immunostained using anti-PSMA antibody. The PSMA staining was assessed in tumor capillaries and in normal tissues and scored as a percentage of CD31 staining. PSMA expression was found in the tumor neovasculature, and no significant expression was identified in vasculature of normal tissues. The extent of PSMA staining in tumor capillaries varied from high expression in ovarian and endometrial cancers, to medium expression in cervical squamous cell carcinomas, and low expression in cervical adenocarcinomas and vulvar cancers. All (100%) cases of primary ovarian carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma metastases, and primary endometrial carcinoma showed PSMA expression in tumor vasculature, which was diffuse in majority of cases.

This article reviews data regarding changes in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Residency education is focusing more on a core curriculum in general obstetrics and gynecology, while subspecialty fellowship training has grown in popularity. There are no recent data to describe whether OB-GYNs are working fewer hours, yet more are employed in larger practices at mostly metropolitan locations. A team-based care model that incorporates nonphysician clinicians and digital conversion of clinical data has been encouraged to increase accessibility, improve comprehensiveness, commit to more continuity of care, and reduce redundancy. Compared with other medical specialists, OB-GYNs retire slightly earlier, especially females who will represent the field more. The specialty is moving toward a more comprehensive women's health care practice model that is more patient-centered, efficient, cost controlling, team-based, and adaptable to the needs of a diverse population. Implications from these changes for our practices and improving patient care are currently unclear and await more reported experience. Target Audience Obstetricians, gynecologists, and family physicians.

Practice differs depending on training and tradition, not only between but even within countries. For example, at the University of Toronto, Canada's largest academic center, obstetric ultrasound is performed and interpreted by radiologists and obstetricians/gynecologists who work closely with sonographers, nurses and trainees, whereas gynecological ultrasound is almost exclusively the domain of radiologists. Conversely, at the University of Ottawa, the maternal–fetal medicine specialists perform and interpret not only obstetric ultrasound but also a significant portion of gynecological ultrasound. It is therefore obvious that two cities, which are both under the jurisdiction of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), have a different approach to ultrasonography, particularly gynecological ultrasound. This is a perfectly adequate approach to care, in which qualified healthcare professionals provide quality care regardless of their specialty. However, it could result in various specialist training programs producing graduates with varying degrees of proficiency in Ob/Gyn ultrasound. If we are to provide quality care to women, it is imperative that those performing and interpreting Ob/Gyn ultrasound have undergone the appropriate training and are qualified to practice safely and competently. Recently, we completed a survey of Ob/Gyn trainees in Canada1 to determine whether Ob/Gyn ultrasound training across Canada is aligned with the recommendations of the RCPSC and the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG)2 . The study highlighted the variation in ultrasound training across Canadian Ob/Gyn training programs with respect to the format, quantity and focus of training. The time devoted to obstetric ultrasound training exceeded significantly that devoted to gynecological ultrasound, with an average of 85% of formal rotation time being dedicated to obstetric ultrasound compared with 15% for gynecological ultrasound. Five of the 16 Canadian residency programs did not include gynecological ultrasound training over the 5-year training period. Consequently, we identified low levels of self-reported competency in gynecological ultrasound tasks, which could limit future clinical practice. In this editorial, we compare and contrast Ob/Gyn training curricula published by regulatory bodies in four high-income English-speaking countries with the standards set by ISUOG, and make a case for the standardization of Ob/Gyn training, with due regard to available resources. In the contemporary field of Ob/Gyn, in which point-of-care ultrasonography is rapidly becoming an expectation and a requirement3, 4, there is a view that obstetrician/gynecologist training should go beyond understanding indications for ultrasound and how to manage the subsequent findings5. It follows that all Ob/Gyn trainees should receive, at minimum, a basic level of theoretical and skill-based education in both obstetric and gynecological ultrasound5. This is particularly relevant as ultrasound technology becomes more accessible and integral to the management of women's health3, 6. Pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis and cervical cancer are only some of the conditions for which there is substantial evidence that ultrasound has the potential to optimize patient care7-9. The real-time, dynamic nature of ultrasound lends itself well to being performed and interpreted by obstetricians/gynecologists to facilitate timely and appropriate treatment decisions. Central to the utility of ultrasound in Ob/Gyn is education. Both baseline standards of care and research and development in the field of ultrasound rely heavily on adequate and conscientious specialized training and education. As the leading organization for the use of ultrasound in Ob/Gyn, ISUOG's published recommendations for Ob/Gyn ultrasound training act as a benchmark (Table 1)2. These recommendations can be compared with training recommendations by various international regulatory bodies (Table 2). For example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has aligned its comprehensive set of ultrasound professional competencies to these recommendations10. However, discrepancies between ISUOG and ACOG recommendations still exist: ACOG does not require its trainees to be able to perform an ultrasound assessment for pelvic masses and considers that their being able to interpret the ultrasound findings is satisfactory. ACOG collaborates with the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), which has its own set of necessary parameters in both obstetric and gynecological ultrasound11, 12. Although these are not specific to Ob/Gyn training, obstetricians/gynecologists who perform ultrasound are expected to adhere to these standards. To aid healthcare providers in understanding how to obtain sufficient training to perform safely ultrasound examinations, AIUM has also published physician training guidelines13, 14. Whereas both AIUM and ISUOG offer comprehensive and valuable guidance on basic ultrasound standards and education, differences are revealed when evaluating critically their recommendations. For instance, ISUOG recommends the use of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis Group terminology for the assessment of pelvic masses, whereas AIUM does not. ACOG and other regulatory bodies alike face challenges in determining which organization to follow when setting their guidelines. Recognize features of intrauterine pregnancy (gestational sac, yolk sac and embryo) Recognize fetal viability and non-viability Adequately measure MSD, CRL and BPD (if applicable) Ascertain if multiple gestation and, if so, determine chorionicity Understand how to calculate or correct gestational age estimation from CRL Recognize features of extrauterine (ectopic) pregnancy Understand concept of PUL and how to interpret serum biochemistry to assign risk Obtain standardized planes for anatomical and biometric evaluation (e.g. BPD, HC, AC, FL, cervical length) Understand interpretation of measurement deviations (e.g. for calculating gestational age, recognizing growth restriction) Recognize, subjectively or objectively, normal and abnormal amniotic fluid volume Recognize placental location in relationship to lower uterine segment and cervix (recognizing and reporting placenta previa) Recognize umbilical cord and its insertions on placenta and fetal abdominal wall Recognize fetal anatomical landmarks and identify possible abnormal findings Assessment of uterus in both its longitudinal and transverse planes Measurement of endometrial thickness and description of endometrial morphology. Recognizing and describing focal intracavitary pathology (polyps and submucous fibroids) Examination of myometrium for evidence of fibroids and adenomyosis Examination of ovaries, and how to describe their morphology and size. Pathology should be reported in terms of its appearance and dimensions using a standardized approach. This should include knowledge of IOTA terminology Examination of pelvis for presence of fluid Confirm diagnosis of multiple gestation by performing endovaginal or abdominal ultrasound examination Perform and/or interpret results of ultrasound used in diagnosis and management of early-pregnancy loss Perform and interpret results of endovaginal ultrasound to confirm diagnosis and location of ectopic pregnancy Crown–rump length and gestational age Confirmation of intrauterine pregnancy Recognition and documentation of fetal heart rate Identify intrauterine pregnancy in first trimester > 6 weeks Recognize number of fetuses Measure gestational sac to obtain mean sac diameter Measure crown–rump length Recognize presence/absence of fetal heart motion using M-mode Identify features of normal gestational sac and confirm its intrauterine location Measure gestational sac size and crown–rump length Identify early cardiac activity using B-mode Identify fetal number Perform accurate ultrasound examination to assess fetal growth Confirm diagnosis of fetal death by ultrasound examination Abdominal or endovaginal ultrasound to localize placenta and evaluate for possible placental separation Fetal position and number Placental location Amniotic fluid volume assessment Fetal biometry: biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length Cervical-length measurement Biophysical profile test Recognize presence/absence of fetal heart motion using M-mode Determine presentation of pregnancy Measure deepest vertical pool Locate placenta Perform and interpret standard fetal measurements (head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, femur length) Perform and interpret assessment of amniotic fluid volume (maximum vertical pool depth and amniotic fluid index) using ultrasound Perform and interpret ultrasound assessment of placental site transabdominally Perform, and interpret results of, pelvic ultrasound and/or saline infusion ultrasound to determine cause of abnormal uterine bleeding Perform and/or interpret tests, such as endovaginal or abdominal ultrasound, to confirm diagnosis of pelvic mass Intermediate level – optional curriculum Consistently identify and examine uterus, ovaries, adnexa and pouch of Douglas Assess cyclical endometrial changes and endometrial responses to combined pill and other hormonal preparations Assess uterine size and measure accurately endometrial thickness Assess ovarian volume and functional changes in ovaries and adnexa during menstrual cycle: follicular appearances, variation in morphology of corpora lutea, functional cysts, fluid in pouch of Douglas In Canada, training objectives set out by the RCPSC for obstetricians/gynecologists were expanded in 2016 to include additional skills, such as identifying an intrauterine pregnancy and measuring crown–rump length to determine gestational age15, 16. Despite this revision, the list of standards for obstetric ultrasound skills is still not as comprehensive as that of ISUOG. Canadian graduates are not expected to diagnose multiple gestation in the first trimester, determine chorionicity or identify extrauterine pregnancies, as recommended by ISUOG. Furthermore, the RCPSC still focuses entirely on obstetric ultrasound and does not require Canadian trainees to receive any skill-based education in gynecological ultrasound. Interestingly, a joint statement addressing ultrasound examination of the female pelvis by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada and the Canadian Association of Radiologists merely suggested that 'subspecialty training in ultrasound' is sufficient for obstetricians/gynecologists to be involved in the performance, supervision and interpretation of ultrasonography, without explicitly stating what constitutes 'subspecialty training'17. In Australia and New Zealand, ultrasound training requirements are specified by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG)18. The RANZCOG training objectives, although thorough with regard to obstetric ultrasound, still exhibit gaps in their standards. For example, ISUOG recommends that the diagnosis of an extrauterine pregnancy is a basic skill, whereas RANZCOG does not. Unlike RCPSC, RANZCOG requirements include gynecological ultrasound training to identify the uterus, ovaries and cervix. This does not, however, match ISUOG's list of basic gynecological tasks. Fortunately, Australia and New Zealand are unique in offering a formally recognized fellowship in ultrasound, entitled Certification in Obstetrical and Gynaecological Ultrasound, for obstetricians/gynecologists who hope to maximize their training and integrate ultrasound into their day-to-day practice19. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in the UK has no baseline requirement for Ob/Gyn graduates to possess skills in gynecological ultrasound. However, similarly to RANZCOG, RCOG offers an optional intermediate-level curriculum in gynecological ultrasound for those keen to pursue advanced imaging education in this field. Nonetheless, all trainees are expected to achieve competency, as determined by clinical supervisors, in basic obstetric ultrasound20. The minimum standards of RANZCOG are aligned with the obstetric recommendations proposed by ISUOG, with the exception of not requiring trainees to be able to diagnose ectopic pregnancy or to determine chorionicity in multiple gestations. National training requirements and the path to competency in ultrasound differ between European countries5. Among countries in which obstetricians/gynecologists are known to perform the majority of ultrasound scans (France, Germany, Switzerland), completing a regulated supplementary program (outside of the regular Ob/Gyn specialist training) is required. Though this is reassuring in terms of ensuring competency of the graduates of these subspecialty programs, not all Ob/Gyn trainees undergo this high-level training. Therefore, are graduates of general Ob/Gyn programs able to fulfill basic recommended ultrasound skills? In some European countries, formal ultrasound curricula exist, and in some cases there are guidelines on the minimum number of scans required to achieve competency. Again, even though clear national standards are important for trainees, the variation in requirements (for example, 80 logged obstetric scans in Denmark vs 400 in Switzerland) begs the question of how competency is defined in each country5. The European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (EBCOG) is attempting to address this shortcoming by offering a set of standards for when an Ob/Gyn ultrasound is performed21, without outlining detailed skill-based requirements22. Nonetheless, it recommends that obstetricians/gynecologists should understand the relevant ultrasound aspects of the obstetric and gynecological disease processes23 and log at least 200 obstetric and 100 gynecological ultrasound scans prior to performing ultrasound examinations independently22, 23. The number of logged scans recommended by AIUM and ISUOG differ (300 vs 100 each for both obstetrics and gynecology, respectively)2, 13, 14. Ultimately, the specific number of scans required to obtain competency will depend on the trainee and the complexity of the cases. In the era of competency-based training programs, we must question whether a minimum threshold number of scans should even exist at all24. However, at this time, it seems that an estimate of the number of logged scans needed to establish competency is still necessary for regulatory bodies and educational centers to plan training programs. It may be useful to turn to learning-curve studies in order to understand the average process of learning a new technique to reach a level of competency25. To conclude, regulatory bodies within each country can learn from organizations such as ISUOG, AIUM and EBCOG with respect to developing more comprehensive training requirements. Beyond that, there should be an emphasis on whether current approaches to ultrasound training in Ob/Gyn are optimal for patient safety and whether they meet the standards for quality assurance. It is fortunate that the abovementioned organizations strive to combine evidence-based medicine with expert opinion to make recommendations on educational methodologies. It is now up to the regulatory bodies in individual countries to assess critically their current models of ultrasound education in Ob/Gyn and attempt to draft comprehensive standards with guidance from relevant international ultrasound societies. These standards should take into account specific considerations such as the available resources, clinical needs and historical practice patterns. Accordingly, Ob/Gyn trainees, and by extension the patients they will care for in future practice, will be much better served.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.18978", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2773605568", "source": "openalex"}

Two hundred female patients (ASA physical status I) were randomly allocated to one of five groups (n = 40 for each): saline (as a control), granisetron 2 micro g/kg, granisetron 5 micro g/kg, granisetron 10 micro g/kg, and granisetron 20 micro g/kg. Saline or granisetron was given intravenously immediately after induction of anesthesia. PONV was assessed 24 h after surgery. The percentage of emesis-free patients was significantly greater in the 5- to 20-micro g/kg granisetron groups than in the control and 2-micro g/kg granisetron groups (18%, 23%, 68%, 78%, and 75% of patients receiving saline or granisetron 2 micro g/kg, 5 micro g/kg, 10 micro g/kg, and 20 micro g/kg, respectively). Granisetron doses of 5 micro g/kg or larger were also superior to the saline and 2-micro g/kg granisetron treatment for the prevention of nausea over the 24-h study period (nausea visual analog scales 24 h after surgery: 49, 41, 18, 16, and 14 mm in the control and granisetron 2 micro g/kg, 5 micro g/kg, 10 micro g/kg, and 20 micro g/kg groups, respectively). A smaller proportion of patients received \"rescue\" antiemetic in the 5-micro g/kg or larger granisetron groups than in the control and 2-micro g/kg granisetron groups (48%, 40%, 18%, 13%, and 10% of patients in the control and granisetron 2 micro g/kg, 5 micro g/kg, 10 micro g/kg, and 20 micro g/kg groups, respectively). The antiemetic effect of granisetron was similar among the groups who received 5-micro g/kg or larger doses. In conclusion, we suggest that the optimal dose of granisetron is 5 micro g/kg for the prevention of PONV after gynecological surgery. Implications: Nausea and vomiting postoperatively after gynecologic surgery is a significant problem. The authors found that granisetron, a selective antagonist of serotonin, markedly decreases the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting at doses of 5 micro g/kg or larger.

Through August 2000, 8869 specimens, including fresh neoplastic tissues and normal counterparts, body fluids (ascites, tumor content, and blood), and cervical scrapings, were procured from 1853 patients. DNA and RNA were extracted from a random sampling of normal (n = 50) and tumor (n = 53) tissues from the uterine cervix (n = 47), endometrium (n = 24), and ovary (n = 32). As expected, tumor tissues conferred a higher yield of DNA (1.56 +/- 1.24 versus 0.94 +/- 0.72 microg/mg tissue, P = 0.001) and RNA (5.04 +/- 6.21 versus 2.12 +/- 1.76 microg/ml, P < 0.001) than normal tissues. However, the RNA message abundance, as measured by RNA yield/DNA yield, was not different between tumor and normal tissues. With a similar content of DNA in the endometrium, uterine cervix, and ovary, RNA yield was higher in the endometrium than the others (P = 0.013). In tumors from these three sites, similar yields of DNA and RNA were noted. Overall the yield of DNA remained unchanged from specimens preserved for as long as 7 years, although at this length of storage, RNA yield became lower and variable. This study provides the basic characteristics of nucleic acids derived from normal and tumor tissues and ensures future research utility of these frozen specimens.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-1438.2002.01085.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112747142", "source": "openalex"}

Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 2 mg IV and propofol 1 mg/kg, IV, and maintained with propofol, 50-160 μ·kg−1·min−1, IV, and nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen via a face mask. Intraoperative anesthetic conditions, recovery times, and postoperative pain and side effects were evaluated. In the ketorolac group, 75% of patients required supplemental fentanyl intraoperatively (mean dose ± SD, 47 ± 54 μg), compared to only 19% (13 ± 30 μg) and 18% (6 ± 15 μg) of patients in the fentanyl and combination groups, respectively. In the ketorolac group, 74% of patients moved in response to surgical stimulation compared to only 16% and 19% of patients in the fentanyl and combination groups, respectively. Although there were no significant differences in intraoperative mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin values among the three treatment groups, the ketorolac group manifested significantly more rapid respiratory rates throughout the procedure compared with the fentanyl and combination groups. Recovery times, postoperative side effects, and pain scores, as well as postoperative analgesic and antiemetic requirements, were similar in all three treatment groups. However, the ketorolac group reported significantly higher pain scores in the early postoperative period. In conclusion, ketorolac alone failed to provide adequate intraoperative analgesia and the use of ketorolac in combination with fentanyl did not decrease recovery times or postoperative side effects compared to fentanyl alone in this outpatient population.

In 2005, the FDA granted gynecological surgery approval for the Da Vinci surgical system. It has been quickly embraced and has already taken on a significant role at many of the locations where it is offered. It consists of a cart with robotic branches next to the patient and a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) vision system. This study covers laparoscopy via robots in benign gynecological surgeries, myomectomy surgery, hysterectomies, endometriosis, tubal anastomosis, and sacrocolpopexy. The appropriate published studies were evaluated after a PubMed search was conducted. Additionally, procedures that may be used in the future are highlighted. In benign gynecological illness, most currently available research does not show a substantial benefit over traditional laparoscopic surgery. Robotics, however, does provide help in more complicated operations. Compared to laparoscopy, robotic assistance has a lower conversion rate to open procedures. Endo wrist movement of an automated machine during myomectomy surgery can perform proper and better suturing than traditional laparoscopy. The automated program is a noticeable improvement over laparoscopic surgery and, if price issues are resolved, can gain popularity among gynecological surgeons around the globe.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29190", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4295949367", "source": "openalex"}

Thus, considerable attention has been paid not only to the role of the RAS in cancer progression, but also to the blockade of RAS as a new approach to the treatment of human cancer. There is increasing evidence that the Ang II-AT1R pathway is involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in various experimental animal models, suggesting the therapeutic potential of an ACE inhibitor and AT1R blocker. In addition, specific Ang II-degrading enzymes are also expressed in tumors and play a regulatory role in tumor cell proliferation and invasion. This review focuses on the role of the RAS in the progression of gynecologic cancers, such as cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and gestational choriocarcinoma. We present here the clinical potential of blocking the RAS as a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of gynecologic cancers.

Persistent vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, or recurrent urinary tract infections after mesh placement should prompt an examination and possible further evaluation for exposure or erosion. A careful history and physical examination is essential in the diagnosis of mesh and graft complications. A clear understanding of the location and extent of mesh placement, as well as the patient's symptoms and therapy goals, are necessary to plan treatment approaches. It is important that a treating obstetrician-gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider who seeks to revise or remove implanted mesh be aware of the details of the index procedure. Diagnostic testing for a suspected mesh complication can include cystoscopy, proctoscopy, colonoscopy, or radiologic imaging. These tests should be pursued to answer specific questions related to management. Given the diverse nature of complications related to mesh-augmented pelvic floor surgery, there are no universal recommendations regarding minimum testing. Approaches to management of mesh-related complications in pelvic floor surgery include observation, physical therapy, medications, and surgery. Obstetrician-gynecologists should counsel women who are considering surgical revision or removal of mesh about the complex exchanges that can occur between positive and adverse pelvic floor functions across each additional procedure starting with the device implant. Detailed counseling regarding the risks and benefits of mesh revision or removal surgery is essential and can be conducted most thoroughly by a clinician who has experience performing these procedures.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to identify risk factors associated with urologic injury.During the study period, there were 86 cases of urologic injuries from a total of 28 819 cases. The overall 10-year incidence was 0.30%. The incidence of bladder injury was 0.18%, (0.083% for ureteric and 0.014% for combined ureter and bladder injury). Among 80 cases with complete data, 52 (65%) had bladder injury and 48 (92.3%) were recognized the time of surgery and underwent primary repair with successful outcome, whereas 18 (75%) of 24 ureteric injury were detected intraoperatively. Previous pelvic surgery and the presence of adhesion were significant risk factors of urologic injury with OR 3.436, 95% CI 2.037-5.796 and OR 2.185, 95% CI 1.319-3.621, respectively.Urinary bladder injury was the most common urinary tract injury during gynecologic surgery.

The two most common terms, controlled-clinical-trial (publication type) and randomized-controlled-trial (publication type), were combined with the link word, OR, and then used to identify RCTs in four obstetrics and gynecology journals for the years 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995. Concurrently, a handsearch of these same journals and years was performed to identify RCTs. The sensitivity and precision of MEDLINE and handsearch were calculated using the total number of RCTs identified by both methods as a reference standard. Sensitivity is the RCTs identified by search strategy as a percentage of all RCTs identified by reference standard. Precision is the RCTs identified by a search strategy as a percentage of all articles identified by it.The overall sensitivity of our MEDLINE search strategy was 72.5%, and the precision was 83.4%. Over 2 decades, sensitivity of our MEDLINE search increased from 0% to 94.9% (P < .001), while its precision dropped from 100% to 75.5% (P=.003). For 1990 and 1995 combined, sensitivity and precision of our MEDLINE search strategy were 90.3% and 79.6%, respectively. Overall sensitivity for handsearch was 96.5%; its precision was 5.0%. Over 2 decades, the sensitivity of handsearch dropped insignificantly from 100% to 92.3% (P=.05), while the precision increased from 2.6% to 6.3% (P < .001).Our simple MEDLINE search strategy has a high sensitivity and precision, especially in more recent years.

Botulinum neurotoxin has been identified in seven different isoforms (BoNT-A, BoNT-B, BoNT-C, BoNT-D, BoNT-E, BoNT-F, and BoNT-G). Neurotoxigenic Clostridia can produce more than 40 different BoNT subtypes and, recently, a new BoNT serotype (BoNT-X) has been reported in some studies. BoNT-X has not been shown to actually be an active neurotoxin despite its catalytically active LC, so it should be described as a putative eighth serotype. The mechanism of action of the serotypes is similar: they inhibit the release of acetylcholine from the nerve endings but their therapeutically potency varies. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is the most studied serotype for therapeutic purposes. Regarding the gynecological pathology, a series of studies based on the efficiency of its use in the treatment of refractory myofascial pelvic pain, vaginism, dyspareunia, vulvodynia and overactive bladder or urinary incontinence have been reported.

Most women present with locally advanced disease, requiring chemotherapy and radiation. Care co-ordination requires input from a multidisciplinary team (MDT) to deliver appropriate, timely treatment. However, there are limited published examples of MDT implementation in LMICs.In May 2015, a weekly MDT clinic for gynecologic cancer care was initiated at Botswana's national referral facility. The MDT clinic served as a forum for discussion and coordination of patients with gynecologic cancer and consisted of a gynecologist, pathologist, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, palliative care specialist, and nurse coordinator.Between May 2015 and December 2015, 135 patients were seen in the MDT clinic. The mean age of the patients was 49 years. Most (60%) of the patients were HIV positive. The most common diagnosis was cervical cancer (60%), followed by high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions (12%) and vulvar cancer (11%). Only data up to September 2015 were assessed for treatment delays. It was found that only 38% of patients needed more than one visit for care coordination before treatment initiation. Among patients with cervical cancer, the median delay from date of biopsy to start of radiation treatment was 39 days (interquartile range, 34 to 57 days) for patients treated after MDT initiation, compared with 108 days (interquartile range, 71 to 147 days) for patients treated before MDT initiation (P < .001).Implementation of MDT clinics in LMICs is feasible and can help reduce delays in treatment initiation, as demonstrated by a gynecologic MDT clinic in Botswana. Streamlining care through MDT clinics can enhance care coordination and improve clinical outcomes.

Materials and Methods A search of PubMed database was performed, using the search terms “vaginal microbiome” with “reproduction,” “infertility,” “fertility,” “miscarriages,” “pregnancy” “cervical cancer,” “endometrial cancer,” and “ovarian cancer.” Full article texts were reviewed. Reference lists were screened for additional articles. Results The fourth article of this series focuses on 2 distinct areas: the role of VMB in various aspects of human reproduction and, in sharp contrast, the association between the VMB and gynecologic malignancies. Several of the negative pregnancy outcomes have been associated with an altered VMB. Dysbiosis is remarkably linked with poor pregnancy outcomes from preconception to delivery. The associations between the microbiome and gynecologic cancers are described. Conclusions The development of the microbiome research, enabled by molecular-based techniques, has dramatically increased the detection of microorganisms and the understanding of bacterial communities that are relevant to maternal-fetal medicine in health and disease, as well as in gynecological malignancies. Proving causation in cancer is difficult because of the complex interactive nature of potential causative factors.

Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, acts by binding to HER2/neu extracellular domain and exhibits therapeutic efficacy in HER2/neu-overexpressing cancers. Two uterine carcinosarcomas (UMMT-ARK-1, UMMT-ARK-2) and 2 ovarian carcinosarcomas (OMMT-ARK-1, OMMT-ARK-2) were established as primary tumor cell lines in vitro and evaluated for HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and for membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins CD46, CD55, and CD59 by flow cytometry. Sensitivity to trastuzumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity was studied in 5-hr chromium release assays. HER2/neu expression was demonstrated in OMMT-ARK-1 and OMMT-ARK-2. OMMT-ARK-2 demonstrated an amplification of the c-erbB2 gene by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis and a high sensitivity to ADCC (mean killing, 45.6%; range, 32.3%-72.6%). A lower level of killing was detected against the fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis-negative OMMT-ARK-1 cell line (mean, 26.5%; range, 21.0%-31.8%). CD46, CD55, and CD59 membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins were expressed at high levels in all primary mixed müllerian tumor cell lines, and all these tumors were found to be highly resistant to complement-dependent cytotoxicity with or without trastuzumab. Addition of untreated and heat-inactivated plasma did not significantly decrease ADCC against OMMT-ARK-2 cell line, suggesting that while the cell line is highly resistant to complement, irrelevant IgG does not significantly alter the ability of trastuzumab to mediate ADCC.

Survival and outcome are strongly related to the stage at diagnosis. Therefore, early diagnosis is essential in reducing morbidity and mortality. The high mortality rate of gynecological cancers can mainly be attributed to ovarian cancer (OC). OC is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage due to a lack of proper screening tools allowing early detection. Endometrial cancer (EC) on the contrary, is mostly diagnosed at an early stage and has, in general, better outcomes. The incidence of nonendometrioid EC has increased in the last decade, displaying a shared tumor biology with OC and consequently significantly worse outcome. New approaches allowing detection of gynecological cancers in an early stage are therefore desired. Recent studies on cancer biology have shown the relevance of altered glycosylation in the occurrence and progression of cancer. The aberrant expression of sialic acid, a specific carbohydrate terminating glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell-surface, is frequently correlated with malignancy. We aimed to determine the current understanding of sialic acid function in different gynecological cancers to identify the gaps in knowledge and its potential use for new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Therefore we performed a review on current literature focusing on studies where sialylation was linked to gynecological cancers.

Imaging cytometry indicated that the majority of the oxygen radical flux triggered by atovaquone occurred in the mitochondria. Atovaquone decreased the viability of patient-derived cancer stem-like cells and spheroids implanted in NSG mice. NMR metabolomics showed shifts in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, electron transport chain, phosphotransfer, and metabolism following atovaquone treatment. Our studies provide the mechanistic understanding and preclinical data to support the further investigation of atovaquone’s potential as a gynecologic cancer therapeutic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14092297", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4229043522", "source": "openalex"}

Use of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for monitoring gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has set the standard to which other assays must be compared. Beta hCG and alphafetoprotein have provided useful markers for ovarian germ cell tumors. Recently, a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for CA 125 antigen has been used to monitor the treatment of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Persistent elevation of CA 125 in serum has generally reflected persistence of disease at second look surveillance procedures. CA 125 levels can, however, return to within normal limits and residual disease can be found at laparoscopy or laparotomy. CA 125 shows promise for distinguishing benign from malignant pelvic masses. Trials are currently underway to evaluate the potential of CA 125 in combination with other markers to facilitate earlier detection of occult ovarian cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19901015)60:8+<1984::aid-cncr2820601510>3.0.co;2-w", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986590390", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of SS1(dsFv)PE38, a recombinant antimesothelin immunotoxin, against human gynecologic tumors grown in short-term culture in vitro.Tumor cells obtained from primary cultures of five ovarian and one cervical tumor were mixed with an equal proportion of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and plated inside collagen gels in tissue culture plates. After 4-7 days of growth, these organotypic cultures were treated with media alone, SS1(dsFv)PE38, and a control immunotoxin RFB4(dsFv)PE38, which targets the CD22 antigen not present on gynecologic tumors, every other day x 3. The organotypic culture gels were then formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and evaluated for immunotoxin sensitivity using light microscopic examination of H&E-stained slides and also evaluated for apoptosis using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay.Tumors expressing mesothelin showed a significant dose-dependent sensitivity to SS1(dsFv)PE38 even at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, whereas no antitumor activity was seen at 100 ng/ml in tumors that did not express mesothelin. This activity was specifically attributable to mesothelin targeting because RFB4 (dsFv)-PE38 had no activity against mesothelin-expressing tumors.These results demonstrate that ovarian and cervical tumor cells obtained from patients can be grown in short-term culture using an organotypic culture model. Our results also show low concentrations of an immunotoxin targeting mesothelin is cytotoxic to mesothelin-expressing human tumors by inducing apoptosis.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120353092", "source": "openalex"}

These include attainment of normal growth, involvement in romantic relationships, and the desire to control fertility. As an increasing number of adolescent transplant recipients are involved in normal social and sexual relationships, they require careful attention to their gynecologic and reproductive health care needs. Anticipating the onset of sexual activity before it occurs may help to prevent a mistimed pregnancy by providing or prescribing condoms and emergency contraception in advance. In addition, many transplant recipients can safely use the currently available methods of hormonal contraception provided there is careful attention to organ function, other medical problems, and concurrently prescribed medications. In adolescent patients, issues such as pubertal development and menstruation, contraception, and routine gynecologic health care are typically addressed by the patient's primary care provider. However, the complexity of the adolescent transplant recipient's medical care necessitates close collaboration among all health care providers caring for the patient. This review is intended to help the transplant team better understand the gynecologic health care needs and treatment options of their adolescent patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00266.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046433849", "source": "openalex"}

The reproducibility (precision) of cytologic interpretation is less well defined. Objective.—To establish and compare the reproducibility (precision) of cytologic interpretation in gynecologic cytopathology, as reflected in the educational program of the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Cervicovaginal Cytology (PAP). Methods.—The pathologists' interpretations for both validated (25 745 responses) and educational conventional (14 353 responses) slides in the PAP program for 2001 were analyzed. The frequency of exact matches between the reference and pathologists' interpretation for each of the cytologic interpretative categories was identified, and the cumulative distributions of exact match rates were derived. χ2 Tests by reference interpretations were used for cytodiagnostic categories, least and most reproducible groupings, and high-grade (HSIL) versus low-grade (LSIL) squamous intraepithelial lesions. Results.—Pathologists' interpretations of negative, Candida, Trichomonas, herpes, and LSIL were characterized by a high degree of exact matching, while interpretations of repair, HSIL, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinomas were characterized by a lesser degree of exact matching (reproducibility). Pathologists' cytologic interpretations of HSIL were significantly less reproducible than those of LSIL. Conclusion.—The cytologic interpretations of the most significant categories (HSIL, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma) are less precise than those of specific infection (Candida, Trichomonas, and yeast), negative, and LSIL categories. Cytologic interpretations of LSIL are made with greater precision than those of HSIL and may represent a more appropriate endpoint to measure the precision performance of gynecologic cytology laboratories.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5858/2003-127-1413-pigcia", "url": "https://openalex.org/W30493650", "source": "openalex"}

The folkloric use of medicinal herbs in gynecological disorders has been growing in Jordan, despite of deficient reports on the evidence-based safety and efficacy of these practices.Objective The aim of this comprehensive article is to review medicinal plants with claimed ethnonpharmacological usage in various gynecological and pregnancy-related issues in Jordan, and to assess their evidence-based pharmacological studies as well as their phytochemistry.Methods The published literature was surveyed using Google Scholar entering the terms \"ethnopharmacology AND Jordan AND infertility AND gynecology OR gestation\". We included ethnopharmacological surveys in Jordan with available full-text.Results Twelve articles were reviewed. Plant species which are commonly used for female gynecological issues such as Artemisia monosperma Del. and A. herba-alba Asso. (Asteraceae) have been found to exert an antifertility effect. Ricinus communis L. (Euphorbiaceae) and Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad. (Cucurbitaceae) had antifertility effects in male rats, but Nigella sativa oil L. (Ranunculaceae) and Cinnamon zeylanicum J. Presl (Lauraceae) were found to enhance it.Conclusion Using plants for gynecological disorders is a common practice in Jordan. Many of them, whether utilised for gynecological or non-gynecological conditions equally, were found to have detrimental effects on female or male fertility.

CSCs/CICs are resistant to several therapies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. CSCs/CICs thus are thought to be responsible for recurrence and distant metastasis, and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of CSCs/CICs are essential to design CSC/CIC-targeting therapy. In this study, we analyzed the molecular aspects of gynecological CSCs/CICs. Gynecological CSCs/CICs were isolated as ALDH1 high cell by Aldefluor assay. The gene expression profile of CSCs/CICs revealed that several genes related to stress responses are preferentially expressed in gynecological CSCs/CICs. Among the stress response genes, a small heat shock protein HSP27 has a role in the maintenance of gynecological CSCs/CICs. The upstream transcription factor of HSP27, heat shock factior-1 (HSF1) was activated by phosphorylation at serine 326 residue (pSer326) in CSCs/CICs, and phosphorylation at serine 326 residue is essential for induction of HSP27. Immunohistochemical staining using clinical ovarian cancer samples revealed that higher expressions of HSF1 pSer326 was related to poorer prognosis. These findings indicate that activation of HSF1 at Ser326 residue and transcription of HSP27 is related to the maintenance of gynecological CSCs/CICs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.16361", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2597032601", "source": "openalex"}

An individual diagnosis and therapy recommendation for each patient is reached by consensus. All protocols, guidelines, and publication data are upgraded and dispersed via Internet for all participants. In the period from December 2004 to August 2006, 39 tumor board conferences were performed with a total of 667 participants. One hundred forty-four patients' cases were presented, and 121 peer-reviewed second-opinions were sought. In an anonymous survey, 84% of the participants reported to be satisfied with the information content and 72% with the technical support.

However, there is little information on risk factors for VTE during gynecologic surgery and no uniform preventive strategy. Our objectives were to identify risk factors for perioperative VTE in gynecologic patients and establish methods for prevention. We analyzed 1,232 patients who underwent surgery at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of St. Marianna University School of Medicine between January 2005 and June 2008. We investigated (1) risk factors for preoperative VTE, (2) use of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and (3) risk factors for postoperative VTE. There were 39 confirmed cases of perioperative VTE (3.17%), including 25 patients with preoperative VTE and 14 with postoperative VTE. Thirty-two patients had cancer and seven patients had benign diseases. Twenty-two of the 32 cancer patients (68.7%) had preoperative VTE, while postoperative VTE occurred in 10 cancer patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that ovarian cancer, tumor diameter ≥10 cm, and previous of VTE were independent risk factors for preoperative VTE. Among ovarian cancer patients, multivariate analysis showed that an age ≥50 years, the presence of heart disease, clear cell adenocarcinoma, and tumor diameter ≥20 cm were independent risk factors for preoperative VTE. The factors significantly related to preoperative VTE in patients with benign disease included previous VTE, age ≥55 years, tumor diameter ≥20 cm, and a history of allergic-immunologic disease. Thirteen of the 25 patients (52%) with preoperative VTE had an IVC filter inserted preoperatively. Postoperative screening (interview and D-dimer measurement) revealed VTE in 14/1,232 patients (1.14%). Multivariate analysis indicated that cancer surgery, a history of allergic-immunologic disease, and blood transfusion ≥2,000 ml were independent risk factors for postoperative VTE. Perioperative VTE is often fatal and preventive measures should be taken in the gynecologic field, especially when patients have the risk factors identified in this study. Since VTE is often present before surgery, preoperative screening is important and use of an IVC filter should be considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-9560-8-17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119614090", "source": "openalex"}

LPAAT-β converts lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid, which functions as a cofactor in Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/Erk pathways. We report that elevated expression of LPAAT-β was associated with reduced survival in ovarian cancer and earlier progression of disease in ovarian and endometrial cancer. Inhibition of LPAAT-β using small interfering RNA or selective inhibitors, CT32521 and CT32228, two small-molecule noncompetitive antagonists representing two different classes of chemical structures, induces apoptosis in human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro at pharmacologically tenable nanomolar concentrations. Inhibition of LPAAT-β also enhanced the survival of mice bearing ovarian tumor xenografts. Cytotoxicity was modulated by diacylglycerol effectors including protein kinase C and CalDAG-GEF1. LPAAT-β was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and overexpression was associated with redistribution of protein kinase C-α. These findings identify LPAAT-β as a potential prognostic and therapeutic target in ovarian and endometrial cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-05-0516", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2136090166", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Anonymous interviews with 158 women on Medical Assistance age 18–44 seen at a university ob/gyn clinic. Results: Sixty women (38.0%) used the ob/gyn setting for primary care, 83 (52.5%) use other places and 15 (9.5%) identified no primary care provider. Compared to women using other places for primary care, women who used the ob/gyn setting as their PCP were younger (OR 0.93, p = .04), had less education (OR 3.9, p = .02), and more frequently had small children (OR 2.8, p = .05) and reported illicit drug use (OR 3.1, p = .05). Performance on first contact care, ongoing care, coordination, and family and community issues did not vary by whether the PCP was an ob/gyn versus another provider, though women with an ob/gyn PCP rated their provider significantly higher on cultural competence. Access to advice on general medical prevention topics differed little by type of PCP; however, women who used the ob/gyn clinic as PCP received advice on more reproductive health, behavioral health, and injury prevention topics, with a mean number of preventive topics of 13.0 (SD 3.6) versus 6.3 (SD 4.1) (p >.01). Discussion: Many young women who rely on hospital-based ob/gyn clinics for primary care may benefit from expanded health promotion efforts. The large portion of young, low-income women using ob/gyn settings for primary care may receive primary care of equal or better quality compared to women using other settings. More research is needed to see if these findings are generalizable.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1300/j013v37n01_02", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036201597", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Dosimetric and toxicity information was analyzed for 12 patients with cervical (8), endometrial (2) or vaginal (2) cancer previously treated with external beam pelvic radiotherapy and a CRT boost. Optimized IMRT boost treatment plans were then developed for each of the 12 patients and compared to CRT and 4FB plans. The plans were compared in terms of dose conformality and critical normal tissue avoidance. Results The median planning target volume (PTV) was 151 cm 3 (range 58–512 cm 3 ). The median overlap of the contoured rectum with the PTV was 15 (1–56) %, and 11 (4–35) % for the bladder. Two of the 12 patients, both with large PTVs and large overlap of the contoured rectum and PTV, developed grade 3 rectal bleeding. The dose conformity was significantly improved with IMRT over CRT and 4FB (p ≤ 0.001 for both). IMRT also yielded an overall improvement in the rectal and bladder dose-volume distributions relative to CRT and 4FB. The volume of rectum that received the highest doses (&gt;66% of the prescription) was reduced by 22% (p &lt; 0.001) with IMRT relative to 4FB, and the bladder volume was reduced by 19% (p &lt; 0.001). This was at the expense of an increase in the volume of these organs receiving doses in the lowest range (&lt;33%). Conclusion These results indicate that IMRT can improve target coverage and reduce dose to critical structures in gynecologic patients receiving an external beam radiotherapy boost. This dosimetric advantage will be integrated with other patient and treatment-specific factors, particularly internal tumor movement during fractionated radiotherapy, in the context of a future image-guided radiation therapy study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-717x-1-13", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146760660", "source": "openalex"}

We sought to understand how gynecologic oncologists9 views influence outpatient specialty palliative care referral to help inform strategies for improvement. <h3>Methods/Materials</h3> We conducted a qualitative interview study at 6 National Cancer Institute–designated cancer centers with well-established outpatient palliative care services. Between September 2015 and March 2016, 34 gynecologic oncologists participated in semistructured telephone interviews focused on attitudes, experiences, and preferences related to outpatient specialty palliative care. A multidisciplinary team analyzed transcripts using constant comparative methods to inductively develop a coding framework.

Mean (SD) interview length was 25 (7) minutes. Three main themes emerged regarding how gynecologic oncologists view outpatient specialty palliative care: (1) long-term relationships with patients is a unique and defining aspect of gynecologic oncology that influences referral, (2) gynecologic oncologists value palliative care clinicians9 communication skills and third-party perspective to increase prognostic awareness and help negotiate differences between patient preferences and physician recommendation, and (3) gynecologic oncologists prefer specialty palliative care services embedded within gynecologic oncology clinics. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Gynecologic oncologists value longitudinal relationships with patients and use specialty palliative care to negotiate conflict surrounding prognostic awareness or the treatment plan.

The only available strategy likely to reduce mortality from this cancer is prevention. This review summarizes evidence that implementation of several prevention strategies can substantially reduce mortality from ovarian cancer. Potential strategies recommended by the Society of Gynecologic Society that can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer are discussed. Recommendations are based on analysis of the current literature. • A key aim of preventive strategies is to identify and treat women at hereditary increased risk of ovarian cancer. • There has been increasing evidence in the past decade that most type 2 serous ovarian cancers arise from neoplastic progression of epithelial cells in the fallopian tube. With the current assumption that the fallopian tubes are the potential source of high-grade serous cancer in women with and without known genetic mutations, many gynecologic surgeons believe that risk reduction in both women at high risk or average risk may be achieved by opportunistic salpingectomy. • Salpingectomy should be considered for average-risk women undergoing hysterectomy, elective pelvic surgery, and sterilization techniques at the completion of childbearing. Salpingectomy can also be considered at the completion of childbearing in women at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer who refuse to have salpingo-oophorectomy. • Oral contraceptives reduce the risk of both types 1 and 2 ovarian cancer and are considered safe for carriers of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation. These drugs are also effective for reducing risk in women with an average risk of ovarian cancer. • Another prevention strategy, tubal ligation, has been associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer in both high-risk women as well as the general population. • The most proven method for preventing ovarian cancer in women with a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Following RRSO, a 70% to 85% reduction in ovarian cancer has been reported. • Women at inherited increased risk of ovarian cancer or who have this cancer should be offered genetic counseling to assess their risk. Individualized genetic counseling is followed by elective genetic testing, which should include BRCA1 and BRCA2. Despite clear evidence of benefit from counseling, about 50% of women with ovarian cancer seen at academic centers and 80% in a community setting are not referred for genetic counseling. • The majority of high-grade serous cancers have precursor lesions in the fallopian tube, and salpingectomy is presumed to reduce the incidence of type 2 ovarian cancer. However, there are no data showing a reduction in ovarian cancer risk with opportunistic salpingectomy among either women at inherited risk or those at average risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ogx.0000469976.39471.e2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2597065516", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: A database of appointment dates and tenure of chairs at each of 125 Association of American Medical Colleges–approved United States medical schools was collated using membership listings from the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics and from the Council of University Chairs in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Complete data from 118 departments were confirmed by selective correspondence at individual departments and further review by the investigators. RESULTS: A total of 260 individuals (232 men, 28 women) became new chairs between 1981 and 2005. The annual turnover rate increased gradually from 6.0% to 12.7%. Five-year net retention rates remained steady between 1982 and 1997 but dropped after 1997 (85.6% compared with 63.2%; P=.03). A chair's tenure ranged widely (1 to 23 years; median 8 years), regardless of gender or school type, size, or location. Approximately one half of interim chairs became permanent chairs, usually at their own institution. The number of new women chairs increased from none in 1981 to 17 (15.2% of total chairs) in 2005. CONCLUSION: Academic chair positions in obstetrics and gynecology experienced a doubling in annual turnover rates, while retention rates declined. The proportion of chairs occupied by women increased progressively.

While sarcopenia has been linked with poorer outcomes following a variety of malignancies, its relationship with all gynecological cancer clinical outcomes has, to date, not been evaluated. This review interrogates the concept of sarcopenia as a prognostic tool for oncological outcomes and adverse effects of treatments in all primary gynecological malignancies. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, searching PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL without date or language restriction for studies reporting on sarcopenia and gynecological malignancies. Random effects meta-analysis models were used to determine the effects of sarcopenia on progression-free survival, overall survival, and treatment-related adverse events. Results Data were analyzed from 13 studies, including 2446 patients (range 60–323) with ovarian cancer (n=1381), endometrial cancer (n=354), or cervical cancer (n=481). Sarcopenia was associated with lower progression-free survival (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.76), overall survival (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.64), and no increase in adverse events (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.40). The risk of bias of the studies was mostly rated unclear, and Begg’s and Egger’s test revealed a potential publication bias for progression-free survival and overall survval, although the HRs remained significant when adjusting for it. Conclusion Sarcopenia is associated with worse progression-free survival and overall survival in gynecological oncology malignancies. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in larger and prospective samples using standardized methodology and to examine if an intervention could reverse its effect in gynecological oncology trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001678", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3047480083", "source": "openalex"}

These women frequently suffer symptoms following an iatrogenically induced menopause. Many gynecologists advise these patients against hormonal replacement therapy. This review attempts to provide the clinician with information based on current evidence. Recent findings The most recent two prospective studies did not find an increase in the recurrence rates in endometrial cancer patients who used hormonal replacement therapy. To date, there are few studies on hormonal replacement therapy in patients with ovarian cancer but the available data suggest that there is no detriment to overall or disease-free survival. There are no data showing an association between poorer outcome and hormonal replacement therapy use in patients with cervical or vulvar cancers. Summary There is no evidence showing hormones negatively influence survival after treatment for epithelial ovarian, squamous cervical or vulvar cancer. Their use can be considered in symptomatic patients with endometrial cancer, after weighing the benefits against the risk of recurrence. Gynecologic cancer survivors suffering from menopausal symptoms should be supported by advice about the alternatives to hormonal replacement therapy and by giving them nonbiased information on the present knowledge on the effects of hormonal use in women with a previous cancer. It is reasonable to prescribe hormonal replacement therapy to symptomatic, well informed patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0b013e32832efc5b", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990380061", "source": "openalex"}

Also, some circRNAs play an essential part in the progression of human cancers. CircRNA is different from traditional linear RNA. CircRNA has a closed circular structure, so it is resistant to exonuclease-mediated degradation and is more stable than linear RNA. Numerous studies have found that many circRNAs can act as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge, interact with RNA-binding proteins, regulate gene transcription, affect alternative splicing and be translated into proteins. Recently, some studies have also indicated that circRNA participates in the progression of gynecological cancers. In addition, circRNA can act as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of gynecological tumors. Additionally, they can also play a key role in the prognosis of gynecological tumors. Furthermore, to our delight, circRNA may be a potential therapeutic target in gynecological cancers and widely used in clinical practice. This article reviews the functions and related molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in gynecological tumors, and discusses their potential as biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic and therapeutic targets for gynecological cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.709512", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3186313196", "source": "openalex"}

Methods This was a retrospective study involving data from 11 ultrasound centers. From the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) database, 105 patients who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced ultrasound examiner between 1999 and 2016 were identified with a histologically confirmed pure clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. An additional 47 patients diagnosed with pure clear cell carcinoma between 1999 and 2016 and with available complete preoperative ultrasound reports were identified retrospectively from the databases of the departments of gynecological oncology in the participating centers. The ultrasound images of all tumors were described using IOTA terminology. Clinical and ultrasound characteristics were analyzed for the whole group, and separately, for patients with and those without histologically confirmed endometriosis, and for patients with evidence of tumor developing from endometriosis. Results Median age of the 152 patients was 53.5 (range, 28–92) years and 92/152 (60.5%) tumors were FIGO Stage I. Most tumors (128/152, 84.2%) were unilateral. On ultrasound examination, all tumors contained solid components and 36/152 (23.7%) were completely solid masses. The median largest diameter of the lesion was 117 (range, 25–310) mm. Papillary projections were present in 58/152 (38.2%) masses and, in most of these (51/56, 91.1%), vascularized papillary projections were seen. Information regarding the presence, site and type of pelvic endometriosis at histology was available for 130/152 patients. Endometriosis was noted in 54 (41.5%) of these. In 24/130 (18.6%) patients, the tumor was judged to have developed from endometriosis. Patients with, compared to those without, evidence of tumor developing from endometriosis were younger (median 47.5 vs 55.0 years, respectively), and ground‐glass echogenicity of cyst fluid was more common in pure clear cell cancers developing from endometriosis (10/20 vs 13/79 (50.0% vs 16.5%), respectively). Conclusions Ovarian pure clear cell carcinoma is usually diagnosed at an early stage and typically appears as a large unilateral mass with solid components. Patients with clear cell carcinoma developing from endometriosis are younger than other patients with clear cell carcinoma, and clear cell cancers developing from endometriosis more often manifest ground‐glass echogenicity of cyst fluid.

Because Dkk‐3 encodes a secreted protein, we investigated whether the Dkk‐3 protein is secreted into the sera of patients with gynecological cancer. Material &amp; Methods: The levels of Dkk‐3 protein were assessed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay in the sera of 104 patients with gynecological cancer: 36 with ovarian, 40 with cervical and 28 with endometrial cancers. Results: The serum levels of Dkk‐3 protein in patients with ovarian cancer [25.54 (7.99) pg/mL] was lower than in normal individuals [42.08 (14.89) pg/mL] ( P = 0.000). But serum levels of Dkk‐3 protein in patients with cervical [166.39 (300.68) pg/mL] ( P = 0.013) and endometrial cancers [73.64 (23.36) pg/mL] ( P = 0.000) were higher than in normal individuals. The serum levels of Dkk‐3 protein were associated with clinical stage in patients with cervical and endometrial cancers. In patients with ovarian cancer, the serum levels of Dkk‐3 protein were associated with lymphatic metastasis. In patients with cervical cancer, the serum levels of Dkk‐3 protein were associated with tumor diameters. Conclusion: Dkk‐3 protein detection using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay as molecular markers can contribute to detection and diagnosis of gynecological cancer, especially for ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2010.01234.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1938812873", "source": "openalex"}

The literature shows that many physicians, especially surgical specialists, think that anatomical knowledge of medical students is inadequate and nesting of anatomical sciences later in the clinical curriculum may be necessary. Quantitative data concerning this perception of an anatomical knowledge deficit are lacking, as are specifics as to what content should be reinforced. This study identifies baseline areas of strength and weakness in the surgical anatomy knowledge of medical students entering surgical rotations. Third‐year medical students completed a 20–25‐question test at the beginning of the General Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynecology rotations. Knowledge of inguinal anatomy (45.3%), orientation in abdominal cavity (38.8%), colon (27.7%), and esophageal varices (12.8%) was poor. The numbers in parentheses are the percentage of questions answered correctly per topic. In comparing those scores to matched test items from this cohort as first‐year students in the anatomy course, the drop in retention overall was very significant ( P = 0.009) from 86.9 to 51.5%. Students also scored lower in questions relating to pelvic organs (46.7%), urogenital development (54.0%), pulmonary development (17.8%), and pregnancy (17.8%). These data showed that indeed, knowledge of surgical anatomy is poor for medical students entering surgical clerkships. These data collected will be utilized to create interactive learning modules, aimed at improving clinically relevant anatomical knowledge retention. These modules, which will be available to students during their inpatient surgical rotations, connect basic anatomy principles to clinical cases, with the ultimate goal of closing the anatomical knowledge gap.

The availability of unlimited quantities of several pure monoclonal antibodies directed against novel epitopes on tumor‐associated antigens has permitted development of highly sensitive assays for serum markers. Traditional assays for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), NB/70K and TA‐4 have been improved. CA 125 has provided a useful first‐generation marker for monitoring ovarian cancer and triaging patients with pelvic masses, despite limitations in sensitivity and specificity. In the next decade, the challenge is to identify new markers that will complement CA 125 in monitoring ovarian cancer and facilitate screening for occult early‐stage disease. Strategies involving multiple markers and modalities may be required. Some markers may emerge through a more fundamental knowledge of the biology of gynecologic neoplasms, including the expression of growth factors and their receptors. Finally, the application of monoclonal antibodies to immunohistochemistry and radionuclide imaging also may provide new areas of diagnostic application for monoclonal antibodies in gynecologic oncology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ssu.2980060604", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129568978", "source": "openalex"}

QOL includes the measurement of patient-reported outcomes, mostly described as the physical, social, emotional and functional wellbeing of the patient. These realms of wellbeing are reported by the patient themself and are thought to be a subjective measurement of response to treatment and/or treatment outcomes. Therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapy and/or radiation can thus be monitored from a patient perspective. In addition, while researchers and oncologists may recognize the futility of advanced and/or recurrent cancer therapy in the setting of reduced QOL, patients may have difficulty with discontinuing therapy. QOL research adds to the literature by introducing a patient perspective into the decision to treat aggressively. Specifically, in gynecologic cancers, there is a wide range of outcomes and patient characteristics to be considered. All three cancer settings – endometrial, cervical and ovarian – are remarkable in the QOL literature as this is a relatively new field with room to create interventions targeted towards improving QOL in often challenging clinical and life situations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2217/fon.10.96", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145624567", "source": "openalex"}

In the present study, to further understand the role of HPV in malignant transformation of these cancers, the infection rates and viral loads of HPV 16 and 18 in gynecological cancers were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). HPV 16 DNA was detected in 61.0% (58/95), 15.2% (7/46) and 32.1% (18/56) of cases of cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers, respectively. On the other hand, HPV 18 DNA was detected in 23.2% (22/95) of cervical cancers, 1.8% (1/56) of ovarian cancers, and in no cases of endometrial cancer. Thus, HPV 16 is much more prevalent than HPV 18 in malignancies of the female genital tract. We also found that both HPV 16 and 18 were significantly (p < 0.05) less frequently present in endometrial and ovarian cancers than in cervical cancer. The median copy numbers of HPV 16 DNA in endometrial and ovarian cancers were 3,500 and 7,590 copies/microg DNA, respectively. These amounts were also significantly (p < 0.05) lower than HPV 16 DNA in cervical cancer (492,800 copies/microg DNA). Thus, HPV 16 could be detected in all three types of gynecological cancer, whilst HPV 18 is extremely rare in endometrial and ovarian cancers. The lower HPV 16 infection rates and lower copy numbers when compared with cervical cancer tend to suggest that HPV plays a less essential role in the development of endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000076463", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1988875494", "source": "openalex"}

Although individual studies vary, gynecological RAS is often associated with longer operating room time but similar clinical outcomes, decreased blood loss, and shorter hospital stay. RAS procedures on women have, however, their own limitations: the patented equipment is very large, bulky, and expensive, the staff must be trained specifically on draping and docking the instruments, the lack of surgical haptic feedback, a limited vaginal access, a limited specific instrumentation, and the need for larger port incisions requiring fascial closure.

Responses to the ligands of the ECS are mediated by numerous receptors like the classical cannabinoid receptors (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as ECS-related receptors, e.g., G protein-coupled receptors 18 and 55 (GPR18 and GPR55), transient receptor potential ion channels, and nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The ECS regulates almost all levels of female reproduction, starting with oocyte production through to parturition. Dysregulation of the ECS is associated with the development of gynecological disorders from fertility disorders to cancer. Cannabinoids that act at the ECS as specific agonists or antagonists may potentially influence dysregulation and, therefore, represent new therapeutic options for the therapy of gynecological disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000499164", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2945524214", "source": "openalex"}

All these patients had a number of target lesions less than 5, with largest diameter less than 6 cm. The treatment was delivered with a TrueBeam LINAC and RapidArc technique, using 10 or 6 MV FFF beams. A total of 70 lesions were treated, and lymph nodes represented the most common site of metastases, followed by lung, liver, and soft tissues. Twenty lesions were treated with one single fraction of 24 Gy and 5 lesions received 27 Gy delivered in 3 fractions, depending on the ability to fulfill adequate target coverage and safe dose/volume constraints for the organ at risk with either regimen.Positron emission tomography scan 3 months after SBRT showed a complete response (CR) in 45 lesions (64.3%), a partial response in 14 (20.0%), a stable disease in 5 (7.1%), and a progressive disease in 6 (8.6%). No lesions in CR after SBRT subsequently progressed. Overall acute toxicity occurred in 13 (28.9%) patients. The most common grade 1 to 2 adverse event was pain (n = 9, 20.0%), followed by nausea and vomiting (n = 5, 11.1%). No grade 3 to 4 acute toxicities occurred, and no late toxicities were observed. Patients who failed to achieve a CR had a 2.37-fold higher risk of progression and a 3.60-fold higher risk of death compared with complete responders (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively).Stereotactic body radiotherapy offers an effective and safe approach for selected cases of oligometastatic gynecological cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000885", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2578269715", "source": "openalex"}

Aprepitant is the first neurokinin-1(NK1) receptor antagonism available for use as an antiemetic. We investigated whether aprepitant can effectively decrease PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. Methods: Sixty four patients receiving general anesthesia for laparoscopic gynecological surgery were randomly assigned to either receive a preoperative dose of 80 mg aprepitant or no drug. Efficacy was assessed in 2 and 24 hours after surgery. Primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed for the time intervals 0-2 hours (acute phase) and 2-24 hours (delayed phase). Vomiting, nausea, use of rescue anti-emetic, and visual analog scale (VAS) were assessed. Nausea was assessed on a 4-point scale, from 0 to 3. Results: Sixty patients participated in the study. At acute phase, PONV was present in both control and NK1 group and were 63% and 43% respectively. The severity of nausea was much less in the NK1 group. PONV prevalence at delayed phase was present in control but absent in NK1 group 27% vs. 0%, respectively. The amount of pain medication used by patients in the NK1 group was significantly less for diclofenac and pentazocine suggesting increase pain tolerance. Conclusions: Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonism effectively lowered PONV increased pain tolerance, and expedited recovery in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. J. Med.

Concern has been expressed about possible carcinogenicity, and specifically the risk of uterine cancer. Methods: From 2001 through 2006, we conducted a population-based, case–control study of gynecologic cancers in 12 provinces in northern Vietnam, where relatively large numbers of women had received quinacrine. Cases of incident cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancer were identified at provincial hospitals or at referral hospitals in Hanoi. For each case, 3 age- and residence-matched controls were randomly selected from the population registries of the case's home community. Results: The prevalence of quinacrine exposure was 1.2% among cases and 1.1% among controls. For cervical cancer, analysis of 606 cases (9 exposed) and their 1774 matched controls (18 exposed) produced an odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval = 0.59–3.48) (adjusted for several covariates including human papillomavirus risk score). For ovarian cancer, based on 262 cases (3 exposed) and 755 controls (8 exposed) and adjusted for age and number of years of ovulation, the odds ratio was 1.26 (0.21–5.45). For uterine cancer, none of the cases—including 23 cases of leiomyosarcoma—was exposed to quinacrine. The 95% confidence interval, based on 161 cases (none exposed) and 470 controls (7 exposed) and adjusted only for age, was 0–1.85.

Many studies have reported that the occurrence, development, and survival rates of tumors are significantly associated with STs' abnormal changes. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality rates of gynecological malignant tumors have been continuously rising, which has caused great harm to women's reproduction and health. Abnormal changes of STs in gynecological malignant tumor cell membranes cause the changes of expression of sialic acids, promoting cell migration and, eventually, leading to tumor metastasis. In this review, we outlined the biological characteristics of STs and summarized the expression profiles of 20 STs in different tumors via transcriptome data from Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. Moreover, STs' functions in four common gynecological tumors (ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and gestational trophoblast tumor) were reviewed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118670", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3096555330", "source": "openalex"}

ASM is a rare disorder characterized by uni‐ or multilocular extensions of the meninges from the sacral spinal canal to the retroperitoneal presacral space. Common symptoms include lower back and pelvic pain, constipation, difficulties in defecation, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, and urinary incontinence, retention or urgency. Perineal and lower‐extremity paresthesias may present when nerve roots are affected. Despite its more posterior location, ASM can mimic an ovarian cyst or other adnexal cystic mass, and in the obstetric patient can present a mechanical obstacle to delivery with a risk of rupture and infection during labor and delivery. Although it is a rare condition, we feel that awareness of the etiology, presentation and imaging characteristics of ASM is of importance and have therefore carried out a review of the literature, taking into account case findings and the obstetric and gynecological management of this disorder.

Epigenetics is one of important gene expression mechanisms which contribute to cancer development and progression by regulating cancer-related genes. Since the discovery of differential gene expression patterns in cancer cells compared with normal cells, extensive efforts have been made to explore the origins of abnormal gene expression in cancer. Epigenetics, the study inheritable changes in gene expression that do not alter DNA sequence, is a key area of this research. DNA methylation and histone modification are well-known epigenetic mechanisms, microRNAs and alternative splicing have recently been identified as important regulators of epigenetic changes. These epigenetic mechanisms not only affect specific target gene expression but also regulate the functioning of other epigenetic mechanisms. Moreover, these diverse epigenetic regulations occur simultaneously. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is extraordinarily complicated and requires that all epigenetic mechanisms be studied at once to determine the exact gene regulation mechanisms. Traditionally, the contribution of epigenetics to cancer is thought to be mediated through the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) expression. But recently it is arising that some oncogenes or cancer-promoting genes (CPGs) are overexpressed in diverse type of cancers through epigenetic derepression mechanism, such as DNA demethylation, histone demethylation. Epigenetic derepression arises from diverse epigenetic changes, and all of these mechanisms are actively interact each other to increase oncogenes or CPGs expression in cancer cell. Oncogenes or CPGs overexpressed through epigenetic derepression can initiate cancer development, and the accumulation of these abnormal epigenetic changes makes cancer more aggressive and resistant to treatment.

Results Factors associated with being sufficiently active (≥150 min/wk physical activity) were being in the follow-up phase of the cancer trajectory (odds ratio [OR], 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 33.4 compared with other phases) and prediagnosis physical activity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 18.5 for the highest vs lowest tertile). The most common barriers were “too tired” and “not well enough,” and both were associated with lower physical activity ( r s , −0.20 and −0.22, respectively). The odds of having disease-specific barriers was higher for women with ovarian cancer (OR, 4.6; P = 0.04) and women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy (OR, 8.3; P = 0.008). “Lack of interest” ( r s , −0.26) and “never been active” ( r s, −0.23) were also inversely correlated with physical activity, although less common. Forty-three percent of women indicated that they were extremely or very interested to have a one-to-one session with an exercise physiologist. Participants’ preferred time of starting a physical activity program was 3 to 6 months after treatment (26%) or during treatment (23%). Walking was the preferred type of physical activity. Conclusions Strategies to increase physical activity among women with gynecological cancer should include a focus on reducing disease-specific barriers and target women who have done little physical activity in the past or who are in the treatment phases of care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000790", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2518371963", "source": "openalex"}

Although there are numerous reports on the anti cancer properties of other Phyllanthus species, published information on the cytotoxicity of P. watsonii are very limited. The present study was carried out with bioassay-guided fractionation approach to evaluate the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction capability of the P. watsonii extracts and fractions on human gynecologic (SKOV-3 and Ca Ski) and colon (HT-29) cancer cells. P. watsonii extracts exhibited strong cytotoxicity on all the cancer cells studied with IC50 values of ≤ 20.0 µg/mL. Hexane extract of P. watsonii was further subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and yielded 10 fractions (PW-1→PW-10). PW-4→PW-8 portrayed stronger cytotoxic activity and was further subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and resulted with 8 sub-fractions (PPWH-1→PPWH-8). PPWH-7 possessed greatest cytotoxicity (IC50 values ranged from 0.66 – 0.83 µg/mL) and was selective on the cancer cells studied. LC-MS/MS analysis of PPWH-7 revealed the presence of ellagic acid, geranic acid, glochidone, betulin, phyllanthin and sterol glucoside. Marked morphological changes, ladder-like appearance of DNA and increment in caspase-3 activity indicating apoptosis were clearly observed in both human gynecologic and colon cancer cells treated with P. watsonii especially with PPWH-7. The study also indicated that P. watsonii extracts arrested cell cycle at different growth phases in SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells. Cytotoxic and apoptotic potential of the endemic P. watsonii was investigated for the first time by bioassay-guided approach. These results demonstrated that P. watsonii selectively inhibits the growth of SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells through apoptosis induction and cell cycle modulation. Hence, P. watsonii has the potential to be further exploited for the discovery and development of new anti cancer drugs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034793", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064351206", "source": "openalex"}

Hysterectomy is one factor that has been suggested to be a risk factor for developing stress incontinence. In Sweden, with a population of 8.86 million, a national register was set up in 1997 in order to have data for assessing the quality of gynecological surgery for benign disorders. Methods. Data in the Swedish national register for gynecological surgery during the period 1997–2002 were investigated. Surgical methods compared during this time period were: total hysterectomy (abdominal/laparoscopic, n =198/116), subtotal hysterectomy (abdominal/laparoscopic, n =163/86), and total hysterectomy (vaginal/laparoscopic assisted vaginal, n =265/7). Patients who underwent endometrial destruction (endometrial ablation, endometrial balloon treatment, n =187) were used as a control group. Only patients with no preoperative complaints were included. Outcome measures were answers to subjective questions asked pre‐ and postoperatively regarding urinary problems and incontinence. Results. De novo symptoms of stress incontinence, urgency and urgency incontinence, and/or mixed incontinence were noted in all groups. No differences were found among the groups. Conclusion. Factors other than hysterectomy should be discussed causing stress incontinence in women.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00016340600555942", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132653997", "source": "openalex"}

Material and Methods: Retrospective study of 14 patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 with early‐drainage pyometra and six patients with perforated pyometra were included. In addition, a review of the literature yielded another 30 perforated pyometra cases for comparison. Results: Of 20 women with pyometra, the main presented symptoms at admission were abdominal pain (80%), fever (45%) and vaginal discharge (25%). The majority of organisms isolated were Bacteroides fragilis (seven cases), Streptococcus species (six cases) and Escherichia coli (five cases). Of the 36 cases with spontaneous uterine perforation to date, 35 cases (97%) had abdominal pain, 11 cases (31%) had fever, and 10 cases (27%) had vomiting. Hypoalbuminemia was found in seven patients (five cases in the perforation group and two cases in the drainage group). Conclusion: Early diagnosis of pyometra before perforation can avoid surgical exploration and decrease morbidity and mortality. Perforated pyometra should be considered as a differential diagnosis in women with pneumoperitoneum and fever.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series were included if they investigated the effects of conservative treatments, including pelvic floor muscle training or dilator training, on bladder, bowel, or sexual function in patients who had received treatment for gynecological cancer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies.Five RCTs and 2 retrospective cohort studies were included (n = 886). The results provided moderate-level evidence that pelvic floor muscle training with counseling and yoga or core exercises were beneficial for sexual function (standardized mean difference = -0.96, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.70, I2 = 0%) and health-related quality of life (standardized mean difference = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.88, I2 = 0%) in survivors of cervical cancer and very low-level evidence that dilator therapy reduced vaginal complications in survivors of cervical and uterine cancer (odds ratio = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.80, I2 = 54%). There were insufficient data for meta-analysis of bladder or bowel function.Conservative pelvic floor muscle interventions may be beneficial for improving sexual function and health-related quality of life in survivors of gynecological cancer.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the frequency and risk factors of pretreatment VTE in gynecological cancer patients. Methods This study investigated 2086 patients with gynecological cancer (cervix, n = 754; endometrium, n = 862; ovary, n = 470) who underwent initial treatment between 2004 and 2017. Pretreatment VTE screening was performed with D‐dimer (DD) levels in these patients. Based on this, the associated risk factors were retrospectively analyzed. Results Pretreatment VTE was discovered in 7.3% of patients with cervical cancer, 11.5% of those with endometrial cancer and 27.0% of those with ovarian cancer. Significant independent risk factors were: age greater than or equal to 60 years and tumor long diameter greater than or equal to 40 mm for cervical cancer; age greater than or equal to 60 years, stage III/IV advanced disease, clear cell carcinoma and tumor long diameter greater than or equal to 60 mm for endometrial cancer; and age greater than or equal to 60 years, clear cell carcinoma and massive ascites for ovarian cancer.

Fifty-two patients were randomized to one of two groups. Epidural anesthesia was performed with 25 mL 2% plain lidocaine. At the end of the surgical procedure, a controlled delivery transdermal patch containing either ketamine (25 mg/24 h) (Ketamine group) or placebo (Placebo group) was applied. Pain and adverse effects were assessed hourly postoperatively for 24 h. IM dipyrone was available at patient request. The two groups were demographically similar. The time to first rescue analgesic was longer in the Ketamine group (230 ± 112 min) compared with the Placebo group (94 ± 54 min); (P < 0.00001). There were more dipyrone dose injections in 24 h in the Placebo group compared with the Ketamine group (P < 0.0001). The incidence of adverse effects was similar between groups.

In gynecological malignancies FDG PET/CT plays an important role, not only in the assessment of disease in the pre-and post-therapy setting, but also in radiation therapy (RT) planning by defining the metabolically active gross tumor volume (GTV. The glucose analogue radiotracer, FDG, is by far the most utilized radiotracer in PET/CT and is typically seen with high uptake in malignant cells. The radiotracer FDG has a high sensitivity but low specificity for malignancy, as benign processes with an inflammatory response for example infection, are also FDG-avid. In the evaluation of the female pelvic region an awareness of potential confounding factors in the interpretation of FDG is essential as variations of FDG uptake occur in accordance with the menstrual cycle and the menopausal state. Incidental imaging findings in the female genital can pose differential diagnostic challenges as false-positive and false-negative findings in benign and malignant processes are not uncommon. Gynecological malignancies continue to pose major public health problems with cervical cancer as the fourth most common cancer in women ranking after breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer.

The aim of this study was to evaluate factors predicting overall survival especially under consideration of department volume. Methods: All Austrian gynecological departments were invited to participate in the quality assurance program. A questionnaire was sent out that included birth date, histology, date of diagnosis, stage, and basic information on primary treatment. Description of comorbidity was not requested. Patient life status was assessed in a passive way. We did record linkage between each patient's name and birth date and the official mortality data set collected by Statistics Austria. No data were available on progression-free survival. Patients treated between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2004 were included in the analysis. Mortality dates were available to December 31, 2006. Data were analyzed by means of classical statistical methods. Cut-off point for departments was 24 patients per year. Results: A total of 1948 patients were evaluable. Approximately 75% of them were treated at institutions with fewer than 24 new patients per year. Patient characteristics were grossly similar for both department types. Multivariate analysis confirmed established prognostic factors such as International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage, lymphadenectomy, age, grading, and residual disease.

It is a result of both the increasing incidence of gynecologic cancer in young patients and the increasing age at first pregnancy. Today, in a young patient with a gynecologic cancer, preservation of fertility is possible and depends primarily on the extent and type of cancer. The clinical importance of an appropriate management of young patients with gynecologic cancer has lead the ESGO Task Force for Fertility Preservation in Gynecologic Cancer to conduct a survey with the aim of exploring the numbers and eligibility of gynecologic cancer patients for fertility-sparing treatment in selected gynecologic oncology centers across Europe. A questionnaire designed to allow adequate insight into the number of patient eligible for fertility-sparing treatment and the resulting treatment was sent to 20 ESGO-accredited centers. The data were collected retrospectively for the year 2007. The reply was received from 14 gynecologic oncology centers, and those surveys were included for analysis. The small numbers of patients eligible for conservative management (14-15 per year/median number in ESGO-accredited centers) and even the smaller number of those who actually receive fertility-sparing treatment (<10) raise the question of quality of care for these patients. These low numbers support the concept of centralization for fertility-sparing management to improve the quality of patients care. Since carrying out the survey on fertility-sparing management in ESGO-accredited gynecologic oncology centers in Europe, the ESGO Task Force for Fertility Preservation in Gynecologic Cancer has proposed a protocol for referrals to centralized units that have developed specific expertise. Optimal management for young patients with gynecologic cancer should include a clear decision-making process, an adequate counseling about the future oncological and obstetrical risks, the appropriate management, and a careful follow-up within a multidisciplinary setting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/igc.0b013e3181f936ff", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2409171420", "source": "openalex"}

This study evaluates how training contributes to this paradox with a national survey of sixty dental school deans and 240 obstetrics and gynecology residency program directors. Response rates were 53 percent and 40 percent for deans and program directors, respectively. According to the respondents, 94 percent of responding dental schools provided POH education, only 39 percent of responding residencies taught POH, and 65 percent of responding deans and 45 percent of responding program directors were aware of current POH guidelines. The residencies exposing trainees to guidelines were three times more likely to have POH training. Barriers to POH education were reported to include too few pregnant patients in clinical settings (for responding dental schools) and lack of faculty expertise (for responding residencies). The majority of responding deans and program directors agreed they would add more POH education if the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a policy statement or practice bulletin. The majority of responding dental deans reported teaching POH in their schools, but clinical exposure was limited; less than half of responding residencies included POH training. Future efforts should include distribution of POH guidelines/consensus statements to educators and learners, increasing exposure of dental students to pregnant patients, and developing faculty expertise in residencies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/j.0022-0337.2013.77.11.tb05622.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162560831", "source": "openalex"}

Experimental data suggest that the production of endogenous nitric oxide is necessary for tonic cholinergic inhibition of spinal pain transmission. The purpose of this study was to determine whether association of transdermal nitroglycerine would enhance analgesia from a low dose of intrathecal neostigmine in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery during spinal anesthesia. Methods Forty-eight patients were randomized to one of four groups. Patients were premedicated with use of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg intravenous midazolam and received 15 mg bupivacaine plus 1 ml test drug intrathecally (saline or neostigmine, 5 microgram). Twenty to 30 min after the spinal puncture, a transdermal patch of either 5 mg nitroglycerin or placebo was applied. The control (Con) group received spinal saline and transdermal placebo. The neostigmine group received spinal neostigmine and transdermal placebo. The nitroglycerin group received spinal saline and a transdermal nitroglycerine patch. Finally, the neostigmine-nitroglycerin group received spinal neostigmine and transdermal nitroglycerine. Pain and adverse effects were evaluated using a 10-cm visual analog scale. Results Patients in the groups were similar regarding age, weight, height, and American Society of Anesthesiologists status. Sensory level to pin prick at 10 min, surgical duration, anesthetic duration, and visual analog scale score for pain at the time of administration of first rescue medication were statistically the same for all groups. The time to administration of first rescue analgesic (min) was longer in the neostigmine-nitroglycerin group (550 min; range, 458-1,440 min; median, 25-75th percentile) compared with the other groups (P &amp;lt; 0.001). The neostigmine-nitroglycerin group required fewer rescue analgesics in 24 h than did the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.0005), whereas the neostigmine group required less analgesics compared with the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.02). The incidence of perioperative adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, headache, back pain) was similar among groups (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion Although neither intrathecal 5 microgram neostigmine alone nor transdermal nitroglycerine alone (5 mg/day) delayed the time to administration of first rescue analgesics, the combination of both provided an average of 14 h of effective postoperative analgesia after vaginoplasty, suggesting that transdermal nitroglycerin and the central cholinergic agent neostigmine may enhance each other's antinociceptive effects at the dose studied.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200010000-00011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995078275", "source": "openalex"}

The promise of this technique is becoming increasingly evident, based upon several studies conducted in these malignancies. 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET appears to have a potential role in assessing response to treatment and forecasting prognosis. For cervical carcinoma, the modality has proven useful in both the staging of untreated advanced cervical cancer and restaging of the disease. Its role in prognostication of the disease and in detecting lesions in the setting of post-treatment unexplained tumor-marker elevation appears promising. PET is of great benefit as a diagnostic tool in ovarian carcinoma when there is an increase in serum CA-125 and CT/MRI or conventional imaging are inconclusive or negative. With regard to its role in endometrial carcinoma, its benefit is particularly emphasized in the setting of post-therapy surveillance of the disease, although, in a limited series, it also appears to give additional information in the pretreatment states. PET may be of value in detecting the extra-uterine lesions that are not visualized with CT/MRI. Data on the role of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET imaging in the management of vulvar and vaginal cancer are relatively sparse at this time but the modality appears to be of value in staging disease and is more effective than conventional diagnostic modalities with respect to detecting nodal metastasis in both malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1586/14737140.9.1.75", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156358025", "source": "openalex"}

Define what is meant by “osteopenia” and “osteoporosis” and describe their relevance to fracture risk. Explain the importance of preventing and managing bone mineral loss and its complications in gynecological cancer survivors. Background. An association between treatment for gynecological cancers and risk of osteoporosis has never been formally evaluated. Women treated for these cancers are now living longer than ever before, and prevention of treatment-induced morbidities is important. We aimed to distinguish, in gynecological cancer survivors, whether cancer therapy has additional detrimental effects on bone health above those attributable to hormone withdrawal. Methods. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan results from 105 women; 64 had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies, and 41 age-matched women had undergone BSO for benign etiologies. All were premenopausal prior to surgery. Results. The median age at DEXA scan for the cancer group was 42 years, and 66% had received hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) following their cancer treatment. For the benign group, the median age was 40 years, and 87% had received HRT. Thirty-nine percent of cancer survivors had abnormal DEXA scan results compared to 15% of the control group, with the majority demonstrating osteopenia. The mean lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral densities (BMDs) were significantly lower in cancer patients. A history of gynecological cancer treatment was associated with significantly lower BMD in a multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions. Women treated for gynecological malignancies with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy have significantly lower BMDs than age-matched women who have undergone oophorectomy for noncancer indications. Prospective evaluation of BMD in gynecological cancer patients is recommended to facilitate interventions that will reduce the risk of subsequent fragility fractures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0416", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112454442", "source": "openalex"}

Students were also asked to enumerate procedures they had performed (e.g., deliveries and speculum examinations) and to rate their ability to counsel women on several clinical problems. To further investigate the perceptions of gender discrimination, a focus group of 12 fourth-year students was held.A total of 263 questionnaires (95%) were returned. Of the respondents, 78% of the men felt their gender adversely affected their experience, and 67% of women felt gender had a positive affect. All but five of the remaining students were in the neutral group. Those students who reported a positive gender effect performed significantly more speculum examinations (15.5 versus 12.3), labor coaching (8.7 versus 6.2), and independent deliveries (3.4 versus 2.7) than did the negative gender-effect group. The positive gender-effect group felt more confident of counseling skills. The neutral group did not differ from the negative group. The overall numerical differences among groups were small, and all groups, on average, performed adequate numbers of skills to meet clerkship objectives.There is a strong perception among medical students that gender influences experience on their obstetrics and gynecology clerkship, but the differences are actually small. Possible reasons for such strong feelings are addressed and related to the history of sexism in reproductive health care and to the ethics of patients' preferences.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-200404000-00008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2065045781", "source": "openalex"}

The two groups were comparable in terms of most risk factors, including age, stage, height, weight, body surface area, estimated blood loss, total anesthesia time, and nodal disease. Six of 94 patients (6.4%) in the SCDs group suffered from venous thromboembolism, while four of 74 patients (5.4%) who received both SCDs and low-dose UH had a thromboembolic event (chi2 P = 0.79).

However, their ability to accurately reflect the molecular mechanisms of tumors occurring in vivo is limited. Recent development of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models facilitate the possibility to better recapitulate several of the biological and molecular characteristics of tumors in vivo , such as cancer cells heterogeneity, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, development of a hypoxic microenvironment, signaling pathway activities depending on contacts with extracellular matrix, differential growth kinetics, more accurate drugs response, and specific gene expression and epigenetic patterns. In this review, we discuss the utilization of different types of 3D culture models including spheroids, organotypic models and patient-derived organoids in gynecologic cancers research, as well as its potential applications in oncological research mainly for screening drugs with major physiological and clinical relevance. Moreover, microRNAs regulation of cancer hallmarks in 3D cell cultures from different types of cancers is discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.826113", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4281551939", "source": "openalex"}

To obtain a better estimate of the individual risk of postoperative morbidity among HIV-infected women, and to determine which procedures pose the greatest risk, we performed a retrospective case-control study in which we assessed the outcomes after 235 obstetric and gynecologic surgical procedures. For purposes of comparison, an HIV-negative control patient was matched for each of the 235 surgical procedures performed, on the basis of the type of procedure and patient age. We found a significantly greater number of postoperative complications among the HIV-positive women. Higher complication rates occurred after abdominal surgery (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; P=.001) and curettage (OR, 7.7; P=.06). Among HIV-infected women, the risk of complications was associated with immune status.

Summarizing the results of very recent studies, we discuss the clinical relevance of vascularization of breast and gynecological tumors. Recent findings The prognostic values of directly assessed vascularity (microvessel density) and angiogenic factors have been confirmed for these malignancies, despite few contradictory results that may be due to methodological inaccuracy. In addition, many studies point to a role of angiogenesis as a predictor of response to both antiangiogenic and conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. For a conclusive evaluation, however, further studies covering all clinically relevant subgroups of patients are needed. Novel therapeutic approaches with inhibitors of angiogenesis are promising, although the adaptation of most experimentally proven approaches to clinical practice appears to be a laborious process. Furthermore, for an appropriate clinical evaluation of these drugs, newly defined endpoints of treatment and new monitoring systems reflecting their mode of action and the anticipated biological effects are required. Summary The prognostic and predictive value of angiogenic factors and microvessel density has been confirmed.

This is most evident in gender-based care such as gynecological care. Transgender men may continue to require gynecological and reproductive health care despite having a masculine identity and appearance. It is crucial that transgender men have access to gynecological and reproductive health care that is culturally and clinically competent. This review aimed to identify and synthesize the available qualitative data about their experiences in seeking gynecological care.This review considered all studies that included natal females who identified as transgender men, gender non-binary, gender expressive, or gender queer. It included studies that explored the experiences of transgender men seeking gynecological care, obstetrical care, fertility care, or reproductive care in all care environments. As patient experience was the primary focus of the review, only qualitative studies where the data were analyzed into findings and where participant voice was prominent were included.The databases searched included CINAHL Complete (EBSCO), PubMed, PsycINFO (EBSCO), PsycArticles (EBSCO), ScienceDirect All Subscribed Content (Elsevier), and Web of Science. Sources of unpublished studies and gray literature searched included Google Scholar, MedNar, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Databases were searched between November 2018 and January 2019. Searches were limited to studies published in English after 1979.Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a mix of studies that included only transgender men, as well as studies that included other types of participants. Appraisal of quality was undertaken by two independent reviewers and revealed common concerns found in qualitative reporting. These concerns included the researchers not acknowledging the impact they have on the data and vice versa, as well as not clearly stating the paradigm and methodological underpinnings of the research. All studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review regardless of quality appraisal. The 26 included studies comprised 874 participants. They yielded 86 findings and accompanying illustrations. These were categorized into 14 categories and further synthesized into five findings: i) negotiating the binary system, ii) navigating the cis-normative world, iii) healthcare access adaptive behaviors, iv) verbal and nonverbal discrimination, and v) provider knowledge and trustworthiness.The findings of this review revealed that transgender men face specific challenges in accessing gynecological and reproductive care. The strictly binary system requires patients to be either male or female, and does not allow for any variation in gender. Gynecological and reproductive spaces and resources are geared exclusively toward heterosexual female clients. Transgender men face discrimination that requires they develop adaptive behaviors. While some of these barriers will not be easily overcome, transgender men feel more comfortable and empowered to seek care when their providers are trusted and knowledgeable about their individualized needs. Recommendations put forth as a result of this review cover policy change, changes to education for staff and providers, changes to academic curricula, and further research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-d-19-00347", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4230170521", "source": "openalex"}

At the end of surgery, the patients received either tropisetron 5 mg, droperidol 1.25 mg, or 0.9% saline intravenously (IV). As a rescue antiemetic, the patients received metoclopramide 10 mg IV. The episodes of nausea, retching, and vomiting; the need for rescue treatment; and the type and severity of adverse events were recorded at four occasions during the 48-h observation period. Pain, anxiety, drowsiness, and general satisfaction were also evaluated on a linear numerical scale of 0-10. Complete response (no PONV within the 48-h observation period) occurred similarly in the study groups (tropisetron 25%, droperidol 22%, and placebo 18%). Tropisetron and droperidol had no effect on the incidence of nausea and retching. However, the incidence of vomiting was significantly less in the tropisetron group than in the placebo group (tropisetron 19%, droperidol 45%, and placebo 57%). The number of emetic episodes (retching and/or vomiting) per patient within 48 h was significantly decreased under tropisetron when compared with placebo (tropisetron 2.5 +/- 3.4, droperidol 4.2 +/- 6.1, placebo 5.9 +/- 7.1). With regard to adverse events, the patients in the droperidol group had significantly more anxiety than the placebo group (2-6 h postoperatively), more drowsiness than the tropisetron and placebo groups (0-2 h postoperatively), and more dissatisfaction than the tropisetron (0-6 h postoperatively) and placebo groups (2-6 h postoperatively). We conclude that tropisetron given 5 mg IV during anesthesia in gynecologic incontinence surgery effectively prevents vomiting but not nausea and retching, while 1.25 mg IV droperidol fails to prevent any of these emetic symptoms and results in adverse events.

Patients with previously undiagnosed, or incompletely managed, medical concerns are identified and appropriate treatment initiated. In women with known medical concerns, the surgeon can anticipate problems and plan for appropriate postoperative care. In certain cases, the preoperative evaluation identifies medical conditions that are unstable enough to adversely affect the postoperative outcome, and appropriate referral for medical management can be made. One of the most important aspects of the evaluation is the identification of women at high risk for cardiovascular complications. A stepwise approach is useful to identify those women who may proceed to surgery and those who need further testing. Much of the preoperative evaluation of the woman with pulmonary disease can be done during the history and physical examination without additional testing. Deep venous thrombosis is a significant concern in gynecologic surgery; appropriate identification of the woman at risk is important, with initiation of prophylaxis occurring shortly after the surgery concludes. Many women undergoing gynecologic surgery have diabetes. Careful management of diabetes in the perioperative period has become more germane, with evidence of improved outcomes as tight control is achieved. Much of the preoperative evaluation falls easily into the purview of the gynecologist, with advice presented as to when medical consultation should be considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e31816c9079", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043486872", "source": "openalex"}

The present study is intended to identify specific cytokines as potent inducers of EMT associated hMSCs-tumor interactions. We used ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3 and IGROV-1), endometrial cancer cell line (Ishikawa) and hMSCs (bone marrow MSC, amniotic membrane MSC and decidua MSC). The expressions of EMT markers (E-cadherin, Snail, Twist and N-cadherin) were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), Matrigel invasion assay, and wound healing assay were used to analyze cell migration and invasion. Gynecologic cancer cells directly co-cultured with hMSCs had contact-dependent altered morphology and growth patterns. IL-6 was elevated in all co-cultures using a human cytokine array. After IL-6 treatment of cancer cell lines, RT-PCR and western blot analysis indicated a decrease in an epithelial marker and an increase in mesenchymal markers. Also, cancer cells with IL-6 significantly increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 and significantly enhance the migration ability compared to untreated cells (P<0.05), as shown by wound healing assay. On Matrigel invasion assay, treated cells displayed significantly increased invasiveness compared to untreated cancer cells. Gyneocologic cancer cells exposed to IL-6 acquired mesenchymal properties that facilitated metastasis and invasion by promoting EMT. The present study suggests that IL-6 of the tumor microenvironment has a critical role in oncogenic EMT.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2015.3122", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119145947", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to investigate the multi-infection patterns and co-infection preference of 27 HPV types among gynecological outpatients across China. Methods: Overall 137,943 gynecological outpatients were recruited from eight tertiary hospitals located in seven regions of China, between July 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. The overall, region-specific, age-specific and type-specific prevalence of HPV infection were calculated, respectively. The pattern of HPV infection was also evaluated. Furthermore, rate ratio was calculated to evaluate the co-infection preference of any two HPV genotypes. Results: The overall prevalence of 27 HPVs' [17 high-risk (hr)/10 low-risk (lr)] infection was 23.5%. The age-specific HPV prevalence showed a 'U-shaped' pattern. The most prevalent hrHPV genotypes were 16, 52 and 58. Multiple infections were detected in 25.8% of the HPV-positive women, in which dual infection was more prevalent. HPV 16/18 were likely to co-infected with HPV 31 but unlikely with HPV 52/58, i.e., the co-infection of HPV 16 with HPV 31 was high (3.5-fold), but low for HPV 58 (1.8-fold) and 52 (1.2-fold), while the co-infection of HPV 18 with HPV 31 was high (4.3-fold), but low for HPV 52 (1.9-fold) and 58 (1.7-fold). Conclusions: We found that a novel co-infection preference of HPV 16/18 with 31, 52 and 58, consistent with Australian study reporting a cross-protective efficacy of HPV 16/18 vaccine for HPV 31, but barely for HPV 52/58.

Methods: This is case report based on a 48-year-old female, G1P1, who presented with advanced cervical carcinoma and a bulky pelvic mass. The patient was treated with Trilogy equipment using IMRT. She received two fractions of 3 Gy each to the pelvis, on an emergent basis, using conventional 3-D conformal irradiation.

Two versions of IFOREAL, each employing different devices, were developed. The consumer version uses a traditional LCD display and computer mouse, whereas the professional version utilizes a head-mounted display (HMD) and joystick controller for the virtual learning. Trainees watched simulated videos and interacted with the system to accomplish tasks. IFOREAL consists of several major learning modules of gynecology. This study used the normal spontaneous delivery module to research user experience and perceptions of the IFOREAL VR training system. The results suggested that most of the trainees' user experiences and perceptions of IFOREAL, using both the types of VR-assisted technology, were positively reported. Trainees who used the consumer version of IFOREAL perceived a stronger internal control, whereas trainees using the professional version perceived a better sense of virtual presence. Overall, trainees perceived the usefulness of the IFOREAL system which predicted their future intention to use the system and other similar VR-assisted training systems for learning. Furthermore, whether the virtual content of IFOREAL grabbed the trainees' attention predicted their future intenon to use professional devices of HMD/joysck for learning other subjects. The gender difference was also explored in the study. Generally speaking, female trainees gave better evaluations of IFOREAL compared to their male counterparts. They perceived a better internal control while using the consumer version than the professional version. Male trainees believed that the gadgets used in the professional version provided a better virtual presence and met their expectation of a virtual experience better.

Overall, use of DMPA does not affect breast cancer risk. An elevated risk of this disease, however, has been noted in recent or current users. Hence, the association between DMPA use and breast cancer risk appears similar to that observed with oral contraceptives. Use of DMPA is associated with an 80% risk reduction of endometrial adenocarcinoma, a level of protection even greater than that noted with oral contraceptives. The risk of epithelial ovarian cancer and cervical neoplasia does not appear to be affected by DMPA use. Except for a substantial reduction in the risk of endometrial adenocarcinoma, use of DMPA does not appear to influence reproductive tract cancer risks.This article reviews recent epidemiological data assessing the risk of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). A review is also provided of epidemiological and biostatistical concepts which relate to the literature on the relationship between the use of hormonal contraception and cancer. Breast cancer is a common and lethal disease in the US, and evidence suggests that gonadal steroids play a role in the development of breast cancer. Two major case control studies (one in New Zealand and the other under the auspices of the World Health Organization [WHO]) as well as a pooled analysis of these studies found no increased overall breast cancer risk in DMPA users. A currently unexplained pattern of increased risk in recent users mimics that seen with oral contraceptive (OC) use and term pregnancy. A WHO hospital-based study of the relationship between endometrial cancer and DMPA use found a protective effect of DMPA which appeared to be longterm and as great as that associated with OCs. Whereas it is plausible that DMPA, which suppresses ovulation, would lower the risk of ovarian cancer in users, a WHO case-control and hospital-based study failed to uncover such a protective effect. Studies of the routine use of DMPA in nulliparous women (who have higher risk of ovarian cancer) will shed more light on any effect DMPA may have on ovarian cancer. The unique epidemiology of cervical cancer (including number of sexual partners, use of barrier contraception, and frequent screening) makes it difficult to assess any association with contraceptive use. However, a large population-based, case-control study in Costa Rica; a WHO hospital-based, case-control study in Thailand, Mexico, and Kenya; and a study in New Zealand indicate that the risk of cervical neoplasia does not appear to be affected by DMPA use. While some issues regarding DMPA and the risk of reproductive tract carcinoma remain to be resolved, clinicians can be reassured that, for appropriately selected clients, the substantial benefits of DMPA outweigh any risks.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W115142329", "source": "openalex"}

However, the long-term follow-up of these patients in an oncofertility unit is not described in the literature other than for the use of cryopreserved material.We retrospectively examined rates and reasons for the first follow-up visits of 154 consecutive young female cancer patients (age range: 18-40 years) who underwent a pre-treatment consultation between January 2012 and June 2017. Demographic and clinical data were collected, as well as information about the chosen fertility preservation method, if any.Rates and reasons for follow-up visits were collected and expressed as percentages. Different reasons were examined in the whole cohort and stratified for type of malignancy. Possible predictive factors for return to the follow-up visit (age, nulliparity, presence of a partner, neoplasm, having cryopreserved material) were investigated through logistic regression.Out of 154 patients, 74 returned to the oncofertility unit (48.1%) for a follow-up visit. The first visit was requested mostly at the end of anticancer therapies (51.3% versus 40.5% during therapies and 8.1% after cancer relapse). Among these patients, only 10.8% returned for the first time because they were actively desiring a pregnancy. For the others, the most common reasons for consultations were management of gynecological adverse effects of therapies (29.7%) and evaluation of ovarian reserve not linked to an immediate desire for a pregnancy (39.2%).

Several inflammasomes have been reported, including the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), NLRP1, NLRP7, ice protease-activating factor (IPAF), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4). Among these inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most well-studied in terms of structure and function. Unlike other inflammasomes that can only be activated by a finite number of pathogenic microorganisms, the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by the imbalance of the internal environment and a large number of metabolites. The biochemical function of NLRP3 inflammasome is to activate cysteine-requiring aspartate proteinase-1 (caspase-1), which converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, namely, IL-1β and IL-18, which are then released into the extracellular space. The well-established, classic role of NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in many disorders. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of NLRP3 inflammasome and its critical role in gynecological disorders and obstetrical complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.555826", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127324693", "source": "openalex"}

An online calculator was recently published, but the primary studies used limited gynecologic surgery data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Universal Surgical Risk Calculator (URC) on the patients of a gynecologic oncology service.We reviewed 628 consecutive surgeries performed by our gynecologic oncology service between July 2012 and June 2013. Demographic data including diagnosis and cancer stage, if applicable, were collected. Charts were reviewed to determine complication rates. Specific complications were as follows: death, pneumonia, cardiac complications, surgical site infection (SSI) or urinary tract infection, renal failure, or venous thromboembolic event. Data were compared with modeled outcomes using Brier scores and receiver operating characteristic curves. Significance was declared based on P < 0.05.The model accurately predicated death and venous thromboembolic event, with Brier scores of 0.004 and 0.003, respectively. Predicted risk was 50% greater than experienced for urinary tract infection; the experienced SSI and pneumonia rates were 43% and 36% greater than predicted. For any complication, the Brier score 0.023 indicates poor performance of the model.In this study of gynecologic surgeries, we could not verify the predictive value of the URC for cardiac complications, SSI, and pneumonia. One disadvantage of applying a URC to multiple subspecialties is that with some categories, complications are not accurately estimated.

Gynecologic examination is a common measure in reproductive health care. Many women experience the examination as a more or less negative event, with shortcomings in the examiner's behavior. The aim of the study was to describe, in terms of critical incidences, women's experiences concerning the personnel's behavior in the situation of gynecologic examination. Methods. The informants were strategically chosen and consisted of 30 Swedish women between the ages of 18–82 years old. The data collection method was qualitative research interviews analyzed by critical incident technique. Results. The result consisted of 30 subcategories, five categories, and two main areas – trust and confirmation. The personnel enabled trust when they promoted participation, created confidence, and were supportive. The opposite behavior contributed to the lack of trust. Confirmation described behavior that confirmed, respectively, did not confirm the women. This was shown through the presence or lack of respect and engagement. Conclusion. The personnel's positive behavior enabled trust and confirmed the women as individuals, while negative behavior was decisive in an unfavorable way. A complexity of patterns of knowing in nursing was identified. Participation through information that contributed to trust was important and amounted to one fourth of the incidents in the material. Respect and engagement, which confirmed the women, facilitated a positive caring relationship. The examination situation can be improved through reflection of the personnel's own behavior and further research about women's own experiences.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00597.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063986187", "source": "openalex"}

Preclinical studies indicate that ARID1A mutant cancers display sensitivity to ATR inhibition while tumors without ARID1A mutations may be sensitive to Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) inhibitors in combination with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Primary Objective To determine whether the ATR inhibitor, ceralasertib, has clinical activity as a single agent and in combination with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in patients with ARID1A ‘loss’ and ‘no loss’ clear cell carcinomas and other relapsed gynecological cancers. Study Hypothesis ARID1A deficient clear cell carcinoma of the ovary or endometrium is sensitive to ATR inhibition, while the combination of ATR and PARP inhibition has activity in other gynecological tumors, irrespective of ARID1A status. Trial Design ATARI (ENGOT/GYN1/NCRI) is a multicenter, international, proof-of-concept, phase II, parallel cohort trial assessing ceralasertib activity as a single agent and in combination with olaparib in ARID1A stratified gynecological cancers. Patients with relapsed ovarian/endometrial clear cell carcinoma with ARID1A loss will receive ceralasertib monotherapy (cohort 1A). Relapsed ovarian/endometrial clear cell carcinoma patients with no ARID1A loss (cohort 2) or patients with other histological subtypes (endometrioid, carcinosarcoma, cervical) (cohort 3) will receive combination therapy (olaparib/ceralasertib). Treatment will continue until disease progression. Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Patients with histologically confirmed recurrent clear cell (ovarian, endometrial, or endometriosis related), endometrioid (ovarian, endometrial, or endometriosis related), cervical (adenocarcinomas or squamous), or carcinosarcomas (ovarian or endometrial) are eligible.

Cytological examination is a crucial step in the initial diagnosis of cancer, although it shows limited diagnostic efficacy. Recently, AI applications in the processing of cytopathological images have shown promising results despite the elementary level of the technology. Here, we performed a systematic review with a quantitative analysis of recent AI applications in non-gynecological (non-GYN) cancer cytology to understand the current technical status. We searched the major online databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE, for relevant English articles published from January 2010 to January 2021. The searched query terms were: “artificial intelligence”, “image processing”, “deep learning”, “cytopathology”, and “fine-needle aspiration cytology.” Out of 17,000 studies, only 26 studies (26 models) were included in the full-text review, whereas 13 studies were included for quantitative analysis. There were eight classes of AI models treated of according to target organs: thyroid (n = 11, 39%), urinary bladder (n = 6, 21%), lung (n = 4, 14%), breast (n = 2, 7%), pleural effusion (n = 2, 7%), ovary (n = 1, 4%), pancreas (n = 1, 4%), and prostate (n = 1, 4). Most of the studies focused on classification and segmentation tasks. Although most of the studies showed impressive results, the sizes of the training and validation datasets were limited. Overall, AI is also promising for non-GYN cancer cytopathology analysis, such as pathology or gynecological cytology. However, the lack of well-annotated, large-scale datasets with Z-stacking and external cross-validation was the major limitation found across all studies.

We investigated whether N2O results in a dose–response increase in PONV. METHODS: Patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were randomized to receive 30% oxygen with air (G0, n = 46), 50% N2O with oxygen (G50, n = 46), or 70% N2O with oxygen (G70, n = 45). A standardized general anesthetic was used with no PONV prophylaxis. Known risk factors for PONV were controlled. Metoclopramide was used as a rescue antiemetic. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, use of rescue antiemetic, and pain visual analog scale (VAS) score was measured at 2 and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Patient demographics were comparable, and there were no differences among groups regarding factors that may influence PONV. The incidence of PONV at 24 h was 33% (15 of 46) in the G0 group, 46% (21 of 46) in the G50 group, and 62% (28 of 45) in the G70 group (P = 0.018). Subgroup analysis revealed a difference between G0 versus G70 groups (P = 0.018), but no significant difference between G0 versus G50 groups and G50 versus G70 groups. The incidence of nausea showed a similar difference (G0 = 26%, G50 = 35%, and G70 = 56%; P = 0.012), but the incidence of vomiting was not different among the groups although there was a trend (G0 = 28%, G50 = 35%, and G70 = 42%; P = 0.377). The severity of nausea (measured by VAS 100 mm) was significantly increased with increasing N2O concentration (G0 = 10.9, G50 = 12.7, and G70 = 20.5; P = 0.027). The highest VAS score during 24 h was used for the analysis. There was no difference in the use of a rescue antiemetic among groups. Pain VAS scores and opioids consumption were not different among groups (at 2 and 24 h after surgery). CONCLUSIONS: N2O increases the incidence of postoperative nausea after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. This preliminary finding indicates that N2O may increase PONV in a dose-dependent fashion. A study with a sample size of >400 patients in each group would be necessary to demonstrate a statistically significant difference among each of these three groups. We do not recommend using a high concentration of N2O in this clinical setting. IMPLICATIONS: We demonstrate that nitrous oxide (N2O) increases the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. The preliminary findings indicate that N2O may increase PONV in a dose-dependent fashion. A high concentration of N2O in this clinical setting is not recommended.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e318181f4aa", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109673513", "source": "openalex"}

Menopausal symptoms are a significant health concern after treatment for gynecological cancers and may result from oncologic treatments such as premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy, ovarian failure associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and anti-estrogenic effects of maintenance endocrine therapy. Additionally, with the growing availability of testing for pathogenic gene variants such as BRCA1/2 and Lynch syndrome, there is an increasing number of women undergoing risk-reducing oophorectomy, which in most cases will be before age 45 years and will induce surgical menopause. Not all menopausal symptoms require treatment, but patients with cancer may experience more severe symptoms compared with women undergoing natural menopause. Moreover, there is increasing evidence of the long-term implications of early menopause, including bone loss, cognitive decline and increased cardiovascular risk. Systemic hormone therapy is well established as the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and vaginal (topical) estrogen therapy is effective for genitourinary symptoms. However, the role of hormone receptors in many gynecological cancers and their treatment pose a challenge to the management of menopausal symptoms after cancer. Consequently, the use of menopausal hormone therapy in this setting can be difficult for clinicians to navigate and this article aims to provide current, comprehensive guidance for the use of menopausal hormone replacement therapy in women who have had, or are at risk of developing, gynecological cancer to assist with these treatment decisions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-002032", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3095471033", "source": "openalex"}

Methods We developed a 27-item questionnaire that was administered to convenient sample of patients with breast cancer and another with gynecological cancer who were attending a community-based oncology service in northern Israel. Results Of the 275 respondents, 109 (39.6%) had gynecological cancers and 166 (60.4%) had breast cancer. Current and/or previous year CAM use for oncology treatment was significantly higher among the patients with gynecological cancer (73/166 [44%] vs 67/106 [63%], P = 0.03). A logistic regression model indicated that CAM use was associated with gynecological cancer (EXP [B], 2.51; 95% confidence interval for EXP [B], 1.29–4.88; P = 0.007], younger age, Jewish religion, and lesser degree of religiosity. The patients highly expected their gynecologist-oncologist and family doctor to refer them to CAM counseling. Moreover, they expected their gynecologist-oncologist to participate in building a CAM treatment plan if CAM were to be integrated into the oncology service. The patients expected the CAM consultant to inform them of the safety and efficacy of CAM treatments, emphasizing expectations to strengthen their general ability to cope with the disease, reduce chemotherapy side effects, and provide emotional and spiritual support. Conclusion Although patients with gynecological malignancies use CAM significantly more than patients with breast cancer, both groups share similar conceptions regarding the active role of their gynecologist oncologists in the process of CAM integration within supportive care and expect CAM consultation to focus on improving their well-being.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e318226c614", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2033392847", "source": "openalex"}

Ideally, once these supportive care needs are met, patients can enjoy an improved quality of life. Supportive care needs include all body systems, and are, therefore, difficult to manage, secondary to the fact that they require collaboration among multiple medical specialties. In this review, several components of supportive care are separated into two categories: tumor-related morbidities and treatment-related morbidities. Some of the themes discussed include nausea and vomiting, cancer pain, psychological distress, fatigue and anemia, small bowel obstruction and peripheral neuropathy. While all of these components are challenging to manage, it is perhaps the psychosocial realm that remains the most unmet need. Regardless, the oncologist must act as a facilitator who addresses these needs and, if unable to address the issue alone, knows how to steer the patient toward the appropriate provider.

Four days later, she presented with symptoms of a small bowel obstruction and was found to have evisceration through a laterally placed 8-mm robotic port site. The bowel was reduced locally and the fascial defect repaired without midline laparotomy or bowel resection.

The development of robotic surgery in gynecology remains in its infancy. The present study reports the first descriptive series of robotic surgery in complicated gynecologic diseases in Taiwan.From March 2009 to February 2011, the records of patients undergoing robotic surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System were reviewed for patient demographics, indications, operative time, hospital stay, conversion to laparotomy, and complications.Sixty cases were reviewed in the present study. Forty-nine patients had benign gynecologic diseases, and 11 patients had malignancies. These robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures include nine hysterectomy, 15 subtotal hysterectomy, 13 myomectomy, eight staging operation, two radical hysterectomy, five ovarian cystectomy, one bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and myomectomy, two resections of deep pelvic endometriosis, one pelvic adhesiolysis, three sacrocolpopexy and one tuboplasty. Thirty-three patients had prior pelvic surgery, and one had a history of pelvic radiotherapy. Adhesiolysis was necessary in 38 patients to complete the whole operation. Robotic myomectomy was easily accomplished in patients with huge uterus or multiple myomas. The suturing of myometrium or cervical stump after ligation of the uterine arteries minimized the blood loss. In addition, it was much easier to dissect severe pelvic adhesions. The dissection of para-aortic lymph nodes can be easily accomplished. All these surgeries were performed smoothly without ureteral, bladder or bowel injury.The present analyses include various complicated gynecologic conditions, which make the estimation of the effectiveness of robotic surgery in each situation individually not appropriate. However, our experiences do show that robotic surgery is feasible and safe for patients with complicated gynecologic diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2012.01.005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071815049", "source": "openalex"}

Methods This was a single‐center, retrospective diagnostic accuracy study based on ultrasound data collected prospectively, between May and December 2017, from 278 patients with at least one adnexal (ovarian, paraovarian or tubal) mass. Clinical and pathologic information, serum CA 125 level and ultrasonographic findings were collected. All patients underwent surgery and the histopathological diagnosis was used as reference standard. The final diagnosis was classified into five tumor types according to the ADNEX model: benign ovarian tumor, borderline ovarian tumor (BOT), Stage‐I ovarian cancer (OC), Stages‐II–IV OC and ovarian metastasis. Receiver–operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the ADNEX model, with and without inclusion of CA 125 level in the model. Results Of the 278 women included, 203 (73.0%) had a benign ovarian tumor and 75 (27.0%) had a malignant ovarian tumor, including 18 (6.5%) with BOT, 17 (6.1%) with Stage‐I OC, 32 (11.5%) with Stages‐II–IV OC and eight (2.9%) with ovarian metastasis. The performance of the IOTA ADNEX model was good for discriminating between benign and malignant tumors, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91–0.97) when CA 125 was included in the model and AUC of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96) without CA 125. The AUC values of the model including CA 125 ranged between 0.61 and 0.99 for distinguishing between the different types of tumor, and it showed excellent performance in discriminating between a benign ovarian tumor and Stages‐II–IV OC, with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97–1.00). The performance of the model was less effective at distinguishing between BOT and Stage‐I OC and between Stages‐II–IV OC and ovarian metastasis, with AUC values of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.43–0.77) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62–0.90), respectively. Although inclusion of CA 125 did not alter the performance of the ADNEX model in discriminating between benign and malignant lesions (AUC of 0.94 and 0.93 with and without CA 125 level, respectively; P = 0.54), the inclusion of CA 125 in the model improved its performance in discriminating between Stage‐I OC and Stages‐II–IV OC (AUC increased from 0.81 to 0.92; P = 0.04) and between Stages‐II–IV OC and metastatic cancer (AUC increased from 0.58 to 0.78; P = 0.01). Conclusions The IOTA ADNEX model showed good to excellent performance in distinguishing between benign and malignant adnexal masses and between the different types of ovarian tumor in a Chinese setting. Based on our findings, the ADNEX model has high value in clinical practice and can aid in the preoperative diagnosis of patients with an adnexal mass. Copyright © 2019 ISUOG.

At least one platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen had failed in each patient. The median number of previous chemotherapy regimens and cycles of chemotherapy was 4 and 23, respectively. A total of 124 cycles of gemcitabine were delivered (median, 3 cycles). Hematologic toxicity included four patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and two patients with grade 3/4 neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia resulted in eight dose reductions and a single 1-week treatment delay. Nonhematologic side effects were well tolerated and largely self-limiting.

Method : Thirty‐two women treated for recurrent gynecologic cancer were prescribed methylphenidate at morning and noon over a 8‐week period. Participants completed the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) along with assessments of quality of life and mood at baseline, week 2, 4 and 8 to determine changes in levels of fatigue experienced. Results : Patients reported significant declines in fatigue ( p =0.0001), and improvement in both mood ( p =0.0020) and quality of life ( p =0.0351) when comparing baseline scores to study end. Conclusions : This study provides support for the use of a psychostimulant to treat fatigue in women who have recurrent gynecologic cancer. It is particularly relevant for these patients with incurable disease who are facing the end of life.

Methods Data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 1992-1994 were analyzed to determine rates of visits to emergency departments among women, ages 15-44 years. Average annual rates per 1000 women were calculated using age, race, and region-specific population estimates. Rate ratios were used to compare rates among subgroups. Results Approximately 1.4 million gynecologic visits were made to emergency departments annually, for an average annual rate of 24.3 visits per 1000 women, ages 15–44 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0, 26.6). The most frequent diagnoses were pelvic inflammatory disease (average annual rate 5.8, 95% CI 5.0, 6.6), lower genital tract infections including sexually transmitted diseases (average annual rate 5.7, 95% CI 4.8, 6.6), and menstrual disorders (average annual rate 2.9, 95% CI 2.3, 3.5). Nearly half of all gynecologic visits resulted in diagnoses of genital tract infections. Younger women (ages 15–24 years) were 2.3 (95% CI 2.0, 2.6) times as likely as older women (ages 25–44 years), and black women were 3.6 (95% CI 2.9, 4.3) times as likely as white women, to visit emergency departments for gynecologic disorders. Rate ratios for genital tract infections were 10–20 times higher for younger black women than for older, white women. Conclusion Almost half of gynecologic visits to emergency departments were related to genital tract infections, which largely are preventable. From 1992 to 1994, genital tract infections were diagnosed at nearly half of all emergency department visits for gynecologic disorders among women ages 15-44 years.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006250-199806000-00026", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4254382701", "source": "openalex"}

Several circumstances predispose to this condition as a consequence of increased intra‐compartmental pressure, such as positioning of the legs during operation (lithotomy and Lloyd‐Davies positions), a prolonged operation, external compression and vascular insults, both pre‐ and intra‐operatively. To prevent well‐leg compartment syndrome it is important to improve knowledge of the condition among surgeons and nursing staff. Potential risk factors and preventive initiatives are listed to reduce the risk in future patients.

Methods This was a retrospective multicenter study of patients with a histological diagnosis of pure endometrioid carcinoma. We identified 161 patients from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) database who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced ultrasound examiner between 1999 and 2016, and another 78 patients from the databases of the departments of gynecological oncology in the participating centers. All tumors were described using IOTA terminology. In addition, one author reviewed all available ultrasound images and described them using pattern recognition. Results Median age of the 239 patients was 55 years (range, 19–88 years). On ultrasound examination, two (0.8%) endometrioid carcinomas were described as unilocular cysts, three (1.3%) as multilocular cysts, 37 (15.5%) as unilocular‐solid cysts, 115 (48.1%) as multilocular‐solid cysts and 82 (34.3%) as solid masses. Median largest tumor diameter was 102.5 mm (range, 20–300 mm) and median largest diameter of the largest solid component was 63 mm (range, 9–300 mm). Papillary projections were present in 70 (29.3%) masses. Most cancers (188 (78.7%)) were unilateral. In 49 (20.5%) cases, the cancer was judged by the pathologist to develop from endometriosis. These cancers, compared with those without evidence of tumor developing from endometriosis, more often manifested papillary projections on ultrasound (46.9% (23/49) vs 24.7% (47/190)), were less often bilateral (8.2% (4/49) vs 24.7% (47/190)) and less often associated with ascites (6.1% (3/49) vs 28.4% (54/190)) and fluid in the pouch of Douglas (24.5% (12/49) vs 48.9% (93/190)). Retrospective analysis of available ultrasound images using pattern recognition revealed that many tumors without evidence of tumor developing from endometriosis (36.3% (41/113)) had a large central solid component entrapped within locules, giving the tumor a cockade‐like appearance. Conclusions Endometrioid cancers are usually large, unilateral, multilocular‐solid or solid tumors. The ultrasound characteristics of endometrioid carcinomas developing from endometriosis differ from those without evidence of tumor developing from endometriosis, the former being more often unilateral cysts with papillary projections and no ascites.

Overall survival was estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Results: Primary gynecological tumors were breast (n = 27), ovarian (n = 8), and uterine (n = 8) cancers. Solely exploratory laparotomy was performed in 13 patients who served as controls. Whereas the perioperative mortality was 0%, minor complications occurred in 18.7%. The overall survival of all patients undergoing liver resection was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of patients with unresectable metastases. Subgroup analyses showed that particularly patients with respectable liver metastases from breast cancer had a significantly higher (50%) 5-year survival compared to patients with only an exploratory laparotomy.

Since most of the current research on spiritual well-being has been carried out in areas with religious beliefs, this study was conducted in the context of no development of formal religion. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between death anxiety and spiritual well-being and the related factors of spiritual well-being among gynecological cancer patients.This cross-section study was conducted among 586 gynecological cancer patients. The European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-spiritual well-being32 (EORTC QLQ-SWB32) and Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (T-DAS) were used to measure spiritual well-being and death anxiety. The Multiple Linear Regression Model was used to determine the relationship between spiritual well-being and death anxiety.For all participants, the highest QLQ-SWB32 centesimal score was 75.13 on the Relationship with Other scale, and the lowest was 60.33 on the Relationship with Someone or Something Greater Scale. The mean Death Anxiety score was 5.31 (SD 3.18). We found that Relationship with Someone or Something Greater was the only scale not associated with death anxiety. Overall, patients with lower death anxiety have a higher level of spiritual well-being. Besides, a high Relationship with Other score was associated with living with a partner (B = 2.471, P < 0.001) and married (B = -6.475, P = 0.001). Patients with higher Global-SWB were retired (B = 0.387, P = 0.019).Our study found that the spiritual well-being of patients with gynecological cancer in China was no worse than in other countries with religious beliefs and patients with lower death anxiety have a higher level of spiritual well-being.

The aim of this study was to analyze the sexual outcome and overall QoL of women after treatment for primary GC compared with a healthy control group (CG).In a multicenter cross-sectional study, 77 women aged 28 to 67 years were surveyed at least 12 months after completion of primary therapy for cervical, endometrial, or vulvar cancer [gynecological cancer group (GCG)]. Data were collected through validated questionnaires (Female Sexual Function Index-d, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, and Sexual Activity Questionnaire) and compared to a control of 60 healthy women (CG).In the GCG, 41.3% were sexually active compared to 78.0% in the CG. Twelve women of the CG and 42 women of the GCG indicated the reasons for their sexual inactivity. The most common reason for sexual inactivity in the GCG was \"the-presence-of-a-physical-problem\" [18/42 (42.9%) vs 2/12 (16.7%) in the CG], whereas in the CG, \"because-I-do-not-have-a-partner\" was most common [6/12 (50.0%) vs 11/42 (26.2%) in the GCG].

Among the PARP families, the most studied are PARP1, PARP2 and PARP 3. PARP1 is found to be the most abundant nuclear enzyme under the PARP series. These enzymes are primarily involved in base excision repair as one of the major single strand break (SSB) repair mechanisms. Being double stranded, DNA engages itself in reparation of a sub-lethal SSB with the aid of PARP. Moreover, by having a sister chromatid, DNA can also repair double strand breaks with either error-free homologous recombination or error-prone non-homologous end-joining. For effective homologous recombination repair, DNA requires functional heterozygous breast cancer genes (BRCA) which encode BRCA1/2. Currently, the development of PARP inhibitors has been one of the promising breakthroughs for cancer chemotherapy. In March 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved niraparib for maintenance therapy of recurrent gynecologic cancers (epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinomas) which are sensitive to previous platinum based chemotherapy irrespective of BRCA mutation and homologous recombination deficiency status. It is the third drug in this class to receive FDA approval, following olaparib and rucaparib and is the first global approval for maintenance therapy of the aforementioned cancers. Niraparib preferentially blocks both PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes. The daily tolerated dose of niraparib is 300 mg, above which dose limiting grade 3 and 4 toxicities were observed. In combination with humanized antibody, pembrolizumab, it is also under investigation for those patients who have triple negative breast cancer.

The most common histologic subtype of both vulvar and vaginal cancers is squamous cell carcinoma, with an increasing role of the human papillomavirus (HPV) in a significant number of these tumors. Lymph node involvement is the hallmark of FIGO stage 3 vulvar cancer while pelvic sidewall involvement is the hallmark of FIGO stage 3 vaginal cancer. Imaging techniques include computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and PET-MRI. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for preoperative clinical staging of nodal and metastatic involvement while PET-CT is helpful with assessing response to neoadjuvant treatment and for guiding patient management. Determining the pretreatment extent of disease has become more important due to modern tailored operative approaches and use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy to reduce surgical morbidity.

This study aimed to investigate the current prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV among women attending gynecology clinics in northern Henan Province.This study included 15,616 women aged 16-81 years old who visited the Xinxiang central hospital's gynecology department between January 2018 and December 2019. HPV DNA was detected by a conventional PCR method followed by HPV type-specific hybridization, which was designed to detect 17 high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) genotypes and 20 low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) genotypes. HPV prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using SPSS 18.0.The overall HPV prevalence was 19.7% among women in northern Henan Province. Single, double, and multiple HPV infections accounted for 13.7%, 4.3%, and 1.8% of the total cases. Most infections were caused by HR-HPV (71.8%), and single genotype HPV infection (13.7%) was the most common pattern. The most common HR-HPV genotype was HPV16 (4.3%), followed by HPV52 (3.5%) and HPV58 (2.0%). The most common LR-HPV genotype was HPV6 (1.4%), followed by HPV61 (1.1%) and HPV81 (1.1%).HPV infection is high among women attending gynecology clinics in northern Henan Province. The highest prevalence was found in women less than 20 years old.

Sexual problems arising after chemotherapy are decreased interest and vaginal lubrication, lack of orgasm and dyspareunia and sense of reduction in sexual attractiveness in general. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes that patients who receive chemotherapy for a gynecologic oncology disorder experience in their sexual functions. Materials and Methods: A descriptive/cross-sectional and qualitative study was performed. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used in order to collect data on sexual capacity. The quantitative data obtained were evaluated with frequency and percentage calculations while content analysis was performed for the qualitative data. Results: All of the information related to sexuality was provided by the physician. Chemotherapy treatment affected sexuality negatively in 55.9%. Since receiving the diagnosis, 52.9% of women had experienced no sexual intercourse at all. Those who had an FSFI score of 30 and below made up 75% of the women. After the content analysis of data obtained during in in-depth interviewing, we focused on three main themes: desire for sexual intercourse, problems experienced during sexual intercourse, and coping with problems.

Overall, it is more a presentation of the state of the field than a collection of formulations and treatment recommendations for a group of disorders; yet it contains that, too. The book is arranged around five main themes. The first section focuses on critical experiences during the female life cycle. Beginning with the prenatal period and the effects of exogenous hormones on the fetus. it proceeds to a discussion of the critical developmental occurrences taking place between infant and parents during the first hours of life, then of the hormonal, physical, and sociocultural factors involved in postpartum depression. A thorough treatment of hormonal regulation of female sexual response is then followed by coverage of the social as well as the emotional aspects of menstruation, birth, and menopause. Part two presents a rather unsettling view of the patient-physician relationship, at least unsettling for those who might have been comfortably ensconced in the old paternalistic approach. Such subjects as women's abhorrence of prolonged waiting time, lofty explanations, routine pubic hair shaving, and the abnormal delivery position", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1484464408", "source": "openalex"}

The methyl line of the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of acridine orange zinc trichloride, dissolved in heavy water, has been studied. This line consists of two overlapping components with different widths. A mathematical technique has been developed to resolve the two components quantitatively. Their relative proportion depends on the acid‐base state of the molecular environment. If the stain is adsorbed on albumin the narrow component quickly disappears, while adsorption on RNA gives rise to a broadening of the narrow line. With large amounts of albumin or RNA, both components disappear. DNA strongly adsorbs acridine orange with complete disappearance of all NMR spectral lines. Mitochondria, submitochondrial particles and microsomes cause some broadening of the narrow component of the methyl line. Due to the obvious alterations of the NMR spectrum, in the circumstances mentioned, this type of spectroscopy may be used for the biophysical characterization of interaction mechanisms between acridine orange and various proteins, nucleic acids and cell fractions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00016347309158480", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1905661675", "source": "openalex"}

Identifying people at risk of postpartum depression may improve its management. The objective of this study was to determine the probable association between postpartum depression and some preconception gynecological morbidities. Data from a nationwide birth cohort study, the Japan Environment and Children's study (JECS), up to one month of postpartum were analyzed. To assess postpartum depression, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used; 11 preconception gynecological morbidities were considered as risk factors. Covariates included psychiatric illness history, psychosocial factors, some pregnancy adverse outcomes, birth outcomes, socio-demographic and health behavioral factors. Except for the prevalence of previous miscarriage, leiomyoma and polycystic ovarian syndrome, depressive women had more gynecological morbidities compared to non-depressive ones. In logistic regression model, endometriosis (OR, 1.27; 95%CI: 1.15–1.41), dysmenorrhea (OR, 1.13; 95%CI: 1.06–1.21) and abnormal uterine bleeding (OR, 1.21; 95%CI: 1.15–1.29) were associated with postpartum depression. We could not specify in detail which type of gynecological morbidity was associated with postpartum depression, because the current design was not exclusively oriented by the JECS research question.

We have investigated the changes in the emergency flow occurred during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an obstetrics and gynecological ES and the short-term adverse outcomes on women's and reproductive health.Study designThe study was conducted in the OBGYN ES of the Clinica Mangiagalli, the largest maternity clinic of Milan, Lombardy, Northern Italy. We analyzed retrospectively the records of all women consecutively admitted at the ES from February 23rd to June 24th 2019, and compared them with the admissions during the lockdown executive order from February 23rd to June 23rd, 2020. Patients were assessed in terms of demographic features, presentation times, triage classification (urgent/not urgent), reason for admission and outcome of the visit (discharge/admission to the ward). A total of 9291 data were retrieved from ES files and automation system, 5644 from 2019 and 3647 from 2020. Categorical variables were compared by the chi-square test calculating the p value and computed were percentage changes (with 95 % Confidence interval, CI).ResultsDuring the period February 24 th - May 31 th 2020 the admissions at the ES decreased by 35.4 % (95 % CI—34.1–36.6) compared with the corresponding period in 2019. The reduction was more marked for gynecological complaints (-63.5 %, 95 %CI -60.5 to -66.5): in particular we observed a reduction of admissions for genital infection/cystitis of 75.7 % (95 %CI -71.4 to -80.1). The admission for complaints associated with pregnancy decreased by 28.5 % (95 %CI -27.2 to-29.9). In the index period, five fetal deaths were diagnosed compared with one observed in the reference period in 2019 (chi square computed using as denominator all observed pregnancies = 4.29, p = 0.04). The frequency of admission for elective caesarean section/labor induction increased from 47.5 % in 2019 to 53.6 % in 2020: this difference was statistically significant.ConclusionThe lockdown negatively influenced ES admissions and consequently the women's/reproductive health.

Although the age at peak incidence can vary depending on the eating disorder, these disorders commonly arise during adolescence. Adult and adolescent females with eating disorders may present with gynecologic concerns or symptoms, including irregular menses, amenorrhea, pelvic pain, atrophic vaginitis, and breast atrophy. Although formal diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders in adolescents are complex and outside the scope of practice for most general obstetrician-gynecologists, it is important that health care providers be comfortable with recognizing and screening at-risk patients. Recognizing risk factors for eating disorders can help to identify patients who should be further evaluated. Simply asking the patient how she feels about her weight, what she is eating, how much she is eating, and how much she is exercising can help identify at-risk patients. A physical examination and laboratory tests are valuable in the diagnosis of an eating disorder. Because eating disorders are complex and affect psychologic and physical health, a multidisciplinary approach is imperative. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not expected to treat eating disorders, they should be familiar with the criteria that warrant immediate hospitalization for medical stabilization.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000002652", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4234125670", "source": "openalex"}

Most of the available studies are limited by their design; for example, they lack a control group, patients are not randomized, follow-up is short term, series are small, LASER is not compared with standard treatments, and most studies are industry sponsored. Because of these limitations, the level of evidence for the use of LASER in the treatment of these conditions remains low and does not allow for definitive recommendations for its use in routine clinical practice. Histological evidence is commonly reported as proof of tissue regeneration after LASER treatment. However, the histological changes noted can also be consistent with reparative changes after a thermal injury rather than necessarily representing regeneration or restoration of function. The use of LASER in women with vulvodynia or lichen sclerosus should not be recommended in routine clinical practice. There is no biological plausibility or safety data on its use on this population of women. The available clinical studies do not present convincing data regarding the efficacy of LASER for the treatment of vaginal atrophy or urinary incontinence. Also, although short-term complications seem to be uncommon, data concerning long-term outcomes are lacking. Therefore, at this point, LASER is not recommended for routine treatment of the aforementioned conditions unless part of well-designed clinical trials or with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/lgt.0000000000000462", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2917120283", "source": "openalex"}

We performed a review of all English-language reports of vulvar leiomyoma published in PubMed from 1978 to 2015 using the following search terms: “vulval leiomyoma,” “vulvar leiomyoma,” “vulval smooth muscle tumor,” and “external genitalia smooth muscle tumor.” Vulvar leiomyomas, which are rare benign monoclonal tumors, most commonly occur in the fourth and fifth decades of life. The genetics of vulvar leiomyoma remain undefined. Three principal histological patterns have been identified: spindled, epithelioid, and myxoid. Imaging tests such as ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging are used in diagnosis. Surgical excision is the only curative treatment for vulvar leiomyomas. Establishment of a full differential diagnosis list and correct final diagnosis before surgery are essential for optimal clinical management. Although recurrence of vulvar leiomyoma is extremely rare, long-term follow-up of all cases is advisable.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060517721796", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2750764361", "source": "openalex"}

Cancer in Endometrial Curettings and Biopsies", "text": "Summary We report our experience with an interinstitutional surgical pathology review of endometrial curettings and biopsies originally diagnosed as cancer. Slides were reviewed from 182 women who were diagnosed with cancer and referred to our institution for further treatment; the slides had been sent for review at the request of the gynecologic oncologist. Review diagnoses were retrospectively compared to original diagnoses made on slides from these specimens, and significant discrepancies were identified in 43 (23.6%) of the 182 cases. For 16 (8.8%) patients, the diagnosis was downgraded from malignant to: I) a benign non-hyperplastic process in 4 (2.2%); 2) scanty atypical glandular epithelium, not diagnostic for malignancy, in 2 (1.1%); and 3) endometrial hyperplasia in 10 (5.5%), including complex atypical hyperplasia in 8 (4.4%). Other significant differences involved histologie tumor classification in 16 (8.8%), degree of differentiation (two grades) in 2 (1.1%), determination of primary site in 4 (2.2%), and diagnosis of endocervical invasion in 5 (2.7%). Problems in comparison included lack of standardization of terminology and incomplete information from the original diagnoses. The high discrepancy rate between review and original diagnoses underscores the difficulty of interpreting these specimens. Review diagnoses of benign processes prevented an unnecessary operation for several women, and allowed those with cancer to undergo the most appropriate therapy. Review diagnoses in women with endometrial cancer contribute to quality medical care and have a major impact on a significant subset of patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004347-199801000-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048445465", "source": "openalex"}

Data are presented on 237 cases of endometrial cancer, 92 cases of ovarian cancer and 639 cases of invasive cervix cancer, detailing their ABO blood antigenic phenotypes, the stage of neoplasia and the treatment received. With regard to endometrial cancer, a sensibly better 5-year and 10-year survival is associated with blood group 0 if compared with blood group A. This finding is more evident when 5-year survival is considered among patients affected by ovarian cancer. With regard to cervical cancer, analysis showed that a little better than 5-year survival is associated with 0 blood phenotype; on the contrary, when a 10-year or longer survival is considered, a better survival is associated with A blood phenotype. The present study confirms evidence of an association between the A blood group and gynecological tumors. Endometrial and ovarian cancer occur more frequently in women with blood type A than in those with the other blood types, moreover, in the same tumors blood group A is associated with a poor prognosis.

Contrary to expectations, physicians made global ratings of the students using a single criterion and did not distinguish among the six evaluation categories. Each of the five groups of physicians used a different criterion to evaluate students. The ratings were inflated and suffered from low inter-rater reliability. First-year residents were more lenient in their grading tendencies than the other physician groups. The ratings showed a weak correlation with the examination scores, and the strength of this relationship varied with the physician group and performance category.

This study using survey methods was conducted to rate the acceptability of the clinical experience and to document any changes in students' attitudes toward women's access to abortion. Method All 145 students who rotated through the Ob/Gyn clerkship between March 2000 and March 2002 were provided an 11-item, confidential questionnaire to complete. Students who did not participate in the abortion care experience were asked questions about their reasons for declining participation; students who did participate were asked questions about the value of the experience. Results Of the 145 students who rotated through the clerkship during the study period, 126 (87%) completed the questionnaire. Of these students, 86 (68%) participated in the clinical experience and 40 (32%) did not. The majority of students who participated in the clinical experience rated it very highly. Of the 86 students who participated in the clinical experience, 33 (38%) reported a change in their attitudes about abortion; 31 (94%) of these became more supportive of women's access to abortion services.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2324035852", "title": "Robotically Assisted vs Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Among Women With Benign Gynecologic Disease", "text": "There has been increasing enthusiasm for robotic gynecologic surgery in recent years. Most data supporting robotically assisted hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease were from small studies conducted in single institutions or centers with surgery performed by highly experienced surgeons. The results of these studies may not be applicable to the practice of gynecology in a community setting. A meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing robotic and laparoscopic surgery for benign gynecologic disease concluded that both procedures were associated with similar outcomes and complications; however, the robotic procedure was considerably more expensive. At present, benefits of robotically assisted hysterectomy for women with benign gynecologic disease are unclear. The aims of this population-based study were to determine rates of uptake of robotically assisted hysterectomy over a 3-year period and to compare the association between use of robotic surgery and rates of abdominal and laparoscopic hysterectomy during this period. In-hospital complications and costs were also compared. The cohort was composed of 264,758 women who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disorders at 441 hospitals in the United States from 2007 to 2010. The primary outcome measures were uptake of robotic-assisted hysterectomy and factors associated with its utilization. Factors evaluated in the participants included complications, transfusion, reoperation, length of stay, death, and cost. A propensity score–matched analysis was performed to analyze outcomes and minimize selection bias and to estimate the propensity to undergo a robotic-assisted hysterectomy. Uptake of robotically assisted hysterectomy increased rapidly over the 3-year study period from 0.5% to 9.5% of all hysterectomies. Laparoscopic hysterectomy rates during this same time period increased from 24.3% to 30.5%. At hospitals where the robotic procedure was used starting in 2007, it accounted for 22.4% of all hysterectomies by 2010. Increased uptake of robotic-assisted hysterectomy was paralleled by a decrease in the rate of abdominal hysterectomy both in hospitals where robotic-assisted hysterectomy was performed and in those where it was not performed. Propensity score–matched analysis showed similar complication rates for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic hysterectomy (5.5% vs 5.3%); relative risk [RR] was 1.03, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.86 to 1.24. Hospitalization for longer than 2 days was significantly less common in patients who underwent robotic-assisted hysterectomy compared with the laparoscopic hysterectomy cohort (19.6 vs 24.9%, P < 0.001), whereas there was no difference in the rate of transfusion (1.4% vs 1.8%; RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.55–1.16) or the rate of discharge to a nursing facility (0.2% vs 0.3%; RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.35–1.76; P > 0.05 for both comparisons). The total costs of robotically assisted hysterectomy per case was more than for laparoscopic hysterectomy; the difference was $2189 (95% CI, $2030–$2349). These data show that the uptake of robotically assisted hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disorders increased substantially between 2007 and 2010. The morbidity profiles for robotically assisted and laparoscopic hysterectomy were similar, but the cost of the robotic procedure was substantially higher.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0b013e3182941723", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2324035852", "source": "openalex"}

Of these, five were classified as diploid by FCM but either aneuploid (three cases) or polyploid (two cases) by IM Two other tumors were aneuploid by ICM but polyploid (one case) and unclassifiable (one case) by FCM. All tumors classified as aneuploid by FCM were also aneuploid by ICM, and all tumors classified diploid by ICM were also diploid by FCM. Of six patients whose tumors were classified as euploid (five diploid and one polyploid) by FCM but classified as aneuploid by ICM, five relapsed, and three of these have died of disease. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that ICM must be performed in cases classified as diploid by FCM to ensure that small subpopulations of aneuploid tumor cells are not overlooked.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.990130314", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078027973", "source": "openalex"}

Most women with depression do not present with depression symptoms. Because they often present with headache or other somatic symptoms, less than one third of these women are accurately diagnosed. The aims of this study were to describe the presenting symptoms of women who screened positive for depression in obstetrics and gynecology clinics, to determine the frequency of a diagnosis of depression, and to investigate factors associated with the diagnosis of depression by an obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn). Data were obtained from charts of women screening positive for depression enrolled in a randomized controlled clinical trial testing a collaborative care depression intervention delivered at 2 academic obstetrician and gynecology clinics. Participants were randomized either to intervention or to usual obstetric and gynecologic care. Patients screening positive for depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire received a complete psychiatric workup to confirm a diagnosis of depression. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios of having a diagnosis of depression by an ob-gyn and to examine patient factors associated with the diagnosis of depression by this specialist. Only 11% of the patients with depression presented with a psychological chief complaint; an additional 30% reported an associated psychological symptom. All other patients had physical symptoms or presented for preventive care. Approximately 60% of patients with a depression diagnosis were not diagnosed by the ob-gyn. Depression severity was similar in women with and without an ob-gyn diagnosis of depression. Bivariate analyses identified 4 factors that were significantly associated with depression diagnosis: a psychological complaint either as a chief complaint or associated symptom (72% compared with 18.6%; P < 0.001), younger age (35.5 years compared with 40.8 years; P < 0.005), being within 12 months postpartum (13.9% compared with 2.8%; P < 0.005), and receiving primary rather than specialty care (72% compared with 30%; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed the following variables to be significantly associated with a depression diagnosis: a psychological symptom either as the chief complaint or as an associated symptom (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.15–19.10; P < 0.001), receiving primary rather specialty care (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.14–5.29; P = 0.03), and each year of increasing age (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.96; P = 0.02).

We report on the initial 69 patients with gynecologic cancers that were either rare or refractory to standard therapy. CGP was performed by Foundation Medicine, Inc. Genomic alterations were reviewed by members of an MTB. Consensus recommendations on genomically targeted, FDA-approved, on- and off-label therapies and clinical trials were sent to the treating physician, and decisions and outcomes were assessed.ResultsStudy outcomes were available for 64 patients. The mean number of genes altered per tumor was 4.97 (median = 4; range, 1–26), and the average turnaround time from testing laboratory report to generation of formal recommendations was approximately three weeks. Evaluation of genomic and clinical data by the MTB led to generation of targeted treatment options in all 64 patients, and the percentage of patients for whom one or more of these recommendations were implemented by the treating physician was 39%. Sixty-four percent of the patients receiving targeted therapy based on a CGP result experienced radiologic response or showed evidence of clinical benefit or stable disease.ConclusionThese data suggest that an institutional MTB is a feasible venue for reviewing tumor genomic profiling results and generating clinical recommendations.

Due to the diverse nature of these, the description of \"new\" morphological types and the rarity of some of them, pathological diagnosis and treatment is often challenging. Finding genetic alterations specific to, and frequently occurring, in a certain type can aid in the diagnosis. DICER1 is a highly conserved ribonuclease crucial in the biogenesis of microRNAs and mutations in DICER1 (either somatic or germline) have been detected in a wide range of sarcomas including genitourinary embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS) and adenosarcomas. Importantly, DICER1-associated sarcomas share morphological features irrespective of the site of origin such that the pathologist can strongly suspect a DICER1 association. A review of the literature shows that almost all gynecologic ERMS reported (outside of the vagina) harbor DICER1 alterations, while approximately 20% of adenosarcomas also do so. These two tumor types exhibit significant morphological overlap and DICER1 tumor testing may be helpful in distinguishing between them, because a negative result makes ERMS unlikely. Given that germline pathogenic DICER1 variants are frequent in uterine (corpus and cervix) ERMS and pathogenic germline variants in this gene cause a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome (DICER1 syndrome), patients diagnosed with these neoplasms should be referred to medical genetic services.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4320180242", "title": "A Comprehensive Review of the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Obstetrics and Gynecology", "text": "The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has fascinated its application in various fields and so in the field of healthcare. Technological advancements in theories and learning algorithms and the availability of processing through huge datasets have created a breakthrough in the medical field with computing systems. AI can potentially drive clinicians and practitioners with appropriate decisions in managing cases and reaching a diagnosis, so its application is extensively spread in the medical field. Thus, computerized algorithms have made predictions so simple and accurate. This is because AI can proffer information accurately even to many patients. Furthermore, the subsets of AI, namely, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, have aided in detecting complex patterns from huge datasets and using such patterns in making predictions. Despite numerous challenges, AI implementation in obstetrics and gynecology is found to have a spellbound development. Therefore, this review propounds exploring the implementation of AI in obstetrics and gynecology to improve the outcomes and clinical experience. In that context, the evolution and progress of AI, the role of AI in ultrasound diagnosis in distinct phases of pregnancy, clinical benefits, preterm birth postpartum period, and applications of AI in gynecology are elucidated in this review with future recommendations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.34891", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4320180242", "source": "openalex"}

Records were reviewed for 44 female (14 with primary disease and 30 with recurrence) with gynecological malignancies treated with HDR-ISBT with or without external beam radiation therapy. The HDR-ISBT applicator insertion was performed with image guidance by trans-rectal ultrasound and CT. The median clinical target volume was 35.5 ml (2.4-142.1 ml) and the median delivered dose in equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) for target volume D90 was 67.7 Gy (48.8-94.2 Gy, doses of external-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy were combined). For re-irradiation patients, median EQD2 of D2cc for rectum and bladder, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, D4cc, D6cc and D8cc for vaginal wall was 91.1 Gy, 100.9 Gy, 260.3 Gy, 212.3 Gy, 170.1 Gy, 117.1 Gy, 105.2 Gy, and 94.7 Gy, respectively. For those without prior radiation therapy, median EQD2 of D2cc for rectum and bladder, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, D4cc, D6cc and D8cc for vaginal wall was 56.3 Gy, 54.3 Gy, 147.4 Gy, 126.2 Gy, 108.0 Gy, 103.5 Gy, 94.7 Gy, and 80.7 Gy, respectively. Among five patients with vaginal ulcer, three had prior pelvic radiation therapy in their initial treatment and three consequently suffered from fistula formation. On univariate analysis, re-irradiation and vaginal wall D2cc in EQD2 was the clinical predictors of vaginal ulcer (p = 0.035 and p = 0.025, respectively). The ROC analysis revealed that vaginal wall D2cc is the best predictor of vaginal ulcer. The 2-year incidence rates of vaginal ulcer in the patients with vaginal wall D2cc in EQD2 equal to or less than 145 Gy and over 145 Gy were 3.7% and 23.5%, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.026). Re-irradiation and vaginal D2cc is a significant predictor of vaginal ulcer after HDR-ISBT for gynecologic malignancies. Three-dimensional image-guided treatment planning should be performed to ensure adequate target coverage while minimizing vaginal D2cc in order to avoid vagina ulcer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-717x-9-31", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110976374", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2156815100", "title": "Increased Risk of Second Primary Malignancies in Patients with Gynecological Cancer: A Swedish record-linkage study", "text": "The Stockholm-Gotland Cancer Register was used to study the risk of developing second primary malignancies (SPM) in women diagnosed with cancer of the uterine cervix, uterine corpus and ovaries during the period 1958-1992. Among 5,325 patients with uterine cervix cancer, 619 developed SPM. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.39). Significantly increased risks were observed for cancer of the colon, rectum, lung, vulva, kidney and bladder. A total of 4,815 women with uterine corpus cancer were followed and 660 SPM were found. The overall SIR was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12-1.30) with significantly increased risk for cancer of the colon, ovary, vulva and bladder. The incidence of leukemia was also significantly elevated (SIR = 3.03; 95% CI 1.70-5.00). Among 5,060 patients with ovarian cancer, 379 SPM were found (SIR 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.64). Increased risks of cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, uterine corpus, bladder and leukemia were observed. All three primary sites showed elevated risks of cancer of the colon and bladder. For patients with a primary cancer of the corpus and ovary an elevated risk of leukemia was also noted. The conclusion from these findings is that SPM to some extent can be explained by previously known factors, i.e. treatment and common risk factors. However, further studies concerning the role of common etiology, for instance hereditary and hormonal factors, are needed to increase the knowledge on the etiology of second primary malignancies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/02841869509127185", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156815100", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1986461907", "title": "Intraoperative Radiation Therapy in the Management of Gynecologic Malignancies", "text": "The aim of this study was to review the experience with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in the treatment of gynecologic cancers at the Massachusetts General Hospital.From January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2011, 32 patients were treated with IORT at Massachusetts General Hospital. Hospital, pathology, and office medical records and radiation oncology records were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) data.In 27 patients (84.4), surgical resection margins were microscopically positive. In 5 patients (15.6%), margins were grossly positive. For patients with microscopic disease, 5-year disease-free survival was 40.9% (57 mo), compared with 9.1% (23 mo) for those with gross residual disease (P=0.001). Five-year OS was also statistically improved for patients with microscopic residual disease, when compared with OS among patients with gross residual disease, 77.3% (93 mo) and 54.5% (40 mo), respectively (P=0.001). The risk of distant metastases in patients with gross residual disease was 87%, compared with 28% in patients with microscopic disease (P=0.02).Volume of residual disease before IORT is an important prognostic indicator. Local recurrence and distant metastases were more common among patients with gross residual disease left in situ at time of IORT. Our institutional experience with IORT further supports the importance of complete surgical resection.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/coc.0000000000000063", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986461907", "source": "openalex"}
